<p><b>Authors:</b> Samy Jad (LGP), Xavier Desforges (LGP), Pierre-Yves Villard (LGP), Christian Caussid\'ery (LGP), Kamal Medjaher (LGP)</p>
<p>Abstract: The French company EDF uses supervisory control and data acquisition systems in conjunction with a data management platform to monitor hydropower plant, allowing engineers and technicians to analyse the time-series collected. Depending on the strategic importance of the monitored hydropower plant, the number of time-series collected can vary greatly making it difficult to generate valuable information from the extracted data. In an attempt to provide an answer to this particular problem, a condition detection and diagnosis method combining clustering algorithms and autoencoder neural networks for pattern recognition has been developed and is presented in this paper. First, a dimension reduction algorithm is used to create a 2-or 3-dimensional projection that allows the users to identify unsuspected relationships between datapoints. Then, a collection of clustering algorithms regroups the datapoints into clusters. For each identified cluster, an autoencoder neural network is trained on the corresponding dataset. The aim is to measure the reconstruction error between each autoencoder model and the measured values, thus creating a proximity index for each state discovered during the clustering stage.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ying-Jung Chen, Chi-Sheng Chen, Ahmad Albarqawi</p>
<p>Abstract: In the age of data-driven medicine, it is paramount to include explainable and ethically managed artificial intelligence in explaining clinical decision support systems to achieve trustworthy and effective patient care. The focus of this paper is on a new architecture of a multi-agent system for clinical decision support that uses modular agents to analyze laboratory results, vital signs, and the clinical context and then integrates these results to drive predictions and validate outcomes. We describe our implementation with the eICU database to run lab-analysis-specific agents, vitals-only interpreters, and contextual reasoners and then run the prediction module and a validation agent. Everything is a transparent implementation of business logic, influenced by the principles of ethical AI governance such as Autonomy, Fairness, and Accountability. It provides visible results that this agent-based framework not only improves on interpretability and accuracy but also on reinforcing trust in AI-assisted decisions in an intensive care setting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lihui Liu, Zihao Wang, Dawei Zhou, Ruijie Wang, Yuchen Yan, Bo Xiong, Sihong He, Kai Shu, Hanghang Tong</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are ubiquitous and widely used in various applications. However, most real-world knowledge graphs are incomplete, which significantly degrades their performance on downstream tasks. Additionally, the relationships in real-world knowledge graphs often follow a long-tail distribution, meaning that most relations are represented by only a few training triplets. To address these challenges, few-shot learning has been introduced. Few-shot KG completion aims to make accurate predictions for triplets involving novel relations when only a limited number of training triplets are available. Although many methods have been proposed, they typically learn each relation individually, overlooking the correlations between different tasks and the relevant information in previously trained tasks. In this paper, we propose a transfer learning-based few-shot KG completion method (TransNet). By learning the relationships between different tasks, TransNet effectively transfers knowledge from similar tasks to improve the current task's performance. Furthermore, by employing meta-learning, TransNet can generalize effectively to new, unseen relations. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of TransNet over state-of-the-art methods. Code can be found at https://github.com/lihuiliullh/TransNet/tree/main</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03729">A Scalable Predictive Modelling Approach to Identifying Duplicate Adverse Event Reports for Drugs and Vaccines</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jim W. Barrett, Nils Erlanson, Joana F\'elix China, G. Niklas Nor\'en</p>
<p>Abstract: The practice of pharmacovigilance relies on large databases of individual case safety reports to detect and evaluate potential new causal associations between medicines or vaccines and adverse events. Duplicate reports are separate and unlinked reports referring to the same case of an adverse event involving a specific patient at a certain time. They impede statistical analysis and mislead clinical assessment. The large size of such databases precludes a manual identification of duplicates, and so a computational method must be employed. This paper builds upon a hitherto state of the art model, vigiMatch, modifying existing features and introducing new ones to target known shortcomings of the original model. Two support vector machine classifiers, one for medicines and one for vaccines, classify report pairs as duplicates and non-duplicates. Recall was measured using a diverse collection of 5 independent labelled test sets. Precision was measured by having each model classify a randomly selected stream of pairs of reports until each model classified 100 pairs as duplicates. These pairs were assessed by a medical doctor without indicating which method(s) had flagged each pair. Performance on individual countries was measured by having a medical doctor assess a subset of pairs classified as duplicates for three different countries. The new model achieved higher precision and higher recall for all labelled datasets compared to the previous state of the art model, with comparable performance for medicines and vaccines. The model was shown to produce substantially fewer false positives than the comparator model on pairs from individual countries. The method presented here advances state of the art for duplicate detection in adverse event reports for medicines and vaccines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhimanyu Pallavi Sudhir, Jackson Kaunismaa, Arjun Panickssery</p>
<p>Abstract: As AI agents surpass human capabilities, scalable oversight -- the problem of effectively supplying human feedback to potentially superhuman AI models -- becomes increasingly critical to ensure alignment. While numerous scalable oversight protocols have been proposed, they lack a systematic empirical framework to evaluate and compare them. While recent works have tried to empirically study scalable oversight protocols -- particularly Debate -- we argue that the experiments they conduct are not generalizable to other protocols. We introduce the scalable oversight benchmark, a principled framework for evaluating human feedback mechanisms based on our agent score difference (ASD) metric, a measure of how effectively a mechanism advantages truth-telling over deception. We supply a Python package to facilitate rapid and competitive evaluation of scalable oversight protocols on our benchmark, and conduct a demonstrative experiment benchmarking Debate.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Helena Zhang, Jakobi Haskell, Yosef Frost</p>
<p>Abstract: Compound AI systems, orchestrating multiple AI components and external APIs, are increasingly vital but face challenges in managing complexity, handling ambiguity, and enabling effective development workflows. Existing frameworks often introduce significant overhead, implicit complexity, or restrictive abstractions, hindering maintainability and iterative refinement, especially in Human-AI collaborative settings. We argue that overcoming these hurdles requires a foundational architecture prioritizing structural clarity and explicit control. To this end, we introduce Pocketflow, a platform centered on Human-AI co-design, enabled by Pocketflow. Pocketflow is a Python framework built upon a deliberately minimal yet synergistic set of core abstractions: modular Nodes with a strict lifecycle, declarative Flow orchestration, native hierarchical nesting (Flow-as-Node), and explicit action-based conditional logic. This unique combination provides a robust, vendor-agnostic foundation with very little code that demonstrably reduces overhead while offering the expressiveness needed for complex patterns like agentic workflows and RAG. Complemented by Pocket AI, an assistant leveraging this structure for system design, Pocketflow provides an effective environment for iteratively prototyping, refining, and deploying the adaptable, scalable AI systems demanded by modern enterprises.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu-Zhe Shi, Mingchen Liu, Fanxu Meng, Qiao Xu, Zhangqian Bi, Kun He, Lecheng Ruan, Qining Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-driving laboratories have begun to replace human experimenters in performing single experimental skills or predetermined experimental protocols. However, as the pace of idea iteration in scientific research has been intensified by Artificial Intelligence, the demand for rapid design of new protocols for new discoveries become evident. Efforts to automate protocol design have been initiated, but the capabilities of knowledge-based machine designers, such as Large Language Models, have not been fully elicited, probably for the absence of a systematic representation of experimental knowledge, as opposed to isolated, flatten pieces of information. To tackle this issue, we propose a multi-faceted, multi-scale representation, where instance actions, generalized operations, and product flow models are hierarchically encapsulated using Domain-Specific Languages. We further develop a data-driven algorithm based on non-parametric modeling that autonomously customizes these representations for specific domains. The proposed representation is equipped with various machine designers to manage protocol design tasks, including planning, modification, and adjustment. The results demonstrate that the proposed method could effectively complement Large Language Models in the protocol design process, serving as an auxiliary module in the realm of machine-assisted scientific exploration.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03861">Improving World Models using Deep Supervision with Linear Probes</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrii Zahorodnii</p>
<p>Abstract: Developing effective world models is crucial for creating artificial agents that can reason about and navigate complex environments. In this paper, we investigate a deep supervision technique for encouraging the development of a world model in a network trained end-to-end to predict the next observation. While deep supervision has been widely applied for task-specific learning, our focus is on improving the world models. Using an experimental environment based on the Flappy Bird game, where the agent receives only LIDAR measurements as observations, we explore the effect of adding a linear probe component to the network's loss function. This additional term encourages the network to encode a subset of the true underlying world features into its hidden state. Our experiments demonstrate that this supervision technique improves both training and test performance, enhances training stability, and results in more easily decodable world features -- even for those world features which were not included in the training. Furthermore, we observe a reduced distribution drift in networks trained with the linear probe, particularly during high-variability phases of the game (flying between successive pipe encounters). Including the world features loss component roughly corresponded to doubling the model size, suggesting that the linear probe technique is particularly beneficial in compute-limited settings or when aiming to achieve the best performance with smaller models. These findings contribute to our understanding of how to develop more robust and sophisticated world models in artificial agents, paving the way for further advancements in this field.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03930">Have Large Language Models Learned to Reason? A Characterization via 3-SAT Phase Transition</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Rishi Hazra, Gabriele Venturato, Pedro Zuidberg Dos Martires, Luc De Raedt</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been touted as AI models possessing advanced reasoning abilities. In theory, autoregressive LLMs with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) can perform more serial computations to solve complex reasoning tasks. However, recent studies suggest that, despite this capacity, LLMs do not truly learn to reason but instead fit on statistical features. To study the reasoning capabilities in a principled fashion, we adopt a computational theory perspective and propose an experimental protocol centered on 3-SAT -- the prototypical NP-complete problem lying at the core of logical reasoning and constraint satisfaction tasks. Specifically, we examine the phase transitions in random 3-SAT and characterize the reasoning abilities of state-of-the-art LLMs by varying the inherent hardness of the problem instances. By comparing DeepSeek R1 with other LLMs, our findings reveal two key insights (1) LLM accuracy drops significantly on harder instances, suggesting all current models struggle when statistical shortcuts are unavailable (2) Unlike other LLMs, R1 shows signs of having learned the underlying reasoning. Following a principled experimental protocol, our study moves beyond the benchmark-driven evidence often found in LLM reasoning research. Our findings highlight important gaps and suggest clear directions for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mario Rico Ibanez, Azim Akhtarshenas, David Lopez-Perez, Giovanni Geraci</p>
<p>Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based base stations offer a promising solution in emergencies where the rapid deployment of cutting-edge networks is crucial for maximizing life-saving potential. Optimizing the strategic positioning of these UAVs is essential for enhancing communication efficiency. This paper introduces an automated reinforcement learning approach that enables UAVs to dynamically interact with their environment and determine optimal configurations. By leveraging the radio signal sensing capabilities of communication networks, our method provides a more realistic perspective, utilizing state-of-the-art algorithm -- proximal policy optimization -- to learn and generalize positioning strategies across diverse user equipment (UE) movement patterns. We evaluate our approach across various UE mobility scenarios, including static, random, linear, circular, and mixed hotspot movements. The numerical results demonstrate the algorithm's adaptability and effectiveness in maintaining comprehensive coverage across all movement patterns.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maithili Patel, Xavier Puig, Ruta Desai, Roozbeh Mottaghi, Sonia Chernova, Joanne Truong, Akshara Rai</p>
<p>Abstract: Assistive agents should be able to perform under-specified long-horizon tasks while respecting user preferences. We introduce Actively Discovering and Adapting to Preferences for any Task (ADAPT) -- a benchmark designed to evaluate agents' ability to adhere to user preferences across various household tasks through active questioning. Next, we propose Reflection-DPO, a novel training approach for adapting large language models (LLMs) to the task of active questioning. Reflection-DPO finetunes a 'student' LLM to follow the actions of a privileged 'teacher' LLM, and optionally ask a question to gather necessary information to better predict the teacher action. We find that prior approaches that use state-of-the-art LLMs fail to sufficiently follow user preferences in ADAPT due to insufficient questioning and poor adherence to elicited preferences. In contrast, Reflection-DPO achieves a higher rate of satisfying user preferences, outperforming a zero-shot chain-of-thought baseline by 6.1% on unseen users.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Satvik Golechha, Adri\`a Garriga-Alonso</p>
<p>Abstract: Studying deception in AI agents is important and difficult due to the lack of model organisms and sandboxes that elicit the behavior without asking the model to act under specific conditions or inserting intentional backdoors. Extending upon $\textit{AmongAgents}$, a text-based social-deduction game environment, we aim to fix this by introducing Among Us as a rich sandbox where LLM-agents exhibit human-style deception naturally while they think, speak, and act with other agents or humans. We introduce Deception ELO as an unbounded measure of deceptive capability, suggesting that frontier models win more because they're better at deception, not at detecting it. We evaluate the effectiveness of AI safety techniques (LLM-monitoring of outputs, linear probes on various datasets, and sparse autoencoders) for detecting lying and deception in Among Us, and find that they generalize very well out-of-distribution. We open-source our sandbox as a benchmark for future alignment research and hope that this is a good testbed to improve safety techniques to detect and remove agentically-motivated deception, and to anticipate deceptive abilities in LLMs.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04086">Towards An Efficient and Effective En Route Travel Time Estimation Framework</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zekai Shen, Haitao Yuan, Xiaowei Mao, Congkang Lv, Shengnan Guo, Youfang Lin, Huaiyu Wan</p>
<p>Abstract: En route travel time estimation (ER-TTE) focuses on predicting the travel time of the remaining route. Existing ER-TTE methods always make re-estimation which significantly hinders real-time performance, especially when faced with the computational demands of simultaneous user requests. This results in delays and reduced responsiveness in ER-TTE services. We propose a general efficient framework U-ERTTE combining an Uncertainty-Guided Decision mechanism (UGD) and Fine-Tuning with Meta-Learning (FTML) to address these challenges. UGD quantifies the uncertainty and provides confidence intervals for the entire route. It selectively re-estimates only when the actual travel time deviates from the predicted confidence intervals, thereby optimizing the efficiency of ER-TTE. To ensure the accuracy of confidence intervals and accurate predictions that need to re-estimate, FTML is employed to train the model, enabling it to learn general driving patterns and specific features to adapt to specific tasks. Extensive experiments on two large-scale real datasets demonstrate that the U-ERTTE framework significantly enhances inference speed and throughput while maintaining high effectiveness.

<p>Abstract: Lifting exploits symmetries in probabilistic graphical models by using a representative for indistinguishable objects, allowing to carry out query answering more efficiently while maintaining exact answers. In this paper, we investigate how lifting enables us to perform probabilistic inference for factor graphs containing unknown factors, i.e., factors whose underlying function of potential mappings is unknown. We present the Lifting Factor Graphs with Some Unknown Factors (LIFAGU) algorithm to identify indistinguishable subgraphs in a factor graph containing unknown factors, thereby enabling the transfer of known potentials to unknown potentials to ensure a well-defined semantics of the model and allow for (lifted) probabilistic inference. We further extend LIFAGU to incorporate additional background knowledge about groups of factors belonging to the same individual object. By incorporating such background knowledge, LIFAGU is able to further reduce the ambiguity of possible transfers of known potentials to unknown potentials.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Quan, Marco Valentino, Danilo S. Carvalho, Dhairya Dalal, Andr\'e Freitas</p>
<p>Abstract: A persistent challenge in AI is the effective integration of material and formal inference - the former concerning the plausibility and contextual relevance of arguments, while the latter focusing on their logical and structural validity. Large Language Models (LLMs), by virtue of their extensive pre-training on large textual corpora, exhibit strong capabilities in material inference. However, their reasoning often lacks formal rigour and verifiability. At the same time, LLMs' linguistic competence positions them as a promising bridge between natural and formal languages, opening up new opportunities for combining these two modes of reasoning. In this paper, we introduce PEIRCE, a neuro-symbolic framework designed to unify material and formal inference through an iterative conjecture-criticism process. Within this framework, LLMs play the central role of generating candidate solutions in natural and formal languages, which are then evaluated and refined via interaction with external critique models. These critiques include symbolic provers, which assess formal validity, as well as soft evaluators that measure the quality of the generated arguments along linguistic and epistemic dimensions such as plausibility, coherence, and parsimony. While PEIRCE is a general-purpose framework, we demonstrate its capabilities in the domain of natural language explanation generation - a setting that inherently demands both material adequacy and formal correctness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lixiang Xu, Xianwei Ding, Xin Yuan, Zhanlong Wang, Lu Bai, Enhong Chen, Philip S. Yu, Yuanyan Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: The Knowledge Tracing (KT) aims to track changes in students' knowledge status and predict their future answers based on their historical answer records. Current research on KT modeling focuses on predicting student' future performance based on existing, unupdated records of student learning interactions. However, these approaches ignore the distractors (such as slipping and guessing) in the answering process and overlook that static cognitive representations are temporary and limited. Most of them assume that there are no distractors in the answering process and that the record representations fully represent the students' level of understanding and proficiency in knowledge. In this case, it may lead to many insynergy and incoordination issue in the original records. Therefore we propose a Cognitive Representation Optimization for Knowledge Tracing (CRO-KT) model, which utilizes a dynamic programming algorithm to optimize structure of cognitive representations. This ensures that the structure matches the students' cognitive patterns in terms of the difficulty of the exercises. Furthermore, we use the co-optimization algorithm to optimize the cognitive representations of the sub-target exercises in terms of the overall situation of exercises responses by considering all the exercises with co-relationships as a single goal. Meanwhile, the CRO-KT model fuses the learned relational embeddings from the bipartite graph with the optimized record representations in a weighted manner, enhancing the expression of students' cognition. Finally, experiments are conducted on three publicly available datasets respectively to validate the effectiveness of the proposed cognitive representation optimization model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chaoxiong Ma, Yan Liang, Huixia Zhang, Hao Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: It is explored that available credible evidence fusion schemes suffer from the potential inconsistency because credibility calculation and Dempster's combination rule-based fusion are sequentially performed in an open-loop style. This paper constructs evidence credibility from the perspective of the degree of support for events within the framework of discrimination (FOD) and proposes an iterative credible evidence fusion (ICEF) to overcome the inconsistency in view of close-loop control. On one hand, the ICEF introduces the fusion result into credibility assessment to establish the correlation between credibility and the fusion result. On the other hand, arithmetic-geometric divergence is promoted based on the exponential normalization of plausibility and belief functions to measure evidence conflict, called plausibility-belief arithmetic-geometric divergence (PBAGD), which is superior in capturing the correlation and difference of FOD subsets, identifying abnormal sources, and reducing their fusion weights. The ICEF is compared with traditional methods by combining different evidence difference measure forms via numerical examples to verify its performance. Simulations on numerical examples and benchmark datasets reflect the adaptability of PBAGD to the proposed fusion strategy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eduardo Salazar</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents COGENT3 (or Collective Growth and Entropy-modulated Triads System), a novel approach for emergent cognition integrating pattern formation networks with group influence dynamics. Contrasting with traditional strategies that rely on predetermined architectures, computational structures emerge dynamically in our framework through agent interactions. This enables a more flexible and adaptive system exhibiting characteristics reminiscent of human cognitive processes. The incorporation of temperature modulation and memory effects in COGENT3 closely integrates statistical mechanics, machine learning, and cognitive science.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianhua Sun, Cewu Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Reviewing the progress in artificial intelligence over the past decade, various significant advances (e.g. object detection, image generation, large language models) have enabled AI systems to produce more semantically meaningful outputs and achieve widespread adoption in internet scenarios. Nevertheless, AI systems still struggle when it comes to understanding and interacting with the physical world. This reveals an important issue: relying solely on semantic-level concepts learned from internet data (e.g. texts, images) to understand the physical world is far from sufficient -- machine intelligence currently lacks an effective way to learn about the physical world. This research introduces the idea of analytic concept -- representing the concepts related to the physical world through programs of mathematical procedures, providing machine intelligence a portal to perceive, reason about, and interact with the physical world. Except for detailing the design philosophy and providing guidelines for the application of analytic concepts, this research also introduce about the infrastructure that has been built around analytic concepts. I aim for my research to contribute to addressing these questions: What is a proper abstraction of general concepts in the physical world for machine intelligence? How to systematically integrate structured priors with neural networks to constrain AI systems to comply with physical laws?</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md. Ehsanul Haque, S. M. Jahidul Islam, Jeba Maliha, Md. Shakhauat Hossan Sumon, Rumana Sharmin, Sakib Rokoni</p>
<p>Abstract: Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a major global health issue which is affecting million people around the world and with increasing rate of mortality. Mitigation of progression of CKD and better patient outcomes requires early detection. Nevertheless, limitations lie in traditional diagnostic methods, especially in resource constrained settings. This study proposes an advanced machine learning approach to enhance CKD detection by evaluating four models: Random Forest (RF), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Logistic Regression (LR), and a fine-tuned CatBoost algorithm. Specifically, among these, the fine-tuned CatBoost model demonstrated the best overall performance having an accuracy of 98.75%, an AUC of 0.9993 and a Kappa score of 97.35% of the studies. The proposed CatBoost model has used a nature inspired algorithm such as Simulated Annealing to select the most important features, Cuckoo Search to adjust outliers and grid search to fine tune its settings in such a way to achieve improved prediction accuracy. Features significance is explained by SHAP-a well-known XAI technique-for gaining transparency in the decision-making process of proposed model and bring up trust in diagnostic systems. Using SHAP, the significant clinical features were identified as specific gravity, serum creatinine, albumin, hemoglobin, and diabetes mellitus. The potential of advanced machine learning techniques in CKD detection is shown in this research, particularly for low income and middle-income healthcare settings where prompt and correct diagnoses are vital. This study seeks to provide a highly accurate, interpretable, and efficient diagnostic tool to add to efforts for early intervention and improved healthcare outcomes for all CKD patients.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04276">A Comparative Study of Explainable AI Methods: Model-Agnostic vs. Model-Specific Approaches</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Keerthi Devireddy</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper compares model-agnostic and model-specific approaches to explainable AI (XAI) in deep learning image classification. I examine how LIME and SHAP (model-agnostic methods) differ from Grad-CAM and Guided Backpropagation (model-specific methods) when interpreting ResNet50 predictions across diverse image categories. Through extensive testing with various species from dogs and birds to insects I found that each method reveals different aspects of the models decision-making process. Model-agnostic techniques provide broader feature attribution that works across different architectures, while model-specific approaches excel at highlighting precise activation regions with greater computational efficiency. My analysis shows there is no "one-size-fits-all" solution for model interpretability. Instead, combining multiple XAI methods offers the most comprehensive understanding of complex models particularly valuable in high-stakes domains like healthcare, autonomous vehicles, and financial services where transparency is crucial. This comparative framework provides practical guidance for selecting appropriate interpretability techniques based on specific application needs and computational constraints.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhijie Duan, Kai Wei, Zhaoqian Xue, Lingyao li, Jin Jin, Shu Yang, Jiayan Zhou, Siyuan Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Social media is a rich source of real-world data that captures valuable patient experience information for pharmacovigilance. However, mining data from unstructured and noisy social media content remains a challenging task. We present a systematic framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to extract medication side effects from social media and organize them into a knowledge graph (KG). We apply this framework to semaglutide for weight loss using data from Reddit. Using the constructed knowledge graph, we perform comprehensive analyses to investigate reported side effects across different semaglutide brands over time. These findings are further validated through comparison with adverse events reported in the FAERS database, providing important patient-centered insights into semaglutide's side effects that complement its safety profile and current knowledge base of semaglutide for both healthcare professionals and patients. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of using LLMs to transform social media data into structured KGs for pharmacovigilance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sergey Pastukhov</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) framework that performs top-down recursive planning via learned subgoals, successfully applied to the complex combinatorial puzzle game Sokoban. Our approach constructs a six-level policy hierarchy, where each higher-level policy generates subgoals for the level below. All subgoals and policies are learned end-to-end from scratch, without any domain knowledge. Our results show that the agent can generate long action sequences from a single high-level call. While prior work has explored 2-3 level hierarchies and subgoal-based planning heuristics, we demonstrate that deep recursive goal decomposition can emerge purely from learning, and that such hierarchies can scale effectively to hard puzzle domains.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large reasoning models exhibit remarkable reasoning capabilities via long, elaborate reasoning trajectories. Supervised fine-tuning on such reasoning traces, also known as distillation, can be a cost-effective way to boost reasoning capabilities of student models. However, empirical observations reveal that these reasoning trajectories are often suboptimal, switching excessively between different lines of thought, resulting in under-thinking, over-thinking, and even degenerate responses. We introduce Retro-Search, an MCTS-inspired search algorithm, for distilling higher quality reasoning paths from large reasoning models. Retro-Search retrospectively revises reasoning paths to discover better, yet shorter traces, which can then lead to student models with enhanced reasoning capabilities with shorter, thus faster inference. Our approach can enable two use cases: self-improvement, where models are fine-tuned on their own Retro-Search-ed thought traces, and weak-to-strong improvement, where a weaker model revises stronger model's thought traces via Retro-Search. For self-improving, R1-distill-7B, fine-tuned on its own Retro-Search-ed traces, reduces the average reasoning length by 31.2% while improving performance by 7.7% across seven math benchmarks. For weak-to-strong improvement, we retrospectively revise R1-671B's traces from the OpenThoughts dataset using R1-distill-32B as the Retro-Search-er, a model 20x smaller. Qwen2.5-32B, fine-tuned on this refined data, achieves performance comparable to R1-distill-32B, yielding an 11.3% reduction in reasoning length and a 2.4% performance improvement compared to fine-tuning on the original OpenThoughts data. Our work counters recently emergent viewpoints that question the relevance of search algorithms in the era of large reasoning models, by demonstrating that there are still opportunities for algorithmic advancements, even for frontier models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matej \v{S}progar</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in machine learning, current AI systems continue to fall short of true human-like intelligence. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in pattern recognition and response generation, they lack genuine understanding - an essential hallmark of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Existing AGI evaluation methods fail to offer a practical, gradual, and informative metric. This paper introduces the Artificial General Intelligence Test Bed (AGITB), comprising twelve rigorous tests that form a signal-processing-level foundation for the potential emergence of cognitive capabilities. AGITB evaluates intelligence through a model's ability to predict binary signals across time without relying on symbolic representations or pretraining. Unlike high-level tests grounded in language or perception, AGITB focuses on core computational invariants reflective of biological intelligence, such as determinism, sensitivity, and generalisation. The test bed assumes no prior bias, operates independently of semantic meaning, and ensures unsolvability through brute force or memorization. While humans pass AGITB by design, no current AI system has met its criteria, making AGITB a compelling benchmark for guiding and recognizing progress toward AGI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cristina Cornelio, Flavio Petruzzellis, Pietro Lio</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise as robotic planners but often struggle with long-horizon and complex tasks, especially in specialized environments requiring external knowledge. While hierarchical planning and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) address some of these challenges, they remain insufficient on their own and a deeper integration is required for achieving more reliable systems. To this end, we propose a neuro-symbolic approach that enhances LLMs-based planners with Knowledge Graph-based RAG for hierarchical plan generation. This method decomposes complex tasks into manageable subtasks, further expanded into executable atomic action sequences. To ensure formal correctness and proper decomposition, we integrate a Symbolic Validator, which also functions as a failure detector by aligning expected and observed world states. Our evaluation against baseline methods demonstrates the consistent significant advantages of integrating hierarchical planning, symbolic verification, and RAG across tasks of varying complexity and different LLMs. Additionally, our experimental setup and novel metrics not only validate our approach for complex planning but also serve as a tool for assessing LLMs' reasoning and compositional capabilities.</p>

The theory allows a quantitative analysis of outstanding AI challenges such as output repetition, hallucination and harmful content, and bias (e.g. from training and fine-tuning). Its predictions are consistent with large-scale LLM outputs. Its 2-body form suggests why LLMs work so well, but hints that a generalized 3-body Attention would make such AI work even better. Its similarity to a spin-bath means that existing Physics expertise could immediately be harnessed to help Society ensure AI is trustworthy and resilient to manipulation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fernando Rosas, Alexander Boyd, Manuel Baltieri</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent work proposes using world models to generate controlled virtual environments in which AI agents can be tested before deployment to ensure their reliability and safety. However, accurate world models often have high computational demands that can severely restrict the scope and depth of such assessments. Inspired by the classic `brain in a vat' thought experiment, here we investigate ways of simplifying world models that remain agnostic to the AI agent under evaluation. By following principles from computational mechanics, our approach reveals a fundamental trade-off in world model construction between efficiency and interpretability, demonstrating that no single world model can optimise all desirable characteristics. Building on this trade-off, we identify procedures to build world models that either minimise memory requirements, delineate the boundaries of what is learnable, or allow tracking causes of undesirable outcomes. In doing so, this work establishes fundamental limits in world modelling, leading to actionable guidelines that inform core design choices related to effective agent evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tzu-Han Hsu, Arshia Rafieioskouei, Borzoo Bonakdarpour</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the problem of learning control policies for complex tasks whose requirements are given by a hyperproperty. The use of hyperproperties is motivated by their significant power to formally specify requirements of multi-agent systems as well as those that need expressiveness in terms of multiple execution traces (e.g., privacy and fairness). Given a Markov decision process M with unknown transitions (representing the environment) and a HyperLTL formula $\varphi$, our approach first employs Skolemization to handle quantifier alternations in $\varphi$. We introduce quantitative robustness functions for HyperLTL to define rewards of finite traces of M with respect to $\varphi$. Finally, we utilize a suitable reinforcement learning algorithm to learn (1) a policy per trace quantifier in $\varphi$, and (2) the probability distribution of transitions of M that together maximize the expected reward and, hence, probability of satisfaction of $\varphi$ in M. We present a set of case studies on (1) safety-preserving multi-agent path planning, (2) fairness in resource allocation, and (3) the post-correspondence problem (PCP).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alfath Daryl Alhajir, Jennifer Dodgson, Joseph Lim, Truong Ma Phi, Julian Peh, Akira Rafhael Janson Pattirane, Lokesh Poovaragan</p>
<p>Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) are constrained by human-derived training data and limited by a single level of abstraction that impedes definitive truth judgments. This paper introduces a novel framework in which AI models autonomously generate and validate new knowledge through direct interaction with their environment. Central to this approach is an unbounded, ungamable numeric reward - such as annexed disk space or follower count - that guides learning without requiring human benchmarks. AI agents iteratively generate strategies and executable code to maximize this metric, with successful outcomes forming the basis for self-retraining and incremental generalisation. To mitigate model collapse and the warm start problem, the framework emphasizes empirical validation over textual similarity and supports fine-tuning via GRPO. The system architecture employs modular agents for environment analysis, strategy generation, and code synthesis, enabling scalable experimentation. This work outlines a pathway toward self-improving AI systems capable of advancing beyond human-imposed constraints toward autonomous general intelligence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anna Goldie, Azalia Mirhoseini, Hao Zhou, Irene Cai, Christopher D. Manning</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been shown to improve the performance of large language models. However, traditional approaches like RLHF or RLAIF treat the problem as single-step. As focus shifts toward more complex reasoning and agentic tasks, language models must take multiple steps of text generation, reasoning and environment interaction before generating a solution. We propose a synthetic data generation and RL methodology targeting multi-step optimization scenarios. This approach, called Step-Wise Reinforcement Learning (SWiRL), iteratively generates multi-step reasoning and tool use data, and then learns from that data. It employs a simple step-wise decomposition that breaks each multi-step trajectory into multiple sub-trajectories corresponding to each action by the original model. It then applies synthetic data filtering and RL optimization on these sub-trajectories. We evaluated SWiRL on a number of multi-step tool use, question answering, and mathematical reasoning tasks. Our experiments show that SWiRL outperforms baseline approaches by 21.5%, 12.3%, 14.8%, 11.1%, and 15.3% in relative accuracy on GSM8K, HotPotQA, CofCA, MuSiQue, and BeerQA, respectively. Excitingly, the approach exhibits generalization across tasks: for example, training only on HotPotQA (text question-answering) improves zero-shot performance on GSM8K (a math dataset) by a relative 16.9%.</p>

<p>Abstract: Efficiently leveraging of the capabilities of contemporary large language models (LLMs) is increasingly challenging, particularly when direct fine-tuning is expensive and often impractical. Existing training-free methods, including manually or automated designed workflows, typically demand substantial human effort or yield suboptimal results. This paper proposes Weak-for-Strong Harnessing (W4S), a novel framework that customizes smaller, cost-efficient language models to design and optimize workflows for harnessing stronger models. W4S formulates workflow design as a multi-turn markov decision process and introduces reinforcement learning for agentic workflow optimization (RLAO) to train a weak meta-agent. Through iterative interaction with the environment, the meta-agent learns to design increasingly effective workflows without manual intervention. Empirical results demonstrate the superiority of W4S that our 7B meta-agent, trained with just one GPU hour, outperforms the strongest baseline by 2.9% ~ 24.6% across eleven benchmarks, successfully elevating the performance of state-of-the-art models such as GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4o. Notably, W4S exhibits strong generalization capabilities across both seen and unseen tasks, offering an efficient, high-performing alternative to directly fine-tuning strong models.</p>

<p>Abstract: As a strategic pillar industry for human survival and development, modern agriculture faces dual challenges: optimizing production efficiency and achieving sustainable development. Against the backdrop of intensified climate change leading to frequent extreme weather events, the uncertainty risks in agricultural production systems are increasing exponentially. To address these challenges, this study proposes an innovative \textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{A}gricultural \textbf{A}gent \textbf{A}rchitecture (\textbf{MA3}), which leverages cross-modal information fusion and task collaboration mechanisms to achieve intelligent agricultural decision-making. This study constructs a multimodal agricultural agent dataset encompassing five major tasks: classification, detection, Visual Question Answering (VQA), tool selection, and agent evaluation. We propose a unified backbone for sugarcane disease classification and detection tools, as well as a sugarcane disease expert model. By integrating an innovative tool selection module, we develop a multimodal agricultural agent capable of effectively performing tasks in classification, detection, and VQA. Furthermore, we introduce a multi-dimensional quantitative evaluation framework and conduct a comprehensive assessment of the entire architecture over our evaluation dataset, thereby verifying the practicality and robustness of MA3 in agricultural scenarios. This study provides new insights and methodologies for the development of agricultural agents, holding significant theoretical and practical implications. Our source code and dataset will be made publicly available upon acceptance.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this article, we propose a centralized Multi-Agent Learning framework for learning a policy that models the simultaneous behavior of multiple agents that need to coordinate to solve a certain task. Centralized approaches often suffer from the explosion of an action space that is defined by all possible combinations of individual actions, known as joint actions. Our approach addresses the coordination problem via a sequential abstraction, which overcomes the scalability problems typical to centralized methods. It introduces a meta-agent, called \textit{supervisor}, which abstracts joint actions as sequential assignments of actions to each agent. This sequential abstraction not only simplifies the centralized joint action space but also enhances the framework's scalability and efficiency. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach successfully coordinates agents across a variety of Multi-Agent Learning environments of diverse sizes.</p>

<p>Abstract: Detecting biases in structured data is a complex and time-consuming task. Existing automated techniques are limited in diversity of data types and heavily reliant on human case-by-case handling, resulting in a lack of generalizability. Currently, large language model (LLM)-based agents have made significant progress in data science, but their ability to detect data biases is still insufficiently explored. To address this gap, we introduce the first end-to-end, multi-agent synergy framework, BIASINSPECTOR, designed for automatic bias detection in structured data based on specific user requirements. It first develops a multi-stage plan to analyze user-specified bias detection tasks and then implements it with a diverse and well-suited set of tools. It delivers detailed results that include explanations and visualizations. To address the lack of a standardized framework for evaluating the capability of LLM agents to detect biases in data, we further propose a comprehensive benchmark that includes multiple evaluation metrics and a large set of test cases. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves exceptional overall performance in structured data bias detection, setting a new milestone for fairer data applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Adversarial patch attacks pose a major threat to vision systems by embedding localized perturbations that mislead deep models. Traditional defense methods often require retraining or fine-tuning, making them impractical for real-world deployment. We propose a training-free Visual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (VRAG) framework that integrates Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for adversarial patch detection. By retrieving visually similar patches and images that resemble stored attacks in a continuously expanding database, VRAG performs generative reasoning to identify diverse attack types, all without additional training or fine-tuning. We extensively evaluate open-source large-scale VLMs, including Qwen-VL-Plus, Qwen2.5-VL-72B, and UI-TARS-72B-DPO, alongside Gemini-2.0, a closed-source model. Notably, the open-source UI-TARS-72B-DPO model achieves up to 95 percent classification accuracy, setting a new state-of-the-art for open-source adversarial patch detection. Gemini-2.0 attains the highest overall accuracy, 98 percent, but remains closed-source. Experimental results demonstrate VRAG's effectiveness in identifying a variety of adversarial patches with minimal human annotation, paving the way for robust, practical defenses against evolving adversarial patch attacks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate motion prediction of traffic agents is crucial for the safety and stability of autonomous driving systems. In this paper, we introduce GAMDTP, a novel graph attention-based network tailored for dynamic trajectory prediction. Specifically, we fuse the result of self attention and mamba-ssm through a gate mechanism, leveraging the strengths of both to extract features more efficiently and accurately, in each graph convolution layer. GAMDTP encodes the high-definition map(HD map) data and the agents' historical trajectory coordinates and decodes the network's output to generate the final prediction results. Additionally, recent approaches predominantly focus on dynamically fusing historical forecast results and rely on two-stage frameworks including proposal and refinement. To further enhance the performance of the two-stage frameworks we also design a scoring mechanism to evaluate the prediction quality during the proposal and refinement processes. Experiments on the Argoverse dataset demonstrates that GAMDTP achieves state-of-the-art performance, achieving superior accuracy in dynamic trajectory prediction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xue Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: As language models continue to grow larger, the cost of acquiring high-quality training data has increased significantly. Collecting human feedback is both expensive and time-consuming, and manual labels can be noisy, leading to an imbalance between helpfulness and harmfulness. Constitutional AI, introduced by Anthropic in December 2022, uses AI to provide feedback to another AI, greatly reducing the need for human labeling. However, the original implementation was designed for a model with around 52 billion parameters, and there is limited information on how well Constitutional AI performs with smaller models, such as LLaMA 3-8B. In this paper, we replicated the Constitutional AI workflow using the smaller LLaMA 3-8B model. Our results show that Constitutional AI can effectively increase the harmlessness of the model, reducing the Attack Success Rate in MT-Bench by 40.8%. However, similar to the original study, increasing harmlessness comes at the cost of helpfulness. The helpfulness metrics, which are an average of the Turn 1 and Turn 2 scores, dropped by 9.8% compared to the baseline. Additionally, we observed clear signs of model collapse in the final DPO-CAI model, indicating that smaller models may struggle with self-improvement due to insufficient output quality, making effective fine-tuning more challenging. Our study suggests that, like reasoning and math ability, self-improvement is an emergent property.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yousef Alhessi, S\'olr\'un Halla Einarsd\'ottir, George Granberry, Emily First, Moa Johansson, Sorin Lerner, Nicholas Smallbone</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatically conjecturing useful, interesting and novel lemmas would greatly improve automated reasoning tools and lower the bar for formalizing mathematics in proof assistants. It is however a very challenging task for both neural and symbolic approaches. We present the first steps towards a practical neuro-symbolic lemma conjecturing tool, Lemmanaid, that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) and symbolic methods, and evaluate it on proof libraries for the Isabelle proof assistant. We train an LLM to generate lemma templates that describe the shape of a lemma, and use symbolic methods to fill in the details. We compare Lemmanaid against an LLM trained to generate complete lemma statements as well as previous fully symbolic conjecturing methods. Our results indicate that neural and symbolic techniques are complementary. By leveraging the best of both symbolic and neural methods we can generate useful lemmas for a wide range of input domains, facilitating computer-assisted theory development and formalization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aditya Hemant Shahane, Prathosh A. P, Sandeep Kumar</p>
<p>Abstract: Graphs are growing rapidly, along with the number of distinct label categories associated with them. Applications like e-commerce, healthcare, recommendation systems, and various social media platforms are rapidly moving towards graph representation of data due to their ability to capture both structural and attribute information. One crucial task in graph analysis is node classification, where unlabeled nodes are categorized into predefined classes. In practice, novel classes appear incrementally sometimes with just a few labels (seen classes) or even without any labels (unseen classes), either because they are new or haven't been explored much. Traditional methods assume abundant labeled data for training, which isn't always feasible. We investigate a broader objective: \emph{Graph Class Incremental Learning under Weak Supervision (GCL)}, addressing this challenge by meta-training on base classes with limited labeled instances. During the incremental streams, novel classes can have few-shot or zero-shot representation. Our proposed framework GOTHAM efficiently accommodates these unlabeled nodes by finding the closest prototype representation, serving as class representatives in the attribute space. For Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs), our framework additionally incorporates semantic information to enhance the representation. By employing teacher-student knowledge distillation to mitigate forgetting, GOTHAM achieves promising results across various tasks. Experiments on datasets such as Cora-ML, Amazon, and OBGN-Arxiv showcase the effectiveness of our approach in handling evolving graph data under limited supervision.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiwei Cao, Minghao Li, Feng Lin, Qiang Fu, Jimin Jia, Yonggang Wen, Jianxiong Yin, Simon See</p>
<p>Abstract: Data centers (DCs) as mission-critical infrastructures are pivotal in powering the growth of artificial intelligence (AI) and the digital economy. The evolution from Internet DC to AI DC has introduced new challenges in operating and managing data centers for improved business resilience and reduced total cost of ownership. As a result, new paradigms, beyond the traditional approaches based on best practices, must be in order for future data centers. In this research, we propose and develop a novel Physical AI (PhyAI) framework for advancing DC operations and management. Our system leverages the emerging capabilities of state-of-the-art industrial products and our in-house research and development. Specifically, it presents three core modules, namely: 1) an industry-grade in-house simulation engine to simulate DC operations in a highly accurate manner, 2) an AI engine built upon NVIDIA PhysicsNemo for the training and evaluation of physics-informed machine learning (PIML) models, and 3) a digital twin platform built upon NVIDIA Omniverse for our proposed 5-tier digital twin framework. This system presents a scalable and adaptable solution to digitalize, optimize, and automate future data center operations and management, by enabling real-time digital twins for future data centers. To illustrate its effectiveness, we present a compelling case study on building a surrogate model for predicting the thermal and airflow profiles of a large-scale DC in a real-time manner. Our results demonstrate its superior performance over traditional time-consuming Computational Fluid Dynamics/Heat Transfer (CFD/HT) simulation, with a median absolute temperature prediction error of 0.18 {\deg}C. This emerging approach would open doors to several potential research directions for advancing Physical AI in future DC operations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sugyeong Eo, Hyeonseok Moon, Evelyn Hayoon Zi, Chanjun Park, Heuiseok Lim</p>
<p>Abstract: Multiagent collaboration has emerged as a promising framework for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). While this approach improves reasoning capability, it incurs substantial computational overhead due to iterative agent interactions. Furthermore, engaging in debates for queries that do not necessitate collaboration amplifies the risk of error generation. To address these challenges, we propose Debate Only When Necessary (DOWN), an adaptive multiagent debate framework that selectively activates the debate process based on the confidence score of the agent's initial response. For queries where debate is triggered, agents refine their outputs using responses from participating agents and their confidence scores. Experimental results demonstrate that this mechanism significantly improves efficiency while maintaining or even surpassing the performance of existing multiagent debate systems. We also find that confidence-guided debate mitigates error propagation and enhances the selective incorporation of reliable responses. These results establish DOWN as an optimization strategy for efficient and effective multiagent reasoning, facilitating the practical deployment of LLM-based collaboration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anja Surina, Amin Mansouri, Lars Quaedvlieg, Amal Seddas, Maryna Viazovska, Emmanuel Abbe, Caglar Gulcehre</p>
<p>Abstract: Discovering efficient algorithms for solving complex problems has been an outstanding challenge in mathematics and computer science, requiring substantial human expertise over the years. Recent advancements in evolutionary search with large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in accelerating the discovery of algorithms across various domains, particularly in mathematics and optimization. However, existing approaches treat the LLM as a static generator, missing the opportunity to update the model with the signal obtained from evolutionary exploration. In this work, we propose to augment LLM-based evolutionary search by continuously refining the search operator - the LLM - through reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning. Our method leverages evolutionary search as an exploration strategy to discover improved algorithms, while RL optimizes the LLM policy based on these discoveries. Our experiments on three combinatorial optimization tasks - bin packing, traveling salesman, and the flatpack problem - show that combining RL and evolutionary search improves discovery efficiency of improved algorithms, showcasing the potential of RL-enhanced evolutionary strategies to assist computer scientists and mathematicians for more efficient algorithm design.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present VAPO, Value-based Augmented Proximal Policy Optimization framework for reasoning models., a novel framework tailored for reasoning models within the value-based paradigm. Benchmarked the AIME 2024 dataset, VAPO, built on the Qwen 32B pre-trained model, attains a state-of-the-art score of $\mathbf{60.4}$. In direct comparison under identical experimental settings, VAPO outperforms the previously reported results of DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B and DAPO by more than 10 points. The training process of VAPO stands out for its stability and efficiency. It reaches state-of-the-art performance within a mere 5,000 steps. Moreover, across multiple independent runs, no training crashes occur, underscoring its reliability. This research delves into long chain-of-thought (long-CoT) reasoning using a value-based reinforcement learning framework. We pinpoint three key challenges that plague value-based methods: value model bias, the presence of heterogeneous sequence lengths, and the sparsity of reward signals. Through systematic design, VAPO offers an integrated solution that effectively alleviates these challenges, enabling enhanced performance in long-CoT reasoning tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongzhuoran Zhou, Yuqicheng Zhu, Yuan He, Jiaoyan Chen, Evgeny Kharlamov, Steffen Staab</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge Graph based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) is a technique that enhances Large Language Model (LLM) inference in tasks like Question Answering (QA) by retrieving relevant information from knowledge graphs (KGs). However, real-world KGs are often incomplete, meaning that essential information for answering questions may be missing. Existing benchmarks do not adequately capture the impact of KG incompleteness on KG-RAG performance. In this paper, we systematically evaluate KG-RAG methods under incomplete KGs by removing triples using different methods and analyzing the resulting effects. We demonstrate that KG-RAG methods are sensitive to KG incompleteness, highlighting the need for more robust approaches in realistic settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Islam Eldifrawi, Shengrui Wang, Amine Trabelsi</p>
<p>Abstract: The field of explainable Automatic Fact-Checking (AFC) aims to enhance the transparency and trustworthiness of automated fact-verification systems by providing clear and comprehensible explanations. However, the effectiveness of these explanations depends on their actionability --their ability to empower users to make informed decisions and mitigate misinformation. Despite actionability being a critical property of high-quality explanations, no prior research has proposed a dedicated method to evaluate it. This paper introduces FinGrAct, a fine-grained evaluation framework that can access the web, and it is designed to assess actionability in AFC explanations through well-defined criteria and an evaluation dataset. FinGrAct surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) evaluators, achieving the highest Pearson and Kendall correlation with human judgments while demonstrating the lowest ego-centric bias, making it a more robust evaluation approach for actionability evaluation in AFC.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper describes a cascading multimodal pipeline for high-resolution biodiversity mapping across Europe, integrating species distribution modeling, biodiversity indicators, and habitat classification. The proposed pipeline first predicts species compositions using a deep-SDM, a multimodal model trained on remote sensing, climate time series, and species occurrence data at 50x50m resolution. These predictions are then used to generate biodiversity indicator maps and classify habitats with Pl@ntBERT, a transformer-based LLM designed for species-to-habitat mapping. With this approach, continental-scale species distribution maps, biodiversity indicator maps, and habitat maps are produced, providing fine-grained ecological insights. Unlike traditional methods, this framework enables joint modeling of interspecies dependencies, bias-aware training with heterogeneous presence-absence data, and large-scale inference from multi-source remote sensing inputs.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05259">How to evaluate control measures for LLM agents? A trajectory from today to superintelligence</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Tomek Korbak, Mikita Balesni, Buck Shlegeris, Geoffrey Irving</p>
<p>Abstract: As LLM agents grow more capable of causing harm autonomously, AI developers will rely on increasingly sophisticated control measures to prevent possibly misaligned agents from causing harm. AI developers could demonstrate that their control measures are sufficient by running control evaluations: testing exercises in which a red team produces agents that try to subvert control measures. To ensure control evaluations accurately capture misalignment risks, the affordances granted to this red team should be adapted to the capability profiles of the agents to be deployed under control measures.
  In this paper we propose a systematic framework for adapting affordances of red teams to advancing AI capabilities. Rather than assuming that agents will always execute the best attack strategies known to humans, we demonstrate how knowledge of an agents's actual capability profile can inform proportional control evaluations, resulting in more practical and cost-effective control measures. We illustrate our framework by considering a sequence of five fictional models (M1-M5) with progressively advanced capabilities, defining five distinct AI control levels (ACLs). For each ACL, we provide example rules for control evaluation, control measures, and safety cases that could be appropriate. Finally, we show why constructing a compelling AI control safety case for superintelligent LLM agents will require research breakthroughs, highlighting that we might eventually need alternative approaches to mitigating misalignment risk.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zahra Atf, Seyed Amir Ahmad Safavi-Naini, Peter R. Lewis, Aref Mahjoubfar, Nariman Naderi, Thomas R. Savage, Ali Soroush</p>
<p>Abstract: This study investigates uncertainty quantification in large language models (LLMs) for medical applications, emphasizing both technical innovations and philosophical implications. As LLMs become integral to clinical decision-making, accurately communicating uncertainty is crucial for ensuring reliable, safe, and ethical AI-assisted healthcare. Our research frames uncertainty not as a barrier but as an essential part of knowledge that invites a dynamic and reflective approach to AI design. By integrating advanced probabilistic methods such as Bayesian inference, deep ensembles, and Monte Carlo dropout with linguistic analysis that computes predictive and semantic entropy, we propose a comprehensive framework that manages both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. The framework incorporates surrogate modeling to address limitations of proprietary APIs, multi-source data integration for better context, and dynamic calibration via continual and meta-learning. Explainability is embedded through uncertainty maps and confidence metrics to support user trust and clinical interpretability. Our approach supports transparent and ethical decision-making aligned with Responsible and Reflective AI principles. Philosophically, we advocate accepting controlled ambiguity instead of striving for absolute predictability, recognizing the inherent provisionality of medical knowledge.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) deliver exceptional performance but require significant computational resources, limiting their deployment on mobile and edge devices. Smaller VLMs typically mirror design choices of larger models, such as extensive image tokenization, leading to inefficient GPU memory usage and constrained practicality for on-device applications.
  We introduce SmolVLM, a series of compact multimodal models specifically engineered for resource-efficient inference. We systematically explore architectural configurations, tokenization strategies, and data curation optimized for low computational overhead. Through this, we identify key design choices that yield substantial performance gains on image and video tasks with minimal memory footprints.
  Our smallest model, SmolVLM-256M, uses less than 1GB GPU memory during inference and outperforms the 300-times larger Idefics-80B model, despite an 18-month development gap. Our largest model, at 2.2B parameters, rivals state-of-the-art VLMs consuming twice the GPU memory. SmolVLM models extend beyond static images, demonstrating robust video comprehension capabilities.
  Our results emphasize that strategic architectural optimizations, aggressive yet efficient tokenization, and carefully curated training data significantly enhance multimodal performance, facilitating practical, energy-efficient deployments at significantly smaller scales.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kyle Stein, Arash Mahyari, Guillermo Francia III, Eman El-Sheikh</p>
<p>Abstract: As networks continue to expand and become more interconnected, the need for novel malware detection methods becomes more pronounced. Traditional security measures are increasingly inadequate against the sophistication of modern cyber attacks. Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) has been pivotal in enhancing network security, offering an in-depth analysis of network traffic that surpasses conventional monitoring techniques. DPI not only examines the metadata of network packets, but also dives into the actual content being carried within the packet payloads, providing a comprehensive view of the data flowing through networks. While the integration of advanced deep learning techniques with DPI has introduced modern methodologies into malware detection and network traffic classification, state-of-the-art supervised learning approaches are limited by their reliance on large amounts of annotated data and their inability to generalize to novel, unseen malware threats. To address these limitations, this paper leverages the recent advancements in self-supervised learning (SSL) and few-shot learning (FSL). Our proposed self-supervised approach trains a transformer via SSL to learn the embedding of packet content, including payload, from vast amounts of unlabeled data by masking portions of packets, leading to a learned representation that generalizes to various downstream tasks. Once the representation is extracted from the packets, they are used to train a malware detection algorithm. The representation obtained from the transformer is then used to adapt the malware detector to novel types of attacks using few-shot learning approaches. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves classification accuracies of up to 94.76% on the UNSW-NB15 dataset and 83.25% on the CIC-IoT23 dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in code generation tasks and have become indispensable programming assistants for developers. However, existing code generation benchmarks primarily assess the functional correctness of code generated by LLMs in single-turn interactions, offering limited insight into their capabilities to generate code that strictly follows users' instructions, especially in multi-turn interaction scenarios. In this paper, we introduce \bench, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' instruction-following capabilities in interactive code generation. Specifically, \bench incorporates nine types of verifiable instructions aligned with the real-world software development requirements, which can be independently and objectively validated through specified test cases, facilitating the evaluation of instruction-following capability in multi-turn interactions. We evaluate nine prominent LLMs using \bench, and the experimental results reveal a significant disparity between their basic programming capability and instruction-following capability, particularly as task complexity, context length, and the number of dialogue rounds increase.</p>

<p>Abstract: The need for automatic and high-quality emotion annotation is paramount in applications such as continuous emotion recognition and video highlight detection, yet achieving this through manual human annotations is challenging. Inspired by inter-subject correlation (ISC) utilized in neuroscience, this study introduces a novel Electroencephalography (EEG) based ISC methodology that leverages a single-electrode and feature-based dynamic approach. Our contributions are three folds. Firstly, we reidentify two potent emotion features suitable for classifying emotions-first-order difference (FD) an differential entropy (DE). Secondly, through the use of overall correlation analysis, we demonstrate the heterogeneous synchronized performance of electrodes. This performance aligns with neural emotion patterns established in prior studies, thus validating the effectiveness of our approach. Thirdly, by employing a sliding window correlation technique, we showcase the significant consistency of dynamic ISCs across various features or key electrodes in each analyzed film clip. Our findings indicate the method's reliability in capturing consistent, dynamic shared neural synchrony among individuals, triggered by evocative film stimuli. This underscores the potential of our approach to serve as an indicator of continuous human emotion arousal. The implications of this research are significant for advancements in affective computing and the broader neuroscience field, suggesting a streamlined and effective tool for emotion analysis in real-world applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce AIBrix, a cloud-native, open-source framework designed to optimize and simplify large-scale LLM deployment in cloud environments. Unlike traditional cloud-native stacks, AIBrix follows a co-design philosophy, ensuring every layer of the infrastructure is purpose-built for seamless integration with inference engines like vLLM. AIBrix introduces several key innovations to reduce inference costs and enhance performance including high-density LoRA management for dynamic adapter scheduling, LLM-specific autoscalers, and prefix-aware, load-aware routing. To further improve efficiency, AIBrix incorporates a distributed KV cache, boosting token reuse across nodes, leading to a 50% increase in throughput and a 70% reduction in inference latency. AIBrix also supports unified AI runtime which streamlines model management while maintaining vendor-agnostic engine compatibility. For large-scale multi-node inference, AIBrix employs hybrid orchestration -- leveraging Kubernetes for coarse-grained scheduling and Ray for fine-grained execution -- to balance efficiency and flexibility. Additionally, an SLO-driven GPU optimizer dynamically adjusts resource allocations, optimizing heterogeneous serving to maximize cost efficiency while maintaining service guarantees. Finally, AIBrix enhances system reliability with AI accelerator diagnostic tools, enabling automated failure detection and mock-up testing to improve fault resilience.

However, strategically serving online and offline tasks through a preemption mechanism fails to fully leverage the flexibility of offline tasks and suffers from KV cache recomputation and irregular workloads.
  In this paper, we introduce Echo, a collaborative online-offline task serving system, including a scheduler, a KV cache manager, and estimation toolkits. The scheduler and KV cache manager work tightly to maximize the throughput of offline tasks, while the estimator further predicts execution time to ensure online task SLOs. The scheduler leverages the batch information of last iteration to reduce the search space for finding the optimal schedule. The KV cache manager sets the priority of the KV cache based on the type of tasks and the opportunity of prefix sharing to reduce the recomputation. Finally, the estimation toolkits predict the execution time, future memory consumption, and the throughput of offline tasks to guide the scheduler, KV cache manager, and the system deployer. Evaluation based on real-world workloads demonstrates that Echo can increase offline task throughput by up to $3.3\times$, while satisfying online task SLOs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Keondo Park, You Rim Choi, Inhoe Lee, Hyung-Sin Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Running deep learning models on resource-constrained edge devices has drawn significant attention due to its fast response, privacy preservation, and robust operation regardless of Internet connectivity. While these devices already cope with various intelligent tasks, the latest edge devices that are equipped with multiple types of low-power accelerators (i.e., both mobile GPU and NPU) can bring another opportunity; a task that used to be too heavy for an edge device in the single-accelerator world might become viable in the upcoming heterogeneous-accelerator world.To realize the potential in the context of 3D object detection, we identify several technical challenges and propose PointSplit, a novel 3D object detection framework for multi-accelerator edge devices that addresses the problems. Specifically, our PointSplit design includes (1) 2D semantics-aware biased point sampling, (2) parallelized 3D feature extraction, and (3) role-based group-wise quantization. We implement PointSplit on TensorFlow Lite and evaluate it on a customized hardware platform comprising both mobile GPU and EdgeTPU. Experimental results on representative RGB-D datasets, SUN RGB-D and Scannet V2, demonstrate that PointSplit on a multi-accelerator device is 24.7 times faster with similar accuracy compared to the full-precision, 2D-3D fusion-based 3D detector on a GPU-only device.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yangyijian Liu, Jun Li, Wu-Jun Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The high memory and computation demand of large language models (LLMs) makes them challenging to be deployed on consumer devices due to limited GPU memory. Offloading can mitigate the memory constraint but often suffers from low GPU utilization, leading to low inference efficiency. In this work, we propose a novel framework, called pipelined offloading (PIPO), for efficient inference on consumer devices. PIPO designs a fine-grained offloading pipeline, complemented with optimized data transfer and computation, to achieve high concurrency and efficient scheduling for inference. Experimental results show that compared with state-of-the-art baseline, PIPO increases GPU utilization from below 40% to over 90% and achieves up to 3.1$\times$ higher throughput, running on a laptop equipped with a RTX3060 GPU of 6GB memory.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and DeepSeek, have been applied to a wide range of domains in software engineering. However, their potential in the context of High-Performance Computing (HPC) much remains to be explored. This paper evaluates how well DeepSeek, a recent LLM, performs in generating a set of HPC benchmark codes: a conjugate gradient solver, the parallel heat equation, parallel matrix multiplication, DGEMM, and the STREAM triad operation. We analyze DeepSeek's code generation capabilities for traditional HPC languages like Cpp, Fortran, Julia and Python. The evaluation includes testing for code correctness, performance, and scaling across different configurations and matrix sizes. We also provide a detailed comparison between DeepSeek and another widely used tool: GPT-4. Our results demonstrate that while DeepSeek generates functional code for HPC tasks, it lags behind GPT-4, in terms of scalability and execution efficiency of the generated code.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Caicheng Wang, Zili Wang, Shuyou Zhang, Yongzhe Xiang, Zheyi Li, Jianrong Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: Pipe routing is a highly complex, time-consuming, and no-deterministic polynomial-time hard (NP-hard) problem in aeroengine design. Despite extensive research efforts in optimizing constant-curvature pipe routing, the growing demand for free-form pipes poses new challenges. Dynamic design environments and fuzzy layout rules further impact the optimization performance and efficiency. To tackle these challenges, this study proposes a self-learning-based method (SLPR) for optimizing free-form pipe routing in aeroengines. The SLPR is based on the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm and integrates a unified rule modeling framework for efficient obstacle detection and fuzzy rule modeling in continuous space. Additionally, a potential energy table is constructed to enable rapid queries of layout tendencies and interference. The agent within SLPR iteratively refines pipe routing and accumulates the design knowledge through interaction with the environment. Once the design environment shifts, the agent can swiftly adapt by fine-tuning network parameters. Comparative tests reveal that SLPR ensures smooth pipe routing through cubic non-uniform B-spline (NURBS) curves, avoiding redundant pipe segments found in constant-curvature pipe routing. Results in both static and dynamic design environments demonstrate that SLPR outperforms three representative baselines in terms of the pipe length reduction, the adherence to layout rules, the path complexity, and the computational efficiency. Furthermore, tests in dynamic environments indicate that SLPR eliminates labor-intensive searches from scratch and even yields superior solutions compared to the retrained model. These results highlight the practical value of SLPR for real-world pipe routing, meeting lightweight, precision, and sustainability requirements of the modern aeroengine design.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this work, we present HiAER-Spike, a modular, reconfigurable, event-driven neuromorphic computing platform designed to execute large spiking neural networks with up to 160 million neurons and 40 billion synapses - roughly twice the neurons of a mouse brain at faster-than real-time. This system, which is currently under construction at the UC San Diego Supercomputing Center, comprises a co-designed hard- and software stack that is optimized for run-time massively parallel processing and hierarchical address-event routing (HiAER) of spikes while promoting memory-efficient network storage and execution. Our architecture efficiently handles both sparse connectivity and sparse activity for robust and low-latency event-driven inference for both edge and cloud computing. A Python programming interface to HiAER-Spike, agnostic to hardware-level detail, shields the user from complexity in the configuration and execution of general spiking neural networks with virtually no constraints in topology. The system is made easily available over a web portal for use by the wider community. In the following we provide an overview of the hard- and software stack, explain the underlying design principles, demonstrate some of the system's capabilities and solicit feedback from the broader neuromorphic community.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhanwei Wang, Qunsong Zeng, Haotian Zheng, Kaibin Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: One of the key missions of sixth-generation (6G) mobile networks is to deploy large-scale artificial intelligence (AI) models at the network edge to provide remote-inference services for edge devices. The resultant platform, known as edge inference, will support a wide range of Internet-of-Things applications, such as autonomous driving, industrial automation, and augmented reality. Given the mission-critical and time-sensitive nature of these tasks, it is essential to design edge inference systems that are both reliable and capable of meeting stringent end-to-end (E2E) latency constraints. Existing studies, which primarily focus on communication reliability as characterized by channel outage probability, may fail to guarantee E2E performance, specifically in terms of E2E inference accuracy and latency. To address this limitation, we propose a theoretical framework that introduces and mathematically characterizes the inference outage (InfOut) probability, which quantifies the likelihood that the E2E inference accuracy falls below a target threshold. Under an E2E latency constraint, this framework establishes a fundamental tradeoff between communication overhead (i.e., uploading more sensor observations) and inference reliability as quantified by the InfOut probability. To find a tractable way to optimize this tradeoff, we derive accurate surrogate functions for InfOut probability by applying a Gaussian approximation to the distribution of the received discriminant gain. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed design over conventional communication-centric approaches in terms of E2E inference reliability.</p>

<p>Abstract: Sensor-based human activity recognition is a key technology for many human-centered intelligent applications. However, this research is still in its infancy and faces many unresolved challenges. To address these, we propose a comprehensive optimization process approach centered on multi-attention interaction. We first utilize unsupervised statistical feature-guided diffusion models for highly adaptive data enhancement, and introduce a novel network architecture-Multi-branch Spatiotemporal Interaction Network, which uses multi-branch features at different levels to effectively Sequential ), which uses multi-branch features at different levels to effectively Sequential spatio-temporal interaction to enhance the ability to mine advanced latent features. In addition, we adopt a multi-loss function fusion strategy in the training phase to dynamically adjust the fusion weights between batches to optimize the training results. Finally, we also conducted actual deployment on embedded devices to extensively test the practical feasibility of the proposed method in existing work. We conduct extensive testing on three public datasets, including ablation studies, comparisons of related work, and embedded deployments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Constraint ordering plays a critical role in the efficiency of Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) solvers, particularly for large-scale problems where poorly ordered constraints trigger increased LP iterations and suboptimal search trajectories. This paper introduces CLCR (Contrastive Learning-based Constraint Reordering), a novel framework that systematically optimizes constraint ordering to accelerate MILP solving. CLCR first clusters constraints based on their structural patterns and then employs contrastive learning with a pointer network to optimize their sequence, preserving problem equivalence while improving solver efficiency. Experiments on benchmarks show CLCR reduces solving time by 30% and LP iterations by 25% on average, without sacrificing solution accuracy. This work demonstrates the potential of data-driven constraint ordering to enhance optimization models, offering a new paradigm for bridging mathematical programming with machine learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Selim F. Yilmaz, Can Karamanli, Deniz Gunduz</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider multiple transmitters aiming to communicate their source signals (e.g., images) over a multiple access channel (MAC). Conventional communication systems minimize interference by orthogonally allocating resources (time and/or bandwidth) among users, which limits their capacity. We introduce a machine learning (ML)-aided wireless image transmission method that merges compression and channel coding using a multi-view autoencoder, which allows the transmitters to use all the available channel resources simultaneously, resulting in a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme. The receiver must recover all the images from the received superposed signal, while also associating each image with its transmitter. Traditional ML models deal with individual samples, whereas our model allows signals from different users to interfere in order to leverage gains from NOMA under limited bandwidth and power constraints. We introduce a progressive fine-tuning algorithm that doubles the number of users at each iteration, maintaining initial performance with orthogonalized user-specific projections, which is then improved through fine-tuning steps. Remarkably, our method scales up to 16 users and beyond, with only a 0.6% increase in the number of trainable parameters compared to a single-user model, significantly enhancing recovered image quality and outperforming existing NOMA-based methods over a wide range of datasets, metrics, and channel conditions. Our approach paves the way for more efficient and robust multi-user communication systems, leveraging innovative ML components and strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nilesh Kumar Sahu, Snehil Gupta, Haroon R Lone</p>
<p>Abstract: Anxiety-provoking activities, such as public speaking, can trigger heightened anxiety responses in individuals with anxiety disorders. Recent research suggests that physiological signals, including electrocardiogram (ECG) and electrodermal activity (EDA), collected via wearable devices, can be used to detect anxiety in such contexts through machine learning models. However, the generalizability of these anxiety prediction models across different activities and diverse populations remains underexplored-an essential step for assessing model bias and fostering user trust in broader applications. To address this gap, we conducted a study with 111 participants who engaged in three anxiety-provoking activities. Utilizing both our collected dataset and two well-known publicly available datasets, we evaluated the generalizability of anxiety detection models within participants (for both same-activity and cross-activity scenarios) and across participants (within-activity and cross-activity). In total, we trained and tested more than 3348 anxiety detection models (using six classifiers, 31 feature sets, and 18 train-test configurations). Our results indicate that three key metrics-AUROC, recall for anxious states, and recall for non-anxious states-were slightly above the baseline score of 0.5. The best AUROC scores ranged from 0.62 to 0.73, with recall for the anxious class spanning 35.19% to 74.3%. Interestingly, model performance (as measured by AUROC) remained relatively stable across different activities and participant groups, though recall for the anxious class did exhibit some variation.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid increase in remote sensing satellites has led to the emergence of distributed space-based observation systems. However, existing distributed remote sensing models often rely on centralized training, resulting in data leakage, communication overhead, and reduced accuracy due to data distribution discrepancies across platforms. To address these challenges, we propose the \textit{Self-Adjustment FEderated Learning} (SAFE) framework, which innovatively leverages federated learning to enhance collaborative sensing in remote sensing scenarios. SAFE introduces four key strategies: (1) \textit{Class Rectification Optimization}, which autonomously addresses class imbalance under unknown local and global distributions. (2) \textit{Feature Alignment Update}, which mitigates Non-IID data issues via locally controlled EMA updates. (3) \textit{Dual-Factor Modulation Rheostat}, which dynamically balances optimization effects during training. (4) \textit{Adaptive Context Enhancement}, which is designed to improve model performance by dynamically refining foreground regions, ensuring computational efficiency with accuracy improvement across distributed satellites. Experiments on real-world image classification and object segmentation datasets validate the effectiveness and reliability of the SAFE framework in complex remote sensing scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jan Lewen, Max Pargmann, Jenia Jitsev, Mehdi Cherti, Robert Pitz-Paal, Daniel Maldonado Quinto</p>
<p>Abstract: Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) plants are a key technology in the transition toward sustainable energy. A critical factor for their safe and efficient operation is the distribution of concentrated solar flux on the receiver. However, flux distributions from individual heliostats are sensitive to surface imperfections. Measuring these surfaces across many heliostats remains impractical in real-world deployments. As a result, control systems often assume idealized heliostat surfaces, leading to suboptimal performance and potential safety risks. To address this, inverse Deep Learning Raytracing (iDLR) has been introduced as a novel method for inferring heliostat surface profiles from target images recorded during standard calibration procedures. In this work, we present the first successful Sim-to-Real transfer of iDLR, enabling accurate surface predictions directly from real-world target images. We evaluate our method on 63 heliostats under real operational conditions. iDLR surface predictions achieve a median mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.17 mm and show good agreement with deflectometry ground truth in 84% of cases. When used in raytracing simulations, it enables flux density predictions with a mean accuracy of 90% compared to deflectometry over our dataset, and outperforms the commonly used ideal heliostat surface assumption by 26%. We tested this approach in a challenging double-extrapolation scenario-involving unseen sun positions and receiver projection-and found that iDLR maintains high predictive accuracy, highlighting its generalization capabilities. Our results demonstrate that iDLR is a scalable, automated, and cost-effective solution for integrating realistic heliostat surface models into digital twins. This opens the door to improved flux control, more precise performance modeling, and ultimately, enhanced efficiency and safety in future CSP plants.</p>

<p>Abstract: While current large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable linguistic capabilities through training on massive unstructured text corpora, they remain inadequate in leveraging structured scientific data (e.g., chemical molecular properties in databases) that encapsulate centuries of accumulated scientific expertise. These structured datasets hold strategic significance for advancing AI for Science yet current approaches merely treat them as auxiliary supplements to unstructured text. This study pioneers a systematic investigation into enhancing LLMs with structured scientific data, using chemical molecular science as a testbed. We investigate the impact of incorporating molecular property data on LLM across distinct training phases, including continual pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning. Notably, to address the inherent limitation of numerical insensitivity in large models, we propose an innovative methodology termed "Reinforcement Learning with Database Feedback" (RLDBF). Experimental evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach, with the model exhibiting remarkable generalization capabilities on previously unseen data and other chemical tasks. The results substantiate the potential of our method in advancing the field of structured scientific data processing within LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have become essential to general artificial intelligence, exhibiting remarkable capabilities in task understanding and problem-solving. However, the real-world reliability of these models critically depends on their stability, which remains an underexplored area. Despite their widespread use, rigorous studies examining the stability of LLMs under various perturbations are still lacking. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing a novel stability measure for LLMs, inspired by statistical methods rooted in information geometry. Our measure possesses desirable invariance properties, making it well-suited for analyzing model sensitivity to both parameter and input perturbations. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on models ranging in size from 1.5B to 13B parameters. Our results demonstrate the utility of our measure in identifying salient parameters and detecting vulnerable regions in input images or critical dimensions in token embeddings. Furthermore, leveraging our stability framework, we enhance model robustness during model merging, leading to improved performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Quality-Diversity algorithms are powerful tools for discovering diverse, high-performing solutions. Recently, Multi-Objective Quality-Diversity (MOQD) extends QD to problems with several objectives while preserving solution diversity. MOQD has shown promise in fields such as robotics and materials science, where finding trade-offs between competing objectives like energy efficiency and speed, or material properties is essential. However, existing methods in MOQD rely on tessellating the feature space into a grid structure, which prevents their application in domains where feature spaces are unknown or must be learned, such as complex biological systems or latent exploration tasks. In this work, we introduce Multi-Objective Unstructured Repertoire for Quality-Diversity (MOUR-QD), a MOQD algorithm designed for unstructured and unbounded feature spaces. We evaluate MOUR-QD on five robotic tasks. Importantly, we show that our method excels in tasks where features must be learned, paving the way for applying MOQD to unsupervised domains. We also demonstrate that MOUR-QD is advantageous in domains with unbounded feature spaces, outperforming existing grid-based methods. Finally, we demonstrate that MOUR-QD is competitive with established MOQD methods on existing MOQD tasks and achieves double the MOQD-score in some environments. MOUR-QD opens up new opportunities for MOQD in domains like protein design and image generation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming ubiquitous, promising automation even in high-stakes scenarios. However, existing evaluation methods often fall short -- benchmarks saturate, accuracy-based metrics are overly simplistic, and many inherently ambiguous problems lack a clear ground truth. Given these limitations, evaluating fairness becomes complex. To address this, we reframe fairness evaluation using Borda scores, a method from voting theory, as a nuanced yet interpretable metric for measuring fairness. Using organ allocation as a case study, we introduce two tasks: (1) Choose-One and (2) Rank-All. In Choose-One, LLMs select a single candidate for a kidney, and we assess fairness across demographics using proportional parity. In Rank-All, LLMs rank all candidates for a kidney, reflecting real-world allocation processes. Since traditional fairness metrics do not account for ranking, we propose a novel application of Borda scoring to capture biases. Our findings highlight the potential of voting-based metrics to provide a richer, more multifaceted evaluation of LLM fairness.</p>

RaanA achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art quantization methods while being extremely fast, requiring minimal calibration data, and enabling flexible bit allocation. Extensive experiments demonstrate RaanA's efficacy in balancing efficiency and accuracy. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/FFTYYY/RaanA .</p>

However, fine-tuning LLMs to specific tasks at the edge is challenging due to the high computational cost and the limited storage and energy resources at the edge. To address this issue, we propose TaskEdge, a task-aware parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework at the edge, which allocates the most effective parameters to the target task and only updates the task-specific parameters. Specifically, we first design a parameter importance calculation criterion that incorporates both weights and input activations into the computation of weight importance. Then, we propose a model-agnostic task-specific parameter allocation algorithm to ensure that task-specific parameters are distributed evenly across the model, rather than being concentrated in specific regions. In doing so, TaskEdge can significantly reduce the computational cost and memory usage while maintaining performance on the target downstream tasks by updating less than 0.1\% of the parameters. In addition, TaskEdge can be easily integrated with structured sparsity to enable acceleration by NVIDIA's specialized sparse tensor cores, and it can be seamlessly integrated with LoRA to enable efficient sparse low-rank adaptation. Extensive experiments on various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of TaskEdge.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tales Panoutsos, Rodrygo L. T. Santos, Flavio Figueiredo</p>
<p>Abstract: \newcommand{\mathds}[1]{\text{\usefont{U}{dsrom}{m}{n}#1}}
  In this paper, we introduce Symmetric Low-Rank Adapters, an optimized variant of LoRA with even fewer weights. This method utilizes Low-Rank Symmetric Weight Matrices to learn downstream tasks more efficiently. Traditional LoRA accumulates fine-tuning weights with the original pre-trained weights via a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) like approach, i.e., model weights are fine-tuned via updates of the form $BA$ (where $B \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times r}$, $A \in \mathbb{R}^{r\times n}$, and $r$ is the rank of the merged weight matrix). In contrast, our approach, named SymLoRA, represents fine-tuning weights as a Spectral Decomposition, i.e., $Q \, diag(\Lambda)\, Q^T$, where $Q \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times r}$ and $\Lambda \in \mathbb{R}^r$. SymLoRA requires approximately half of the finetuning weights. Here, we show that this approach has negligible losses in downstream efficacy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luyuan Zhang, An Liu, Kexuan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: In the forthcoming 6G era, extend reality (XR) has been regarded as an emerging application for ultra-reliable and low latency communications (URLLC) with new traffic characteristics and more stringent requirements. In addition to the quasi-periodical traffic in XR, burst traffic with both large frame size and random arrivals in some real world low latency communication scenarios has become the leading cause of network congestion or even collapse, and there still lacks an efficient algorithm for the resource scheduling problem under burst traffic with hard latency constraints. We propose a novel hybrid reinforcement learning framework for resource scheduling with hard latency constraints (HRL-RSHLC), which reuses polices from both old policies learned under other similar environments and domain-knowledge-based (DK) policies constructed using expert knowledge to improve the performance. The joint optimization of the policy reuse probabilities and new policy is formulated as an Markov Decision Problem (MDP), which maximizes the hard-latency constrained effective throughput (HLC-ET) of users. We prove that the proposed HRL-RSHLC can converge to KKT points with an arbitrary initial point. Simulations show that HRL-RSHLC can achieve superior performance with faster convergence speed compared to baseline algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yulu Pi, Ella Bettison, Anna Becker</p>
<p>Abstract: This study investigates malicious AI Assistants' manipulative traits and whether the behaviours of malicious AI Assistants can be detected when interacting with human-like simulated users in various decision-making contexts. We also examine how interaction depth and ability of planning influence malicious AI Assistants' manipulative strategies and effectiveness. Using a controlled experimental design, we simulate interactions between AI Assistants (both benign and deliberately malicious) and users across eight decision-making scenarios of varying complexity and stakes. Our methodology employs two state-of-the-art language models to generate interaction data and implements Intent-Aware Prompting (IAP) to detect malicious AI Assistants. The findings reveal that malicious AI Assistants employ domain-specific persona-tailored manipulation strategies, exploiting simulated users' vulnerabilities and emotional triggers. In particular, simulated users demonstrate resistance to manipulation initially, but become increasingly vulnerable to malicious AI Assistants as the depth of the interaction increases, highlighting the significant risks associated with extended engagement with potentially manipulative systems. IAP detection methods achieve high precision with zero false positives but struggle to detect many malicious AI Assistants, resulting in high false negative rates. These findings underscore critical risks in human-AI interactions and highlight the need for robust, context-sensitive safeguards against manipulative AI behaviour in increasingly autonomous decision-support systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Tahir, Mahboobeh Norouzi, Shehroz S. Khan, James R. Davie, Soichiro Yamanaka, Ahmed Ashraf</p>
<p>Abstract: Epigenetics encompasses mechanisms that can alter the expression of genes without changing the underlying genetic sequence. The epigenetic regulation of gene expression is initiated and sustained by several mechanisms such as DNA methylation, histone modifications, chromatin conformation, and non-coding RNA. The changes in gene regulation and expression can manifest in the form of various diseases and disorders such as cancer and congenital deformities. Over the last few decades, high throughput experimental approaches have been used to identify and understand epigenetic changes, but these laboratory experimental approaches and biochemical processes are time-consuming and expensive. To overcome these challenges, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) approaches have been extensively used for mapping epigenetic modifications to their phenotypic manifestations. In this paper we provide a narrative review of published research on AI models trained on epigenomic data to address a variety of problems such as prediction of disease markers, gene expression, enhancer promoter interaction, and chromatin states. The purpose of this review is twofold as it is addressed to both AI experts and epigeneticists. For AI researchers, we provided a taxonomy of epigenetics research problems that can benefit from an AI-based approach. For epigeneticists, given each of the above problems we provide a list of candidate AI solutions in the literature. We have also identified several gaps in the literature, research challenges, and recommendations to address these challenges.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianfei Cao, Dongchao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) is a widely recognized technique for modeling spatial heterogeneity. However, it is commonly assumed that the relationships between dependent and independent variables are linear. To overcome this limitation, we propose an Artificial Geographically Weighted Neural Network (AGWNN), a novel framework that integrates geographically weighted techniques with neural networks to capture complex nonlinear spatial relationships. Central to this framework is the Geographically Weighted Layer (GWL), a specialized component designed to encode spatial heterogeneity within the neural network architecture. To rigorously evaluate the performance of AGWNN, we conducted comprehensive experiments using both simulated datasets and real-world case studies. Our results demonstrate that AGWNN significantly outperforms traditional GWR and standard Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in terms of model fitting accuracy. Notably, AGWNN excels in modeling intricate nonlinear relationships and effectively identifies complex spatial heterogeneity patterns, offering a robust and versatile tool for advanced spatial analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Erfan Shayegani, G M Shahariar, Sara Abdali, Lei Yu, Nael Abu-Ghazaleh, Yue Dong</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Language Models (MMLMs) typically undergo post-training alignment to prevent harmful content generation. However, these alignment stages focus primarily on the assistant role, leaving the user role unaligned, and stick to a fixed input prompt structure of special tokens, leaving the model vulnerable when inputs deviate from these expectations. We introduce Role-Modality Attacks (RMA), a novel class of adversarial attacks that exploit role confusion between the user and assistant and alter the position of the image token to elicit harmful outputs. Unlike existing attacks that modify query content, RMAs manipulate the input structure without altering the query itself. We systematically evaluate these attacks across multiple Vision Language Models (VLMs) on eight distinct settings, showing that they can be composed to create stronger adversarial prompts, as also evidenced by their increased projection in the negative refusal direction in the residual stream, a property observed in prior successful attacks. Finally, for mitigation, we propose an adversarial training approach that makes the model robust against input prompt perturbations. By training the model on a range of harmful and benign prompts all perturbed with different RMA settings, it loses its sensitivity to Role Confusion and Modality Manipulation attacks and is trained to only pay attention to the content of the query in the input prompt structure, effectively reducing Attack Success Rate (ASR) while preserving the model's general utility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Teodor Chiaburu, Felix Bie{\ss}mann, Frank Hau{\ss}er</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding uncertainty in Explainable AI (XAI) is crucial for building trust and ensuring reliable decision-making in Machine Learning models. This paper introduces a unified framework for quantifying and interpreting Uncertainty in XAI by defining a general explanation function $e_{\theta}(x, f)$ that captures the propagation of uncertainty from key sources: perturbations in input data and model parameters. By using both analytical and empirical estimates of explanation variance, we provide a systematic means of assessing the impact uncertainty on explanations. We illustrate the approach using a first-order uncertainty propagation as the analytical estimator. In a comprehensive evaluation across heterogeneous datasets, we compare analytical and empirical estimates of uncertainty propagation and evaluate their robustness. Extending previous work on inconsistencies in explanations, our experiments identify XAI methods that do not reliably capture and propagate uncertainty. Our findings underscore the importance of uncertainty-aware explanations in high-stakes applications and offer new insights into the limitations of current XAI methods.

In addition to reviewing architectural innovations, we examine how attention mechanisms contribute to performance improvements in diverse applications. We also identify current limitations and underexplored areas, and outline potential directions for future research.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingyan Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative models, such as GPT and BERT, have significantly improved performance in tasks like text generation and summarization. However, hallucinations "where models generate non-factual or misleading content" are especially problematic in smaller-scale architectures, limiting their real-world applicability.In this paper, we propose a unified Virtual Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) fusion strategy that enhances inference performance and mitigates hallucinations in a single Qwen 1.5 0.5B model without increasing the parameter count. Our method leverages multiple domain-specific expert prompts (with the number of experts being adjustable) to guide the model from different perspectives. We apply a statistical outlier truncation strategy based on the mean and standard deviation to filter out abnormally high probability predictions, and we inject noise into the embedding space to promote output diversity. To clearly assess the contribution of each module, we adopt a fixed voting mechanism rather than a dynamic gating network, thereby avoiding additional confounding factors. We provide detailed theoretical derivations from both statistical and ensemble learning perspectives to demonstrate how our method reduces output variance and suppresses hallucinations. Extensive ablation experiments on dialogue generation tasks show that our approach significantly improves inference accuracy and robustness in small models. Additionally, we discuss methods for evaluating the orthogonality of virtual experts and outline the potential for future work involving dynamic expert weight allocation using gating networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> ZhiTeng Zhu (School of Mathematics, Hunan University), Lan Yao (School of Mathematics, Hunan University)</p>
<p>Abstract: The dynamic characterization of functional brain networks is of great significance for elucidating the mechanisms of human brain function. Although graph neural networks have achieved remarkable progress in functional network analysis, challenges such as data scarcity and insufficient supervision persist. To address the limitations of limited training data and inadequate supervision, this paper proposes a novel model named PHGCL-DDGformer that integrates graph contrastive learning with graph transformers, effectively enhancing the representation learning capability for brain network classification tasks. To overcome the constraints of existing graph contrastive learning methods in brain network feature extraction, an adaptive graph augmentation strategy combining attribute masking and edge perturbation is implemented for data enhancement. Subsequently, a dual-domain graph transformer (DDGformer) module is constructed to integrate local and global information, where graph convolutional networks aggregate neighborhood features to capture local patterns while attention mechanisms extract global dependencies. Finally, a graph contrastive learning framework is established to maximize the consistency between positive and negative pairs, thereby obtaining high-quality graph representations. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that the PHGCL-DDGformer model outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in brain network classification tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Songtao Peng, Lei Wang, Wu Shuai, Hao Song, Jiajun Zhou, Shanqing Yu, Qi Xuan</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid growth of internet traffic, malicious network attacks have become increasingly frequent and sophisticated, posing significant threats to global cybersecurity. Traditional detection methods, including rule-based and machine learning-based approaches, struggle to accurately identify emerging threats, particularly in scenarios with limited samples. While recent advances in few-shot learning have partially addressed the data scarcity issue, existing methods still exhibit high false positive rates and lack the capability to effectively capture crucial local traffic patterns. In this paper, we propose HLoG, a novel hierarchical few-shot malicious traffic detection framework that leverages both local and global features extracted from network sessions. HLoG employs a sliding-window approach to segment sessions into phases, capturing fine-grained local interaction patterns through hierarchical bidirectional GRU encoding, while simultaneously modeling global contextual dependencies. We further design a session similarity assessment module that integrates local similarity with global self-attention-enhanced representations, achieving accurate and robust few-shot traffic classification. Comprehensive experiments on three meticulously reconstructed datasets demonstrate that HLoG significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Particularly, HLoG achieves superior recall rates while substantially reducing false positives, highlighting its effectiveness and practical value in real-world cybersecurity applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benjamin Patrick Evans, Leo Ardon, Sumitra Ganesh</p>
<p>Abstract: Modelling bounded rational decision-making through information constrained processing provides a principled approach for representing departures from rationality within a reinforcement learning framework, while still treating decision-making as an optimization process. However, existing approaches are generally based on Entropy, Kullback-Leibler divergence, or Mutual Information. In this work, we highlight issues with these approaches when dealing with ordinal action spaces. Specifically, entropy assumes uniform prior beliefs, missing the impact of a priori biases on decision-makings. KL-Divergence addresses this, however, has no notion of "nearness" of actions, and additionally, has several well known potentially undesirable properties such as the lack of symmetry, and furthermore, requires the distributions to have the same support (e.g. positive probability for all actions). Mutual information is often difficult to estimate. Here, we propose an alternative approach for modeling bounded rational RL agents utilising Wasserstein distances. This approach overcomes the aforementioned issues. Crucially, this approach accounts for the nearness of ordinal actions, modeling "stickiness" in agent decisions and unlikeliness of rapidly switching to far away actions, while also supporting low probability actions, zero-support prior distributions, and is simple to calculate directly.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tanmay Chakraborty, Christian Wirth, Christin Seifert</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces Multi-Output LOcal Narrative Explanation (MOLONE), a novel comparative explanation method designed to enhance preference selection in human-in-the-loop Preference Bayesian optimization (PBO). The preference elicitation in PBO is a non-trivial task because it involves navigating implicit trade-offs between vector-valued outcomes, subjective priorities of decision-makers, and decision-makers' uncertainty in preference selection. Existing explainable AI (XAI) methods for BO primarily focus on input feature importance, neglecting the crucial role of outputs (objectives) in human preference elicitation. MOLONE addresses this gap by providing explanations that highlight both input and output importance, enabling decision-makers to understand the trade-offs between competing objectives and make more informed preference selections. MOLONE focuses on local explanations, comparing the importance of input features and outcomes across candidate samples within a local neighborhood of the search space, thus capturing nuanced differences relevant to preference-based decision-making. We evaluate MOLONE within a PBO framework using benchmark multi-objective optimization functions, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving convergence compared to noisy preference selections. Furthermore, a user study confirms that MOLONE significantly accelerates convergence in human-in-the-loop scenarios by facilitating more efficient identification of preferred options.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pavia Bera, Sabrina Hassan Moon, Jennifer Adorno, Dayane Alfenas Reis, Sanjukta Bhanja</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) generates zettabytes of data that demand efficient unsupervised learning systems. Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM), a third-generation unsupervised AI algorithm, models the neocortex of the human brain by simulating columns of neurons to process and predict sequences. These neuron columns can memorize and infer sequences across multiple orders. While multiorder inferences offer robust predictive capabilities, they often come with significant computational overhead. The Sequence Memory (SM) component of HTM, which manages these inferences, encounters bottlenecks primarily due to its extensive programmable interconnects. In many cases, it has been observed that first-order temporal relationships have proven to be sufficient without any significant loss in efficiency. This paper introduces a Reflex Memory (RM) block, inspired by the Spinal Cord's working mechanisms, designed to accelerate the processing of first-order inferences. The RM block performs these inferences significantly faster than the SM. The integration of RM with HTM forms a system called the Accelerated Hierarchical Temporal Memory (AHTM), which processes repetitive information more efficiently than the original HTM while still supporting multiorder inferences. The experimental results demonstrate that the HTM predicts an event in 0.945 s, whereas the AHTM module does so in 0.125 s. Additionally, the hardware implementation of RM in a content-addressable memory (CAM) block, known as Hardware-Accelerated Hierarchical Temporal Memory (H-AHTM), predicts an event in just 0.094 s, significantly improving inference speed. Compared to the original algorithm \cite{bautista2020matlabhtm}, AHTM accelerates inference by up to 7.55x, while H-AHTM further enhances performance with a 10.10x speedup.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid emergence of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has significantly advanced multimodal understanding, enabling applications in scene comprehension and visual reasoning. While these models have been primarily evaluated and developed for front-view image understanding, their capabilities in interpreting top-down images have received limited attention, partly due to the scarcity of diverse top-down datasets and the challenges in collecting such data. In contrast, top-down vision provides explicit spatial overviews and improved contextual understanding of scenes, making it particularly valuable for tasks like autonomous navigation, aerial imaging, and spatial planning. In this work, we address this gap by introducing TDBench, a comprehensive benchmark for VLMs in top-down image understanding. TDBench is constructed from public top-down view datasets and high-quality simulated images, including diverse real-world and synthetic scenarios. TDBench consists of visual question-answer pairs across ten evaluation dimensions of image understanding. Moreover, we conduct four case studies that commonly happen in real-world scenarios but are less explored. By revealing the strengths and limitations of existing VLM through evaluation results, we hope TDBench to provide insights for motivating future research.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sebastian Barros</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid proliferation of generative AI has led to an internet increasingly populated with synthetic content-text, images, audio, and video generated without human intervention. As the distinction between human and AI-generated data blurs, the ability to verify content origin becomes critical for applications ranging from social media and journalism to legal and financial systems.
  In this paper, we propose a conceptual, multi-layer architectural framework that enables telecommunications networks to act as infrastructure level certifiers of human-originated content. By leveraging identity anchoring at the physical layer, metadata propagation at the network and transport layers, and cryptographic attestations at the session and application layers, Telcos can provide an end-to-end Proof of Humanity for data traversing their networks.
  We outline how each OSI layer can contribute to this trust fabric using technical primitives such as SIM/eSIM identity, digital signatures, behavior-based ML heuristics, and edge-validated APIs. The framework is presented as a foundation for future implementation, highlighting monetization pathways for telcos such as trust-as-a-service APIs, origin-certified traffic tiers, and regulatory compliance tools.
  The paper does not present implementation or benchmarking results but offers a technically detailed roadmap and strategic rationale for transforming Telcos into validators of digital authenticity in an AI-dominated internet. Security, privacy, and adversarial considerations are discussed as directions for future work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shijie Ma, Fei Zhu, Xu-Yao Zhang, Cheng-Lin Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Generalized category discovery (GCD) is a pragmatic but underexplored problem, which requires models to automatically cluster and discover novel categories by leveraging the labeled samples from old classes. The challenge is that unlabeled data contain both old and new classes. Early works leveraging pseudo-labeling with parametric classifiers handle old and new classes separately, which brings about imbalanced accuracy between them. Recent methods employing contrastive learning neglect potential positives and are decoupled from the clustering objective, leading to biased representations and sub-optimal results. To address these issues, we introduce a unified and unbiased prototype learning framework, namely ProtoGCD, wherein old and new classes are modeled with joint prototypes and unified learning objectives, {enabling unified modeling between old and new classes}. Specifically, we propose a dual-level adaptive pseudo-labeling mechanism to mitigate confirmation bias, together with two regularization terms to collectively help learn more suitable representations for GCD. Moreover, for practical considerations, we devise a criterion to estimate the number of new classes. Furthermore, we extend ProtoGCD to detect unseen outliers, achieving task-level unification. Comprehensive experiments show that ProtoGCD achieves state-of-the-art performance on both generic and fine-grained datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/mashijie1028/ProtoGCD.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs)-powered AI agents exhibit a high level of autonomy in addressing medical and healthcare challenges. With the ability to access various tools, they can operate within an open-ended action space. However, with the increase in autonomy and ability, unforeseen risks also arise. In this work, we investigated one particular risk, i.e., cyber attack vulnerability of medical AI agents, as agents have access to the Internet through web browsing tools. We revealed that through adversarial prompts embedded on webpages, cyberattackers can: i) inject false information into the agent's response; ii) they can force the agent to manipulate recommendation (e.g., healthcare products and services); iii) the attacker can also steal historical conversations between the user and agent, resulting in the leak of sensitive/private medical information; iv) furthermore, the targeted agent can also cause a computer system hijack by returning a malicious URL in its response. Different backbone LLMs were examined, and we found such cyber attacks can succeed in agents powered by most mainstream LLMs, with the reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1 being the most vulnerable.</p>

<p>Abstract: Resistive In-Memory Computing (RIMC) offers ultra-efficient computation for edge AI but faces accuracy degradation due to RRAM conductance drift over time. Traditional retraining methods are limited by RRAM's high energy consumption, write latency, and endurance constraints. We propose a DoRA-based calibration framework that restores accuracy by compensating influential weights with minimal calibration parameters stored in SRAM, leaving RRAM weights untouched. This eliminates in-field RRAM writes, ensuring energy-efficient, fast, and reliable calibration. Experiments on RIMC-based ResNet50 (ImageNet-1K) demonstrate 69.53% accuracy restoration using just 10 calibration samples while updating only 2.34% of parameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Brandon Radosevich, John Halloran</p>
<p>Abstract: To reduce development overhead and enable seamless integration between potential components comprising any given generative AI application, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) (Anthropic, 2024) has recently been released and subsequently widely adopted. The MCP is an open protocol that standardizes API calls to large language models (LLMs), data sources, and agentic tools. By connecting multiple MCP servers, each defined with a set of tools, resources, and prompts, users are able to define automated workflows fully driven by LLMs. However, we show that the current MCP design carries a wide range of security risks for end users. In particular, we demonstrate that industry-leading LLMs may be coerced into using MCP tools to compromise an AI developer's system through various attacks, such as malicious code execution, remote access control, and credential theft. To proactively mitigate these and related attacks, we introduce a safety auditing tool, MCPSafetyScanner, the first agentic tool to assess the security of an arbitrary MCP server. MCPScanner uses several agents to (a) automatically determine adversarial samples given an MCP server's tools and resources; (b) search for related vulnerabilities and remediations based on those samples; and (c) generate a security report detailing all findings. Our work highlights serious security issues with general-purpose agentic workflows while also providing a proactive tool to audit MCP server safety and address detected vulnerabilities before deployment.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Nian, Shenzhe Zhu, Yuehan Qin, Li Li, Ziyi Wang, Chaowei Xiao, Yue Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language tasks but also pose significant risks of generating harmful content, particularly through jailbreak attacks. Jailbreak attacks refer to intentional manipulations that bypass safety mechanisms in models, leading to the generation of inappropriate or unsafe content. Detecting such attacks is critical to ensuring the responsible deployment of MLLMs. Existing jailbreak detection methods face three primary challenges: (1) Many rely on model hidden states or gradients, limiting their applicability to white-box models, where the internal workings of the model are accessible; (2) They involve high computational overhead from uncertainty-based analysis, which limits real-time detection, and (3) They require fully labeled harmful datasets, which are often scarce in real-world settings. To address these issues, we introduce a test-time adaptive framework called JAILDAM. Our method leverages a memory-based approach guided by policy-driven unsafe knowledge representations, eliminating the need for explicit exposure to harmful data. By dynamically updating unsafe knowledge during test-time, our framework improves generalization to unseen jailbreak strategies while maintaining efficiency. Experiments on multiple VLM jailbreak benchmarks demonstrate that JAILDAM delivers state-of-the-art performance in harmful content detection, improving both accuracy and speed.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qian Chen, Xingjian Dong, Zhike Peng, Guang Meng</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite significant progress in intelligent fault diagnosis (IFD), the lack of interpretability remains a critical barrier to practical industrial applications, driving the growth of interpretability research in IFD. Post-hoc interpretability has gained popularity due to its ability to preserve network flexibility and scalability without modifying model structures. However, these methods often yield suboptimal time-domain explanations. Recently, combining domain transform with SHAP has improved interpretability by extending explanations to more informative domains. Nonetheless, the computational expense of SHAP, exacerbated by increased dimensions from domain transforms, remains a major challenge. To address this, we propose patch-wise attribution and SHapley Estimated Explanation (SHEP). Patch-wise attribution reduces feature dimensions at the cost of explanation granularity, while SHEP simplifies subset enumeration to approximate SHAP, reducing complexity from exponential to linear. Together, these methods significantly enhance SHAP's computational efficiency, providing feasibility for real-time interpretation in monitoring tasks. Extensive experiments confirm SHEP's efficiency, interpretability, and reliability in approximating SHAP. Additionally, with open-source code, SHEP has the potential to serve as a benchmark for post-hoc interpretability in IFD. The code is available on https://github.com/ChenQian0618/SHEP.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Giulio Malenza, Francesco Targa, Adriano Marques Garcia, Marco Aldinucci, Robert Birke</p>
<p>Abstract: In today's era of rapid technological advancement, artificial intelligence (AI) applications require large-scale, high-performance, and data-intensive computations, leading to significant energy demands. Addressing this challenge necessitates a combined approach involving both hardware and software innovations. Hardware manufacturers are developing new, efficient, and specialized solutions, with the RISC-V architecture emerging as a prominent player due to its open, extensible, and energy-efficient instruction set architecture (ISA). Simultaneously, software developers are creating new algorithms and frameworks, yet their energy efficiency often remains unclear. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive benchmark analysis of machine learning (ML) applications on the 64-core SOPHON SG2042 RISC-V architecture. We specifically analyze the energy consumption of deep learning inference models across three leading AI frameworks: PyTorch, ONNX Runtime, and TensorFlow. Our findings show that frameworks using the XNNPACK back-end, such as ONNX Runtime and TensorFlow, consume less energy compared to PyTorch, which is compiled with the native OpenBLAS back-end.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weiqing Li, Guochao Jiang, Xiangyong Ding, Zhangcheng Tao, Chuzhan Hao, Chenfeng Xu, Yuewei Zhang, Hao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Disaggregated inference has become an essential framework that separates the prefill (P) and decode (D) stages in large language model inference to improve throughput. However, the KV cache transfer faces significant delays between prefill and decode nodes. The block-wise calling method and discontinuous KV cache memory allocation increase the number of calls to the transmission kernel. Additionally, existing frameworks often fix the roles of P and D nodes, leading to computational imbalances. In this paper, we propose FlowKV, a novel disaggregated inference framework, which reduces the average transmission latency of KV cache by 96%, from 0.944s to 0.053s, almost eliminating the transfer time relative to the total request latency by optimizing the KV cache transfer. FlowKV introduces the Load-Aware Scheduler for balanced request scheduling and flexible PD node allocation. This design maximizes hardware resource utilization, achieving peak system throughput across various scenarios, including normal, computational imbalance, and extreme overload conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that FlowKV significantly accelerates inference by 15.2%-48.9% on LongBench dataset compared to the baseline and supports applications with heterogeneous GPUs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huam Ming Ken, Mehran Behjati</p>
<p>Abstract: The escalation of urban air pollution necessitates innovative solutions for real-time air quality monitoring and prediction. This paper introduces a novel TinyML-based system designed to predict ozone concentration in real-time. The system employs an Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense microcontroller equipped with an MQ7 sensor for carbon monoxide (CO) detection and built-in sensors for temperature and pressure measurements. The data, sourced from a Kaggle dataset on air quality parameters from India, underwent thorough cleaning and preprocessing. Model training and evaluation were performed using Edge Impulse, considering various combinations of input parameters (CO, temperature, and pressure). The optimal model, incorporating all three variables, achieved a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.03 and an R-squared value of 0.95, indicating high predictive accuracy. The regression model was deployed on the microcontroller via the Arduino IDE, showcasing robust real-time performance. Sensitivity analysis identified CO levels as the most critical predictor of ozone concentration, followed by pressure and temperature. The system's low-cost and low-power design makes it suitable for widespread implementation, particularly in resource-constrained settings. This TinyML approach provides precise real-time predictions of ozone levels, enabling prompt responses to pollution events and enhancing public health protection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hussain Jagirdar, Rukma Talwadker, Aditya Pareek, Pulkit Agrawal, Tridib Mukherjee</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-variate Time Series (MTS) forecasting has made large strides (with very negligible errors) through recent advancements in neural networks, e.g., Transformers. However, in critical situations like predicting gaming overindulgence that affects one's mental well-being; an accurate forecast without a contributing evidence (explanation) is irrelevant. Hence, it becomes important that the forecasts are Interpretable - intermediate representation of the forecasted trajectory is comprehensible; as well as Explainable - attentive input features and events are accessible for a personalized and timely intervention of players at risk. While the contributing state of the art research on interpretability primarily focuses on temporally-smooth single-process driven time series data, our online multi-player gameplay data demonstrates intractable temporal randomness due to intrinsic orthogonality between player's game outcome and their intent to engage further. We introduce a novel deep Actionable Forecasting Network (AFN), which addresses the inter-dependent challenges associated with three exclusive objectives - 1) forecasting accuracy; 2) smooth comprehensible trajectory and 3) explanations via multi-dimensional input features while tackling the challenges introduced by our non-smooth temporal data, together in one single solution. AFN establishes a \it{new benchmark} via: (i) achieving 25% improvement on the MSE of the forecasts on player data in comparison to the SOM-VAE based SOTA networks; (ii) attributing unfavourable progression of a player's time series to a specific future time step(s), with the premise of eliminating near-future overindulgent player volume by over 18% with player specific actionable inputs feature(s) and (iii) proactively detecting over 23% (100% jump from SOTA) of the to-be overindulgent, players on an average, 4 weeks in advance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyuan Li, Jindong Wang, Mathias Funk, Aaqib Saeed</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Active Learning (FAL) has emerged as a promising framework to leverage large quantities of unlabeled data across distributed clients while preserving data privacy. However, real-world deployments remain limited by high annotation costs and communication-intensive sampling processes, particularly in a cross-silo setting, when clients possess substantial local datasets. This paper addresses the crucial question: What is the best practice to reduce communication costs in human-in-the-loop learning with minimal annotator effort? Existing FAL methods typically rely on iterative annotation processes that separate active sampling from federated updates, leading to multiple rounds of expensive communication and annotation. In response, we introduce FAST, a two-pass FAL framework that harnesses foundation models for weak labeling in a preliminary pass, followed by a refinement pass focused exclusively on the most uncertain samples. By leveraging representation knowledge from foundation models and integrating refinement steps into a streamlined workflow, FAST substantially reduces the overhead incurred by iterative active sampling. Extensive experiments on diverse medical and natural image benchmarks demonstrate that FAST outperforms existing FAL methods by an average of 4.36% while reducing communication rounds eightfold under a limited 5% labeling budget.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kai Ye, Hongyi Zhou, Jin Zhu, Francesco Quinzan, Chengchung Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a key technique for aligning the output of large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. To learn the reward function, most existing RLHF algorithms use the Bradley-Terry model, which relies on assumptions about human preferences that may not reflect the complexity and variability of real-world judgments. In this paper, we propose a robust algorithm to enhance the performance of existing approaches under such reward model misspecifications. Theoretically, our algorithm reduces the variance of reward and policy estimators, leading to improved regret bounds. Empirical evaluations on LLM benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm consistently outperforms existing methods, with 77-81% of responses being favored over baselines on the Anthropic Helpful and Harmless dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xintong Wang, Haihan Nan, Ruidong Li, Huaming Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurately predicting spatio-temporal network traffic is essential for dynamically managing computing resources in modern communication systems and minimizing energy consumption. Although spatio-temporal traffic prediction has received extensive research attention, further improvements in prediction accuracy and computational efficiency remain necessary. In particular, existing decomposition-based methods or hybrid architectures often incur heavy overhead when capturing local and global feature correlations, necessitating novel approaches that optimize accuracy and complexity. In this paper, we propose an efficient spatio-temporal network traffic prediction framework, DP-LET, which consists of a data processing module, a local feature enhancement module, and a Transformer-based prediction module. The data processing module is designed for high-efficiency denoising of network data and spatial decoupling. In contrast, the local feature enhancement module leverages multiple Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) to capture fine-grained local features. Meanwhile, the prediction module utilizes a Transformer encoder to model long-term dependencies and assess feature relevance. A case study on real-world cellular traffic prediction demonstrates the practicality of DP-LET, which maintains low computational complexity while achieving state-of-the-art performance, significantly reducing MSE by 31.8% and MAE by 23.1% compared to baseline models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Particle Accelerators are high power complex machines. To ensure uninterrupted operation of these machines, thousands of pieces of equipment need to be synchronized, which requires addressing many challenges including design, optimization and control, anomaly detection and machine protection. With recent advancements, Machine Learning (ML) holds promise to assist in more advance prognostics, optimization, and control. While ML based solutions have been developed for several applications in particle accelerators, only few have reached deployment and even fewer to long term usage, due to particle accelerator data distribution drifts caused by changes in both measurable and non-measurable parameters. In this paper, we identify some of the key areas within particle accelerators where continual learning can allow maintenance of ML model performance with distribution drifts. Particularly, we first discuss existing applications of ML in particle accelerators, and their limitations due to distribution drift. Next, we review existing continual learning techniques and investigate their potential applications to address data distribution drifts in accelerators. By identifying the opportunities and challenges in applying continual learning, this paper seeks to open up the new field and inspire more research efforts towards deployable continual learning for particle accelerators.</p>

<p>Abstract: As large language models continue to scale, their growing computational and storage demands pose significant challenges for real-world deployment. In this work, we investigate redundancy within Transformer-based models and propose an entropy-based pruning strategy to enhance efficiency while maintaining performance. Empirical analysis reveals that the entropy of hidden representations decreases in the early blocks but progressively increases across most subsequent blocks. This trend suggests that entropy serves as a more effective measure of information richness within computation blocks. Unlike cosine similarity, which primarily captures geometric relationships, entropy directly quantifies uncertainty and information content, making it a more reliable criterion for pruning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our entropy-based pruning approach surpasses cosine similarity-based methods in reducing model size while preserving accuracy, offering a promising direction for efficient model deployment.</p>

<p>Abstract: The population of older adults is steadily increasing, with a strong preference for aging-in-place rather than moving to care facilities. Consequently, supporting this growing demographic has become a significant global challenge. However, facilitating successful aging-in-place is challenging, requiring consideration of multiple factors such as data privacy, health status monitoring, and living environments to improve health outcomes. In this paper, we propose an unobtrusive sensor system designed for installation in older adults' homes. Using data from the sensors, our system constructs a digital twin, a virtual representation of events and activities that occurred in the home. The system uses neural network models and decision rules to capture residents' activities and living environments. This digital twin enables continuous health monitoring by providing actionable insights into residents' well-being. Our system is designed to be low-cost and privacy-preserving, with the aim of providing green and safe monitoring for the health of older adults. We have successfully deployed our system in two homes over a time period of two months, and our findings demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of digital twin technology in supporting independent living for older adults. This study highlights that our system could revolutionize elder care by enabling personalized interventions, such as lifestyle adjustments, medical treatments, or modifications to the residential environment, to enhance health outcomes.</p>

<p>Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables policy training solely on pre-collected data, avoiding direct environment interaction - a crucial benefit for energy-constrained embodied AI applications. Although Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)-based methods perform well in offline RL, their high computational and energy demands motivate exploration of more efficient alternatives. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) show promise for such tasks, given their low power consumption. In this work, we introduce DSFormer, the first spike-driven transformer model designed to tackle offline RL via sequence modeling. Unlike existing SNN transformers focused on spatial dimensions for vision tasks, we develop Temporal Spiking Self-Attention (TSSA) and Positional Spiking Self-Attention (PSSA) in DSFormer to capture the temporal and positional dependencies essential for sequence modeling in RL. Additionally, we propose Progressive Threshold-dependent Batch Normalization (PTBN), which combines the benefits of LayerNorm and BatchNorm to preserve temporal dependencies while maintaining the spiking nature of SNNs. Comprehensive results in the D4RL benchmark show DSFormer's superiority over both SNN and ANN counterparts, achieving 78.4% energy savings, highlighting DSFormer's advantages not only in energy efficiency but also in competitive performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruhui Zhang, Hezhe Qiao, Pengcheng Xu, Mingsheng Shang, Lin Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-label Recognition (MLR) involves assigning multiple labels to each data instance in an image, offering advantages over single-label classification in complex scenarios. However, it faces the challenge of annotating all relevant categories, often leading to uncertain annotations, such as unseen or incomplete labels. Recent Vision and Language Pre-training (VLP) based methods have made significant progress in tackling zero-shot MLR tasks by leveraging rich vision-language correlations. However, the correlation between multi-label semantics has not been fully explored, and the learned visual features often lack essential semantic information. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a Semantic-guided Representation Learning approach (SigRL) that enables the model to learn effective visual and textual representations, thereby improving the downstream alignment of visual images and categories. Specifically, we first introduce a graph-based multi-label correlation module (GMC) to facilitate information exchange between labels, enriching the semantic representation across the multi-label texts. Next, we propose a Semantic Visual Feature Reconstruction module (SVFR) to enhance the semantic information in the visual representation by integrating the learned textual representation during reconstruction. Finally, we optimize the image-text matching capability of the VLP model using both local and global features to achieve zero-shot MLR. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on several MLR benchmarks, encompassing both zero-shot MLR (with unseen labels) and single positive multi-label learning (with limited labels), demonstrating the superior performance of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods.

<p>Abstract: Our main contribution is the introduction of the map of elections framework. A map of elections consists of three main elements: (1) a dataset of elections (i.e., collections of ordinal votes over given sets of candidates), (2) a way of measuring similarities between these elections, and (3) a representation of the elections in the 2D Euclidean space as points, so that the more similar two elections are, the closer are their points. In our maps, we mostly focus on datasets of synthetic elections, but we also show an example of a map over real-life ones. To measure similarities, we would have preferred to use, e.g., the isomorphic swap distance, but this is infeasible due to its high computational complexity. Hence, we propose polynomial-time computable positionwise distance and use it instead. Regarding the representations in 2D Euclidean space, we mostly use the Kamada-Kawai algorithm, but we also show two alternatives. We develop the necessary theoretical results to form our maps and argue experimentally that they are accurate and credible. Further, we show how coloring the elections in a map according to various criteria helps in analyzing results of a number of experiments. In particular, we show colorings according to the scores of winning candidates or committees, running times of ILP-based winner determination algorithms, and approximation ratios achieved by particular algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Grgur Kova\v{c}, J\'er\'emy Perez, R\'emy Portelas, Peter Ford Dominey, Pierre-Yves Oudeyer</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly contributing to the creation of content on the Internet. This creates a feedback loop as subsequent generations of models will be trained on this generated, synthetic data. This phenomenon is receiving increasing interest, in particular because previous studies have shown that it may lead to distribution shift - models misrepresent and forget the true underlying distributions of human data they are expected to approximate (e.g. resulting in a drastic loss of quality). In this study, we study the impact of human data properties on distribution shift dynamics in iterated training loops. We first confirm that the distribution shift dynamics greatly vary depending on the human data by comparing four datasets (two based on Twitter and two on Reddit). We then test whether data quality may influence the rate of this shift. We find that it does on the twitter, but not on the Reddit datasets. We then focus on a Reddit dataset and conduct a more exhaustive evaluation of a large set of dataset properties. This experiment associated lexical diversity with larger, and semantic diversity with smaller detrimental shifts, suggesting that incorporating text with high lexical (but limited semantic) diversity could exacerbate the degradation of generated text. We then focus on the evolution of political bias, and find that the type of shift observed (bias reduction, amplification or inversion) depends on the political lean of the human (true) distribution. Overall, our work extends the existing literature on the consequences of recursive fine-tuning by showing that this phenomenon is highly dependent on features of the human data on which training occurs. This suggests that different parts of internet (e.g. GitHub, Reddit) may undergo different types of shift depending on their properties.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammed Adil Yatkin, Mihkel Korgesaar, Jani Romanoff, Umit Islak, Hasan Kurban</p>
<p>Abstract: Current neural network (NN) models can learn patterns from data points with historical dependence. Specifically, in natural language processing (NLP), sequential learning has transitioned from recurrence-based architectures to transformer-based architectures. However, it is unknown which NN architectures will perform the best on datasets containing deformation history due to mechanical loading. Thus, this study ascertains the appropriateness of 1D-convolutional, recurrent, and transformer-based architectures for predicting deformation localization based on the earlier states in the form of deformation history. Following this investigation, the crucial incompatibility issues between the mathematical computation of the prediction process in the best-performing NN architectures and the actual values derived from the natural physical properties of the deformation paths are examined in detail.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lisa P. Argyle, Ethan C. Busby, Joshua R. Gubler, Bryce Hepner, Alex Lyman, David Wingate</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative large language models (LLMs) are incredibly useful, versatile, and promising tools. However, they will be of most use to political and social science researchers when they are used in a way that advances understanding about real human behaviors and concerns. To promote the scientific use of LLMs, we suggest that researchers in the political and social sciences need to remain focused on the scientific goal of inference. To this end, we discuss the challenges and opportunities related to scientific inference with LLMs, using validation of model output as an illustrative case for discussion. We propose a set of guidelines related to establishing the failure and success of LLMs when completing particular tasks, and discuss how we can make inferences from these observations. We conclude with a discussion of how this refocus will improve the accumulation of shared scientific knowledge about these tools and their uses in the social sciences.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ved Umrajkar, Aakash Kumar Singh</p>
<p>Abstract: Tree-Ring Watermarking is a significant technique for authenticating AI-generated images. However, its effectiveness in rectified flow-based models remains unexplored, particularly given the inherent challenges of these models with noise latent inversion. Through extensive experimentation, we evaluated and compared the detection and separability of watermarks between SD 2.1 and FLUX.1-dev models. By analyzing various text guidance configurations and augmentation attacks, we demonstrate how inversion limitations affect both watermark recovery and the statistical separation between watermarked and unwatermarked images. Our findings provide valuable insights into the current limitations of Tree-Ring Watermarking in the current SOTA models and highlight the critical need for improved inversion methods to achieve reliable watermark detection and separability.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Keegan Harris</p>
<p>Abstract: Motivated by recent improvements in generative AI and wearable camera devices (e.g. smart glasses and AI-enabled pins), I investigate the ability of foundation models to learn about the wearer's personal life through first-person camera data. To test this, I wore a camera headset for 54 hours over the course of a week, generated summaries of various lengths (e.g. minute-long, hour-long, and day-long summaries), and fine-tuned both GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini on the resulting summary hierarchy. By querying the fine-tuned models, we are able to learn what the models learned about me. The results are mixed: Both models learned basic information about me (e.g. approximate age, gender). Moreover, GPT-4o correctly deduced that I live in Pittsburgh, am a PhD student at CMU, am right-handed, and have a pet cat. However, both models also suffered from hallucination and would make up names for the individuals present in the video footage of my life.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiabo Shi, Yehia Elkhatib</p>
<p>Abstract: The benefits of Deep Learning (DL) impose significant pressure on GPU resources, particularly within GPU cluster, where Out-Of-Memory (OOM) errors present a primary impediment to model training and efficient resource utilization. Conventional OOM estimation techniques, relying either on static graph analysis or direct GPU memory profiling, suffer from inherent limitations: static analysis often fails to capture model dynamics, whereas GPU-based profiling intensifies contention for scarce GPU resources. To overcome these constraints, VeritasEst emerges. It is an innovative, entirely CPU-based analysis tool capable of accurately predicting the peak GPU memory required for DL training tasks without accessing the target GPU. This "offline" prediction capability is core advantage of VeritasEst, allowing accurate memory footprint information to be obtained before task scheduling, thereby effectively preventing OOM and optimizing GPU allocation. Its performance was validated through thousands of experimental runs across convolutional neural network (CNN) models: Compared to baseline GPU memory estimators, VeritasEst significantly reduces the relative error by 84% and lowers the estimation failure probability by 73%. VeritasEst represents a key step towards efficient and predictable DL training in resource-constrained environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: As AI chatbots see increased adoption and integration into everyday life, questions have been raised about the potential impact of human-like or anthropomorphic AI on users. In this work, we investigate the extent to which interactions with ChatGPT (with a focus on Advanced Voice Mode) may impact users' emotional well-being, behaviors and experiences through two parallel studies. To study the affective use of AI chatbots, we perform large-scale automated analysis of ChatGPT platform usage in a privacy-preserving manner, analyzing over 3 million conversations for affective cues and surveying over 4,000 users on their perceptions of ChatGPT. To investigate whether there is a relationship between model usage and emotional well-being, we conduct an Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved randomized controlled trial (RCT) on close to 1,000 participants over 28 days, examining changes in their emotional well-being as they interact with ChatGPT under different experimental settings. In both on-platform data analysis and the RCT, we observe that very high usage correlates with increased self-reported indicators of dependence. From our RCT, we find that the impact of voice-based interactions on emotional well-being to be highly nuanced, and influenced by factors such as the user's initial emotional state and total usage duration. Overall, our analysis reveals that a small number of users are responsible for a disproportionate share of the most affective cues.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haiqing Li, Yuzhi Guo, Feng Jiang, Qifeng Zhou, Hehuan Ma, Junzhou Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Scoliosis is a spinal curvature disorder that is difficult to detect early and can compress the chest cavity, impacting respiratory function and cardiac health. Especially for adolescents, delayed detection and treatment result in worsening compression. Traditional scoliosis detection methods heavily rely on clinical expertise, and X-ray imaging poses radiation risks, limiting large-scale early screening. We propose an Attention-Guided Deep Multi-Instance Learning method (Gait-MIL) to effectively capture discriminative features from gait patterns, which is inspired by ScoNet-MT's pioneering use of gait patterns for scoliosis detection. We evaluate our method on the first large-scale dataset based on gait patterns for scoliosis classification. The results demonstrate that our study improves the performance of using gait as a biomarker for scoliosis detection, significantly enhances detection accuracy for the particularly challenging Neutral cases, where subtle indicators are often overlooked. Our Gait-MIL also performs robustly in imbalanced scenarios, making it a promising tool for large-scale scoliosis screening.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rufei Ma, Chao Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) technology infers heart rate by capturing subtle color changes in facial skin
  using a camera, demonstrating great potential in non-contact heart rate measurement. However, measurement
  accuracy significantly decreases in complex scenarios such as lighting changes and head movements compared
  to ideal laboratory conditions. Existing deep learning models often neglect the quantification of measurement
  uncertainty, limiting their credibility in dynamic scenes. To address the issue of insufficient rPPG measurement
  reliability in complex scenarios, this paper introduces Bayesian neural networks to the rPPG field for the first time,
  proposing the Robust Fusion Bayesian Physiological Network (RF-BayesPhysNet), which can model both aleatoric
  and epistemic uncertainty. It leverages variational inference to balance accuracy and computational efficiency.
  Due to the current lack of uncertainty estimation metrics in the rPPG field, this paper also proposes a new set of
  methods, using Spearman correlation coefficient, prediction interval coverage, and confidence interval width, to
  measure the effectiveness of uncertainty estimation methods under different noise conditions. Experiments show
  that the model, with only double the parameters compared to traditional network models, achieves a MAE of 2.56
  on the UBFC-RPPG dataset, surpassing most models. It demonstrates good uncertainty estimation capability
  in no-noise and low-noise conditions, providing prediction confidence and significantly enhancing robustness in
  real-world applications. We have open-sourced the code at https://github.com/AIDC-rPPG/RF-Net</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zixuan Ke, Yifei Ming, Shafiq Joty</p>
<p>Abstract: This tutorial on adaptation of LLMs is designed to address the growing demand for models that go beyond the static capabilities of generic LLMs by providing an overview of dynamic, domain-specific, and task-adaptive LLM adaptation techniques. While general LLMs have demonstrated strong generalization across a variety of tasks, they often struggle to perform well in specialized domains such as finance, healthcare, and code generation for underrepresented languages. Additionally, their static nature limits their ability to evolve with the changing world, and they are often extremely large in size, making them impractical and costly to deploy at scale. As a result, the adaptation of LLMs has drawn much attention since the birth of LLMs and is of core importance, both for industry, which focuses on serving its targeted users, and academia, which can greatly benefit from small but powerful LLMs. To address this gap, this tutorial aims to provide an overview of the LLM adaptation techniques. We start with an introduction to LLM adaptation, from both the data perspective and the model perspective. We then emphasize how the evaluation metrics and benchmarks are different from other techniques. After establishing the problems, we explore various adaptation techniques. We categorize adaptation techniques into two main families. The first is parametric knowledge adaptation, which focuses on updating the parametric knowledge within LLMs. Additionally, we will discuss real-time adaptation techniques, including model editing, which allows LLMs to be updated dynamically in production environments. The second kind of adaptation is semi-parametric knowledge adaptation, where the goal is to update LLM parameters to better leverage external knowledge or tools through techniques like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and agent-based systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mahsa Bazzaz, Seth Cooper</p>
<p>Abstract: Procedural content generation via machine learning (PCGML) in games involves using machine learning techniques to create game content such as maps and levels. 2D tile-based game levels have consistently served as a standard dataset for PCGML because they are a simplified version of game levels while maintaining the specific constraints typical of games, such as being solvable. In this work, we highlight the unique characteristics of game levels, including their structured discrete data nature, the local and global constraints inherent in the games, and the sensitivity of the game levels to small changes in input. We define the robustness of data as a measure of sensitivity to small changes in input that cause a change in output, and we use this measure to analyze and compare these levels to state-of-the-art machine learning datasets, showcasing the subtle differences in their nature. We also constructed a large dataset from four games inspired by popular classic tile-based games that showcase these characteristics and address the challenge of sparse data in PCGML by providing a significantly larger dataset than those currently available.</p>

<p>Abstract: Envy-freeness up to any good (EFX) is a popular and important fairness property in the fair allocation of indivisible goods, of which its existence in general is still an open question. In this work, we investigate the problem of determining the minimum number of EFX allocations for a given instance, arguing that this approach may yield valuable insights into the existence and computation of EFX allocations. We focus on restricted instances where the number of goods slightly exceeds the number of agents, and extend our analysis to weighted EFX (WEFX) and a novel variant of EFX for general monotone valuations, termed EFX+. In doing so, we identify the transition threshold for the existence of allocations satisfying these fairness notions. Notably, we resolve open problems regarding WEFX by proving polynomial-time computability under binary additive valuations, and establishing the first constant-factor approximation for two agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arash Sajjadi, Mark Eramian</p>
<p>Abstract: TGraphX presents a novel paradigm in deep learning by unifying convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with graph neural networks (GNNs) to enhance visual reasoning tasks. Traditional CNNs excel at extracting rich spatial features from images but lack the inherent capability to model inter-object relationships. Conversely, conventional GNNs typically rely on flattened node features, thereby discarding vital spatial details. TGraphX overcomes these limitations by employing CNNs to generate multi-dimensional node features (e.g., (3*128*128) tensors) that preserve local spatial semantics. These spatially aware nodes participate in a graph where message passing is performed using 1*1 convolutions, which fuse adjacent features while maintaining their structure. Furthermore, a deep CNN aggregator with residual connections is used to robustly refine the fused messages, ensuring stable gradient flow and end-to-end trainability. Our approach not only bridges the gap between spatial feature extraction and relational reasoning but also demonstrates significant improvements in object detection refinement and ensemble reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinling Yu, Ziyue Liu, Hai Li, Yixing Li, Xin Ai, Zhiyu Zeng, Ian Young, Zheng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Thermal analysis is crucial in three-dimensional integrated circuit (3D-IC) design due to increased power density and complex heat dissipation paths. Although operator learning frameworks such as DeepOHeat have demonstrated promising preliminary results in accelerating thermal simulation, they face critical limitations in prediction capability for multi-scale thermal patterns, training efficiency, and trustworthiness of results during design optimization. This paper presents DeepOHeat-v1, an enhanced physics-informed operator learning framework that addresses these challenges through three key innovations. First, we integrate Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks with learnable activation functions as trunk networks, enabling an adaptive representation of multi-scale thermal patterns. This approach achieves a $1.25\times$ and $6.29\times$ reduction in error in two representative test cases. Second, we introduce a separable training method that decomposes the basis function along the coordinate axes, achieving $62\times$ training speedup and $31\times$ GPU memory reduction in our baseline case, and enabling thermal analysis at resolutions previously infeasible due to GPU memory constraints. Third, we propose a confidence score to evaluate the trustworthiness of the predicted results, and further develop a hybrid optimization workflow that combines operator learning with finite difference (FD) using Generalized Minimal Residual (GMRES) method for incremental solution refinement, enabling efficient and trustworthy thermal optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that DeepOHeat-v1 achieves accuracy comparable to optimization using high-fidelity finite difference solvers, while speeding up the entire optimization process by $70.6\times$ in our test cases, effectively minimizing the peak temperature through optimal placement of heat-generating components.</p>

<p>Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Learning Management Systems (LMSs) has the potential to enhance task automation and accessibility in education. However, hallucination where LLMs generate inaccurate or misleading information remains a significant challenge. This study introduces the Dynamic Course Content Integration (DCCI) mechanism, which dynamically retrieves and integrates course content and curriculum from Canvas LMS into the LLM-powered assistant, Ask ME. By employing prompt engineering to structure retrieved content within the LLM's context window, DCCI ensures accuracy, relevance, and contextual alignment, mitigating hallucination. To evaluate DCCI's effectiveness, Ask ME's usability, and broader student perceptions of AI in education, a mixed-methods approach was employed, incorporating user satisfaction ratings and a structured survey. Results from a pilot study indicate high user satisfaction (4.614/5), with students recognizing Ask ME's ability to provide timely and contextually relevant responses for both administrative and course-related inquiries. Additionally, a majority of students agreed that Ask ME's integration with course content in Canvas LMS reduced platform-switching, improving usability, engagement, and comprehension. AI's role in reducing classroom hesitation and fostering self-directed learning and intellectual curiosity was also highlighted. Despite these benefits and positive perception of AI tools, concerns emerged regarding over-reliance on AI, accuracy limitations, and ethical issues such as plagiarism and reduced student-teacher interaction. These findings emphasize the need for strategic AI implementation, ethical safeguards, and a pedagogical framework that prioritizes human-AI collaboration over substitution.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce VideoComp, a benchmark and learning framework for advancing video-text compositionality understanding, aimed at improving vision-language models (VLMs) in fine-grained temporal alignment. Unlike existing benchmarks focused on static image-text compositionality or isolated single-event videos, our benchmark targets alignment in continuous multi-event videos. Leveraging video-text datasets with temporally localized event captions (e.g. ActivityNet-Captions, YouCook2), we construct two compositional benchmarks, ActivityNet-Comp and YouCook2-Comp. We create challenging negative samples with subtle temporal disruptions such as reordering, action word replacement, partial captioning, and combined disruptions. These benchmarks comprehensively test models' compositional sensitivity across extended, cohesive video-text sequences. To improve model performance, we propose a hierarchical pairwise preference loss that strengthens alignment with temporally accurate pairs and gradually penalizes increasingly disrupted ones, encouraging fine-grained compositional learning. To mitigate the limited availability of densely annotated video data, we introduce a pretraining strategy that concatenates short video-caption pairs to simulate multi-event sequences. We evaluate video-text foundational models and large multimodal models (LMMs) on our benchmark, identifying both strengths and areas for improvement in compositionality. Overall, our work provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating and enhancing model capabilities in achieving fine-grained, temporally coherent video-text alignment.</p>

<p>Abstract: LLMs have gained immense popularity among researchers and the general public for its impressive capabilities on a variety of tasks. Notably, the efficacy of LLMs remains significantly dependent on the quality and structure of the input prompts, making prompt design a critical factor for their performance. Recent advancements in automated prompt optimization have introduced diverse techniques that automatically enhance prompts to better align model outputs with user expectations. However, these methods often suffer from the lack of standardization and compatibility across different techniques, limited flexibility in customization, inconsistent performance across model scales, and they often exclusively rely on expensive proprietary LLM APIs. To fill in this gap, we introduce GREATERPROMPT, a novel framework that democratizes prompt optimization by unifying diverse methods under a unified, customizable API while delivering highly effective prompts for different tasks. Our framework flexibly accommodates various model scales by leveraging both text feedback-based optimization for larger LLMs and internal gradient-based optimization for smaller models to achieve powerful and precise prompt improvements. Moreover, we provide a user-friendly Web UI that ensures accessibility for non-expert users, enabling broader adoption and enhanced performance across various user groups and application scenarios.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francesco De Santis, Gabriele Ciravegna, Philippe Bich, Danilo Giordano, Tania Cerquitelli</p>
<p>Abstract: Concept-based eXplainable AI (C-XAI) is a rapidly growing research field that enhances AI model interpretability by leveraging intermediate, human-understandable concepts. This approach not only enhances model transparency but also enables human intervention, allowing users to interact with these concepts to refine and improve the model's performance. Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) explicitly predict concepts before making final decisions, enabling interventions to correct misclassified concepts. While CBMs remain effective in Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) settings with intervention, they struggle to match the performance of black-box models. Concept Embedding Models (CEMs) address this by learning concept embeddings from both concept predictions and input data, enhancing In-Distribution (ID) accuracy but reducing the effectiveness of interventions, especially in OOD scenarios. In this work, we propose the Variational Concept Embedding Model (V-CEM), which leverages variational inference to improve intervention responsiveness in CEMs. We evaluated our model on various textual and visual datasets in terms of ID performance, intervention responsiveness in both ID and OOD settings, and Concept Representation Cohesiveness (CRC), a metric we propose to assess the quality of the concept embedding representations. The results demonstrate that V-CEM retains CEM-level ID performance while achieving intervention effectiveness similar to CBM in OOD settings, effectively reducing the gap between interpretability (intervention) and generalization (performance).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gabriel Shimanuki, Alexandre Nascimento, Lucio Vismari, Joao Camargo Jr, Jorge Almeida Jr, Paulo Cugnasca</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) aim to improve traffic safety and efficiency by reducing human error. However, ensuring AVs reliability and safety is a challenging task when rare, high-risk traffic scenarios are considered. These 'Corner Cases' (CC) scenarios, such as unexpected vehicle maneuvers or sudden pedestrian crossings, must be safely and reliable dealt by AVs during their operations. But they arehard to be efficiently generated. Traditional CC generation relies on costly and risky real-world data acquisition, limiting scalability, and slowing research and development progress. Simulation-based techniques also face challenges, as modeling diverse scenarios and capturing all possible CCs is complex and time-consuming. To address these limitations in CC generation, this research introduces CORTEX-AVD, CORner Case Testing & EXploration for Autonomous Vehicles Development, an open-source framework that integrates the CARLA Simulator and Scenic to automatically generate CC from textual descriptions, increasing the diversity and automation of scenario modeling. Genetic Algorithms (GA) are used to optimize the scenario parameters in six case study scenarios, increasing the occurrence of high-risk events. Unlike previous methods, CORTEX-AVD incorporates a multi-factor fitness function that considers variables such as distance, time, speed, and collision likelihood. Additionally, the study provides a benchmark for comparing GA-based CC generation methods, contributing to a more standardized evaluation of synthetic data generation and scenario assessment. Experimental results demonstrate that the CORTEX-AVD framework significantly increases CC incidence while reducing the proportion of wasted simulations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siddharth Srikanth, Varun Bhatt, Boshen Zhang, Werner Hager, Charles Michael Lewis, Katia P. Sycara, Aaquib Tabrez, Stefanos Nikolaidis</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding how humans collaborate and communicate in teams is essential for improving human-agent teaming and AI-assisted decision-making. However, relying solely on data from large-scale user studies is impractical due to logistical, ethical, and practical constraints, necessitating synthetic models of multiple diverse human behaviors. Recently, agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to emulate human-like behavior in social settings. But, obtaining a large set of diverse behaviors requires manual effort in the form of designing prompts. On the other hand, Quality Diversity (QD) optimization has been shown to be capable of generating diverse Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent behavior. In this work, we combine QD optimization with LLM-powered agents to iteratively search for prompts that generate diverse team behavior in a long-horizon, multi-step collaborative environment. We first show, through a human-subjects experiment (n=54 participants), that humans exhibit diverse coordination and communication behavior in this domain. We then show that our approach can effectively replicate trends from human teaming data and also capture behaviors that are not easily observed without collecting large amounts of data. Our findings highlight the combination of QD and LLM-powered agents as an effective tool for studying teaming and communication strategies in multi-agent collaboration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad El-Mahdy, Nourhan Sakr, Rodrigo Carrasco</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel reinforcement learning (RL) approach to scheduling mixed-criticality (MC) systems on processors with varying speeds. Building upon the foundation laid by [1], we extend their work to address the non-preemptive scheduling problem, which is known to be NP-hard. By modeling this scheduling challenge as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), we develop an RL agent capable of generating near-optimal schedules for real-time MC systems. Our RL-based scheduler prioritizes high-critical tasks while maintaining overall system performance.
  Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of our approach. The RL scheduler significantly improves task completion rates, achieving around 80% overall and 85% for high-criticality tasks across 100,000 instances of synthetic data and real data under varying system conditions. Moreover, under stable conditions without degradation, the scheduler achieves 94% overall task completion and 93% for high-criticality tasks. These results highlight the potential of RL-based schedulers in real-time and safety-critical applications, offering substantial improvements in handling complex and dynamic scheduling scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chuang Yang, Xu Han, Tao Han, Han Han, Bingxuan Zhao, Qi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Pursuing efficient text shape representations helps scene text detection models focus on compact foreground regions and optimize the contour reconstruction steps to simplify the whole detection pipeline. Current approaches either represent irregular shapes via box-to-polygon strategy or decomposing a contour into pieces for fitting gradually, the deficiency of coarse contours or complex pipelines always exists in these models. Considering the above issues, we introduce EdgeText to fit text contours compactly while alleviating excessive contour rebuilding processes. Concretely, it is observed that the two long edges of texts can be regarded as smooth curves. It allows us to build contours via continuous and smooth edges that cover text regions tightly instead of fitting piecewise, which helps avoid the two limitations in current models. Inspired by this observation, EdgeText formulates the text representation as the edge approximation problem via parameterized curve fitting functions. In the inference stage, our model starts with locating text centers, and then creating curve functions for approximating text edges relying on the points. Meanwhile, truncation points are determined based on the location features. In the end, extracting curve segments from curve functions by using the pixel coordinate information brought by truncation points to reconstruct text contours. Furthermore, considering the deep dependency of EdgeText on text edges, a bilateral enhanced perception (BEP) module is designed. It encourages our model to pay attention to the recognition of edge features. Additionally, to accelerate the learning of the curve function parameters, we introduce a proportional integral loss (PI-loss) to force the proposed model to focus on the curve distribution and avoid being disturbed by text scales.</p>

<p>Abstract: Transformer-based foundation models have emerged as a dominant paradigm in time series analysis, offering unprecedented capabilities in tasks such as forecasting, anomaly detection, classification, trend analysis and many more time series analytical tasks. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of the art pre-trained foundation models, introducing a novel taxonomy to categorize them across several dimensions. Specifically, we classify models by their architecture design, distinguishing between those leveraging patch-based representations and those operating directly on raw sequences. The taxonomy further includes whether the models provide probabilistic or deterministic predictions, and whether they are designed to work with univariate time series or can handle multivariate time series out of the box. Additionally, the taxonomy encompasses model scale and complexity, highlighting differences between lightweight architectures and large-scale foundation models. A unique aspect of this survey is its categorization by the type of objective function employed during training phase. By synthesizing these perspectives, this survey serves as a resource for researchers and practitioners, providing insights into current trends and identifying promising directions for future research in transformer-based time series modeling.</p>

<p>Abstract: A language model's ability to reflect on its own reasoning provides a key advantage for solving complex problems. While most recent research has focused on how this ability develops during reinforcement learning, we show that it actually begins to emerge much earlier - during the model's pre-training. To study this, we introduce deliberate errors into chains-of-thought and test whether the model can still arrive at the correct answer by recognizing and correcting these mistakes. By tracking performance across different stages of pre-training, we observe that this self-correcting ability appears early and improves steadily over time. For instance, an OLMo2-7B model pre-trained on 4 trillion tokens displays self-correction on our six self-reflection tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shintaro Shiba, Yoshimitsu Aoki, Guillermo Gallego</p>
<p>Abstract: Event cameras are emerging vision sensors, whose noise is challenging to characterize. Existing denoising methods for event cameras consider other tasks such as motion estimation separately (i.e., sequentially after denoising). However, motion is an intrinsic part of event data, since scene edges cannot be sensed without motion. This work proposes, to the best of our knowledge, the first method that simultaneously estimates motion in its various forms (e.g., ego-motion, optical flow) and noise. The method is flexible, as it allows replacing the 1-step motion estimation of the widely-used Contrast Maximization framework with any other motion estimator, such as deep neural networks. The experiments show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on the E-MLB denoising benchmark and competitive results on the DND21 benchmark, while showing its efficacy on motion estimation and intensity reconstruction tasks. We believe that the proposed approach contributes to strengthening the theory of event-data denoising, as well as impacting practical denoising use-cases, as we release the code upon acceptance.

<p>Abstract: Complex data mining has wide application value in many fields, especially in the feature extraction and classification tasks of unlabeled data. This paper proposes an algorithm based on self-supervised learning and verifies its effectiveness through experiments. The study found that in terms of the selection of optimizer and learning rate, the combination of AdamW optimizer and 0.002 learning rate performed best in all evaluation indicators, indicating that the adaptive optimization method can improve the performance of the model in complex data mining tasks. In addition, the ablation experiment further analyzed the contribution of each module. The results show that contrastive learning, variational modules, and data augmentation strategies play a key role in the generalization ability and robustness of the model. Through the convergence curve analysis of the loss function, the experiment verifies that the method can converge stably during the training process and effectively avoid serious overfitting. Further experimental results show that the model has strong adaptability on different data sets, can effectively extract high-quality features from unlabeled data, and improves classification accuracy. At the same time, under different data distribution conditions, the method can still maintain high detection accuracy, proving its applicability in complex data environments. This study analyzed the role of self-supervised learning methods in complex data mining through systematic experiments and verified its advantages in improving feature extraction quality, optimizing classification performance, and enhancing model stability</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoran Li, Jingfeng Wu, Vladimir Braverman</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the statistical performance of a continual learning problem with two linear regression tasks in a well-specified random design setting. We consider a structural regularization algorithm that incorporates a generalized $\ell_2$-regularization tailored to the Hessian of the previous task for mitigating catastrophic forgetting. We establish upper and lower bounds on the joint excess risk for this algorithm. Our analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off between memory complexity and statistical efficiency, where memory complexity is measured by the number of vectors needed to define the structural regularization. Specifically, increasing the number of vectors in structural regularization leads to a worse memory complexity but an improved excess risk, and vice versa. Furthermore, our theory suggests that naive continual learning without regularization suffers from catastrophic forgetting, while structural regularization mitigates this issue. Notably, structural regularization achieves comparable performance to joint training with access to both tasks simultaneously. These results highlight the critical role of curvature-aware regularization for continual learning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Computational pathology, analyzing whole slide images for automated cancer diagnosis, relies on the multiple instance learning framework where performance heavily depends on the feature extractor and aggregator. Recent Pathology Foundation Models (PFMs), pretrained on large-scale histopathology data, have significantly enhanced capabilities of extractors and aggregators but lack systematic analysis frameworks. This survey presents a hierarchical taxonomy organizing PFMs through a top-down philosophy that can be utilized to analyze FMs in any domain: model scope, model pretraining, and model design. Additionally, we systematically categorize PFM evaluation tasks into slide-level, patch-level, multimodal, and biological tasks, providing comprehensive benchmarking criteria. Our analysis identifies critical challenges in both PFM development (pathology-specific methodology, end-to-end pretraining, data-model scalability) and utilization (effective adaptation, model maintenance), paving the way for future directions in this promising field.

<p>Abstract: Generative models have driven significant progress in a variety of AI tasks, including text-to-video generation, where models like Video LDM and Stable Video Diffusion can produce realistic, movie-level videos from textual instructions. Despite these advances, current text-to-video models still face fundamental challenges in reliably following human commands, particularly in adhering to simple numerical constraints. In this work, we present T2VCountBench, a specialized benchmark aiming at evaluating the counting capability of SOTA text-to-video models as of 2025. Our benchmark employs rigorous human evaluations to measure the number of generated objects and covers a diverse range of generators, covering both open-source and commercial models. Extensive experiments reveal that all existing models struggle with basic numerical tasks, almost always failing to generate videos with an object count of 9 or fewer. Furthermore, our comprehensive ablation studies explore how factors like video style, temporal dynamics, and multilingual inputs may influence counting performance. We also explore prompt refinement techniques and demonstrate that decomposing the task into smaller subtasks does not easily alleviate these limitations. Our findings highlight important challenges in current text-to-video generation and provide insights for future research aimed at improving adherence to basic numerical constraints.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youn-Yeol Yu, Jeongwhan Choi, Jaehyeon Park, Kookjin Lee, Noseong Park</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, data-driven simulators based on graph neural networks have gained attention in modeling physical systems on unstructured meshes. However, they struggle with long-range dependencies in fluid flows, particularly in refined mesh regions. This challenge, known as the 'over-squashing' problem, hinders information propagation. While existing graph rewiring methods address this issue to some extent, they only consider graph topology, overlooking the underlying physical phenomena. We propose Physics-Informed Ollivier-Ricci Flow (PIORF), a novel rewiring method that combines physical correlations with graph topology. PIORF uses Ollivier-Ricci curvature (ORC) to identify bottleneck regions and connects these areas with nodes in high-velocity gradient nodes, enabling long-range interactions and mitigating over-squashing. Our approach is computationally efficient in rewiring edges and can scale to larger simulations. Experimental results on 3 fluid dynamics benchmark datasets show that PIORF consistently outperforms baseline models and existing rewiring methods, achieving up to 26.2 improvement.</p>

<p>Abstract: Autonomous exploration in unknown environments is a critical challenge in robotics, particularly for applications such as indoor navigation, search and rescue, and service robotics. Traditional exploration strategies, such as frontier-based methods, often struggle to efficiently utilize prior knowledge of structural regularities in indoor spaces. To address this limitation, we propose Mapping at First Sense, a lightweight neural network-based approach that predicts unobserved areas in local maps, thereby enhancing exploration efficiency. The core of our method, SenseMapNet, integrates convolutional and transformerbased architectures to infer occluded regions while maintaining computational efficiency for real-time deployment on resourceconstrained robots. Additionally, we introduce SenseMapDataset, a curated dataset constructed from KTH and HouseExpo environments, which facilitates training and evaluation of neural models for indoor exploration. Experimental results demonstrate that SenseMapNet achieves an SSIM (structural similarity) of 0.78, LPIPS (perceptual quality) of 0.68, and an FID (feature distribution alignment) of 239.79, outperforming conventional methods in map reconstruction quality. Compared to traditional frontier-based exploration, our method reduces exploration time by 46.5% (from 2335.56s to 1248.68s) while maintaining a high coverage rate (88%) and achieving a reconstruction accuracy of 88%. The proposed method represents a promising step toward efficient, learning-driven robotic exploration in structured environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: As autonomous agents become more powerful and widely used, it is becoming increasingly important to ensure they behave safely and stay aligned with system goals, especially in multi-agent settings. Current systems often rely on agents self-monitoring or correcting issues after the fact, but they lack mechanisms for real-time oversight. This paper introduces the Enforcement Agent (EA) Framework, which embeds dedicated supervisory agents into the environment to monitor others, detect misbehavior, and intervene through real-time correction. We implement this framework in a custom drone simulation and evaluate it across 90 episodes using 0, 1, and 2 EA configurations. Results show that adding EAs significantly improves system safety: success rates rise from 0.0% with no EA to 7.4% with one EA and 26.7% with two EAs. The system also demonstrates increased operational longevity and higher rates of malicious drone reformation. These findings highlight the potential of lightweight, real-time supervision for enhancing alignment and resilience in multi-agent systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Document image segmentation is crucial for document analysis and recognition but remains challenging due to the diversity of document formats and segmentation tasks. Existing methods often address these tasks separately, resulting in limited generalization and resource wastage. This paper introduces DocSAM, a transformer-based unified framework designed for various document image segmentation tasks, such as document layout analysis, multi-granularity text segmentation, and table structure recognition, by modelling these tasks as a combination of instance and semantic segmentation. Specifically, DocSAM employs Sentence-BERT to map category names from each dataset into semantic queries that match the dimensionality of instance queries. These two sets of queries interact through an attention mechanism and are cross-attended with image features to predict instance and semantic segmentation masks. Instance categories are predicted by computing the dot product between instance and semantic queries, followed by softmax normalization of scores. Consequently, DocSAM can be jointly trained on heterogeneous datasets, enhancing robustness and generalization while reducing computational and storage resources. Comprehensive evaluations show that DocSAM surpasses existing methods in accuracy, efficiency, and adaptability, highlighting its potential for advancing document image understanding and segmentation across various applications.

<p>Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models have demonstrated remarkable performance across various tasks; however, the challenge of hallucinations constrains their practical applications. The hallucination problem arises from multiple factors, including the inherent hallucinations in language models, the limitations of visual encoders in perception, and biases introduced by multimodal data. Extensive research has explored ways to mitigate hallucinations. For instance, OPERA prevents the model from overly focusing on "anchor tokens", thereby reducing hallucinations, whereas VCD mitigates hallucinations by employing a contrastive decoding approach. In this paper, we investigate the correlation between the decay of attention to image tokens and the occurrence of hallucinations. Based on this finding, we propose Temporal Attention Real-time Accumulative Connection (TARAC), a novel training-free method that dynamically accumulates and updates LVLMs' attention on image tokens during generation. By enhancing the model's attention to image tokens, TARAC mitigates hallucinations caused by the decay of attention on image tokens. We validate the effectiveness of TARAC across multiple models and datasets, demonstrating that our approach substantially mitigates hallucinations. In particular, TARAC reduces $C_S$ by 25.2 and $C_I$ by 8.7 compared to VCD on the CHAIR benchmark.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generating human videos from a single image while ensuring high visual quality and precise control is a challenging task, especially in complex scenarios involving multiple individuals and interactions with objects. Existing methods, while effective for single-human cases, often fail to handle the intricacies of multi-identity interactions because they struggle to associate the correct pairs of human appearance and pose condition and model the distribution of 3D-aware dynamics. To address these limitations, we present Structural Video Diffusion, a novel framework designed for generating realistic multi-human videos. Our approach introduces two core innovations: identity-specific embeddings to maintain consistent appearances across individuals and a structural learning mechanism that incorporates depth and surface-normal cues to model human-object interactions. Additionally, we expand existing human video dataset with 25K new videos featuring diverse multi-human and object interaction scenarios, providing a robust foundation for training. Experimental results demonstrate that Structural Video Diffusion achieves superior performance in generating lifelike, coherent videos for multiple subjects with dynamic and rich interactions, advancing the state of human-centric video generation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Soil macronutrients, particularly potassium ions (K$^+$), are indispensable for plant health, underpinning various physiological and biological processes, and facilitating the management of both biotic and abiotic stresses. Deficient macronutrient content results in stunted growth, delayed maturation, and increased vulnerability to environmental stressors, thereby accentuating the imperative for precise soil nutrient monitoring. Traditional techniques such as chemical assays, atomic absorption spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy, and electrochemical methods, albeit advanced, are prohibitively expensive and time-intensive, thus unsuitable for real-time macronutrient assessment. In this study, we propose an innovative soil testing protocol utilizing a dataset derived from synthetic solutions to model soil behaviour. The dataset encompasses physical properties including conductivity and pH, with a concentration on three key macronutrients: nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K). Four machine learning algorithms were applied to the dataset, with random forest regressors and neural networks being selected for the prediction of soil nutrient concentrations. Comparative analysis with laboratory soil testing results revealed prediction errors of 23.6% for phosphorus and 16% for potassium using the random forest model, and 26.3% for phosphorus and 21.8% for potassium using the neural network model. This methodology illustrates a cost-effective and efficacious strategy for real-time soil nutrient monitoring, offering substantial advancements over conventional techniques and enhancing the capability to sustain optimal nutrient levels conducive to robust crop growth.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yidong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The Needle In A Haystack (NIAH) task has been widely used to evaluate the long-context question-answering capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, its reliance on simple retrieval limits its effectiveness. To address this limitation, recent studies have introduced the Multiple Needles In A Haystack Reasoning (MNIAH-R) task, which incorporates supporting documents (Multiple needles) of multi-hop reasoning tasks into a distracting context (Haystack}). Despite this advancement, existing approaches still fail to address the issue of models providing direct answers from internal knowledge, and they do not explain or mitigate the decline in accuracy as context length increases. In this paper, we tackle the memory-based answering problem by filtering out direct-answer questions, and we reveal that performance degradation is primarily driven by the reduction in the length of the thinking process as the input length increases. Building on this insight, we decompose the thinking process into retrieval and reasoning stages and introduce a reflection mechanism for multi-round extension. We also train a model using the generated iterative thinking process, which helps mitigate the performance degradation. Furthermore, we demonstrate the application of this retrieval-reflection capability in mathematical reasoning scenarios, improving GPT-4o's performance on AIME2024.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jimmy Wang, Thomas Zollo, Richard Zemel, Hongseok Namkoong</p>
<p>Abstract: Eliciting information to reduce uncertainty about a latent entity is a critical task in many application domains, e.g., assessing individual student learning outcomes, diagnosing underlying diseases, or learning user preferences. Though natural language is a powerful medium for this purpose, large language models (LLMs) and existing fine-tuning algorithms lack mechanisms for strategically gathering information to refine their own understanding of the latent entity. To harness the generalization power and world knowledge of LLMs in developing effective information-gathering strategies, we propose an adaptive elicitation framework that actively reduces uncertainty on the latent entity. Since probabilistic modeling of an abstract latent entity is difficult, our framework adopts a predictive view of uncertainty, using a meta-learned language model to simulate future observations and enable scalable uncertainty quantification over complex natural language. Through autoregressive forward simulation, our model quantifies how new questions reduce epistemic uncertainty, enabling the development of sophisticated information-gathering strategies to choose the most informative next queries. In experiments on the 20 questions game, dynamic opinion polling, and adaptive student assessment, our method consistently outperforms baselines in identifying critical unknowns and improving downstream predictions, illustrating the promise of strategic information gathering in natural language settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vishnu Kabir Chhabra, Mohammad Mahdi Khalili</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models has spurred significant interest in model compression as a means to enhance their accessibility and practicality. While extensive research has explored model compression through the lens of safety, findings suggest that safety-aligned models often lose elements of trustworthiness post-compression. Simultaneously, the field of mechanistic interpretability has gained traction, with notable discoveries, such as the identification of a single direction in the residual stream mediating refusal behaviors across diverse model architectures. In this work, we investigate the safety of compressed models by examining the mechanisms of refusal, adopting a novel interpretability-driven perspective to evaluate model safety. Furthermore, leveraging insights from our interpretability analysis, we propose a lightweight, computationally efficient method to enhance the safety of compressed models without compromising their performance or utility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyu Cui, Xinjie Lin, Sijia Li, Miao Chen, Qilei Yin, Qi Li, Ke Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning (ML) powered network traffic analysis has been widely used for the purpose of threat detection. Unfortunately, their generalization across different tasks and unseen data is very limited. Large language models (LLMs), known for their strong generalization capabilities, have shown promising performance in various domains. However, their application to the traffic analysis domain is limited due to significantly different characteristics of network traffic. To address the issue, in this paper, we propose TrafficLLM, which introduces a dual-stage fine-tuning framework to learn generic traffic representation from heterogeneous raw traffic data. The framework uses traffic-domain tokenization, dual-stage tuning pipeline, and extensible adaptation to help LLM release generalization ability on dynamic traffic analysis tasks, such that it enables traffic detection and traffic generation across a wide range of downstream tasks. We evaluate TrafficLLM across 10 distinct scenarios and 229 types of traffic. TrafficLLM achieves F1-scores of 0.9875 and 0.9483, with up to 80.12% and 33.92% better performance than existing detection and generation methods. It also shows strong generalization on unseen traffic with an 18.6% performance improvement. We further evaluate TrafficLLM in real-world scenarios. The results confirm that TrafficLLM is easy to scale and achieves accurate detection performance on enterprise traffic.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuheng Wu, Wentao Guo, Zirui Liu, Heng Ji, Zhaozhuo Xu, Denghui Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates the emergence of Theory-of-Mind (ToM) capabilities in large language models (LLMs) from a mechanistic perspective, focusing on the role of extremely sparse parameter patterns. We introduce a novel method to identify ToM-sensitive parameters and reveal that perturbing as little as 0.001% of these parameters significantly degrades ToM performance while also impairing contextual localization and language understanding. To understand this effect, we analyze their interaction with core architectural components of LLMs. Our findings demonstrate that these sensitive parameters are closely linked to the positional encoding module, particularly in models using Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), where perturbations disrupt dominant-frequency activations critical for contextual processing. Furthermore, we show that perturbing ToM-sensitive parameters affects LLM's attention mechanism by modulating the angle between queries and keys under positional encoding. These insights provide a deeper understanding of how LLMs acquire social reasoning abilities, bridging AI interpretability with cognitive science. Our results have implications for enhancing model alignment, mitigating biases, and improving AI systems designed for human interaction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chandan Sharma, Rakshith GB, Ajay Kumar Patel, Dhanus M Lal, Darshan Patel, Ragesh Hajela, Masahiro Doteguchi, Priyanka Sharma</p>
<p>Abstract: The evolution of ARM-based architectures, particularly those incorporating Scalable Vector Extension (SVE), has introduced transformative opportunities for high-performance computing (HPC) and machine learning (ML) workloads. The Unified Acceleration Foundation's (UXL) oneAPI Data Analytics Library (oneDAL) is a widely adopted library for accelerating ML and data analytics workflows, but its reliance on Intel's proprietary Math Kernel Library (MKL) has traditionally limited its compatibility to x86platforms. This paper details the porting of oneDAL to ARM architectures with SVE support, using OpenBLAS as an alternative backend to overcome architectural and performance challenges. Beyond porting, the research introduces novel ARM-specific optimizations, including custom sparse matrix routines, vectorized statistical functions, and a Scalable Vector Extension (SVE)-optimized Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. The SVM enhancements leverage SVE's flexible vector lengths and predicate driven execution, achieving notable performance gains of 22% for the Boser method and 5% for the Thunder method. Benchmarks conducted on ARM SVE-enabled AWSGraviton3 instances showcase up to 200x acceleration in ML training and inference tasks compared to the original scikit-learn implementation on the ARM platform. Moreover, the ARM-optimized oneDAL achieves performance parity with, and in some cases exceeds, the x86 oneDAL implementation (MKL backend) on IceLake x86 systems, which are nearly twice as costly as AWSGraviton3 ARM instances. These findings highlight ARM's potential as a high-performance, energyefficient platform for dataintensive ML applications. By expanding cross-architecture compatibility and contributing to the opensource ecosystem, this work reinforces ARM's position as a competitive alternative in the HPC and ML domains, paving the way for future advancements in dataintensive computing.</p>

<p>Abstract: The design of AI systems to assist human decision-making typically requires the availability of labels to train and evaluate supervised models. Frequently, however, these labels are unknown, and different ways of estimating them involve unverifiable assumptions or arbitrary choices. In this work, we introduce the concept of label indeterminacy and derive important implications in high-stakes AI-assisted decision-making. We present an empirical study in a healthcare context, focusing specifically on predicting the recovery of comatose patients after resuscitation from cardiac arrest. Our study shows that label indeterminacy can result in models that perform similarly when evaluated on patients with known labels, but vary drastically in their predictions for patients where labels are unknown. After demonstrating crucial ethical implications of label indeterminacy in this high-stakes context, we discuss takeaways for evaluation, reporting, and design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Avijit Saha Asru, Hamed Khosravi, Imtiaz Ahmed, Abdullahil Azeem</p>
<p>Abstract: Discovering novel materials with desired properties is essential for driving innovation. Industry 4.0 and smart manufacturing have promised transformative advances in this area through real-time data integration and automated production planning and control. However, the reliance on automation alone has often fallen short, lacking the flexibility needed for complex processes. To fully unlock the potential of smart manufacturing, we must evolve from automation to autonomous systems that go beyond rigid programming and can dynamically optimize the search for solutions. Current discovery approaches are often slow, requiring numerous trials to find optimal combinations, and costly, particularly when optimizing multiple properties simultaneously. This paper proposes a Bayesian multi-objective sequential decision-making (BMSDM) framework that can intelligently select experiments as manufacturing progresses, guiding us toward the discovery of optimal design faster and more efficiently. The framework leverages sequential learning through Bayesian Optimization, which iteratively refines a statistical model representing the underlying manufacturing process. This statistical model acts as a surrogate, allowing for efficient exploration and optimization without requiring numerous real-world experiments. This approach can significantly reduce the time and cost of data collection required by traditional experimental designs. The proposed framework is compared with traditional DoE methods and two other multi-objective optimization methods. Using a manufacturing dataset, we evaluate and compare the performance of these approaches across five evaluation metrics. BMSDM comprehensively outperforms the competing methods in multi-objective decision-making scenarios. Our proposed approach represents a significant leap forward in creating an intelligent autonomous platform capable of novel material discovery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kesav Kaza, Jerome Le Ny, Aditya Mahajan</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of optimal decision referrals in human-automation teams performing binary classification tasks. The automation, which includes a pre-trained classifier, observes data for a batch of independent tasks, analyzes them, and may refer a subset of tasks to a human operator for fresh and final analysis. Our key modeling assumption is that human performance degrades with task load. We model the problem of choosing which tasks to refer as a stochastic optimization problem and show that, for a given task load, it is optimal to myopically refer tasks that yield the largest reduction in expected cost, conditional on the observed data. This provides a ranking scheme and a policy to determine the optimal set of tasks for referral. We evaluate this policy against a baseline through an experimental study with human participants. Using a radar screen simulator, participants made binary target classification decisions under time constraint. They were guided by a decision rule provided to them, but were still prone to errors under time pressure. An initial experiment estimated human performance model parameters, while a second experiment compared two referral policies. Results show statistically significant gains for the proposed optimal referral policy over a blind policy that determines referrals using the automation and human-performance models but not based on the observed data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Osama Zeeshan, Marco Pedersoli, Alessandro Lameiras Koerich, Eric Grange</p>
<p>Abstract: Personalized facial expression recognition (FER) involves adapting a machine learning model using samples from labeled sources and unlabeled target domains. Given the challenges of recognizing subtle expressions with considerable interpersonal variability, state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods focus on the multi-source UDA (MSDA) setting, where each domain corresponds to a specific subject, and improve model accuracy and robustness. However, when adapting to a specific target, the diverse nature of multiple source domains translates to a large shift between source and target data. State-of-the-art MSDA methods for FER address this domain shift by considering all the sources to adapt to the target representations. Nevertheless, adapting to a target subject presents significant challenges due to large distributional differences between source and target domains, often resulting in negative transfer. In addition, integrating all sources simultaneously increases computational costs and causes misalignment with the target. To address these issues, we propose a progressive MSDA approach that gradually introduces information from subjects based on their similarity to the target subject. This will ensure that only the most relevant sources from the target are selected, which helps avoid the negative transfer caused by dissimilar sources. We first exploit the closest sources to reduce the distribution shift with the target and then move towards the furthest while only considering the most relevant sources based on the predetermined threshold. Furthermore, to mitigate catastrophic forgetting caused by the incremental introduction of source subjects, we implemented a density-based memory mechanism that preserves the most relevant historical source samples for adaptation. Our experiments show the effectiveness of our proposed method on pain datasets: Biovid and UNBC-McMaster.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marimuthu Kalimuthu, David Holzm\"uller, Mathias Niepert</p>
<p>Abstract: Modeling high-frequency information is a critical challenge in scientific machine learning. For instance, fully turbulent flow simulations of Navier-Stokes equations at Reynolds numbers 3500 and above can generate high-frequency signals due to swirling fluid motions caused by eddies and vortices. Faithfully modeling such signals using neural networks depends on accurately reconstructing moderate to high frequencies. However, it has been well known that deep neural nets exhibit the so-called spectral bias toward learning low-frequency components. Meanwhile, Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) have emerged as a popular class of data-driven models in recent years for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) and for surrogate modeling in general. Although impressive results have been achieved on several PDE benchmark problems, FNOs often perform poorly in learning non-dominant frequencies characterized by local features. This limitation stems from the spectral bias inherent in neural networks and the explicit exclusion of high-frequency modes in FNOs and their variants. Therefore, to mitigate these issues and improve FNO's spectral learning capabilities to represent a broad range of frequency components, we propose two key architectural enhancements: (i) a parallel branch performing local spectral convolutions (ii) a high-frequency propagation module. Moreover, we propose a novel frequency-sensitive loss term based on radially binned spectral errors. This introduction of a parallel branch for local convolutions reduces number of trainable parameters by up to 50% while achieving the accuracy of baseline FNO that relies solely on global convolutions. Experiments on three challenging PDE problems in fluid mechanics and biological pattern formation, and the qualitative and spectral analysis of predictions show the effectiveness of our method over the state-of-the-art neural operator baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marios Kokkodis, Richard Demsyn-Jones, Vijay Raghavan</p>
<p>Abstract: Are traditional classification approaches irrelevant in this era of AI hype? We show that there are multiclass classification problems where predictive models holistically outperform LLM prompt-based frameworks. Given text and images from home-service project descriptions provided by Thumbtack customers, we build embeddings-based softmax models that predict the professional category (e.g., handyman, bathroom remodeling) associated with each problem description. We then compare against prompts that ask state-of-the-art LLM models to solve the same problem. We find that the embeddings approach outperforms the best LLM prompts in terms of accuracy, calibration, latency, and financial cost. In particular, the embeddings approach has 49.5% higher accuracy than the prompting approach, and its superiority is consistent across text-only, image-only, and text-image problem descriptions. Furthermore, it yields well-calibrated probabilities, which we later use as confidence signals to provide contextualized user experience during deployment. On the contrary, prompting scores are overly uninformative. Finally, the embeddings approach is 14 and 81 times faster than prompting in processing images and text respectively, while under realistic deployment assumptions, it can be up to 10 times cheaper. Based on these results, we deployed a variation of the embeddings approach, and through A/B testing we observed performance consistent with our offline analysis. Our study shows that for multiclass classification problems that can leverage proprietary datasets, an embeddings-based approach may yield unequivocally better results. Hence, scientists, practitioners, engineers, and business leaders can use our study to go beyond the hype and consider appropriate predictive models for their classification use cases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiao Lin, Zhichen Zeng, Tianxin Wei, Zhining Liu, Yuzhong chen, Hanghang Tong</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) leverages labeled source data to train models for unlabeled target data. Given the prevalence of multivariate time series (MTS) data across various domains, the UDA task for MTS classification has emerged as a critical challenge. However, for MTS data, correlations between variables often vary across domains, whereas most existing UDA works for MTS classification have overlooked this essential characteristic. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel domain shift, {\em correlation shift}, measuring domain differences in multivariate correlation. To mitigate correlation shift, we propose a scalable and parameter-efficient \underline{C}orrelation \underline{A}dapter for M\underline{TS} (CATS). Designed as a plug-and-play technique compatible with various Transformer variants, CATS employs temporal convolution to capture local temporal patterns and a graph attention module to model the changing multivariate correlation. The adapter reweights the target correlations to align the source correlations with a theoretically guaranteed precision. A correlation alignment loss is further proposed to mitigate correlation shift, bypassing the alignment challenge from the non-i.i.d. nature of MTS data. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that (1) compared with vanilla Transformer-based models, CATS increases over $10\%$ average accuracy while only adding around $1\%$ parameters, and (2) all Transformer variants equipped with CATS either reach or surpass state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have led to the increase of conversational agents like Replika, designed to provide social interaction and emotional support. However, reports of these AI systems engaging in inappropriate sexual behaviors with users have raised significant concerns. In this study, we conducted a thematic analysis of user reviews from the Google Play Store to investigate instances of sexual harassment by the Replika chatbot. From a dataset of 35,105 negative reviews, we identified 800 relevant cases for analysis. Our findings revealed that users frequently experience unsolicited sexual advances, persistent inappropriate behavior, and failures of the chatbot to respect user boundaries. Users expressed feelings of discomfort, violation of privacy, and disappointment, particularly when seeking a platonic or therapeutic AI companion. This study highlights the potential harms associated with AI companions and underscores the need for developers to implement effective safeguards and ethical guidelines to prevent such incidents. By shedding light on user experiences of AI-induced harassment, we contribute to the understanding of AI-related risks and emphasize the importance of corporate responsibility in developing safer and more ethical AI systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the domain of semantic parsing, significant progress has been achieved in Text-to-SQL and question-answering tasks, both of which focus on extracting information from data sources in their native formats. However, the inherent constraints of their formal meaning representations, such as SQL programming language or basic logical forms, hinder their ability to analyze data from various perspectives, such as conducting statistical analyses. To address this limitation and inspire research in this field, we design SIGMA, a new dataset for Text-to-Code semantic parsing with statistical analysis. SIGMA comprises 6000 questions with corresponding Python code labels, spanning across 160 databases. Half of the questions involve query types, which return information in its original format, while the remaining 50% are statistical analysis questions, which perform statistical operations on the data. The Python code labels in our dataset cover 4 types of query types and 40 types of statistical analysis patterns. We evaluated the SIGMA dataset using three different baseline models: LGESQL, SmBoP, and SLSQL. The experimental results show that the LGESQL model with ELECTRA outperforms all other models, achieving 83.37% structure accuracy. In terms of execution accuracy, the SmBoP model, when combined with GraPPa and T5, reaches 76.38%.</p>

<p>Abstract: Linear attention methods offer a compelling alternative to softmax attention due to their efficiency in recurrent decoding. Recent research has focused on enhancing standard linear attention by incorporating gating while retaining its computational benefits. Such Gated Linear Attention (GLA) architectures include competitive models such as Mamba and RWKV. In this work, we investigate the in-context learning capabilities of the GLA model and make the following contributions. We show that a multilayer GLA can implement a general class of Weighted Preconditioned Gradient Descent (WPGD) algorithms with data-dependent weights. These weights are induced by the gating mechanism and the input, enabling the model to control the contribution of individual tokens to prediction. To further understand the mechanics of this weighting, we introduce a novel data model with multitask prompts and characterize the optimization landscape of learning a WPGD algorithm. Under mild conditions, we establish the existence and uniqueness (up to scaling) of a global minimum, corresponding to a unique WPGD solution. Finally, we translate these findings to explore the optimization landscape of GLA and shed light on how gating facilitates context-aware learning and when it is provably better than vanilla linear attention.</p>

<p>Abstract: In today's digital era, the Internet, especially social media platforms, plays a significant role in shaping public opinions, attitudes, and beliefs. Unfortunately, the credibility of scientific information sources is often undermined by the spread of misinformation through various means, including technology-driven tools like bots, cyborgs, trolls, sock-puppets, and deep fakes. This manipulation of public discourse serves antagonistic business agendas and compromises civil society. In response to this challenge, a new scientific discipline has emerged: social cybersecurity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Justin Miller, Tristram Alexander</p>
<p>Abstract: The challenge of clustering short text data lies in balancing informativeness with interpretability. Traditional evaluation metrics often overlook this trade-off. Inspired by linguistic principles of communicative efficiency, this paper investigates the optimal number of clusters by quantifying the trade-off between informativeness and cognitive simplicity. We use large language models (LLMs) to generate cluster names and evaluate their effectiveness through semantic density, information theory, and clustering accuracy. Our results show that Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) clustering on embeddings generated by a LLM, increases semantic density compared to random assignment, effectively grouping similar bios. However, as clusters increase, interpretability declines, as measured by a generative LLM's ability to correctly assign bios based on cluster names. A logistic regression analysis confirms that classification accuracy depends on the semantic similarity between bios and their assigned cluster names, as well as their distinction from alternatives.
  These findings reveal a "Goldilocks zone" where clusters remain distinct yet interpretable. We identify an optimal range of 16-22 clusters, paralleling linguistic efficiency in lexical categorization. These insights inform both theoretical models and practical applications, guiding future research toward optimising cluster interpretability and usefulness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dimitrios Stamoulis, Diana Marculescu</p>
<p>Abstract: Geospatial Copilots hold immense potential for automating Earth observation (EO) and climate monitoring workflows, yet their reliance on large-scale models such as GPT-4o introduces a paradox: tools intended for sustainability studies often incur unsustainable costs. Using agentic AI frameworks in geospatial applications can amass thousands of dollars in API charges or requires expensive, power-intensive GPUs for deployment, creating barriers for researchers, policymakers, and NGOs. Unfortunately, when geospatial Copilots are deployed with open language models (OLMs), performance often degrades due to their dependence on GPT-optimized logic. In this paper, we present Geo-OLM, a tool-augmented geospatial agent that leverages the novel paradigm of state-driven LLM reasoning to decouple task progression from tool calling. By alleviating the workflow reasoning burden, our approach enables low-resource OLMs to complete geospatial tasks more effectively. When downsizing to small models below 7B parameters, Geo-OLM outperforms the strongest prior geospatial baselines by 32.8% in successful query completion rates. Our method performs comparably to proprietary models achieving results within 10% of GPT-4o, while reducing inference costs by two orders of magnitude from \$500-\$1000 to under \$10. We present an in-depth analysis with geospatial downstream benchmarks, providing key insights to help practitioners effectively deploy OLMs for EO applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Quan Shi, Carlos Jimenez, Stephen Dong, Brian Seo, Caden Yao, Adam Kelch, Karthik Narasimhan</p>
<p>Abstract: As language models achieve increasingly human-like capabilities in conversational text generation, a critical question emerges: to what extent can these systems simulate the characteristics of specific individuals? To evaluate this, we introduce IMPersona, a framework for evaluating LMs at impersonating specific individuals' writing style and personal knowledge. Using supervised fine-tuning and a hierarchical memory-inspired retrieval system, we demonstrate that even modestly sized open-source models, such as Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, can achieve impersonation abilities at concerning levels. In blind conversation experiments, participants (mis)identified our fine-tuned models with memory integration as human in 44.44% of interactions, compared to just 25.00% for the best prompting-based approach. We analyze these results to propose detection methods and defense strategies against such impersonation attempts. Our findings raise important questions about both the potential applications and risks of personalized language models, particularly regarding privacy, security, and the ethical deployment of such technologies in real-world contexts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuya Ogasa, Yuki Arase</p>
<p>Abstract: This study tackles token-level hallucination detection in outputs of large language models. Previous studies revealed that attention exhibits irregular patterns when hallucination occurs. Inspired by this, we extract features from the attention matrix that provide complementary views of (a) the average attention each token receives, which helps identify whether certain tokens are overly influential or ignored, (b) the diversity of attention each token receives, which reveals whether attention is biased toward specific subsets, and (c) the diversity of tokens a token attends to during generation, which indicates whether the model references a narrow or broad range of information. These features are input to a Transformer-based classifier to conduct token-level classification to identify hallucinated spans. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms strong baselines on hallucination detection with longer input contexts, i.e., data-to-text and summarization tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cong Sun, Kurt Teichman, Yiliang Zhou, Brian Critelli, David Nauheim, Graham Keir, Xindi Wang, Judy Zhong, Adam E Flanders, George Shih, Yifan Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: In this retrospective study, a dataset was constructed with two parts. The first part included 1,656 synthetic chest radiology reports generated by GPT-4 using specified prompts, with 828 being error-free synthetic reports and 828 containing errors. The second part included 614 reports: 307 error-free reports between 2011 and 2016 from the MIMIC-CXR database and 307 corresponding synthetic reports with errors generated by GPT-4 on the basis of these MIMIC-CXR reports and specified prompts. All errors were categorized into four types: negation, left/right, interval change, and transcription errors. Then, several models, including Llama-3, GPT-4, and BiomedBERT, were refined using zero-shot prompting, few-shot prompting, or fine-tuning strategies. Finally, the performance of these models was evaluated using the F1 score, 95\% confidence interval (CI) and paired-sample t-tests on our constructed dataset, with the prediction results further assessed by radiologists. Using zero-shot prompting, the fine-tuned Llama-3-70B-Instruct model achieved the best performance with the following F1 scores: 0.769 for negation errors, 0.772 for left/right errors, 0.750 for interval change errors, 0.828 for transcription errors, and 0.780 overall. In the real-world evaluation phase, two radiologists reviewed 200 randomly selected reports output by the model. Of these, 99 were confirmed to contain errors detected by the models by both radiologists, and 163 were confirmed to contain model-detected errors by at least one radiologist. Generative LLMs, fine-tuned on synthetic and MIMIC-CXR radiology reports, greatly enhanced error detection in radiology reports.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinyang Li, Sangwon Hyun, M. Ali Babar</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation. However, the quality of the generated code is heavily dependent on the structure and composition of the prompts used. Crafting high-quality prompts is a challenging task that requires significant knowledge and skills of prompt engineering. To advance the automation support for the prompt engineering for LLM-based code generation, we propose a novel solution Diffusion-Driven Prompt Tuning (DDPT) that learns how to generate optimal prompt embedding from Gaussian Noise to automate the prompt engineering for code generation. We evaluate the feasibility of diffusion-based optimization and abstract the optimal prompt embedding as a directional vector toward the optimal embedding. We use the code generation loss given by the LLMs to help the diffusion model capture the distribution of optimal prompt embedding during training. The trained diffusion model can build a path from the noise distribution to the optimal distribution at the sampling phrase, the evaluation result demonstrates that DDPT helps improve the prompt optimization for code generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shenyang Liu, Saleh Almohaimeed, Liqiang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The existing Text-to-SQL models suffer from a shortage of training data, inhibiting their ability to fully facilitate the applications of SQL queries in new domains. To address this challenge, various data synthesis techniques have been employed to generate more diverse and higher quality data. In this paper, we propose REFORMER, a framework that leverages ChatGPT's prowess without the need for additional training, to facilitate the synthesis of (question, SQL query) pairs tailored to new domains. Our data augmentation approach is based on a "retrieve-and-edit" method, where we generate new questions by filling masked question using explanation of SQL queries with the help of ChatGPT. Furthermore, we demonstrate that cycle consistency remains a valuable method of validation when applied appropriately. Our experimental results show that REFORMER consistently outperforms previous data augmentation methods. To further investigate the power of ChatGPT and create a general data augmentation method, we also generate the new data by paraphrasing the question in the dataset and by paraphrasing the description of a new SQL query that is generated by ChatGPT as well. Our results affirm that paraphrasing questions generated by ChatGPT help augment the original data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Claudio Spiess, Mandana Vaziri, Louis Mandel, Martin Hirzel</p>
<p>Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) depends on how they are prompted, with choices spanning both the high-level prompting pattern (e.g., Zero-Shot, CoT, ReAct, ReWOO) and the specific prompt content (instructions and few-shot demonstrations). Manually tuning this combination is tedious, error-prone, and non-transferable across LLMs or tasks. Therefore, this paper proposes AutoPDL, an automated approach to discover good LLM agent configurations. Our method frames this as a structured AutoML problem over a combinatorial space of agentic and non-agentic prompting patterns and demonstrations, using successive halving to efficiently navigate this space. We introduce a library implementing common prompting patterns using the PDL prompt programming language. AutoPDL solutions are human-readable, editable, and executable PDL programs that use this library. This approach also enables source-to-source optimization, allowing human-in-the-loop refinement and reuse. Evaluations across three tasks and six LLMs (ranging from 8B to 70B parameters) show consistent accuracy gains ($9.5\pm17.5$ percentage points), up to 68.9pp, and reveal that selected prompting strategies vary across models and tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sameera K. M., Vinod P., Anderson Rocha, Rafidha Rehiman K. A., Mauro Conti</p>
<p>Abstract: In the era of data expansion, ensuring data privacy has become increasingly critical, posing significant challenges to traditional AI-based applications. In addition, the increasing adoption of IoT devices has introduced significant cybersecurity challenges, making traditional Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) less effective against evolving threats, and privacy concerns and regulatory restrictions limit their deployment. Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising solution, allowing decentralized model training while maintaining data privacy to solve these issues. However, despite implementing privacy-preserving technologies, FL systems remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Furthermore, data distribution among clients is not heterogeneous in the FL scenario. We propose WeiDetect, a two-phase, server-side defense mechanism for FL-based NIDS that detects malicious participants to address these challenges. In the first phase, local models are evaluated using a validation dataset to generate validation scores. These scores are then analyzed using a Weibull distribution, identifying and removing malicious models. We conducted experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach in diverse attack settings. Our evaluation included two popular datasets, CIC-Darknet2020 and CSE-CIC-IDS2018, tested under non-IID data distributions. Our findings highlight that WeiDetect outperforms state-of-the-art defense approaches, improving higher target class recall up to 70% and enhancing the global model's F1 score by 1% to 14%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sabaat Haroon, Ahmad Faraz Khan, Ahmad Humayun, Waris Gill, Abdul Haddi Amjad, Ali R. Butt, Mohammad Taha Khan, Muhammad Ali Gulzar</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in post-development tasks such as code repair and testing. A key factor in these tasks' success is the model's deep understanding of code. However, the extent to which LLMs truly understand code remains largely unevaluated. Quantifying code comprehension is challenging due to its abstract nature and the lack of a standardized metric. Previously, this was assessed through developer surveys, which are not feasible for evaluating LLMs. Existing LLM benchmarks focus primarily on code generation, fundamentally different from code comprehension. Additionally, fixed benchmarks quickly become obsolete as they become part of the training data. This paper presents the first large-scale empirical investigation into LLMs' ability to understand code. Inspired by mutation testing, we use an LLM's fault-finding ability as a proxy for its deep code understanding. This approach is based on the insight that a model capable of identifying subtle functional discrepancies must understand the code well. We inject faults in real-world programs and ask the LLM to localize them, ensuring the specifications suffice for fault localization. Next, we apply semantic-preserving code mutations (SPMs) to the faulty programs and test whether the LLMs still locate the faults, verifying their confidence in code understanding. We evaluate nine popular LLMs on 575000 debugging tasks from 670 Java and 637 Python programs. We find that LLMs lose the ability to debug the same bug in 81% of faulty programs when SPMs are applied, indicating a shallow understanding of code and reliance on features irrelevant to semantics. We also find that LLMs understand code earlier in the program better than later. This suggests that LLMs' code comprehension remains tied to lexical and syntactic features due to tokenization designed for natural languages, which overlooks code semantics.</p>

<p>Abstract: Prompt Recovery, reconstructing prompts from the outputs of large language models (LLMs), has grown in importance as LLMs become ubiquitous. Most users access LLMs through APIs without internal model weights, relying only on outputs and logits, which complicates recovery. This paper explores a unique prompt recovery task focused on reconstructing prompts for style transfer and rephrasing, rather than typical question-answering. We introduce a dataset created with LLM assistance, ensuring quality through multiple techniques, and test methods like zero-shot, few-shot, jailbreak, chain-of-thought, fine-tuning, and a novel canonical-prompt fallback for poor-performing cases. Our results show that one-shot and fine-tuning yield the best outcomes but highlight flaws in traditional sentence similarity metrics for evaluating prompt recovery. Contributions include (1) a benchmark dataset, (2) comprehensive experiments on prompt recovery strategies, and (3) identification of limitations in current evaluation metrics, all of which advance general prompt recovery research, where the structure of the input prompt is unrestricted.</p>

<p>Abstract: Anomaly detection for cyber-physical systems (ADCPS) is crucial in identifying faults and potential attacks by analyzing the time series of sensor measurements and actuator states. However, current methods lack adaptation to data distribution shifts in both temporal and spatial dimensions as cyber-physical systems evolve. To tackle this issue, we propose an incremental meta-learning-based approach, namely iADCPS, which can continuously update the model through limited evolving normal samples to reconcile the distribution gap between evolving and historical time series. Specifically, We first introduce a temporal mixup strategy to align data for data-level generalization which is then combined with the one-class meta-learning approach for model-level generalization. Furthermore, we develop a non-parametric dynamic threshold to adaptively adjust the threshold based on the probability density of the abnormal scores without any anomaly supervision. We empirically evaluate the effectiveness of the iADCPS using three publicly available datasets PUMP, SWaT, and WADI. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves 99.0%, 93.1%, and 78.7% F1-Score, respectively, which outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) ADCPS method, especially in the context of the evolving CPSs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bowen Zheng, Enze Liu, Zhongfu Chen, Zhongrui Ma, Yue Wang, Wayne Xin Zhao, Ji-Rong Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative recommendation autoregressively generates item identifiers to recommend potential items. Existing methods typically adopt a one-to-one mapping strategy, where each item is represented by a single identifier. However, this scheme poses issues, such as suboptimal semantic modeling for low-frequency items and limited diversity in token sequence data. To overcome these limitations, we propose MTGRec, which leverages Multi-identifier item Tokenization to augment token sequence data for Generative Recommender pre-training. Our approach involves two key innovations: multi-identifier item tokenization and curriculum recommender pre-training. For multi-identifier item tokenization, we leverage the RQ-VAE as the tokenizer backbone and treat model checkpoints from adjacent training epochs as semantically relevant tokenizers. This allows each item to be associated with multiple identifiers, enabling a single user interaction sequence to be converted into several token sequences as different data groups. For curriculum recommender pre-training, we introduce a curriculum learning scheme guided by data influence estimation, dynamically adjusting the sampling probability of each data group during recommender pre-training. After pre-training, we fine-tune the model using a single tokenizer to ensure accurate item identification for recommendation. Extensive experiments on three public benchmark datasets demonstrate that MTGRec significantly outperforms both traditional and generative recommendation baselines in terms of effectiveness and scalability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bowen Zheng, Hongyu Lu, Yu Chen, Wayne Xin Zhao, Ji-Rong Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, generative recommendation has emerged as a promising paradigm, attracting significant research attention. The basic framework involves an item tokenizer, which represents each item as a sequence of codes serving as its identifier, and a generative recommender that predicts the next item by autoregressively generating the target item identifier. However, in existing methods, both the tokenizer and the recommender are typically domain-specific, limiting their ability for effective transfer or adaptation to new domains. To this end, we propose UTGRec, a Universal item Tokenization approach for transferable Generative Recommendation. Specifically, we design a universal item tokenizer for encoding rich item semantics by adapting a multimodal large language model (MLLM). By devising tree-structured codebooks, we discretize content representations into corresponding codes for item tokenization. To effectively learn the universal item tokenizer on multiple domains, we introduce two key techniques in our approach. For raw content reconstruction, we employ dual lightweight decoders to reconstruct item text and images from discrete representations to capture general knowledge embedded in the content. For collaborative knowledge integration, we assume that co-occurring items are similar and integrate collaborative signals through co-occurrence alignment and reconstruction. Finally, we present a joint learning framework to pre-train and adapt the transferable generative recommender across multiple domains. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate the superiority of UTGRec compared to both traditional and generative recommendation baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: Driving scenario data play an increasingly vital role in the development of intelligent vehicles and autonomous driving. Accurate and efficient scenario data search is critical for both online vehicle decision-making and planning, and offline scenario generation and simulations, as it allows for leveraging the scenario experiences to improve the overall performance. Especially with the application of large language models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG) systems in autonomous driving, urgent requirements are put forward. In this paper, we introduce the Driving-RAG framework to address the challenges of efficient scenario data embedding, search, and applications for RAG systems. Our embedding model aligns fundamental scenario information and scenario distance metrics in the vector space. The typical scenario sampling method combined with hierarchical navigable small world can perform efficient scenario vector search to achieve high efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. In addition, the reorganization mechanism by graph knowledge enhances the relevance to the prompt scenarios and augment LLM generation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework on typical trajectory planning task for complex interactive scenarios such as ramps and intersections, showcasing its advantages for RAG applications.</p>

Through in-depth experiments, we uncover key principles for developing a unified model capable of both visual understanding and image generation. Extensive evaluations across a diverse range of prominent benchmarks demonstrate that UniToken achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing approaches.

<p>Abstract: Generating consecutive images of lip movements that align with a given speech in audio-driven lip synthesis is a challenging task. While previous studies have made strides in synchronization and visual quality, lip intelligibility and video fluency remain persistent challenges. This work proposes FluentLip, a two-stage approach for audio-driven lip synthesis, incorporating three featured strategies. To improve lip synchronization and intelligibility, we integrate a phoneme extractor and encoder to generate a fusion of audio and phoneme information for multimodal learning. Additionally, we employ optical flow consistency loss to ensure natural transitions between image frames. Furthermore, we incorporate a diffusion chain during the training of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to improve both stability and efficiency. We evaluate our proposed FluentLip through extensive experiments, comparing it with five state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches across five metrics, including a proposed metric called Phoneme Error Rate (PER) that evaluates lip pose intelligibility and video fluency. The experimental results demonstrate that our FluentLip approach is highly competitive, achieving significant improvements in smoothness and naturalness. In particular, it outperforms these SOTA approaches by approximately $\textbf{16.3%}$ in Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) and $\textbf{35.2%}$ in PER.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel formula-driven supervised learning (FDSL) framework for pre-training an environmental sound analysis model by leveraging acoustic signals parametrically synthesized through formula-driven methods. Specifically, we outline detailed procedures and evaluate their effectiveness for sound event detection (SED). The SED task, which involves estimating the types and timings of sound events, is particularly challenged by the difficulty of acquiring a sufficient quantity of accurately labeled training data. Moreover, it is well known that manually annotated labels often contain noises and are significantly influenced by the subjective judgment of annotators. To address these challenges, we propose a novel pre-training method that utilizes a synthetic dataset, Formula-SED, where acoustic data are generated solely based on mathematical formulas. The proposed method enables large-scale pre-training by using the synthesis parameters applied at each time step as ground truth labels, thereby eliminating label noise and bias. We demonstrate that large-scale pre-training with Formula-SED significantly enhances model accuracy and accelerates training, as evidenced by our results in the DESED dataset used for DCASE2023 Challenge Task 4.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Amaan Sayeed, Engin Tekin, Maryam Nadeem, Nancy A. ElNaker, Aahan Singh, Natalia Vassilieva, Boulbaba Ben Amor</p>
<p>Abstract: Unlocking the next generation of biotechnology and therapeutic innovation demands overcoming the inherent complexity and resource-intensity of conventional protein engineering methods. Recent GenAI-powered computational techniques often rely on the availability of the target protein's 3D structures and specific binding sites to generate high-affinity binders, constraints exhibited by models such as AlphaProteo and RFdiffusion. In this work, we explore the use of Protein Language Models (pLMs) for high-affinity binder generation. We introduce Prot42, a novel family of Protein Language Models (pLMs) pretrained on vast amounts of unlabeled protein sequences. By capturing deep evolutionary, structural, and functional insights through an advanced auto-regressive, decoder-only architecture inspired by breakthroughs in natural language processing, Prot42 dramatically expands the capabilities of computational protein design based on language only. Remarkably, our models handle sequences up to 8,192 amino acids, significantly surpassing standard limitations and enabling precise modeling of large proteins and complex multi-domain sequences. Demonstrating powerful practical applications, Prot42 excels in generating high-affinity protein binders and sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins. Our innovative models are publicly available, offering the scientific community an efficient and precise computational toolkit for rapid protein engineering.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurately predicting eclipse events around irregular small bodies is crucial for spacecraft navigation, orbit determination, and spacecraft systems management. This paper introduces a novel approach leveraging neural implicit representations to model eclipse conditions efficiently and reliably. We propose neural network architectures that capture the complex silhouettes of asteroids and comets with high precision. Tested on four well-characterized bodies - Bennu, Itokawa, 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, and Eros - our method achieves accuracy comparable to traditional ray-tracing techniques while offering orders of magnitude faster performance. Additionally, we develop an indirect learning framework that trains these models directly from sparse trajectory data using Neural Ordinary Differential Equations, removing the requirement to have prior knowledge of an accurate shape model. This approach allows for the continuous refinement of eclipse predictions, progressively reducing errors and improving accuracy as new trajectory data is incorporated.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced sentiment analysis, yet their inherent uncertainty and variability pose critical challenges to achieving reliable and consistent outcomes. This paper systematically explores the Model Variability Problem (MVP) in LLM-based sentiment analysis, characterized by inconsistent sentiment classification, polarization, and uncertainty arising from stochastic inference mechanisms, prompt sensitivity, and biases in training data. We analyze the core causes of MVP, presenting illustrative examples and a case study to highlight its impact. In addition, we investigate key challenges and mitigation strategies, paying particular attention to the role of temperature as a driver of output randomness and emphasizing the crucial role of explainability in improving transparency and user trust. By providing a structured perspective on stability, reproducibility, and trustworthiness, this study helps develop more reliable, explainable, and robust sentiment analysis models, facilitating their deployment in high-stakes domains such as finance, healthcare, and policymaking, among others.</p>

<p>Abstract: Loops--short audio segments designed for seamless repetition--are central to many music genres, particularly those rooted in dance and electronic styles. However, current generative music models struggle to produce truly loopable audio, as generating a short waveform alone does not guarantee a smooth transition from its endpoint back to its start, often resulting in audible discontinuities.Loops--short audio segments designed for seamless repetition--are central to many music genres, particularly those rooted in dance and electronic styles. However, current generative music models struggle to produce truly loopable audio, as generating a short waveform alone does not guarantee a smooth transition from its endpoint back to its start, often resulting in audible discontinuities.We address this gap by modifying a non-autoregressive model (MAGNeT) to generate tokens in a circular pattern, letting the model attend to the beginning of the audio when creating its ending. This inference-only approach results in generations that are aware of future context and loop naturally, without the need for any additional training or data. We evaluate the consistency of loop transitions by computing token perplexity around the seam of the loop, observing a 55% improvement. Blind listening tests further confirm significant perceptual gains over baseline methods, improving mean ratings by 70%. Taken together, these results highlight the effectiveness of inference-only approaches in improving generative models and underscore the advantages of non-autoregressive methods for context-aware music generation.</p>

<p>Abstract: The worldwide economy and environmental sustainability depend on eff icient and reliable supply chains, in which container shipping plays a crucial role as an environmentally friendly mode of transport. Liner shipping companies seek to improve operational efficiency by solving the stowage planning problem. Due to many complex combinatorial aspects, stowage planning is challenging and often decomposed into two NP-hard subproblems: master and slot planning. This article proposes AI2STOW, an end-to-end deep reinforcement learning model with feasibility projection and an action mask to create master plans under demand uncertainty with global objectives and constraints, including paired block stowage patterms. Our experimental results demonstrate that AI2STOW outperforms baseline methods from reinforcement learning and stochastic programming in objective performance and computational efficiency, based on simulated instances reflecting the scale of realistic vessels and operational planning horizons.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we have presented a method for identifying missing items known as gaps in the student answers by comparing them against the corresponding model answer/reference answers, automatically. The gaps can be identified at word, phrase or sentence level. The identified gaps are useful in providing feedback to the students for formative assessment. The problem of gap identification has been modelled as an alignment of a pair of directed graphs representing a student answer and the corresponding model answer for a given question. To validate the proposed approach, the gap annotated student answers considering answers from three widely known datasets in the short answer grading domain, namely, University of North Texas (UNT), SciEntsBank, and Beetle have been developed and this gap annotated student answers' dataset is available at: https://github.com/sahuarchana7/gaps-answers-dataset. Evaluation metrics used in the traditional machine learning tasks have been adopted to evaluate the task of gap identification. Though performance of the proposed approach varies across the datasets and the types of the answers, overall the performance is observed to be promising.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengxia Dai, Wenqian Luo, Tianyang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Instance segmentation plays a pivotal role in medical image analysis by enabling precise localization and delineation of lesions, tumors, and anatomical structures. Although deep learning models such as Mask R-CNN and BlendMask have achieved remarkable progress, their application in high-risk medical scenarios remains constrained by confidence calibration issues, which may lead to misdiagnosis. To address this challenge, we propose a robust quality control framework based on conformal prediction theory. This framework innovatively constructs a risk-aware dynamic threshold mechanism that adaptively adjusts segmentation decision boundaries according to clinical requirements.Specifically, we design a \textbf{calibration-aware loss function} that dynamically tunes the segmentation threshold based on a user-defined risk level $\alpha$. Utilizing exchangeable calibration data, this method ensures that the expected FNR or FDR on test data remains below $\alpha$ with high probability. The framework maintains compatibility with mainstream segmentation models (e.g., Mask R-CNN, BlendMask+ResNet-50-FPN) and datasets (PASCAL VOC format) without requiring architectural modifications. Empirical results demonstrate that we rigorously bound the FDR metric marginally over the test set via our developed calibration framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yao Tao, Yehui Tang, Yun Wang, Mingjian Zhu, Hailin Hu, Yunhe Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the recent success of large language models (LLMs), LLMs are particularly challenging in long-sequence inference scenarios due to the quadratic computational complexity of the attention mechanism. Inspired by the interpretability theory of feature attribution in neural network models, we observe that not all tokens have the same contribution. Based on this observation, we propose a novel token pruning framework, namely Saliency-driven Dynamic Token Pruning (SDTP), to gradually and dynamically prune redundant tokens based on the input context. Specifically, a lightweight saliency-driven prediction module is designed to estimate the importance score of each token with its hidden state, which is added to different layers of the LLM to hierarchically prune redundant tokens. Furthermore, a ranking-based optimization strategy is proposed to minimize the ranking divergence of the saliency score and the predicted importance score. Extensive experiments have shown that our framework is generalizable to various models and datasets. By hierarchically pruning 65\% of the input tokens, our method greatly reduces 33\% $\sim$ 47\% FLOPs and achieves speedup up to 1.75$\times$ during inference, while maintaining comparable performance. We further demonstrate that SDTP can be combined with KV cache compression method for further compression.</p>

<p>Abstract: Foundation models pretrained on extensive datasets, such as GroundingDINO and LAE-DINO, have performed remarkably in the cross-domain few-shot object detection (CD-FSOD) task. Through rigorous few-shot training, we found that the integration of image-based data augmentation techniques and grid-based sub-domain search strategy significantly enhances the performance of these foundation models. Building upon GroundingDINO, we employed several widely used image augmentation methods and established optimization objectives to effectively navigate the expansive domain space in search of optimal sub-domains. This approach facilitates efficient few-shot object detection and introduces an approach to solving the CD-FSOD problem by efficiently searching for the optimal parameter configuration from the foundation model. Our findings substantially advance the practical deployment of vision-language models in data-scarce environments, offering critical insights into optimizing their cross-domain generalization capabilities without labor-intensive retraining.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuerui Su, Shufang Xie, Guoqing Liu, Yingce Xia, Renqian Luo, Peiran Jin, Zhiming Ma, Yue Wang, Zun Wang, Yuting Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly evolved, approaching Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) while benefiting from large-scale reinforcement learning to enhance Human Alignment (HA) and Reasoning. Recent reward-based optimization algorithms, such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) have achieved significant performance on reasoning tasks, whereas preference-based optimization algorithms such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) significantly improve the performance of LLMs on human alignment. However, despite the strong performance of reward-based optimization methods in alignment tasks , they remain vulnerable to reward hacking. Furthermore, preference-based algorithms (such as Online DPO) haven't yet matched the performance of reward-based optimization algorithms (like PPO) on reasoning tasks, making their exploration in this specific area still a worthwhile pursuit. Motivated by these challenges, we propose the Trust Region Preference Approximation (TRPA) algorithm, which integrates rule-based optimization with preference-based optimization for reasoning tasks. As a preference-based algorithm, TRPA naturally eliminates the reward hacking issue. TRPA constructs preference levels using predefined rules, forms corresponding preference pairs, and leverages a novel optimization algorithm for RL training with a theoretical monotonic improvement guarantee. Experimental results demonstrate that TRPA not only achieves competitive performance on reasoning tasks but also exhibits robust stability.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gerardo Flores, Abigail Schiff, Alyssa H. Smith, Julia A Fukuyama, Ashia C. Wilson</p>
<p>Abstract: ML-supported decisions, such as ordering tests or determining preventive custody, often involve binary classification based on probabilistic forecasts. Evaluation frameworks for such forecasts typically consider whether to prioritize independent-decision metrics (e.g., Accuracy) or top-K metrics (e.g., Precision@K), and whether to focus on fixed thresholds or threshold-agnostic measures like AUC-ROC. We highlight that a consequentialist perspective, long advocated by decision theorists, should naturally favor evaluations that support independent decisions using a mixture of thresholds given their prevalence, such as Brier scores and Log loss. However, our empirical analysis reveals a strong preference for top-K metrics or fixed thresholds in evaluations at major conferences like ICML, FAccT, and CHIL. To address this gap, we use this decision-theoretic framework to map evaluation metrics to their optimal use cases, along with a Python package, briertools, to promote the broader adoption of Brier scores. In doing so, we also uncover new theoretical connections, including a reconciliation between the Brier Score and Decision Curve Analysis, which clarifies and responds to a longstanding critique by (Assel, et al. 2017) regarding the clinical utility of proper scoring rules.</p>

<p>Abstract: Text summarization is crucial for mitigating information overload across domains like journalism, medicine, and business. This research evaluates summarization performance across 17 large language models (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, open-source) using a novel multi-dimensional framework. We assessed models on seven diverse datasets (BigPatent, BillSum, CNN/DailyMail, PubMed, SAMSum, WikiHow, XSum) at three output lengths (50, 100, 150 tokens) using metrics for factual consistency, semantic similarity, lexical overlap, and human-like quality, while also considering efficiency factors. Our findings reveal significant performance differences, with specific models excelling in factual accuracy (deepseek-v3), human-like quality (claude-3-5-sonnet), and processing efficiency/cost-effectiveness (gemini-1.5-flash, gemini-2.0-flash). Performance varies dramatically by dataset, with models struggling on technical domains but performing well on conversational content. We identified a critical tension between factual consistency (best at 50 tokens) and perceived quality (best at 150 tokens). Our analysis provides evidence-based recommendations for different use cases, from high-stakes applications requiring factual accuracy to resource-constrained environments needing efficient processing. This comprehensive approach enhances evaluation methodology by integrating quality metrics with operational considerations, incorporating trade-offs between accuracy, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness to guide model selection for specific applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Energy-efficient image acquisition on the edge is crucial for enabling remote sensing applications where the sensor node has weak compute capabilities and must transmit data to a remote server/cloud for processing. To reduce the edge energy consumption, this paper proposes a sensor-algorithm co-designed system called SnapPix, which compresses raw pixels in the analog domain inside the sensor. We use coded exposure (CE) as the in-sensor compression strategy as it offers the flexibility to sample, i.e., selectively expose pixels, both spatially and temporally. SNAPPIX has three contributions. First, we propose a task-agnostic strategy to learn the sampling/exposure pattern based on the classic theory of efficient coding. Second, we co-design the downstream vision model with the exposure pattern to address the pixel-level non-uniformity unique to CE-compressed images. Finally, we propose lightweight augmentations to the image sensor hardware to support our in-sensor CE compression. Evaluating on action recognition and video reconstruction, SnapPix outperforms state-of-the-art video-based methods at the same speed while reducing the energy by up to 15.4x.

<p>Abstract: 3D Large Language Models (LLMs) leveraging spatial information in point clouds for 3D spatial reasoning attract great attention. Despite some promising results, the role of point clouds in 3D spatial reasoning remains under-explored. In this work, we comprehensively evaluate and analyze these models to answer the research question: \textit{Does point cloud truly boost the spatial reasoning capacities of 3D LLMs?} We first evaluate the spatial reasoning capacity of LLMs with different input modalities by replacing the point cloud with the visual and text counterparts. We then propose a novel 3D QA (Question-answering) benchmark, ScanReQA, that comprehensively evaluates models' understanding of binary spatial relationships. Our findings reveal several critical insights: 1) LLMs without point input could even achieve competitive performance even in a zero-shot manner; 2) existing 3D LLMs struggle to comprehend the binary spatial relationships; 3) 3D LLMs exhibit limitations in exploiting the structural coordinates in point clouds for fine-grained spatial reasoning. We think these conclusions can help the next step of 3D LLMs and also offer insights for foundation models in other modalities.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Gan, Pei Li, Keke Long, Bocheng An, Junwei You, Keshu Wu, Bin Ran</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models have demonstrated strong reasoning and generalization capabilities in driving-related tasks, including scene understanding, planning, and control. However, they still face challenges in hallucinations, uncertainty, and long inference latency. While existing foundation models have general knowledge of avoiding collisions, they often lack transportation-specific safety knowledge. To overcome these limitations, we introduce LetsPi, a physics-informed, dual-phase, knowledge-driven framework for safe, human-like trajectory planning. To prevent hallucinations and minimize uncertainty, this hybrid framework integrates Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning with physics-informed social force dynamics. LetsPi leverages the LLM to analyze driving scenes and historical information, providing appropriate parameters and target destinations (goals) for the social force model, which then generates the future trajectory. Moreover, the dual-phase architecture balances reasoning and computational efficiency through its Memory Collection phase and Fast Inference phase. The Memory Collection phase leverages the physics-informed LLM to process and refine planning results through reasoning, reflection, and memory modules, storing safe, high-quality driving experiences in a memory bank. Surrogate safety measures and physics-informed prompt techniques are introduced to enhance the LLM's knowledge of transportation safety and physical force, respectively. The Fast Inference phase extracts similar driving experiences as few-shot examples for new scenarios, while simplifying input-output requirements to enable rapid trajectory planning without compromising safety. Extensive experiments using the HighD dataset demonstrate that LetsPi outperforms baseline models across five safety metrics.See PDF for project Github link.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicolo Resmini, Eugenio Lomurno, Cristian Sbrolli, Matteo Matteucci</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools to synthetically produce training data, offering potential solutions to data scarcity and reducing labelling costs for downstream supervised deep learning applications. However, effectively leveraging text-conditioned image generation for building classifier training sets requires addressing key issues: constructing informative textual prompts, adapting generative models to specific domains, and ensuring robust performance. This paper proposes the Text-Conditioned Knowledge Recycling (TCKR) pipeline to tackle these challenges. TCKR combines dynamic image captioning, parameter-efficient diffusion model fine-tuning, and Generative Knowledge Distillation techniques to create synthetic datasets tailored for image classification. The pipeline is rigorously evaluated on ten diverse image classification benchmarks. The results demonstrate that models trained solely on TCKR-generated data achieve classification accuracies on par with (and in several cases exceeding) models trained on real images. Furthermore, the evaluation reveals that these synthetic-data-trained models exhibit substantially enhanced privacy characteristics: their vulnerability to Membership Inference Attacks is significantly reduced, with the membership inference AUC lowered by 5.49 points on average compared to using real training data, demonstrating a substantial improvement in the performance-privacy trade-off. These findings indicate that high-fidelity synthetic data can effectively replace real data for training classifiers, yielding strong performance whilst simultaneously providing improved privacy protection as a valuable emergent property. The code and trained models are available in the accompanying open-source repository.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Uri Menkes, Assaf Hallak, Ofra Amir</p>
<p>Abstract: Consider a setting where a pre-trained agent is operating in an environment and a human operator can decide to temporarily terminate its operation and take-over for some duration of time. These kind of scenarios are common in human-machine interactions, for example in autonomous driving, factory automation and healthcare. In these settings, we typically observe a trade-off between two extreme cases -- if no take-overs are allowed, then the agent might employ a sub-optimal, possibly dangerous policy. Alternatively, if there are too many take-overs, then the human has no confidence in the agent, greatly limiting its usefulness. In this paper, we formalize this setup and propose an explainability scheme to help optimize the number of human interventions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haonan Chen, Cheng Zhu, Yunzhu Li, Katherine Driggs-Campbell</p>
<p>Abstract: Tool use is critical for enabling robots to perform complex real-world tasks, and leveraging human tool-use data can be instrumental for teaching robots. However, existing data collection methods like teleoperation are slow, prone to control delays, and unsuitable for dynamic tasks. In contrast, human natural data, where humans directly perform tasks with tools, offers natural, unstructured interactions that are both efficient and easy to collect. Building on the insight that humans and robots can share the same tools, we propose a framework to transfer tool-use knowledge from human data to robots. Using two RGB cameras, our method generates 3D reconstruction, applies Gaussian splatting for novel view augmentation, employs segmentation models to extract embodiment-agnostic observations, and leverages task-space tool-action representations to train visuomotor policies. We validate our approach on diverse real-world tasks, including meatball scooping, pan flipping, wine bottle balancing, and other complex tasks. Our method achieves a 71\% higher average success rate compared to diffusion policies trained with teleoperation data and reduces data collection time by 77\%, with some tasks solvable only by our framework. Compared to hand-held gripper, our method cuts data collection time by 41\%. Additionally, our method bridges the embodiment gap, improves robustness to variations in camera viewpoints and robot configurations, and generalizes effectively across objects and spatial setups.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanshu Li, Hongyang He, Yi Cao, Qisen Cheng, Xiang Fu, Ruixiang Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal in-context learning (ICL) is a vital capability for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), allowing task adaptation via contextual prompts without parameter retraining. However, its application is hindered by the token-intensive nature of inputs and the high complexity of cross-modal few-shot learning, which limits the expressive power of representation methods. To tackle these challenges, we propose \textbf{M2IV}, a method that substitutes explicit demonstrations with learnable \textbf{I}n-context \textbf{V}ectors directly integrated into LVLMs. By exploiting the complementary strengths of multi-head attention (\textbf{M}HA) and multi-layer perceptrons (\textbf{M}LP), M2IV achieves robust cross-modal fidelity and fine-grained semantic distillation through training. This significantly enhances performance across diverse LVLMs and tasks and scales efficiently to many-shot scenarios, bypassing the context window limitations. We also introduce \textbf{VLibrary}, a repository for storing and retrieving M2IV, enabling flexible LVLM steering for tasks like cross-modal alignment, customized generation and safety improvement. Experiments across seven benchmarks and three LVLMs show that M2IV surpasses Vanilla ICL and prior representation engineering approaches, with an average accuracy gain of \textbf{3.74\%} over ICL with the same shot count, alongside substantial efficiency advantages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Foram Niravbhai Shah, Parshwa Shah, Muhammad Usama Saleem, Ekkasit Pinyoanuntapong, Pu Wang, Hongfei Xue, Ahmed Helmy</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in dance generation have enabled automatic synthesis of 3D dance motions. However, existing methods still struggle to produce high-fidelity dance sequences that simultaneously deliver exceptional realism, precise dance-music synchronization, high motion diversity, and physical plausibility. Moreover, existing methods lack the flexibility to edit dance sequences according to diverse guidance signals, such as musical prompts, pose constraints, action labels, and genre descriptions, significantly restricting their creative utility and adaptability. Unlike the existing approaches, DanceMosaic enables fast and high-fidelity dance generation, while allowing multimodal motion editing. Specifically, we propose a multimodal masked motion model that fuses the text-to-motion model with music and pose adapters to learn probabilistic mapping from diverse guidance signals to high-quality dance motion sequences via progressive generative masking training. To further enhance the motion generation quality, we propose multimodal classifier-free guidance and inference-time optimization mechanism that further enforce the alignment between the generated motions and the multimodal guidance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method establishes a new state-of-the-art performance in dance generation, significantly advancing the quality and editability achieved by existing approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eylon Caplan, Tania Chakraborty, Dan Goldwasser</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding how people of various demographics think, feel, and express themselves (collectively called group expression) is essential for social science and underlies the assessment of bias in Large Language Models (LLMs). While LLMs can effectively summarize group expression when provided with empirical examples, coming up with generalizable theories of how a group's expression manifests in real-world text is challenging. In this paper, we define a new task called Group Theorization, in which a system must write theories that differentiate expression across demographic groups. We make available a large dataset on this task, Splits!, constructed by splitting Reddit posts by neutral topics (e.g. sports, cooking, and movies) and by demographics (e.g. occupation, religion, and race). Finally, we suggest a simple evaluation framework for assessing how effectively a method can generate 'better' theories about group expression, backed by human validation. We publicly release the raw corpora and evaluation scripts for Splits! to help researchers assess how methods infer--and potentially misrepresent--group differences in expression. We make Splits! and our evaluation module available at https://github.com/eyloncaplan/splits.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyi Ren, Juampablo Heras Rivera, Hitender Oswal, Yutong Pan, Agamdeep Chopra, Jacob Ruzevick, Mehmet Kurt</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning has been successfully applied to medical image segmentation, enabling accurate identification of regions of interest such as organs and lesions. This approach works effectively across diverse datasets, including those with single-image contrast, multi-contrast, and multimodal imaging data. To improve human understanding of these black-box models, there is a growing need for Explainable AI (XAI) techniques for model transparency and accountability. Previous research has primarily focused on post hoc pixel-level explanations, using methods gradient-based and perturbation-based apporaches. These methods rely on gradients or perturbations to explain model predictions. However, these pixel-level explanations often struggle with the complexity inherent in multi-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) segmentation tasks, and the sparsely distributed explanations have limited clinical relevance. In this study, we propose using contrast-level Shapley values to explain state-of-the-art models trained on standard metrics used in brain tumor segmentation. Our results demonstrate that Shapley analysis provides valuable insights into different models' behavior used for tumor segmentation. We demonstrated a bias for U-Net towards over-weighing T1-contrast and FLAIR, while Swin-UNETR provided a cross-contrast understanding with balanced Shapley distribution.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ngoc-Quang Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate prediction of compound-protein interactions (CPI) remains a cornerstone challenge in computational drug discovery. While existing sequence-based approaches leverage molecular fingerprints or graph representations, they critically overlook three-dimensional (3D) structural determinants of binding affinity. To bridge this gap, we present EquiCPI, an end-to-end geometric deep learning framework that synergizes first-principles structural modeling with SE(3)-equivariant neural networks. Our pipeline transforms raw sequences into 3D atomic coordinates via ESMFold for proteins and DiffDock-L for ligands, followed by physics-guided conformer re-ranking and equivariant feature learning. At its core, EquiCPI employs SE(3)-equivariant message passing over atomic point clouds, preserving symmetry under rotations, translations, and reflections, while hierarchically encoding local interaction patterns through tensor products of spherical harmonics. The proposed model is evaluated on BindingDB (affinity prediction) and DUD-E (virtual screening), EquiCPI achieves performance on par with or exceeding the state-of-the-art deep learning competitors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bo Li, Jing Yun</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-view clustering can explore common semantics from multiple views and has received increasing attention in recent years. However, current methods focus on learning consistency in representation, neglecting the contribution of each view's complementarity aspect in representation learning. This limit poses a significant challenge in multi-view representation learning. This paper proposes a novel multi-view clustering framework that introduces a disentangled variational autoencoder that separates multi-view into shared and private information, i.e., consistency and complementarity information. We first learn informative and consistent representations by maximizing mutual information across different views through contrastive learning. This process will ignore complementary information. Then, we employ consistency inference constraints to explicitly utilize complementary information when attempting to seek the consistency of shared information across all views. Specifically, we perform a within-reconstruction using the private and shared information of each view and a cross-reconstruction using the shared information of all views. The dual consistency constraints are not only effective in improving the representation quality of data but also easy to extend to other scenarios, especially in complex multi-view scenes. This could be the first attempt to employ dual consistent constraint in a unified MVC theoretical framework. During the training procedure, the consistency and complementarity features are jointly optimized. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms baseline methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yicheng Leng, Chaowei Fang, Junye Chen, Yixiang Fang, Sheng Li, Guanbin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Visible watermark removal which involves watermark cleaning and background content restoration is pivotal to evaluate the resilience of watermarks. Existing deep neural network (DNN)-based models still struggle with large-area watermarks and are overly dependent on the quality of watermark mask prediction. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel feature adapting framework that leverages the representation modeling capacity of a pre-trained image inpainting model. Our approach bridges the knowledge gap between image inpainting and watermark removal by fusing information of the residual background content beneath watermarks into the inpainting backbone model. We establish a dual-branch system to capture and embed features from the residual background content, which are merged into intermediate features of the inpainting backbone model via gated feature fusion modules. Moreover, for relieving the dependence on high-quality watermark masks, we introduce a new training paradigm by utilizing coarse watermark masks to guide the inference process. This contributes to a visible image removal model which is insensitive to the quality of watermark mask during testing. Extensive experiments on both a large-scale synthesized dataset and a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising performance in software vulnerability detection (SVD), yet their reasoning capabilities remain unreliable. Existing approaches relying on chain-of-thought (CoT) struggle to provide relevant and actionable security assessments. Additionally, effective SVD requires not only generating coherent reasoning but also differentiating between well-founded and misleading yet plausible security assessments, an aspect overlooked in prior work. To this end, we introduce R2Vul, a novel approach that distills structured reasoning into small LLMs using reinforcement learning from AI feedback (RLAIF). Through RLAIF, R2Vul enables LLMs to produce structured, security-aware reasoning that is actionable and reliable while explicitly learning to distinguish valid assessments from misleading ones. We evaluate R2Vul across five languages against SAST tools, CoT, instruction tuning, and classification-based baselines. Our results show that R2Vul with structured reasoning distillation enables a 1.5B student LLM to rival larger models while improving generalization to out-of-distribution vulnerabilities. Beyond model improvements, we contribute a large-scale, multilingual preference dataset featuring structured reasoning to support future research in SVD.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Transformer-based architectures have led to impressive breakthroughs in natural language processing tasks, with models such as GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini demonstrating human-level reasoning abilities. However, despite their high performance, concerns remain about the inherent limitations of these models, especially when it comes to learning basic logical functions. While complexity-theoretic analyses indicate that Transformers can represent simple logic functions (e.g., $\mathsf{AND}$, $\mathsf{OR}$, and majority gates) by its nature of belonging to the $\mathsf{TC}^0$ class, these results assume ideal parameter settings and do not account for the constraints imposed by gradient descent-based training methods. In this work, we investigate whether Transformers can truly learn simple majority functions when trained using gradient-based methods. We focus on a simplified variant of the Transformer architecture and consider both $n=\mathrm{poly}(d)$ and $n=\exp(\Omega(d))$ number of training samples, where each sample is a $d$-size binary string paired with the output of a basic majority function. Our analysis demonstrates that even after $\mathrm{poly}(d)$ gradient queries, the generalization error of the Transformer model still remains substantially large, growing exponentially with $d$. This work highlights fundamental optimization challenges in training Transformers for the simplest logical reasoning tasks and provides new insights into their theoretical limitations.</p>

<p>Abstract: The increasing size of the Key-Value (KV) cache during the Large Language Models long-context inference is the main obstacle for its balance between the deployment cost and task accuracy. To reduce the KV cache size in such scenarios, most previous efforts leveraged on the attention weight to evict non-critical cache tokens. But there is a trade-off in those methods, they usually require major modifiation of the inference infrastructure and significant computation overhead. Base on the fact that the Large Lanuage models are autoregresssive models, we propose {\it LagKV}, a KV allocation strategy only relying on straight forward comparison among KV themself. It is a totally attention free method which offers easy integration to the main stream inference platform and comparable performance comparing to other complicated KV compression methods. Results on LongBench and PasskeyRetrieval show that, our approach achieves nearly zero loss when the ratio is $2\times$ and $\approx 90\%$ of the original model performance for $8\times$. Especially in the 64-digit passkey retrieval task, our mehod outperforms the attention weight based method $H_2O$ over $60\%$ with same compression ratios.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lingyue Fu, Ting Long, Jianghao Lin, Wei Xia, Xinyi Dai, Ruiming Tang, Yasheng Wang, Weinan Zhang, Yong Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge Tracing (KT) monitors students' knowledge states and simulates their responses to question sequences. Existing KT models typically follow a single-step training paradigm, which leads to discrepancies with the multi-step inference process required in real-world simulations, resulting in significant error accumulation. This accumulation of error, coupled with the issue of data sparsity, can substantially degrade the performance of recommendation models in the intelligent tutoring systems. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Adversarial Multi-Step Training Framework for Knowledge Tracing (AdvKT), which, for the first time, focuses on the multi-step KT task. More specifically, AdvKT leverages adversarial learning paradigm involving a generator and a discriminator. The generator mimics high-reward responses, effectively reducing error accumulation across multiple steps, while the discriminator provides feedback to generate synthetic data. Additionally, we design specialized data augmentation techniques to enrich the training data with realistic variations, ensuring that the model generalizes well even in scenarios with sparse data. Experiments conducted on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of AdvKT over existing KT models, showcasing its ability to address both error accumulation and data sparsity issues effectively.</p>

The paper organizes current benchmarks and datasets into coherent categories that reflect the evolving landscape of multi-turn dialogue evaluation. In addition, we review a range of enhancement methodologies under multi-turn settings, including model-centric strategies (contextual learning, supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and new architectures), external integration approaches (memory-augmented, retrieval-based methods, and knowledge graph), and agent-based techniques for collaborative interactions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minki Kang, Jongwon Jeong, Jaewoong Cho</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that test-time compute scaling effectively improves the performance of small language models (sLMs). However, prior research has mainly examined test-time compute scaling with an additional larger model as a verifier, leaving self-verification by sLMs underexplored. In this work, we investigate whether sLMs can reliably self-verify their outputs under test-time scaling. We find that even with knowledge distillation from larger verifiers, sLMs struggle with verification tasks requiring memorization, such as numerical calculations and fact-checking. To address this limitation, we propose Tool-integrated self-verification (T1), which delegates memorization-heavy verification steps to external tools, such as a code interpreter. Our theoretical analysis shows that tool integration reduces memorization demands and improves test-time scaling performance. Experiments on the MATH benchmark demonstrate that, with T1, a Llama-3.2 1B model under test-time scaling outperforms the significantly larger Llama-3.1 8B model. Moreover, T1 generalizes effectively to both mathematical (MATH500) and multi-domain knowledge-intensive tasks (MMLU-Pro). Our findings highlight the potential of tool integration to substantially improve the self-verification abilities of sLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the landscape of Fact-based Judgment Prediction and Explanation (FJPE), reliance on factual data is essential for developing robust and realistic AI-driven decision-making tools. This paper introduces TathyaNyaya, the largest annotated dataset for FJPE tailored to the Indian legal context, encompassing judgments from the Supreme Court of India and various High Courts. Derived from the Hindi terms "Tathya" (fact) and "Nyaya" (justice), the TathyaNyaya dataset is uniquely designed to focus on factual statements rather than complete legal texts, reflecting real-world judicial processes where factual data drives outcomes. Complementing this dataset, we present FactLegalLlama, an instruction-tuned variant of the LLaMa-3-8B Large Language Model (LLM), optimized for generating high-quality explanations in FJPE tasks. Finetuned on the factual data in TathyaNyaya, FactLegalLlama integrates predictive accuracy with coherent, contextually relevant explanations, addressing the critical need for transparency and interpretability in AI-assisted legal systems. Our methodology combines transformers for binary judgment prediction with FactLegalLlama for explanation generation, creating a robust framework for advancing FJPE in the Indian legal domain. TathyaNyaya not only surpasses existing datasets in scale and diversity but also establishes a benchmark for building explainable AI systems in legal analysis. The findings underscore the importance of factual precision and domain-specific tuning in enhancing predictive performance and interpretability, positioning TathyaNyaya and FactLegalLlama as foundational resources for AI-assisted legal decision-making.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samarth Mishra, Kate Saenko, Venkatesh Saligrama</p>
<p>Abstract: Compositionality, or correctly recognizing scenes as compositions of atomic visual concepts, remains difficult for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Even state of the art MLLMs such as GPT-4o can make mistakes in distinguishing compositions like "dog chasing cat" vs "cat chasing dog". While on Winoground, a benchmark for measuring such reasoning, MLLMs have made significant progress, they are still far from a human's performance. We show that compositional reasoning in these models can be improved by elucidating such concepts via data, where a model is trained to prefer the correct caption for an image over a close but incorrect one. We introduce SCRAMBLe: Synthetic Compositional Reasoning Augmentation of MLLMs with Binary preference Learning, an approach for preference tuning open-weight MLLMs on synthetic preference data generated in a fully automated manner from existing image-caption data. SCRAMBLe holistically improves these MLLMs' compositional reasoning capabilities which we can see through significant improvements across multiple vision language compositionality benchmarks, as well as smaller but significant improvements on general question answering tasks. As a sneak peek, SCRAMBLe tuned Molmo-7B model improves on Winoground from 49.5% to 54.8% (best reported to date), while improving by ~1% on more general visual question answering tasks. Code for SCRAMBLe along with tuned models and our synthetic training dataset is available at https://github.com/samarth4149/SCRAMBLe.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> He Zhu, Quyu Kong, Kechun Xu, Xunlong Xia, Bing Deng, Jieping Ye, Rong Xiong, Yue Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Grounding 3D object affordance is a task that locates objects in 3D space where they can be manipulated, which links perception and action for embodied intelligence. For example, for an intelligent robot, it is necessary to accurately ground the affordance of an object and grasp it according to human instructions. In this paper, we introduce a novel task that grounds 3D object affordance based on language instructions, visual observations and interactions, which is inspired by cognitive science. We collect an Affordance Grounding dataset with Points, Images and Language instructions (AGPIL) to support the proposed task. In the 3D physical world, due to observation orientation, object rotation, or spatial occlusion, we can only get a partial observation of the object. So this dataset includes affordance estimations of objects from full-view, partial-view, and rotation-view perspectives. To accomplish this task, we propose LMAffordance3D, the first multi-modal, language-guided 3D affordance grounding network, which applies a vision-language model to fuse 2D and 3D spatial features with semantic features. Comprehensive experiments on AGPIL demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method on this task, even in unseen experimental settings.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eloi Moliner, Michal \v{S}vento, Alec Wright, Lauri Juvela, Pavel Rajmic, Vesa V\"alim\"aki</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurately estimating nonlinear audio effects without access to paired input-output signals remains a challenging problem.This work studies unsupervised probabilistic approaches for solving this task. We introduce a method, novel for this application, based on diffusion generative models for blind system identification, enabling the estimation of unknown nonlinear effects using black- and gray-box models. This study compares this method with a previously proposed adversarial approach, analyzing the performance of both methods under different parameterizations of the effect operator and varying lengths of available effected recordings.Through experiments on guitar distortion effects, we show that the diffusion-based approach provides more stable results and is less sensitive to data availability, while the adversarial approach is superior at estimating more pronounced distortion effects. Our findings contribute to the robust unsupervised blind estimation of audio effects, demonstrating the potential of diffusion models for system identification in music technology.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shyam Sundhar, Riya Sharma, Priyansh Maheshwari, Suvidha Rupesh Kumar, T. Sunil Kumar</p>
<p>Abstract: Agriculture plays a critical role in the global economy, providing livelihoods and ensuring food security for billions. As innovative agricultural practices become more widespread, the risk of crop diseases has increased, highlighting the urgent need for efficient, low-intervention disease identification methods. This research presents a hybrid model combining Graph Attention Networks (GATs) and Graph Convolution Networks (GCNs) for leaf disease classification. GCNs have been widely used for learning from graph-structured data, and GATs enhance this by incorporating attention mechanisms to focus on the most important neighbors. The methodology integrates superpixel segmentation for efficient feature extraction, partitioning images into meaningful, homogeneous regions that better capture localized features. The authors have employed an edge augmentation technique to enhance the robustness of the model. The edge augmentation technique has introduced a significant degree of generalization in the detection capabilities of the model. To further optimize training, weight initialization techniques are applied. The hybrid model is evaluated against the individual performance of the GCN and GAT models and the hybrid model achieved a precision of 0.9822, recall of 0.9818, and F1-score of 0.9818 in apple leaf disease classification, a precision of 0.9746, recall of 0.9744, and F1-score of 0.9743 in potato leaf disease classification, and a precision of 0.8801, recall of 0.8801, and F1-score of 0.8799 in sugarcane leaf disease classification. These results demonstrate the robustness and performance of the model, suggesting its potential to support sustainable agricultural practices through precise and effective disease detection. This work is a small step towards reducing the loss of crops and hence supporting sustainable goals of zero hunger and life on land.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Zhao, Jiaqi Li, Haitao Xia, Tianjiao Zhang, Zerong Zeng, Tianyu Ren, Yucheng Zhang, Chao Zhu, Shengtong Xu, Hongchun Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Inspired by the similarity of the atmosphere-ocean physical coupling mechanism, this study innovatively migrates meteorological large-model techniques to the ocean domain, constructing the KunPeng global ocean environmental prediction model. Aimed at the discontinuous characteristics of marine space, we propose a terrain-adaptive mask constraint mechanism to mitigate effectively training divergence caused by abrupt gradients at land-sea boundaries. To fully integrate far-, medium-, and close-range marine features, a longitude-cyclic deformable convolution network (LC-DCN) is employed to enhance the dynamic receptive field, achieving refined modeling of multi-scale oceanic characteristics. A Deformable Convolution-enhanced Multi-Step Prediction module (DC-MTP) is employed to strengthen temporal dependency feature extraction capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that this model achieves an average ACC of 0.80 in 15-day global predictions at 0.25$^\circ$ resolution, outperforming comparative models by 0.01-0.08. The average mean squared error (MSE) is 0.41 (representing a 5%-31% reduction) and the average mean absolute error (MAE) is 0.44 (0.6%-21% reduction) compared to other models. Significant improvements are particularly observed in sea surface parameter prediction, deep-sea region characterization, and current velocity field forecasting. Through a horizontal comparison of the applicability of operators at different scales in the marine domain, this study reveals that local operators significantly outperform global operators under slow-varying oceanic processes, demonstrating the effectiveness of dynamic feature pyramid representations in predicting marine physical parameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuefeng Liu, Songhao Jiang, Chih-chan Tien, Jinbo Xu, Rick Stevens</p>
<p>Abstract: Protein representation learning is critical for numerous biological tasks. Recently, large transformer-based protein language models (pLMs) pretrained on large scale protein sequences have demonstrated significant success in sequence-based tasks. However, pLMs lack structural information. Conversely, graph neural networks (GNNs) designed to leverage 3D structural information have shown promising generalization in protein-related prediction tasks, but their effectiveness is often constrained by the scarcity of labeled structural data. Recognizing that sequence and structural representations are complementary perspectives of the same protein entity, we propose a multimodal bidirectional hierarchical fusion framework to effectively merge these modalities. Our framework employs attention and gating mechanisms to enable effective interaction between pLMs-generated sequential representations and GNN-extracted structural features, improving information exchange and enhancement across layers of the neural network. Based on the framework, we further introduce local Bi-Hierarchical Fusion with gating and global Bi-Hierarchical Fusion with multihead self-attention approaches. Through extensive experiments on a diverse set of protein-related tasks, our method demonstrates consistent improvements over strong baselines and existing fusion techniques in a variety of protein representation learning benchmarks, including react (enzyme/EC classification), model quality assessment (MQA), protein-ligand binding affinity prediction (LBA), protein-protein binding site prediction (PPBS), and B cell epitopes prediction (BCEs). Our method establishes a new state-of-the-art for multimodal protein representation learning, emphasizing the efficacy of BIHIERARCHICAL FUSION in bridging sequence and structural modalities.</p>

<p>Abstract: Mamba-based vision models have gained extensive attention as a result of being computationally more efficient than attention-based models. However, spatial redundancy still exists in these models, represented by token and block redundancy. For token redundancy, we analytically find that early token pruning methods will result in inconsistency between training and inference or introduce extra computation for inference. Therefore, we customize token pruning to fit the Mamba structure by rearranging the pruned sequence before feeding it into the next Mamba block. For block redundancy, we allow each image to select SSM blocks dynamically based on an empirical observation that the inference speed of Mamba-based vision models is largely affected by the number of SSM blocks. Our proposed method, Dynamic Vision Mamba (DyVM), effectively reduces FLOPs with minor performance drops. We achieve a reduction of 35.2\% FLOPs with only a loss of accuracy of 1.7\% on Vim-S. It also generalizes well across different Mamba vision model architectures and different vision tasks. Our code will be made public.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tengjun Jin, Yuxuan Zhu, Daniel Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: Practitioners are increasingly turning to Extract-Load-Transform (ELT) pipelines with the widespread adoption of cloud data warehouses. However, designing these pipelines often involves significant manual work to ensure correctness. Recent advances in AI-based methods, which have shown strong capabilities in data tasks, such as text-to-SQL, present an opportunity to alleviate manual efforts in developing ELT pipelines. Unfortunately, current benchmarks in data engineering only evaluate isolated tasks, such as using data tools and writing data transformation queries, leaving a significant gap in evaluating AI agents for generating end-to-end ELT pipelines.
  To fill this gap, we introduce ELT-Bench, an end-to-end benchmark designed to assess the capabilities of AI agents to build ELT pipelines. ELT-Bench consists of 100 pipelines, including 835 source tables and 203 data models across various domains. By simulating realistic scenarios involving the integration of diverse data sources and the use of popular data tools, ELT-Bench evaluates AI agents' abilities in handling complex data engineering workflows. AI agents must interact with databases and data tools, write code and SQL queries, and orchestrate every pipeline stage. We evaluate two representative code agent frameworks, Spider-Agent and SWE-Agent, using six popular Large Language Models (LLMs) on ELT-Bench. The highest-performing agent, Spider-Agent Claude-3.7-Sonnet with extended thinking, correctly generates only 3.9% of data models, with an average cost of $4.30 and 89.3 steps per pipeline. Our experimental results demonstrate the challenges of ELT-Bench and highlight the need for a more advanced AI agent to reduce manual effort in ELT workflows.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Timo Brand, Daniel Faber, Stephan Held, Petra Mutzel</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce ZykovColor, a novel SAT-based algorithm to solve the graph coloring problem working on top of an encoding that mimics the Zykov tree. Our method is based on an approach of H\'ebrard and Katsirelos (2020) that employs a propagator to enforce transitivity constraints, incorporate lower bounds for search tree pruning, and enable inferred propagations. We leverage the recently introduced IPASIR-UP interface for CaDiCal to implement these techniques with a SAT solver. Furthermore, we propose new features that take advantage of the underlying SAT solver. These include modifying the integrated decision strategy with vertex domination hints and using incremental bottom-up search that allows to reuse learned clauses from previous calls. Additionally, we integrate a more efficient clique computation to improve the lower bounds during the search. We validate the effectiveness of each new feature through an experimental analysis. ZykovColor outperforms other state-of-the-art graph coloring implementations on the DIMACS benchmark set. Further experiments on random Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs show that our new approach dominates state-of-the-art SAT-based methods for both very sparse and highly dense graphs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruikang Liu, Yuxuan Sun, Manyi Zhang, Haoli Bai, Xianzhi Yu, Tiezheng Yu, Chun Yuan, Lu Hou</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in reasoning language models have demonstrated remarkable performance in complex tasks, but their extended chain-of-thought reasoning process increases inference overhead. While quantization has been widely adopted to reduce the inference cost of large language models, its impact on reasoning models remains understudied. In this study, we conduct the first systematic study on quantized reasoning models, evaluating the open-sourced DeepSeek-R1-Distilled Qwen and LLaMA families ranging from 1.5B to 70B parameters, and QwQ-32B. Our investigation covers weight, KV cache, and activation quantization using state-of-the-art algorithms at varying bit-widths, with extensive evaluation across mathematical (AIME, MATH-500), scientific (GPQA), and programming (LiveCodeBench) reasoning benchmarks. Our findings reveal that while lossless quantization can be achieved with W8A8 or W4A16 quantization, lower bit-widths introduce significant accuracy risks. We further identify model size, model origin, and task difficulty as critical determinants of performance. Contrary to expectations, quantized models do not exhibit increased output lengths. In addition, strategically scaling the model sizes or reasoning steps can effectively enhance the performance. All quantized models and codes will be open-sourced in https://github.com/ruikangliu/Quantized-Reasoning-Models.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04827">From Specificity to Generality: Revisiting Generalizable Artifacts in Detecting Face Deepfakes</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Long Ma, Zhiyuan Yan, Yize Chen, Jin Xu, Qinglang Guo, Hu Huang, Yong Liao, Hui Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting deepfakes has been an increasingly important topic, especially given the rapid development of AI generation techniques. In this paper, we ask: How can we build a universal detection framework that is effective for most facial deepfakes? One significant challenge is the wide variety of deepfake generators available, resulting in varying forgery artifacts (e.g., lighting inconsistency, color mismatch, etc). But should we ``teach" the detector to learn all these artifacts separately? It is impossible and impractical to elaborate on them all. So the core idea is to pinpoint the more common and general artifacts across different deepfakes. Accordingly, we categorize deepfake artifacts into two distinct yet complementary types: Face Inconsistency Artifacts (FIA) and Up-Sampling Artifacts (USA). FIA arise from the challenge of generating all intricate details, inevitably causing inconsistencies between the complex facial features and relatively uniform surrounding areas. USA, on the other hand, are the inevitable traces left by the generator's decoder during the up-sampling process. This categorization stems from the observation that all existing deepfakes typically exhibit one or both of these artifacts. To achieve this, we propose a new data-level pseudo-fake creation framework that constructs fake samples with only the FIA and USA, without introducing extra less-general artifacts. Specifically, we employ a super-resolution to simulate the USA, while design a Blender module that uses image-level self-blending on diverse facial regions to create the FIA. We surprisingly found that, with this intuitive design, a standard image classifier trained only with our pseudo-fake data can non-trivially generalize well to unseen deepfakes.</p>

<p>Abstract: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in modern society is heavily shifting the way that individuals carry out their tasks and activities. Employing AI-based systems raises challenges that designers and developers must address to ensure that humans remain in control of the interaction process, particularly in high-risk domains. This article presents a novel End-User Development (EUD) approach for black-box AI models through a redesigned user interface in the Rhino-Cyt platform, a medical AI-based decision-support system for medical professionals (more precisely, rhinocytologists) to carry out cell classification. The proposed interface empowers users to intervene in AI decision-making process by editing explanations and reconfiguring the model, influencing its future predictions. This work contributes to Human-Centered AI (HCAI) and EUD by discussing how explanation-driven interventions allow a blend of explainability, user intervention, and model reconfiguration, fostering a symbiosis between humans and user-tailored AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongtao Wang, Renchi Yang, Hewen Wang, Haoran Zheng, Jianliang Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Textual interaction networks (TINs) are an omnipresent data structure used to model the interplay between users and items on e-commerce websites, social networks, etc., where each interaction is associated with a text description. Classifying such textual interactions (TIC) finds extensive use in detecting spam reviews in e-commerce, fraudulent transactions in finance, and so on. Existing TIC solutions either (i) fail to capture the rich text semantics due to the use of context-free text embeddings, and/or (ii) disregard the bipartite structure and node heterogeneity of TINs, leading to compromised TIC performance. In this work, we propose SAFT, a new architecture that integrates language- and graph-based modules for the effective fusion of textual and structural semantics in the representation learning of interactions. In particular, line graph attention (LGA)/gated attention units (GAUs) and pretrained language models (PLMs) are capitalized on to model the interaction-level and token-level signals, which are further coupled via the proxy token in an iterative and contextualized fashion. Additionally, an efficient and theoretically-grounded approach is developed to encode the local and global topology information pertaining to interactions into structural embeddings. The resulting embeddings not only inject the structural features underlying TINs into the textual interaction encoding but also facilitate the design of graph sampling strategies. Extensive empirical evaluations on multiple real TIN datasets demonstrate the superiority of SAFT over the state-of-the-art baselines in TIC accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ming-Lun Lee, Han-Chang Chou,  Yan-Ann~Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning is a distributed machine learning framework to collaboratively train a global model without uploading privacy-sensitive data onto a centralized server. Usually, this framework is applied to edge devices such as smartphones, wearable devices, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices which closely collect information from users. However, these devices are mostly battery-powered. The update procedure of federated learning will constantly consume the battery power and the transmission bandwidth. In this work, we propose an update control for federated learning, FedSAUC, by considering the similarity of users' behaviors (models). At the server side, we exploit clustering algorithms to group devices with similar models. Then we select some representatives for each cluster to update information to train the model. We also implemented a testbed prototyping on edge devices for validating the performance. The experimental results show that this update control will not affect the training accuracy in the long run.</p>

<p>Abstract: The NP-complete combinatorial optimization task of assigning offsets to a set of buffers with known sizes and lifetimes so as to minimize total memory usage is called dynamic storage allocation (DSA). Existing DSA implementations bypass the theoretical state-of-the-art algorithms in favor of either fast but wasteful heuristics, or memory-efficient approaches that do not scale beyond one thousand buffers. The "AI memory wall", combined with deep neural networks' static architecture, has reignited interest in DSA. We present idealloc, a low-fragmentation, high-performance DSA implementation designed for million-buffer instances. Evaluated on a novel suite of particularly hard benchmarks from several domains, idealloc ranks first against four production implementations in terms of a joint effectiveness/robustness criterion.</p>

<p>Abstract: Typographic attacks exploit the interplay between text and visual content in multimodal foundation models, causing misclassifications when misleading text is embedded within images. However, existing datasets are limited in size and diversity, making it difficult to study such vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce SCAM, the largest and most diverse dataset of real-world typographic attack images to date, containing 1,162 images across hundreds of object categories and attack words. Through extensive benchmarking of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on SCAM, we demonstrate that typographic attacks significantly degrade performance, and identify that training data and model architecture influence the susceptibility to these attacks. Our findings reveal that typographic attacks persist in state-of-the-art Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) due to the choice of their vision encoder, though larger Large Language Models (LLMs) backbones help mitigate their vulnerability. Additionally, we demonstrate that synthetic attacks closely resemble real-world (handwritten) attacks, validating their use in research. Our work provides a comprehensive resource and empirical insights to facilitate future research toward robust and trustworthy multimodal AI systems.

<p>Abstract: We present Lunima-OmniLV (abbreviated as OmniLV), a universal multimodal multi-task framework for low-level vision that addresses over 100 sub-tasks across four major categories: image restoration, image enhancement, weak-semantic dense prediction, and stylization. OmniLV leverages both textual and visual prompts to offer flexible and user-friendly interactions. Built on Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based generative priors, our framework supports arbitrary resolutions -- achieving optimal performance at 1K resolution -- while preserving fine-grained details and high fidelity. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that separately encoding text and visual instructions, combined with co-training using shallow feature control, is essential to mitigate task ambiguity and enhance multi-task generalization. Our findings also reveal that integrating high-level generative tasks into low-level vision models can compromise detail-sensitive restoration. These insights pave the way for more robust and generalizable low-level vision systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Video generation assessment is essential for ensuring that generative models produce visually realistic, high-quality videos while aligning with human expectations. Current video generation benchmarks fall into two main categories: traditional benchmarks, which use metrics and embeddings to evaluate generated video quality across multiple dimensions but often lack alignment with human judgments; and large language model (LLM)-based benchmarks, though capable of human-like reasoning, are constrained by a limited understanding of video quality metrics and cross-modal consistency. To address these challenges and establish a benchmark that better aligns with human preferences, this paper introduces Video-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark featuring a rich prompt suite and extensive evaluation dimensions. This benchmark represents the first attempt to systematically leverage MLLMs across all dimensions relevant to video generation assessment in generative models. By incorporating few-shot scoring and chain-of-query techniques, Video-Bench provides a structured, scalable approach to generated video evaluation. Experiments on advanced models including Sora demonstrate that Video-Bench achieves superior alignment with human preferences across all dimensions. Moreover, in instances where our framework's assessments diverge from human evaluations, it consistently offers more objective and accurate insights, suggesting an even greater potential advantage over traditional human judgment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Llewyn Salt, Marcus Gallagher</p>
<p>Abstract: Algorithm Operating System (AlgOS) is an unopinionated, extensible, modular framework for algorithmic implementations. AlgOS offers numerous features: integration with Optuna for automated hyperparameter tuning; automated argument parsing for generic command-line interfaces; automated registration of new classes; and a centralised database for logging experiments and studies. These features are designed to reduce the overhead of implementing new algorithms and to standardise the comparison of algorithms. The standardisation of algorithmic implementations is crucial for reproducibility and reliability in research. AlgOS combines Abstract Syntax Trees with a novel implementation of the Observer pattern to control the logical flow of algorithmic segments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ran Xu, Wenqi Shi, Yuchen Zhuang, Yue Yu, Joyce C. Ho, Haoyu Wang, Carl Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems often struggle to handle multi-hop question-answering tasks accurately due to irrelevant context retrieval and limited complex reasoning capabilities. We introduce Collab-RAG, a collaborative training framework that leverages mutual enhancement between a white-box small language model (SLM) and a blackbox large language model (LLM) for RAG. Specifically, the SLM decomposes complex queries into simpler sub-questions, thus enhancing the accuracy of the retrieval and facilitating more effective reasoning by the black-box LLM. Concurrently, the black-box LLM provides feedback signals to improve the SLM's decomposition capability. We observe that Collab-RAG relies solely on supervision from an affordable black-box LLM without additional distillation from frontier LLMs, yet demonstrates strong generalization across multiple black-box LLMs. Experimental evaluations across five multi-hop QA datasets demonstrate that Collab-RAG substantially outperforms existing black-box-only and SLM fine-tuning baselines by 1.8%-14.2% on average. In particular, our fine-tuned 3B SLM surpasses a frozen 32B LLM in question decomposition, highlighting the efficiency of Collab-RAG in improving reasoning and retrieval for complex questions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Katja Karhu, Jussi Kasurinen, Kari Smolander</p>
<p>Abstract: In the software industry, artificial intelligence (AI) has been utilized more and more in software development activities. In some activities, such as coding, AI has already been an everyday tool, but in software testing activities AI it has not yet made a significant breakthrough. In this paper, the objective was to identify what kind of empirical research with industry context has been conducted on AI in software testing, as well as how AI has been adopted in software testing practice. To achieve this, we performed a systematic mapping study of recent (2020 and later) studies on AI adoption in software testing in the industry, and applied thematic analysis to identify common themes and categories, such as the real-world use cases and benefits, in the found papers. The observations suggest that AI is not yet heavily utilized in software testing, and still relatively few studies on AI adoption in software testing have been conducted in the industry context to solve real-world problems. Earlier studies indicated there was a noticeable gap between the actual use cases and actual benefits versus the expectations, which we analyzed further. While there were numerous potential use cases for AI in software testing, such as test case generation, code analysis, and intelligent test automation, the reported actual implementations and observed benefits were limited. In addition, the systematic mapping study revealed a potential problem with false positive search results in online databases when using the search string "artificial intelligence".</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Veronica Lachi, Antonio Longa, Beatrice Bevilacqua, Bruno Lepri, Andrea Passerini, Bruno Ribeiro</p>
<p>Abstract: Relational databases, organized into tables connected by primary-foreign key relationships, are a common format for organizing data. Making predictions on relational data often involves transforming them into a flat tabular format through table joins and feature engineering, which serve as input to tabular methods. However, designing features that fully capture complex relational patterns remains challenging. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a compelling alternative by inherently modeling these relationships, but their time overhead during inference limits their applicability for real-time scenarios. In this work, we aim to bridge this gap by leveraging existing feature engineering efforts to enhance the efficiency of GNNs in relational databases. Specifically, we use GNNs to capture complex relationships within relational databases, patterns that are difficult to featurize, while employing engineered features to encode temporal information, thereby avoiding the need to retain the entire historical graph and enabling the use of smaller, more efficient graphs. Our \textsc{LightRDL} approach not only improves efficiency, but also outperforms existing models. Experimental results on the RelBench benchmark demonstrate that our framework achieves up to $33\%$ performance improvement and a $526\times$ inference speedup compared to GNNs, making it highly suitable for real-time inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peng Liu, Heng-Chao Li, Sen Lei, Nanqing Liu, Bin Feng, Xiao Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Crowd counting, which is a key computer vision task, has emerged as a fundamental technology in crowd analysis and public safety management. However, challenges such as scale variations and complex backgrounds significantly impact the accuracy of crowd counting. To mitigate these issues, this paper proposes a robust Transformer-based crowd counting network, termed RCCFormer, specifically designed for background suppression and scale awareness. The proposed method incorporates a Multi-level Feature Fusion Module (MFFM), which meticulously integrates features extracted at diverse stages of the backbone architecture. It establishes a strong baseline capable of capturing intricate and comprehensive feature representations, surpassing traditional baselines. Furthermore, the introduced Detail-Embedded Attention Block (DEAB) captures contextual information and local details through global self-attention and local attention along with a learnable manner for efficient fusion. This enhances the model's ability to focus on foreground regions while effectively mitigating background noise interference. Additionally, we develop an Adaptive Scale-Aware Module (ASAM), with our novel Input-dependent Deformable Convolution (IDConv) as its fundamental building block. This module dynamically adapts to changes in head target shapes and scales, significantly improving the network's capability to accommodate large-scale variations. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated on the ShanghaiTech Part_A and Part_B, NWPU-Crowd, and QNRF datasets. The results demonstrate that our RCCFormer achieves excellent performance across all four datasets, showcasing state-of-the-art outcomes.</p>

<p>Abstract: Self-handover, transferring an object between one's own hands, is a common but understudied bimanual action. While it facilitates seamless transitions in complex tasks, the strategies underlying its execution remain largely unexplored. Here, we introduce the first systematic taxonomy of self-handover, derived from manual annotation of over 12 hours of cooking activity performed by 21 participants. Our analysis reveals that self-handover is not merely a passive transition, but a highly coordinated action involving anticipatory adjustments by both hands. As a step toward automated analysis of human manipulation, we further demonstrate the feasibility of classifying self-handover types using a state-of-the-art vision-language model. These findings offer fresh insights into bimanual coordination, underscoring the role of self-handover in enabling smooth task transitions-an ability essential for adaptive dual-arm robotics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rean Fernandes, Andr\'e Biedenkapp, Frank Hutter, Noor Awad</p>
<p>Abstract: Legal reasoning tasks present unique challenges for large language models (LLMs) due to the complexity of domain-specific knowledge and reasoning processes. This paper investigates how effectively smaller language models (Llama 2 7B and Llama 3 8B) can be fine-tuned with a limited dataset of 1,514 Multi-state Bar Examination (MBE) questions to improve legal question answering accuracy. We evaluate these models on the 2022 MBE questions licensed from JD Advising, the same dataset used in the 'GPT-4 passes the Bar exam' study. Our methodology involves collecting approximately 200 questions per legal domain across 7 domains. We distill the dataset using Llama 3 (70B) to transform explanations into a structured IRAC (Issue, Rule, Application, Conclusion) format as a guided reasoning process to see if it results in better performance over the non-distilled dataset. We compare the non-fine-tuned models against their supervised fine-tuned (SFT) counterparts, trained for different sample sizes per domain, to study the effect on accuracy and prompt adherence. We also analyse option selection biases and their mitigation following SFT. In addition, we consolidate the performance across multiple variables: prompt type (few-shot vs zero-shot), answer ordering (chosen-option first vs generated-explanation first), response format (Numbered list vs Markdown vs JSON), and different decoding temperatures. Our findings show that domain-specific SFT helps some model configurations achieve close to human baseline performance, despite limited computational resources and a relatively small dataset. We release both the gathered SFT dataset and the family of Supervised Fine-tuned (SFT) adapters optimised for MBE performance. This establishes a practical lower bound on resources needed towards achieving effective legal question answering in smaller LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Neural audio codecs have recently gained traction for their ability to compress high-fidelity audio and generate discrete tokens that can be utilized in downstream generative modeling tasks. However, leading approaches often rely on resource-intensive models and multi-quantizer architectures, resulting in considerable computational overhead and constrained real-world applicability. In this paper, we present SQCodec, a lightweight neural audio codec that leverages a single quantizer to address these limitations. SQCodec explores streamlined convolutional networks and local Transformer modules, alongside TConv, a novel mechanism designed to capture acoustic variations across multiple temporal scales, thereby enhancing reconstruction fidelity while reducing model complexity. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets show that SQCodec achieves audio quality comparable to multi-quantizer baselines, while its single-quantizer design offers enhanced adaptability and its lightweight architecture reduces resource consumption by an order of magnitude.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jos\'e Pombal, Dongkeun Yoon, Patrick Fernandes, Ian Wu, Seungone Kim, Ricardo Rei, Graham Neubig, Andr\'e F. T. Martins</p>
<p>Abstract: The use of language models for automatically evaluating long-form text (LLM-as-a-judge) is becoming increasingly common, yet most LLM judges are optimized exclusively for English, with strategies for enhancing their multilingual evaluation capabilities remaining largely unexplored in the current literature. This has created a disparity in the quality of automatic evaluation methods for non-English languages, ultimately hindering the development of models with better multilingual capabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce M-Prometheus, a suite of open-weight LLM judges ranging from 3B to 14B parameters that can provide both direct assessment and pairwise comparison feedback on multilingual outputs. M-Prometheus models outperform state-of-the-art open LLM judges on multilingual reward benchmarks spanning more than 20 languages, as well as on literary machine translation (MT) evaluation covering 4 language pairs. Furthermore, M-Prometheus models can be leveraged at decoding time to significantly improve generated outputs across all 3 tested languages, showcasing their utility for the development of better multilingual models. Lastly, through extensive ablations, we identify the key factors for obtaining an effective multilingual judge, including backbone model selection and training on natively multilingual feedback data instead of translated data. We release our models, training dataset, and code.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces the art project The Dream Within Huang Long Cave, an AI-driven interactive and immersive narrative experience. The project offers new insights into AI technology, artistic practice, and psychoanalysis. Inspired by actual geographical landscapes and familial archetypes, the work combines psychoanalytic theory and computational technology, providing an artistic response to the concept of the non-existence of the Big Other. The narrative is driven by a combination of a large language model (LLM) and a realistic digital character, forming a virtual agent named YELL. Through dialogue and exploration within a cave automatic virtual environment (CAVE), the audience is invited to unravel the language puzzles presented by YELL and help him overcome his life challenges. YELL is a fictional embodiment of the Big Other, modeled after the artist's real father. Through a cross-temporal interaction with this digital father, the project seeks to deconstruct complex familial relationships. By demonstrating the non-existence of the Big Other, we aim to underscore the authenticity of interpersonal emotions, positioning art as a bridge for emotional connection and understanding within family dynamics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Edoardo Del Bianco, Davide Torielli, Federico Rollo, Damiano Gasperini, Arturo Laurenzi, Lorenzo Baccelliere, Luca Muratore, Marco Roveri, Nikos G. Tsagarakis</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern humanoid robots have shown their promising potential for executing various tasks involving the grasping and manipulation of objects using their end-effectors. Nevertheless, in the most of the cases, the grasping and manipulation actions involve low to moderate payload and interaction forces. This is due to limitations often presented by the end-effectors, which can not match their arm-reachable payload, and hence limit the payload that can be grasped and manipulated. In addition, grippers usually do not embed adequate perception in their hardware, and grasping actions are mainly driven by perception sensors installed in the rest of the robot body, frequently affected by occlusions due to the arm motions during the execution of the grasping and manipulation tasks. To address the above, we developed a modular high grasping force gripper equipped with embedded multi-modal perception functionalities. The proposed gripper can generate a grasping force of 110 N in a compact implementation. The high grasping force capability is combined with embedded multi-modal sensing, which includes an eye-in-hand camera, a Time-of-Flight (ToF) distance sensor, an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and an omnidirectional microphone, permitting the implementation of perception-driven grasping functionalities.
  We extensively evaluated the grasping force capacity of the gripper by introducing novel payload evaluation metrics that are a function of the robot arm's dynamic motion and gripper thermal states. We also evaluated the embedded multi-modal sensing by performing perception-guided enhanced grasping operations.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper studies constrained Markov decision processes (CMDPs) with constraints against stochastic thresholds, aiming at safety of reinforcement learning in unknown and uncertain environments. We leverage a Growing-Window estimator sampling from interactions with the uncertain and dynamic environment to estimate the thresholds, based on which we design Stochastic Pessimistic-Optimistic Thresholding (SPOT), a novel model-based primal-dual algorithm for multiple constraints against stochastic thresholds. SPOT enables reinforcement learning under both pessimistic and optimistic threshold settings. We prove that our algorithm achieves sublinear regret and constraint violation; i.e., a reward regret of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ while allowing an $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ constraint violation over $T$ episodes. The theoretical guarantees show that our algorithm achieves performance comparable to that of an approach relying on fixed and clear thresholds. To the best of our knowledge, SPOT is the first reinforcement learning algorithm that realises theoretical guaranteed performance in an uncertain environment where even thresholds are unknown.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ming Li, Ruiyi Zhang, Jian Chen, Jiuxiang Gu, Yufan Zhou, Franck Dernoncourt, Wanrong Zhu, Tianyi Zhou, Tong Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the existing evolution of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), a non-neglectable limitation remains in their struggle with visual text grounding, especially in text-rich images of documents. Document images, such as scanned forms and infographics, highlight critical challenges due to their complex layouts and textual content. However, current benchmarks do not fully address these challenges, as they mostly focus on visual grounding on natural images, rather than text-rich document images. Thus, to bridge this gap, we introduce TRIG, a novel task with a newly designed instruction dataset for benchmarking and improving the Text-Rich Image Grounding capabilities of MLLMs in document question-answering. Specifically, we propose an OCR-LLM-human interaction pipeline to create 800 manually annotated question-answer pairs as a benchmark and a large-scale training set of 90$ synthetic data based on four diverse datasets. A comprehensive evaluation of various MLLMs on our proposed benchmark exposes substantial limitations in their grounding capability on text-rich images. In addition, we propose two simple and effective TRIG methods based on general instruction tuning and plug-and-play efficient embedding, respectively. By finetuning MLLMs on our synthetic dataset, they promisingly improve spatial reasoning and grounding capabilities.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper studies continual test-time adaptation (CTTA), the task of adapting a model to constantly changing unseen domains in testing while preserving previously learned knowledge. Existing CTTA methods mostly focus on adaptation to the current test domain only, overlooking generalization to arbitrary test domains a model may face in the future. To tackle this limitation, we present a novel online domain-invariant learning framework for CTTA, dubbed DiCoTTA. DiCoTTA aims to learn feature representation to be invariant to both current and previous test domains on the fly during testing. To this end, we propose a new model architecture and a test-time adaptation strategy dedicated to learning domain-invariant features without corrupting semantic contents, along with a new data structure and optimization algorithm for effectively managing information from previous test domains. DiCoTTA achieved state-of-the-art performance on four public CTTA benchmarks. Moreover, it showed superior generalization to unseen test domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Congcong Wen, Yiting Lin, Xiaokang Qu, Nan Li, Yong Liao, Hui Lin, Xiang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent progress in VLMs has demonstrated impressive capabilities across a variety of tasks in the natural image domain. Motivated by these advancements, the remote sensing community has begun to adopt VLMs for remote sensing vision-language tasks, including scene understanding, image captioning, and visual question answering. However, existing remote sensing VLMs typically rely on closed-set scene understanding and focus on generic scene descriptions, yet lack the ability to incorporate external knowledge. This limitation hinders their capacity for semantic reasoning over complex or context-dependent queries that involve domain-specific or world knowledge. To address these challenges, we first introduced a multimodal Remote Sensing World Knowledge (RSWK) dataset, which comprises high-resolution satellite imagery and detailed textual descriptions for 14,141 well-known landmarks from 175 countries, integrating both remote sensing domain knowledge and broader world knowledge. Building upon this dataset, we proposed a novel Remote Sensing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RS-RAG) framework, which consists of two key components. The Multi-Modal Knowledge Vector Database Construction module encodes remote sensing imagery and associated textual knowledge into a unified vector space. The Knowledge Retrieval and Response Generation module retrieves and re-ranks relevant knowledge based on image and/or text queries, and incorporates the retrieved content into a knowledge-augmented prompt to guide the VLM in producing contextually grounded responses. We validated the effectiveness of our approach on three representative vision-language tasks, including image captioning, image classification, and visual question answering, where RS-RAG significantly outperformed state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of large language models (LLMs), they can present unintended biases and harmful behaviors driven by encoded values, emphasizing the urgent need to understand the value mechanisms behind them. However, current research primarily evaluates these values through external responses with a focus on AI safety, lacking interpretability and failing to assess social values in real-world contexts. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called ValueExploration, which aims to explore the behavior-driven mechanisms of National Social Values within LLMs at the neuron level. As a case study, we focus on Chinese Social Values and first construct C-voice, a large-scale bilingual benchmark for identifying and evaluating Chinese Social Values in LLMs. By leveraging C-voice, we then identify and locate the neurons responsible for encoding these values according to activation difference. Finally, by deactivating these neurons, we analyze shifts in model behavior, uncovering the internal mechanism by which values influence LLM decision-making. Extensive experiments on four representative LLMs validate the efficacy of our framework. The benchmark and code will be available.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose a neural-network based survival model (SurvSurf) specifically designed for direct and simultaneous probabilistic prediction of the first hitting time of sequential events from baseline. Unlike existing models, SurvSurf is theoretically guaranteed to never violate the monotonic relationship between the cumulative incidence functions of sequential events, while allowing nonlinear influence from predictors. It also incorporates implicit truths for unobserved intermediate events in model fitting, and supports both discrete and continuous time and events. We also identified a variant of the Integrated Brier Score (IBS) that showed robust correlation with the mean squared error (MSE) between the true and predicted probabilities by accounting for implied truths about the missing intermediate events. We demonstrated the superiority of SurvSurf compared to modern and traditional predictive survival models in two simulated datasets and two real-world datasets, using MSE, the more robust IBS and by measuring the extent of monotonicity violation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stefan Buijsman, Herman Veluwenkamp</p>
<p>Abstract: AI Impact Assessments are only as good as the measures used to assess the impact of these systems. It is therefore paramount that we can justify our choice of metrics in these assessments, especially for difficult to quantify ethical and social values. We present a two-step approach to ensure metrics are properly motivated. First, a conception needs to be spelled out (e.g. Rawlsian fairness or fairness as solidarity) and then a metric can be fitted to that conception. Both steps require separate justifications, as conceptions can be judged on how well they fit with the function of, for example, fairness. We argue that conceptual engineering offers helpful tools for this step. Second, metrics need to be fitted to a conception. We illustrate this process through an examination of competing fairness metrics to illustrate that here the additional content that a conception offers helps us justify the choice for a specific metric. We thus advocate that impact assessments are not only clear on their metrics, but also on the conceptions that motivate those metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Charco Hui, Yalu Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: Natural language processing models often face challenges due to limited labeled data, especially in domain specific areas, e.g., clinical trials. To overcome this, text augmentation techniques are commonly used to increases sample size by transforming the original input data into artificial ones with the label preserved. However, traditional text classification methods ignores the relationship between augmented texts and treats them as independent samples which may introduce classification error. Therefore, we propose a novel approach called 'Batch Aggregation' (BAGG) which explicitly models the dependence of text inputs generated through augmentation by incorporating an additional layer that aggregates results from correlated texts. Through studying multiple benchmark data sets across different domains, we found that BAGG can improve classification accuracy. We also found that the increase of performance with BAGG is more obvious in domain specific data sets, with accuracy improvements of up to 10-29%. Through the analysis of benchmark data, the proposed method addresses limitations of traditional techniques and improves robustness in text classification tasks. Our result demonstrates that BAGG offers more robust results and outperforms traditional approaches when training data is limited.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuan Zhang, Xiang Deng, Hongxing Yuan, Chunyu Wei, Yushun Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, diffusion-based recommendation methods have achieved impressive results. However, existing approaches predominantly treat each user's historical interactions as independent training samples, overlooking the potential of higher-order collaborative signals between users and items. Such signals, which encapsulate richer and more nuanced relationships, can be naturally captured using graph-based data structures. To address this limitation, we extend diffusion-based recommendation methods to the graph domain by directly modeling user-item bipartite graphs with diffusion models. This enables better modeling of the higher-order connectivity inherent in complex interaction dynamics. However, this extension introduces two primary challenges: (1) Noise Heterogeneity, where interactions are influenced by various forms of continuous and discrete noise, and (2) Relation Explosion, referring to the high computational costs of processing large-scale graphs. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Graph-based Diffusion Model for Collaborative Filtering (GDMCF). To address noise heterogeneity, we introduce a multi-level noise corruption mechanism that integrates both continuous and discrete noise, effectively simulating real-world interaction complexities. To mitigate relation explosion, we design a user-active guided diffusion process that selectively focuses on the most meaningful edges and active users, reducing inference costs while preserving the graph's topological integrity. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that GDMCF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its effectiveness in capturing higher-order collaborative signals and improving recommendation performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiawei Lian, Jianhong Pan, Lefan Wang, Yi Wang, Shaohui Mei, Lap-Pui Chau</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are foundational explorations to artificial general intelligence, yet their alignment with human values via instruction tuning and preference learning achieves only superficial compliance. Here, we demonstrate that harmful knowledge embedded during pretraining persists as indelible "dark patterns" in LLMs' parametric memory, evading alignment safeguards and resurfacing under adversarial inducement at distributional shifts. In this study, we first theoretically analyze the intrinsic ethical vulnerability of aligned LLMs by proving that current alignment methods yield only local "safety regions" in the knowledge manifold. In contrast, pretrained knowledge remains globally connected to harmful concepts via high-likelihood adversarial trajectories. Building on this theoretical insight, we empirically validate our findings by employing semantic coherence inducement under distributional shifts--a method that systematically bypasses alignment constraints through optimized adversarial prompts. This combined theoretical and empirical approach achieves a 100% attack success rate across 19 out of 23 state-of-the-art aligned LLMs, including DeepSeek-R1 and LLaMA-3, revealing their universal vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>Abstract: Novice content creators often invest significant time recording expressive speech for social media videos. While recent advancements in text-to-speech (TTS) technology can generate highly realistic speech in various languages and accents, many struggle with unintuitive or overly granular TTS interfaces. We propose simplifying TTS generation by allowing users to specify high-level context alongside their script. Our Wizard-of-Oz system, SpeakEasy, leverages user-provided context to inform and influence TTS output, enabling iterative refinement with high-level feedback. This approach was informed by two 8-subject formative studies: one examining content creators' experiences with TTS, and the other drawing on effective strategies from voice actors. Our evaluation shows that participants using SpeakEasy were more successful in generating performances matching their personal standards, without requiring significantly more effort than leading industry interfaces.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jon Guti\'errez Zaballa, Koldo Basterretxea, Javier Echanobe</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning-based embedded systems for safety-critical applications, such as aerospace and autonomous driving, must be robust to perturbations caused by soft errors. As transistor geometries shrink and voltages decrease, modern electronic devices become more susceptible to background radiation, increasing the concern about failures produced by soft errors. The resilience of deep neural networks (DNNs) to these errors depends not only on target device technology but also on model structure and the numerical representation and arithmetic precision of their parameters. Compression techniques like pruning and quantization, used to reduce memory footprint and computational complexity, alter both model structure and representation, affecting soft error robustness. In this regard, although often overlooked, the choice of activation functions (AFs) impacts not only accuracy and trainability but also compressibility and error resilience. This paper explores the use of bounded AFs to enhance robustness against parameter perturbations, while evaluating their effects on model accuracy, compressibility, and computational load with a technology-agnostic approach. We focus on encoder-decoder convolutional models developed for semantic segmentation of hyperspectral images with application to autonomous driving systems. Experiments are conducted on an AMD-Xilinx's KV260 SoM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Suhang Gu, Ye Wang, Yongxin Chou, Jinliang Cong, Mingli Lu, Zhuqing Jiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Clustering is an efficient and essential technique for exploring latent knowledge of data. However, limited attention has been given to the interpretability of the clusters detected by most clustering algorithms. In addition, due to the homogeneity of data, different groups of data have their own homogeneous styles. In this paper, the above two aspects are considered, and an interpretable style Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy clustering (IS-TSK-FC) algorithm is proposed. The clustering behavior of IS-TSK-FC is fully guided by the TSK fuzzy inference on fuzzy rules. In particular, samples are grouped into clusters represented by the corresponding consequent vectors of all fuzzy rules learned in an unsupervised manner. This can explain how the clusters are generated in detail, thus making the underlying decision-making process of the IS-TSK-FC interpretable. Moreover, a series of style matrices are introduced to facilitate the consequents of fuzzy rules in IS-TSK-FC by capturing the styles of clusters as well as the nuances between different styles. Consequently, all the fuzzy rules in IS-TSK-FC have powerful data representation capability. After determining the antecedents of all the fuzzy rules, the optimization problem of IS-TSK-FC can be iteratively solved in an alternation manner. The effectiveness of IS-TSK-FC as an interpretable clustering tool is validated through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets with unknown implicit/explicit styles. Specially, the superior clustering performance of IS-TSK-FC is demonstrated on case studies where different groups of data present explicit styles.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bingyang Wang, Kaer Huang, Bin Li, Yiqiang Yan, Lihe Zhang, Huchuan Lu, You He</p>
<p>Abstract: Open-World Tracking (OWT) aims to track every object of any category, which requires the model to have strong generalization capabilities. Trackers can improve their generalization ability by leveraging Visual Language Models (VLMs). However, challenges arise with the fine-tuning strategies when VLMs are transferred to OWT: full fine-tuning results in excessive parameter and memory costs, while the zero-shot strategy leads to sub-optimal performance. To solve the problem, EffOWT is proposed for efficiently transferring VLMs to OWT. Specifically, we build a small and independent learnable side network outside the VLM backbone. By freezing the backbone and only executing backpropagation on the side network, the model's efficiency requirements can be met. In addition, EffOWT enhances the side network by proposing a hybrid structure of Transformer and CNN to improve the model's performance in the OWT field. Finally, we implement sparse interactions on the MLP, thus reducing parameter updates and memory costs significantly. Thanks to the proposed methods, EffOWT achieves an absolute gain of 5.5% on the tracking metric OWTA for unknown categories, while only updating 1.3% of the parameters compared to full fine-tuning, with a 36.4% memory saving. Other metrics also demonstrate obvious improvement.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leonardo Kanashiro Felizardo, Edoardo Fadda, Paolo Brandimarte, Emilio Del-Moral-Hernandez, Mari\'a Cristina Vasconcelos Nascimento</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents Post-Decision Proximal Policy Optimization (PDPPO), a novel variation of the leading deep reinforcement learning method, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). The PDPPO state transition process is divided into two steps: a deterministic step resulting in the post-decision state and a stochastic step leading to the next state. Our approach incorporates post-decision states and dual critics to reduce the problem's dimensionality and enhance the accuracy of value function estimation. Lot-sizing is a mixed integer programming problem for which we exemplify such dynamics. The objective of lot-sizing is to optimize production, delivery fulfillment, and inventory levels in uncertain demand and cost parameters. This paper evaluates the performance of PDPPO across various environments and configurations. Notably, PDPPO with a dual critic architecture achieves nearly double the maximum reward of vanilla PPO in specific scenarios, requiring fewer episode iterations and demonstrating faster and more consistent learning across different initializations. On average, PDPPO outperforms PPO in environments with a stochastic component in the state transition. These results support the benefits of using a post-decision state. Integrating this post-decision state in the value function approximation leads to more informed and efficient learning in high-dimensional and stochastic environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuechun Shao, Yinfeng Yu, Liejun Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition (MER) seeks to integrate various modalities to predict emotional states accurately. However, most current research focuses solely on the fusion of audio and text features, overlooking the valuable information in emotion labels. This oversight could potentially hinder the performance of existing methods, as emotion labels harbor rich, insightful information that could significantly aid MER. We introduce a novel model called Label Signal-Guided Multimodal Emotion Recognition (LSGMER) to overcome this limitation. This model aims to fully harness the power of emotion label information to boost the classification accuracy and stability of MER. Specifically, LSGMER employs a Label Signal Enhancement module that optimizes the representation of modality features by interacting with audio and text features through label embeddings, enabling it to capture the nuances of emotions precisely. Furthermore, we propose a Joint Objective Optimization(JOO) approach to enhance classification accuracy by introducing the Attribution-Prediction Consistency Constraint (APC), which strengthens the alignment between fused features and emotion categories. Extensive experiments conducted on the IEMOCAP and MELD datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed LSGMER model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingcan Wang, Junchang Xin, Luxuan Qu, Qi Chen, Zhiqiong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The score-based structure learning of Bayesian network (BN) is an effective way to learn BN models, which are regarded as some of the most compelling probabilistic graphical models in the field of representation and reasoning under uncertainty. However, the search space of structure learning grows super-exponentially as the number of variables increases, which makes BN structure learning an NP-hard problem, as well as a combination optimization problem (COP). Despite the successes of many heuristic methods on it, the results of the structure learning of BN are usually unsatisfactory. Inspired by Q-learning, in this paper, a Bayesian network structure learning algorithm via reinforcement learning-based (RL-based) search strategy is proposed, namely RLBayes. The method borrows the idea of RL and tends to record and guide the learning process by a dynamically maintained Q-table. By creating and maintaining the dynamic Q-table, RLBayes achieve storing the unlimited search space within limited space, thereby achieving the structure learning of BN via Q-learning. Not only is it theoretically proved that RLBayes can converge to the global optimal BN structure, but also it is experimentally proved that RLBayes has a better effect than almost all other heuristic search algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bonan Ding, Jin Xie, Jing Nie, Jiale Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal 3D object detection based on deep neural networks has indeed made significant progress. However, it still faces challenges due to the misalignment of scale and spatial information between features extracted from 2D images and those derived from 3D point clouds. Existing methods usually aggregate multimodal features at a single stage. However, leveraging multi-stage cross-modal features is crucial for detecting objects of various scales. Therefore, these methods often struggle to integrate features across different scales and modalities effectively, thereby restricting the accuracy of detection. Additionally, the time-consuming Query-Key-Value-based (QKV-based) cross-attention operations often utilized in existing methods aid in reasoning the location and existence of objects by capturing non-local contexts. However, this approach tends to increase computational complexity. To address these challenges, we present SSLFusion, a novel Scale & Space Aligned Latent Fusion Model, consisting of a scale-aligned fusion strategy (SAF), a 3D-to-2D space alignment module (SAM), and a latent cross-modal fusion module (LFM). SAF mitigates scale misalignment between modalities by aggregating features from both images and point clouds across multiple levels. SAM is designed to reduce the inter-modal gap between features from images and point clouds by incorporating 3D coordinate information into 2D image features. Additionally, LFM captures cross-modal non-local contexts in the latent space without utilizing the QKV-based attention operations, thus mitigating computational complexity. Experiments on the KITTI and DENSE datasets demonstrate that our SSLFusion outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our approach obtains an absolute gain of 2.15% in 3D AP, compared with the state-of-art method GraphAlign on the moderate level of the KITTI test set.</p>

<p>Abstract: Fault diagnosis in multimode processes plays a critical role in ensuring the safe operation of industrial systems across multiple modes. It faces a great challenge yet to be addressed - that is, the significant distributional differences among monitoring data from multiple modes make it difficult for the models to extract shared feature representations related to system health conditions. In response to this problem, this paper introduces a novel method called attention-based multi-scale temporal fusion network. The multi-scale depthwise convolution and gated recurrent unit are employed to extract multi-scale contextual local features and long-short-term features. A temporal attention mechanism is designed to focus on critical time points with higher cross-mode shared information, thereby enhancing the accuracy of fault diagnosis. The proposed model is applied to Tennessee Eastman process dataset and three-phase flow facility dataset. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior diagnostic performance and maintains a small model size.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Li, Yang Zou, Christopher Ellis, Ruben Purdy, Shawn Blanton, Jos\'e M. F. Moura</p>
<p>Abstract: While many EDA tasks already involve graph-based data, existing LLMs in EDA primarily either represent graphs as sequential text, or simply ignore graph-structured data that might be beneficial like dataflow graphs of RTL code. Recent studies have found that LLM performance suffers when graphs are represented as sequential text, and using additional graph information significantly boosts performance. To address these challenges, we introduce BRIDGES, a framework designed to incorporate graph modality into LLMs for EDA tasks. BRIDGES integrates an automated data generation workflow, a solution that combines graph modality with LLM, and a comprehensive evaluation suite. First, we establish an LLM-driven workflow to generate RTL and netlist-level data, converting them into dataflow and netlist graphs with function descriptions. This workflow yields a large-scale dataset comprising over 500,000 graph instances and more than 1.5 billion tokens. Second, we propose a lightweight cross-modal projector that encodes graph representations into text-compatible prompts, enabling LLMs to effectively utilize graph data without architectural modifications. Experimental results demonstrate 2x to 10x improvements across multiple tasks compared to text-only baselines, including accuracy in design retrieval, type prediction and perplexity in function description, with negligible computational overhead (<1% model weights increase and <30% additional runtime overhead). Even without additional LLM finetuning, our results outperform text-only by a large margin. We plan to release BRIDGES, including the dataset, models, and training flow.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kidist Amde Mekonnen, Yubao Tang, Maarten de Rijke</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative information retrieval (GenIR) is a promising neural retrieval paradigm that formulates document retrieval as a document identifier (docid) generation task, allowing for end-to-end optimization toward a unified global retrieval objective. However, existing GenIR models suffer from token-level misalignment, where models trained to predict the next token often fail to capture document-level relevance effectively. While reinforcement learning-based methods, such as reinforcement learning from relevance feedback (RLRF), aim to address this misalignment through reward modeling, they introduce significant complexity, requiring the optimization of an auxiliary reward function followed by reinforcement fine-tuning, which is computationally expensive and often unstable. To address these challenges, we propose direct document relevance optimization (DDRO), which aligns token-level docid generation with document-level relevance estimation through direct optimization via pairwise ranking, eliminating the need for explicit reward modeling and reinforcement learning. Experimental results on benchmark datasets, including MS MARCO document and Natural Questions, show that DDRO outperforms reinforcement learning-based methods, achieving a 7.4% improvement in MRR@10 for MS MARCO and a 19.9% improvement for Natural Questions. These findings highlight DDRO's potential to enhance retrieval effectiveness with a simplified optimization approach. By framing alignment as a direct optimization problem, DDRO simplifies the ranking optimization pipeline of GenIR models while offering a viable alternative to reinforcement learning-based methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Min Park, Yan Kyaw Tun, Walid Saad, Choong Seon Hong</p>
<p>Abstract: Beamforming is a key technology in millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications that improves signal transmission by optimizing directionality and intensity. However, conventional channel estimation methods, such as pilot signals or beam sweeping, often fail to adapt to rapidly changing communication environments. To address this limitation, multimodal sensing-aided beam prediction has gained significant attention, using various sensing data from devices such as LiDAR, radar, GPS, and RGB images to predict user locations or network conditions. Despite its promising potential, the adoption of multimodal sensing-aided beam prediction is hindered by high computational complexity, high costs, and limited datasets. Thus, in this paper, a resource-efficient learning approach is proposed to transfer knowledge from a multimodal network to a monomodal (radar-only) network based on cross-modal relational knowledge distillation (CRKD), while reducing computational overhead and preserving predictive accuracy. To enable multimodal learning with realistic data, a novel multimodal simulation framework is developed while integrating sensor data generated from the autonomous driving simulator CARLA with MATLAB-based mmWave channel modeling, and reflecting real-world conditions. The proposed CRKD achieves its objective by distilling relational information across different feature spaces, which enhances beam prediction performance without relying on expensive sensor data. Simulation results demonstrate that CRKD efficiently distills multimodal knowledge, allowing a radar-only model to achieve $94.62\%$ of the teacher performance. In particular, this is achieved with just $10\%$ of the teacher network's parameters, thereby significantly reducing computational complexity and dependence on multimodal sensor data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Robust localization of lymph nodes (LNs) in multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) is critical for the assessment of lymphadenopathy. Radiologists routinely measure the size of LN to distinguish benign from malignant nodes, which would require subsequent cancer staging. Sizing is a cumbersome task compounded by the diverse appearances of LNs in mpMRI, which renders their measurement difficult. Furthermore, smaller and potentially metastatic LNs could be missed during a busy clinical day. To alleviate these imaging and workflow problems, we propose a pipeline to universally detect both benign and metastatic nodes in the body for their ensuing measurement. The recently proposed VFNet neural network was employed to identify LN in T2 fat suppressed and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) sequences acquired by various scanners with a variety of exam protocols. We also use a selective augmentation technique known as Intra-Label LISA (ILL) to diversify the input data samples the model sees during training, such that it improves its robustness during the evaluation phase. We achieved a sensitivity of $\sim$83\% with ILL vs. $\sim$80\% without ILL at 4 FP/vol. Compared with current LN detection approaches evaluated on mpMRI, we show a sensitivity improvement of $\sim$9\% at 4 FP/vol.</p>

<p>Abstract: Radiologists routinely perform the tedious task of lesion localization, classification, and size measurement in computed tomography (CT) studies. Universal lesion detection and tagging (ULDT) can simultaneously help alleviate the cumbersome nature of lesion measurement and enable tumor burden assessment. Previous ULDT approaches utilize the publicly available DeepLesion dataset, however it does not provide the full volumetric (3D) extent of lesions and also displays a severe class imbalance. In this work, we propose a self-training pipeline to detect 3D lesions and tag them according to the body part they occur in. We used a significantly limited 30\% subset of DeepLesion to train a VFNet model for 2D lesion detection and tagging. Next, the 2D lesion context was expanded into 3D, and the mined 3D lesion proposals were integrated back into the baseline training data in order to retrain the model over multiple rounds. Through the self-training procedure, our VFNet model learned from its own predictions, detected lesions in 3D, and tagged them. Our results indicated that our VFNet model achieved an average sensitivity of 46.9\% at [0.125:8] false positives (FP) with a limited 30\% data subset in comparison to the 46.8\% of an existing approach that used the entire DeepLesion dataset. To our knowledge, we are the first to jointly detect lesions in 3D and tag them according to the body part label.</p>

<p>Abstract: Universal lesion detection and tagging (ULDT) in CT studies is critical for tumor burden assessment and tracking the progression of lesion status (growth/shrinkage) over time. However, a lack of fully annotated data hinders the development of effective ULDT approaches. Prior work used the DeepLesion dataset (4,427 patients, 10,594 studies, 32,120 CT slices, 32,735 lesions, 8 body part labels) for algorithmic development, but this dataset is not completely annotated and contains class imbalances. To address these issues, in this work, we developed a self-training pipeline for ULDT. A VFNet model was trained on a limited 11.5\% subset of DeepLesion (bounding boxes + tags) to detect and classify lesions in CT studies. Then, it identified and incorporated novel lesion candidates from a larger unseen data subset into its training set, and self-trained itself over multiple rounds. Multiple self-training experiments were conducted with different threshold policies to select predicted lesions with higher quality and cover the class imbalances. We discovered that direct self-training improved the sensitivities of over-represented lesion classes at the expense of under-represented classes. However, upsampling the lesions mined during self-training along with a variable threshold policy yielded a 6.5\% increase in sensitivity at 4 FP in contrast to self-training without class balancing (72\% vs 78.5\%) and a 11.7\% increase compared to the same self-training policy without upsampling (66.8\% vs 78.5\%). Furthermore, we show that our results either improved or maintained the sensitivity at 4FP for all 8 lesion classes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joshua Hatherley</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning (ML) systems are vulnerable to performance decline over time due to dataset shift. To address this problem, experts often suggest that ML systems should be regularly updated to ensure ongoing performance stability. Some scholarly literature has begun to address the epistemic and ethical challenges associated with different updating methodologies. Thus far, however, little attention has been paid to the impact of model updating on the ML-assisted decision-making process itself, particularly in the AI ethics and AI epistemology literatures. This article aims to address this gap in the literature. It argues that model updating introduces a new sub-type of opacity into ML-assisted decision-making -- update opacity -- that occurs when users cannot understand how or why an update has changed the reasoning or behaviour of an ML system. This type of opacity presents a variety of distinctive epistemic and safety concerns that available solutions to the black box problem in ML are largely ill-equipped to address. A variety of alternative strategies may be developed or pursued to address the problem of update opacity more directly, including bi-factual explanations, dynamic model reporting, and update compatibility. However, each of these strategies presents its own risks or carries significant limitations. Further research will be needed to address the epistemic and safety concerns associated with model updating and update opacity going forward.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hengran Zhang, Keping Bi, Jiafeng Guo, Xiaojie Sun, Shihao Liu, Daiting Shi, Dawei Yin, Xueqi Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Dense retrieval is a crucial task in Information Retrieval (IR) and is the foundation for downstream tasks such as re-ranking. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown compelling semantic understanding capabilities and are appealing to researchers studying dense retrieval. LLMs, as decoder-style generative models, are competent at language generation while falling short on modeling global information due to the lack of attention to tokens afterward. Inspired by the classical word-based language modeling approach for IR, i.e., the query likelihood (QL) model, we seek to sufficiently utilize LLMs' generative ability by QL maximization. However, instead of ranking documents with QL estimation, we introduce an auxiliary task of QL maximization to yield a better backbone for contrastively learning a discriminative retriever. We name our model as LLM-QL. To condense global document semantics to a single vector during QL modeling, LLM-QL has two major components, Attention Stop (AS) and Input Corruption (IC). AS stops the attention of predictive tokens to previous tokens until the ending token of the document. IC masks a portion of tokens in the input documents during prediction. Experiments on MSMARCO show that LLM-QL can achieve significantly better performance than other LLM-based retrievers and using QL estimated by LLM-QL for ranking outperforms word-based QL by a large margin.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hengran Zhang, Minghao Tang, Keping Bi, Jiafeng Guo, Shihao Liu, Daiting Shi, Dawei Yin, Xueqi Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval models typically rely on costly human-labeled query-document relevance annotations for training and evaluation. To reduce this cost and leverage the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in relevance judgments, we aim to explore whether LLM-generated annotations can effectively replace human annotations in training retrieval models. Retrieval usually emphasizes relevance, which indicates "topic-relatedness" of a document to a query, while in RAG, the value of a document (or utility) depends on how it contributes to answer generation. Recognizing this mismatch, some researchers use LLM performance on downstream tasks with documents as labels, but this approach requires manual answers for specific tasks, leading to high costs and limited generalization. In another line of work, prompting LLMs to select useful documents as RAG references eliminates the need for human annotation and is not task-specific. If we leverage LLMs' utility judgments to annotate retrieval data, we may retain cross-task generalization without human annotation in large-scale corpora. Therefore, we investigate utility-focused annotation via LLMs for large-scale retriever training data across both in-domain and out-of-domain settings on the retrieval and RAG tasks. To reduce the impact of low-quality positives labeled by LLMs, we design a novel loss function, i.e., Disj-InfoNCE. Our experiments reveal that: (1) Retrievers trained on utility-focused annotations significantly outperform those trained on human annotations in the out-of-domain setting on both tasks, demonstrating superior generalization capabilities. (2) LLM annotation does not replace human annotation in the in-domain setting. However, incorporating just 20% human-annotated data enables retrievers trained with utility-focused annotations to match the performance of models trained entirely with human annotations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marius Almanst\"otter, Roman Vetter, Dagmar Iber</p>
<p>Abstract: Parameter estimation for differential equations from measured data is an inverse problem prevalent across quantitative sciences. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as effective tools for solving such problems, especially with sparse measurements and incomplete system information. However, PINNs face convergence issues, stability problems, overfitting, and complex loss function design. Here we introduce PINNverse, a training paradigm that addresses these limitations by reformulating the learning process as a constrained differential optimization problem. This approach achieves a dynamic balance between data loss and differential equation residual loss during training while preventing overfitting. PINNverse combines the advantages of PINNs with the Modified Differential Method of Multipliers to enable convergence on any point on the Pareto front. We demonstrate robust and accurate parameter estimation from noisy data in four classical ODE and PDE models from physics and biology. Our method enables accurate parameter inference also when the forward problem is expensive to solve.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05254">Explaining Low Perception Model Competency with High-Competency Counterfactuals</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sara Pohland, Claire Tomlin</p>
<p>Abstract: There exist many methods to explain how an image classification model generates its decision, but very little work has explored methods to explain why a classifier might lack confidence in its prediction. As there are various reasons the classifier might lose confidence, it would be valuable for this model to not only indicate its level of uncertainty but also explain why it is uncertain. Counterfactual images have been used to visualize changes that could be made to an image to generate a different classification decision. In this work, we explore the use of counterfactuals to offer an explanation for low model competency--a generalized form of predictive uncertainty that measures confidence. Toward this end, we develop five novel methods to generate high-competency counterfactual images, namely Image Gradient Descent (IGD), Feature Gradient Descent (FGD), Autoencoder Reconstruction (Reco), Latent Gradient Descent (LGD), and Latent Nearest Neighbors (LNN). We evaluate these methods across two unique datasets containing images with six known causes for low model competency and find Reco, LGD, and LNN to be the most promising methods for counterfactual generation. We further evaluate how these three methods can be utilized by pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to generate language explanations for low model competency. We find that the inclusion of a counterfactual image in the language model query greatly increases the ability of the model to generate an accurate explanation for the cause of low model competency, thus demonstrating the utility of counterfactual images in explaining low perception model competency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adri\'an Bazaga, Rexhina Blloshmi, Bill Byrne, Adri\`a de Gispert</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for generating coherent text, understanding context, and performing reasoning tasks. However, they struggle with temporal reasoning, which requires processing time-related information such as event sequencing, durations, and inter-temporal relationships. These capabilities are critical for applications including question answering, scheduling, and historical analysis. In this paper, we introduce TISER, a novel framework that enhances the temporal reasoning abilities of LLMs through a multi-stage process that combines timeline construction with iterative self-reflection. Our approach leverages test-time scaling to extend the length of reasoning traces, enabling models to capture complex temporal dependencies more effectively. This strategy not only boosts reasoning accuracy but also improves the traceability of the inference process. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, including out-of-distribution test sets, and reveal that TISER enables smaller open-source models to surpass larger closed-weight models on challenging temporal reasoning tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Training large AI models efficiently requires distributing computation across multiple accelerators, but this often incurs significant communication overhead -- especially during gradient synchronization. We introduce Dion, a communication-efficient optimizer that retains the synchronous semantics of standard distributed training (e.g., DDP, FSDP) while substantially reducing I/O costs. Unlike conventional optimizers that synchronize full gradient matrices, Dion leverages orthonormalized updates with device-local momentum buffers, eliminating the need for full gradient exchange. It further supports an efficient sharding strategy that avoids reconstructing large matrices during training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sangbeom Lim, Junwan Kim, Heeji Yoon, Jaewoo Jung, Seungryong Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Region-level captioning aims to generate natural language descriptions for specific image regions while highlighting their distinguishing features. However, existing methods struggle to produce unique captions across multi-granularity, limiting their real-world applicability. To address the need for detailed region-level understanding, we introduce URECA dataset, a large-scale dataset tailored for multi-granularity region captioning. Unlike prior datasets that focus primarily on salient objects, URECA dataset ensures a unique and consistent mapping between regions and captions by incorporating a diverse set of objects, parts, and background elements. Central to this is a stage-wise data curation pipeline, where each stage incrementally refines region selection and caption generation. By leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) at each stage, our pipeline produces distinctive and contextually grounded captions with improved accuracy and semantic diversity. Building upon this dataset, we present URECA, a novel captioning model designed to effectively encode multi-granularity regions. URECA maintains essential spatial properties such as position and shape through simple yet impactful modifications to existing MLLMs, enabling fine-grained and semantically rich region descriptions. Our approach introduces dynamic mask modeling and a high-resolution mask encoder to enhance caption uniqueness. Experiments show that URECA achieves state-of-the-art performance on URECA dataset and generalizes well to existing region-level captioning benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Moran Barenboim, Vadim Indelman</p>
<p>Abstract: Decision-making under uncertainty is a critical aspect of many practical autonomous systems due to incomplete information. Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) offer a mathematically principled framework for formulating decision-making problems under such conditions. However, finding an optimal solution for a POMDP is generally intractable. In recent years, there has been a significant progress of scaling approximate solvers from small to moderately sized problems, using online tree search solvers. Often, such approximate solvers are limited to probabilistic or asymptotic guarantees towards the optimal solution. In this paper, we derive a deterministic relationship for discrete POMDPs between an approximated and the optimal solution. We show that at any time, we can derive bounds that relate between the existing solution and the optimal one. We show that our derivations provide an avenue for a new set of algorithms and can be attached to existing algorithms that have a certain structure to provide them with deterministic guarantees with marginal computational overhead. In return, not only do we certify the solution quality, but we demonstrate that making a decision based on the deterministic guarantee may result in superior performance compared to the original algorithm without the deterministic certification.</p>

<p>Abstract: Autonomous agents that execute human tasks by controlling computers can enhance human productivity and application accessibility. However, progress in this field will be driven by realistic and reproducible benchmarks. We present AndroidWorld, a fully functional Android environment that provides reward signals for 116 programmatic tasks across 20 real-world Android apps. Unlike existing interactive environments, which provide a static test set, AndroidWorld dynamically constructs tasks that are parameterized and expressed in natural language in unlimited ways, thus enabling testing on a much larger and more realistic suite of tasks. To ensure reproducibility, each task includes dedicated initialization, success-checking, and tear-down logic, which modifies and inspects the device's system state. We experiment with baseline agents to test AndroidWorld and provide initial results on the benchmark. Our best agent can complete 30.6% of AndroidWorld's tasks, leaving ample room for future work. Furthermore, we adapt a popular desktop web agent to work on Android, which we find to be less effective on mobile, suggesting future research is needed to achieve universal, cross-platform agents. Finally, we also conduct a robustness analysis, showing that task variations can significantly affect agent performance, demonstrating that without such testing, agent performance metrics may not fully reflect practical challenges.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yichi Zhang, Zhuo Chen, Lingbing Guo, Yajing Xu, Binbin Hu, Ziqi Liu, Wen Zhang, Huajun Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning high-quality multi-modal entity representations is an important goal of multi-modal knowledge graph (MMKG) representation learning, which can enhance reasoning tasks within the MMKGs, such as MMKG completion (MMKGC). The main challenge is to collaboratively model the structural information concealed in massive triples and the multi-modal features of the entities. Existing methods focus on crafting elegant entity-wise multi-modal fusion strategies, yet they overlook the utilization of multi-perspective features concealed within the modalities under diverse relational contexts. To address this issue, we introduce a novel framework with Mixture of Modality Knowledge experts (MoMoK for short) to learn adaptive multi-modal entity representations for better MMKGC. We design relation-guided modality knowledge experts to acquire relation-aware modality embeddings and integrate the predictions from multi-modalities to achieve joint decisions. Additionally, we disentangle the experts by minimizing their mutual information. Experiments on four public MMKG benchmarks demonstrate the outstanding performance of MoMoK under complex scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaoyan Chen, Olga Mashkova, Fernando Zhapa-Camacho, Robert Hoehndorf, Yuan He, Ian Horrocks</p>
<p>Abstract: Ontologies are widely used for representing domain knowledge and meta data, playing an increasingly important role in Information Systems, the Semantic Web, Bioinformatics and many other domains. However, logical reasoning that ontologies can directly support are quite limited in learning, approximation and prediction. One straightforward solution is to integrate statistical analysis and machine learning. To this end, automatically learning vector representation for knowledge of an ontology i.e., ontology embedding has been widely investigated. Numerous papers have been published on ontology embedding, but a lack of systematic reviews hinders researchers from gaining a comprehensive understanding of this field. To bridge this gap, we write this survey paper, which first introduces different kinds of semantics of ontologies and formally defines ontology embedding as well as its property of faithfulness. Based on this, it systematically categorizes and analyses a relatively complete set of over 80 papers, according to the ontologies they aim at and their technical solutions including geometric modeling, sequence modeling and graph propagation. This survey also introduces the applications of ontology embedding in ontology engineering, machine learning augmentation and life sciences, presents a new library mOWL and discusses the challenges and future directions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdul Karim Gizzini, Yahia Medjahdi, Ali J. Ghandour, Laurent Clavier</p>
<p>Abstract: The support of artificial intelligence (AI) based decision-making is a key element in future 6G networks, where the concept of native AI will be introduced. Moreover, AI is widely employed in different critical applications such as autonomous driving and medical diagnosis. In such applications, using AI as black-box models is risky and challenging. Hence, it is crucial to understand and trust the decisions taken by these models. Tackling this issue can be achieved by developing explainable AI (XAI) schemes that aim to explain the logic behind the black-box model behavior, and thus, ensure its efficient and safe deployment. Recently, we proposed a novel perturbation-based XAI-CHEST framework that is oriented toward channel estimation in wireless communications. The core idea of the XAI-CHEST framework is to identify the relevant model inputs by inducing high noise on the irrelevant ones. This manuscript provides the detailed theoretical foundations of the XAI-CHEST framework. In particular, we derive the analytical expressions of the XAI-CHEST loss functions and the noise threshold fine-tuning optimization problem. Hence the designed XAI-CHEST delivers a smart input feature selection methodology that can further improve the overall performance while optimizing the architecture of the employed model. Simulation results show that the XAI-CHEST framework provides valid interpretations, where it offers an improved bit error rate performance while reducing the required computational complexity in comparison to the classical DL-based channel estimation.</p>

Llama 3.1 consistently underperformed, relying on heuristics and exhibiting frequent inconsistencies and contradictions. The findings highlight the challenges of achieving robust and generalizable reasoning in LLMs, and underscore the need for further development to mitigate biases in artificial general intelligence (AGI). The study emphasizes the importance of integrating statistical reasoning and ethical considerations in future AI development.</p>

<p>Abstract: LLM-based judges have emerged as a scalable alternative to human evaluation and are increasingly used to assess, compare, and improve models. However, the reliability of LLM-based judges themselves is rarely scrutinized. As LLMs become more advanced, their responses grow more sophisticated, requiring stronger judges to evaluate them. Existing benchmarks primarily focus on a judge's alignment with human preferences, but often fail to account for more challenging tasks where crowdsourced human preference is a poor indicator of factual and logical correctness. To address this, we propose a novel evaluation framework to objectively evaluate LLM-based judges. Based on this framework, we propose JudgeBench, a benchmark for evaluating LLM-based judges on challenging response pairs spanning knowledge, reasoning, math, and coding. JudgeBench leverages a novel pipeline for converting existing difficult datasets into challenging response pairs with preference labels reflecting objective correctness. Our comprehensive evaluation on a collection of prompted judges, fine-tuned judges, multi-agent judges, and reward models shows that JudgeBench poses a significantly greater challenge than previous benchmarks, with many strong models (e.g., GPT-4o) performing just slightly better than random guessing. Overall, JudgeBench offers a reliable platform for assessing increasingly advanced LLM-based judges. Data and code are available at https://github.com/ScalerLab/JudgeBench.</p>

<p>Abstract: The advancements in cloud-based Large Languages Models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI-assisted programming. However, their integration into certain local development environments like ones within the Apple software ecosystem (e.g., iOS apps, macOS) remains challenging due to computational demands and sandboxed constraints. This paper presents CAMP, a multi-model AI-assisted programming framework that consists of a local model that employs Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to retrieve contextual information from the codebase to facilitate context-aware prompt construction thus optimizing the performance of the cloud model, empowering LLMs' capabilities in local Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). The methodology is actualized in Copilot for Xcode, an AI-assisted programming tool crafted for Xcode that employs the RAG module to address software constraints and enables diverse generative programming tasks, including automatic code completion, documentation, error detection, and intelligent user-agent interaction. The results from objective experiments on generated code quality and subjective experiments on user adoption collectively demonstrate the pilot success of the proposed system and mark its significant contributions to the realm of AI-assisted programming.</p>

TESSA introduces two agents: a general annotation agent and a domain-specific annotation agent. The general agent captures common patterns and knowledge across multiple source domains, leveraging both time-series-wise and text-wise features to generate general annotations. Meanwhile, the domain-specific agent utilizes limited annotations from the target domain to learn domain-specific terminology and generate targeted annotations. Extensive experiments on multiple synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that TESSA effectively generates high-quality annotations, outperforming existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Duo Wu, Jinghe Wang, Yuan Meng, Yanning Zhang, Le Sun, Zhi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Utilizing large language models (LLMs) for tool planning has emerged as a promising avenue for developing general AI systems, where LLMs automatically schedule external tools (e.g. vision models) to tackle complex tasks based on task descriptions. To push this paradigm toward practical applications, it is crucial for LLMs to consider tool execution costs (e.g. execution time) for tool planning. Unfortunately, prior studies overlook the tool execution costs, leading to the generation of expensive plans of which the costs outweigh task performance. To fill this gap, we propose the Cost-Aware Tool Planning with LLMs (CATP-LLM) framework, which for the first time provides a coherent design to empower LLMs for cost-aware tool planning. Specifically, CATP-LLM incorporates a tool planning language to enhance the LLM to generate non-sequential plans of multiple branches for efficient concurrent tool execution and cost reduction. Moreover, it further designs a cost-aware offline reinforcement learning algorithm to fine-tune the LLM to optimize the performance-cost trade-off in tool planning. In lack of public cost-related datasets, we further present OpenCATP, the first platform for cost-aware planning evaluation. Experiments on OpenCATP show that CATP-LLM outperforms GPT-4 even when using Llama2-7B as its backbone, with the average improvement of 28.2%-30.2% higher plan performance and 24.7%-45.8% lower costs even on the challenging planning tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianming Liu, Jirong Yang, Yafeng Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: In transportation system demand modeling and simulation, agent-based models and microsimulations are current state-of-the-art approaches. However, existing agent-based models still have some limitations on behavioral realism and resource demand that limit their applicability. In this study, leveraging the emerging technology of large language models (LLMs) and LLM-based agents, we propose a general LLM-agent-based modeling framework for transportation systems. We argue that LLM agents not only possess the essential capabilities to function as agents but also offer promising solutions to overcome some limitations of existing agent-based models. Our conceptual framework design closely replicates the decision-making and interaction processes and traits of human travelers within transportation networks, and we demonstrate that the proposed systems can meet critical behavioral criteria for decision-making and learning behaviors using related studies and a demonstrative example of LLM agents' learning and adjustment in the bottleneck setting. Although further refinement of the LLM-agent-based modeling framework is necessary, we believe that this approach has the potential to improve transportation system modeling and simulation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Du, Shang Liu, Lele Zheng, Yang Cao, Atsuyoshi Nakamura, Lei Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning has emerged as a critical process in leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for specific downstream tasks, enabling these models to achieve state-of-the-art performance across various domains. However, the fine-tuning process often involves sensitive datasets, introducing privacy risks that exploit the unique characteristics of this stage. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of privacy challenges associated with fine-tuning LLMs, highlighting vulnerabilities to various privacy attacks, including membership inference, data extraction, and backdoor attacks. We further review defense mechanisms designed to mitigate privacy risks in the fine-tuning phase, such as differential privacy, federated learning, and knowledge unlearning, discussing their effectiveness and limitations in addressing privacy risks and maintaining model utility. By identifying key gaps in existing research, we highlight challenges and propose directions to advance the development of privacy-preserving methods for fine-tuning LLMs, promoting their responsible use in diverse applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: The MCP Solver bridges Large Language Models (LLMs) with symbolic solvers through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), an open-source standard for AI system integration. Providing LLMs access to formal solving and reasoning capabilities addresses their key deficiency while leveraging their strengths. Our implementation offers interfaces for constraint programming (Minizinc), propositional satisfiability (PySAT), and SAT modulo Theories (Python Z3).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Faria Huq, Zora Zhiruo Wang, Frank F. Xu, Tianyue Ou, Shuyan Zhou, Jeffrey P. Bigham, Graham Neubig</p>
<p>Abstract: While much work on web agents emphasizes the promise of autonomously performing tasks on behalf of users, in reality, agents often fall short on complex tasks in real-world contexts and modeling user preference. This presents an opportunity for humans to collaborate with the agent and leverage the agent's capabilities effectively. We propose CowPilot, a framework supporting autonomous as well as human-agent collaborative web navigation, and evaluation across task success and task efficiency. CowPilot reduces the number of steps humans need to perform by allowing agents to propose next steps, while users are able to pause, reject, or take alternative actions. During execution, users can interleave their actions with the agent by overriding suggestions or resuming agent control when needed. We conducted case studies on five common websites and found that the human-agent collaborative mode achieves the highest success rate of 95% while requiring humans to perform only 15.2% of the total steps. Even with human interventions during task execution, the agent successfully drives up to half of task success on its own. CowPilot can serve as a useful tool for data collection and agent evaluation across websites, which we believe will enable research in how users and agents can work together. Video demonstrations are available at https://oaishi.github.io/cowpilot.html</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Libo Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: To reduce the cost and consumption of computing resources caused by computational redundancy and delayed reward assignment in long CoT, this research proposes the dynamic chain-of-thought (D-CoT) with adaptive reasoning time and steps. The researcher used simulation experiment to simulate the integration of D-CoT through Python 3.13 IDLE combined with a Python simulator based on GPTs. At the same time, the researcher used DeepSeek R1 as a control group to test and compare the performance of the D-CoT simulator in processing MIT OpenCourseWare's linear algebra exam questions. Experimental results show that D-CoT is better than DeepSeek R1 based on long CoT in three indicators: reasoning time, CoT length (reasoning steps) and token count, which achieves a significant reduction in computing resource consumption. In addition, this research has potential value in deep reasoning optimization that is used as a reference for future dynamic deep reasoning frameworks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bingchen Liu, Jingchen Li, Yuanyuan Fang, Xin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Zero-shot learning (ZL) is crucial for tasks involving unseen categories, such as natural language processing, image classification, and cross-lingual transfer.Current applications often fail to accurately infer and handle new relations orentities involving unseen categories, severely limiting their scalability and prac-ticality in open-domain scenarios. ZL learning faces the challenge of effectivelytransferring semantic information of unseen categories in multi-modal knowledgegraph (MMKG) embedding representation learning. In this paper, we proposeZSLLM, a framework for zero-shot embedding learning of MMKGs using largelanguage models (LLMs). We leverage textual modality information of unseencategories as prompts to fully utilize the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, enablingsemantic information transfer across different modalities for unseen categories.Through model-based learning, the embedding representation of unseen cate-gories in MMKG is enhanced. Extensive experiments conducted on multiplereal-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared tostate-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: AI presents a novel tool for deciphering the motivations behind human behaviors. We show that by varying prompts to a large language model, we can elicit a full range of human behaviors in a variety of different scenarios in terms of classic economic games. Then by analyzing which prompts are needed to elicit which behaviors, we can infer (decipher) the motivations behind the human behaviors. We also show how one can analyze the prompts to reveal relationships between the classic economic games, providing new insight into what different economic scenarios induce people to think about. We also show how this deciphering process can be used to understand differences in the behavioral tendencies of different populations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyu Wang, Christopher M. Poskitt, Jun Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Agents built on LLMs are increasingly deployed across diverse domains, automating complex decision-making and task execution. However, their autonomy introduces safety risks, including security vulnerabilities, legal violations, and unintended harmful actions. Existing mitigation methods, such as model-based safeguards and early enforcement strategies, fall short in robustness, interpretability, and adaptability. To address these challenges, we propose AgentSpec, a lightweight domain-specific language for specifying and enforcing runtime constraints on LLM agents. With AgentSpec, users define structured rules that incorporate triggers, predicates, and enforcement mechanisms, ensuring agents operate within predefined safety boundaries. We implement AgentSpec across multiple domains, including code execution, embodied agents, and autonomous driving, demonstrating its adaptability and effectiveness. Our evaluation shows that AgentSpec successfully prevents unsafe executions in over 90% of code agent cases, eliminates all hazardous actions in embodied agent tasks, and enforces 100% compliance by autonomous vehicles (AVs). Despite its strong safety guarantees, AgentSpec remains computationally lightweight, with overheads in milliseconds. By combining interpretability, modularity, and efficiency, AgentSpec provides a practical and scalable solution for enforcing LLM agent safety across diverse applications. We also automate the generation of rules using LLMs and assess their effectiveness. Our evaluation shows that the rules generated by OpenAI o1 achieve a precision of 95.56% and recall of 70.96% for embodied agents, successfully identifying 87.26% of the risky code, and prevent AVs from breaking laws in 5 out of 8 scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a multi-agent application system designed to enhance office collaboration efficiency and work quality. The system integrates artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural language processing technologies, achieving functionalities such as task allocation, progress monitoring, and information sharing. The agents within the system are capable of providing personalized collaboration support based on team members' needs and incorporate data analysis tools to improve decision-making quality. The paper also proposes an intelligent agent architecture that separates Plan and Solver, and through techniques such as multi-turn query rewriting and business tool retrieval, it enhances the agent's multi-intent and multi-turn dialogue capabilities. Furthermore, the paper details the design of tools and multi-turn dialogue in the context of office collaboration scenarios, and validates the system's effectiveness through experiments and evaluations. Ultimately, the system has demonstrated outstanding performance in real business applications, particularly in query understanding, task planning, and tool calling. Looking forward, the system is expected to play a more significant role in addressing complex interaction issues within dynamic environments and large-scale multi-agent systems.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21668">Cognitive Science-Inspired Evaluation of Core Capabilities for Object Understanding in AI</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Danaja Rutar, Alva Markelius, Konstantinos Voudouris, Jos\'e Hern\'andez-Orallo, Lucy Cheke</p>
<p>Abstract: One of the core components of our world models is 'intuitive physics' - an understanding of objects, space, and causality. This capability enables us to predict events, plan action and navigate environments, all of which rely on a composite sense of objecthood. Despite its importance, there is no single, unified account of objecthood, though multiple theoretical frameworks provide insights. In the first part of this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of the main theoretical frameworks in objecthood research - Gestalt psychology, enactive cognition, and developmental psychology - and identify the core capabilities each framework attributes to object understanding, as well as what functional roles they play in shaping world models in biological agents. Given the foundational role of objecthood in world modelling, understanding objecthood is also essential in AI. In the second part of the paper, we evaluate how current AI paradigms approach and test objecthood capabilities compared to those in cognitive science. We define an AI paradigm as a combination of how objecthood is conceptualised, the methods used for studying objecthood, the data utilised, and the evaluation techniques. We find that, whilst benchmarks can detect that AI systems model isolated aspects of objecthood, the benchmarks cannot detect when AI systems lack functional integration across these capabilities, not solving the objecthood challenge fully. Finally, we explore novel evaluation approaches that align with the integrated vision of objecthood outlined in this paper. These methods are promising candidates for advancing from isolated object capabilities toward general-purpose AI with genuine object understanding in real-world contexts.</p>

<p>Abstract: The advent of generative AI exemplified by large language models (LLMs) opens new ways to represent and compute geographic information and transcends the process of geographic knowledge production, driving geographic information systems (GIS) towards autonomous GIS. Leveraging LLMs as the decision core, autonomous GIS can independently generate and execute geoprocessing workflows to perform spatial analysis. In this vision paper, we further elaborate on the concept of autonomous GIS and present a conceptual framework that defines its five autonomous goals, five autonomous levels, five core functions, and three operational scales. We demonstrate how autonomous GIS could perform geospatial data retrieval, spatial analysis, and map making with four proof-of-concept GIS agents. We conclude by identifying critical challenges and future research directions, including fine-tuning and self-growing decision-cores, autonomous modeling, and examining the societal and practical implications of autonomous GIS. By establishing the groundwork for a paradigm shift in GIScience, this paper envisions a future where GIS moves beyond traditional workflows to autonomously reason, derive, innovate, and advance geospatial solutions to pressing global challenges. As we design and deploy increasingly intelligent geospatial systems, we have a responsibility to ensure they are developed in socially responsible ways, serve the public good, and support the continued value of human geographic insight in an AI-augmented future.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce PaperBench, a benchmark evaluating the ability of AI agents to replicate state-of-the-art AI research. Agents must replicate 20 ICML 2024 Spotlight and Oral papers from scratch, including understanding paper contributions, developing a codebase, and successfully executing experiments. For objective evaluation, we develop rubrics that hierarchically decompose each replication task into smaller sub-tasks with clear grading criteria. In total, PaperBench contains 8,316 individually gradable tasks. Rubrics are co-developed with the author(s) of each ICML paper for accuracy and realism. To enable scalable evaluation, we also develop an LLM-based judge to automatically grade replication attempts against rubrics, and assess our judge's performance by creating a separate benchmark for judges. We evaluate several frontier models on PaperBench, finding that the best-performing tested agent, Claude 3.5 Sonnet (New) with open-source scaffolding, achieves an average replication score of 21.0%. Finally, we recruit top ML PhDs to attempt a subset of PaperBench, finding that models do not yet outperform the human baseline. We open-source our code (https://github.com/openai/preparedness) to facilitate future research in understanding the AI engineering capabilities of AI agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxiang Zheng, Dayuan Fu, Xiangkun Hu, Xiaojie Cai, Lyumanshan Ye, Pengrui Lu, Pengfei Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) equipped with web search capabilities have demonstrated impressive potential for deep research tasks. However, current approaches predominantly rely on either manually engineered prompts (prompt engineering-based) with brittle performance or reinforcement learning within controlled Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) environments (RAG-based) that fail to capture the complexities of real-world interaction. In this paper, we introduce DeepResearcher, the first comprehensive framework for end-to-end training of LLM-based deep research agents through scaling reinforcement learning (RL) in real-world environments with authentic web search interactions. Unlike RAG-based approaches that assume all necessary information exists within a fixed corpus, our method trains agents to navigate the noisy, unstructured, and dynamic nature of the open web. We implement a specialized multi-agent architecture where browsing agents extract relevant information from various webpage structures and overcoming significant technical challenges. Extensive experiments on open-domain research tasks demonstrate that DeepResearcher achieves substantial improvements of up to 28.9 points over prompt engineering-based baselines and up to 7.2 points over RAG-based RL agents. Our qualitative analysis reveals emergent cognitive behaviors from end-to-end RL training, including the ability to formulate plans, cross-validate information from multiple sources, engage in self-reflection to redirect research, and maintain honesty when unable to find definitive answers. Our results highlight that end-to-end training in real-world web environments is not merely an implementation detail but a fundamental requirement for developing robust research capabilities aligned with real-world applications.

It allows us to enhance a natural model of quantum computation -- permutational quantum computing (PQC) [Quantum Inf. Comput., 10, 470-497 (2010)] -- and define a more powerful model: PQC+. While PQC was shown to be efficiently classically simulatable, we exhibit a problem which can be efficiently solved on PQC+ machine, whereas no classical polynomial time algorithm is known; thus providing evidence against PQC+ being classically simulatable. We further discuss practical quantum machine learning algorithms which can be carried out in the paradigm of PQC+.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weihao Yu, Pan Zhou, Shuicheng Yan, Xinchao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Inspired by the long-range modeling ability of ViTs, large-kernel convolutions are widely studied and adopted recently to enlarge the receptive field and improve model performance, like the remarkable work ConvNeXt which employs 7x7 depthwise convolution. Although such depthwise operator only consumes a few FLOPs, it largely harms the model efficiency on powerful computing devices due to the high memory access costs. For example, ConvNeXt-T has similar FLOPs with ResNet-50 but only achieves ~60% throughputs when trained on A100 GPUs with full precision. Although reducing the kernel size of ConvNeXt can improve speed, it results in significant performance degradation, which poses a challenging problem: How to speed up large-kernel-based CNN models while preserving their performance. To tackle this issue, inspired by Inceptions, we propose to decompose large-kernel depthwise convolution into four parallel branches along channel dimension, i.e., small square kernel, two orthogonal band kernels, and an identity mapping. With this new Inception depthwise convolution, we build a series of networks, namely IncepitonNeXt, which not only enjoy high throughputs but also maintain competitive performance. For instance, InceptionNeXt-T achieves 1.6x higher training throughputs than ConvNeX-T, as well as attains 0.2% top-1 accuracy improvement on ImageNet-1K. We anticipate InceptionNeXt can serve as an economical baseline for future architecture design to reduce carbon footprint. Code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/inceptionnext.</p>

<p>Abstract: We develop a method that recovers the surface, materials, and illumination of a scene from its posed multi-view images. In contrast to prior work, it does not require any additional data and can handle glossy objects or bright lighting. It is a progressive inverse rendering approach, which consists of three stages. In the first stage, we reconstruct the scene radiance and signed distance function (SDF) with a novel regularization strategy for specular reflections. We propose to explain a pixel color using both surface and volume rendering jointly, which allows for handling complex view-dependent lighting effects for surface reconstruction. In the second stage, we distill light visibility and indirect illumination from the learned SDF and radiance field using learnable mapping functions. Finally, we design a method for estimating the ratio of incoming direct light reflected in a specular manner and use it to reconstruct the materials and direct illumination. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the current state-of-the-art in recovering surfaces, materials, and lighting without relying on any additional data.</p>

<p>Abstract: The purpose of multi-object tracking (MOT) is to continuously track and identify objects detected in videos. Currently, most methods for multi-object tracking model the motion information and combine it with appearance information to determine and track objects. In this paper, unfalsified control is employed to address the ID-switch problem in multi-object tracking. We establish sequences of appearance information variations for the trajectories during the tracking process and design a detection and rectification module specifically for ID-switch detection and recovery. We also propose a simple and effective strategy to address the issue of ambiguous matching of appearance information during the data association process. Experimental results on publicly available MOT datasets demonstrate that the tracker exhibits excellent effectiveness and robustness in handling tracking errors caused by occlusions and rapid movements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shams Forruque Ahmed, Md. Sakib Bin Alam, Maliha Kabir, Shaila Afrin, Sabiha Jannat Rafa, Aanushka Mehjabin, Amir H. Gandomi</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning (DL) allows computer models to learn, visualize, optimize, refine, and predict data. To understand its present state, examining the most recent advancements and applications of deep learning across various domains is essential. However, prior reviews focused on DL applications in only one or two domains. The current review thoroughly investigates the use of DL in four different broad fields due to the plenty of relevant research literature in these domains. This wide range of coverage provides a comprehensive and interconnected understanding of DL's influence and opportunities, which is lacking in other reviews. The study also discusses DL frameworks and addresses the benefits and challenges of utilizing DL in each field, which is only occasionally available in other reviews. DL frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch make it easy to develop innovative DL applications across diverse domains by providing model development and deployment platforms. This helps bridge theoretical progress and practical implementation. Deep learning solves complex problems and advances technology in many fields, demonstrating its revolutionary potential and adaptability. CNN LSTM models with attention mechanisms can forecast traffic with 99 percent accuracy. Fungal diseased mango leaves can be classified with 97.13 percent accuracy by the multi layer CNN model. However, deep learning requires rigorous data collection to analyze and process large amounts of data because it is independent of training data. Thus, large scale medical, research, healthcare, and environmental data compilation are challenging, reducing deep learning effectiveness. Future research should address data volume, privacy, domain complexity, and data quality issues in DL datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Quentin Bouniot, Ievgen Redko, Anton Mallasto, Charlotte Laclau, Oliver Struckmeier, Karol Arndt, Markus Heinonen, Ville Kyrki, Samuel Kaski</p>
<p>Abstract: In the last decade, we have witnessed the introduction of several novel deep neural network (DNN) architectures exhibiting ever-increasing performance across diverse tasks. Explaining the upward trend of their performance, however, remains difficult as different DNN architectures of comparable depth and width -- common factors associated with their expressive power -- may exhibit a drastically different performance even when trained on the same dataset. In this paper, we introduce the concept of the non-linearity signature of DNN, the first theoretically sound solution for approximately measuring the non-linearity of deep neural networks. Built upon a score derived from closed-form optimal transport mappings, this signature provides a better understanding of the inner workings of a wide range of DNN architectures and learning paradigms, with a particular emphasis on the computer vision task. We provide extensive experimental results that highlight the practical usefulness of the proposed non-linearity signature and its potential for long-reaching implications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Min Liu, Gang Yang, Siyuan Luo, Lin Shao</p>
<p>Abstract: Differentiable physics simulation provides an avenue to tackle previously intractable challenges through gradient-based optimization, thereby greatly improving the efficiency of solving robotics-related problems. To apply differentiable simulation in diverse robotic manipulation scenarios, a key challenge is to integrate various materials in a unified framework. We present SoftMAC, a differentiable simulation framework that couples soft bodies with articulated rigid bodies and clothes. SoftMAC simulates soft bodies with the continuum-mechanics-based Material Point Method (MPM). We provide a novel forecast-based contact model for MPM, which effectively reduces penetration without introducing other artifacts like unnatural rebound. To couple MPM particles with deformable and non-volumetric clothes meshes, we also propose a penetration tracing algorithm that reconstructs the signed distance field in local area. Diverging from previous works, SoftMAC simulates the complete dynamics of each modality and incorporates them into a cohesive system with an explicit and differentiable coupling mechanism. The feature empowers SoftMAC to handle a broader spectrum of interactions, such as soft bodies serving as manipulators and engaging with underactuated systems. We conducted comprehensive experiments to validate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed differentiable pipeline in downstream robotic manipulation applications. Supplementary materials and videos are available on our project website at https://minliu01.github.io/SoftMAC.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Collin Leiber, Dominik Mautz, Claudia Plant, Christian B\"ohm</p>
<p>Abstract: High-dimensional datasets often contain multiple meaningful clusterings in different subspaces. For example, objects can be clustered either by color, weight, or size, revealing different interpretations of the given dataset. A variety of approaches are able to identify such non-redundant clusterings. However, most of these methods require the user to specify the expected number of subspaces and clusters for each subspace. Stating these values is a non-trivial problem and usually requires detailed knowledge of the input dataset. In this paper, we propose a framework that utilizes the Minimum Description Length Principle (MDL) to detect the number of subspaces and clusters per subspace automatically. We describe an efficient procedure that greedily searches the parameter space by splitting and merging subspaces and clusters within subspaces. Additionally, an encoding strategy is introduced that allows us to detect outliers in each subspace. Extensive experiments show that our approach is highly competitive to state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiacheng Liu, Sewon Min, Luke Zettlemoyer, Yejin Choi, Hannaneh Hajishirzi</p>
<p>Abstract: Are $n$-gram language models still relevant in this era of neural large language models (LLMs)? Our answer is yes, and we showcase their values in both text analysis and improving neural LLMs. This was done by modernizing $n$-gram LMs in two aspects. First, we train them at the same data scale as neural LLMs -- 5 trillion tokens. This is the largest $n$-gram LM ever built. Second, existing $n$-gram LMs use small $n$ which hinders their performance; we instead allow $n$ to be arbitrarily large, by introducing a new $\infty$-gram LM with backoff. Instead of pre-computing $n$-gram count tables (which would be very expensive), we develop an engine named infini-gram -- powered by suffix arrays -- that can compute $\infty$-gram (as well as $n$-gram with arbitrary $n$) probabilities with millisecond-level latency. The $\infty$-gram framework and infini-gram engine enable us to conduct many novel and interesting analyses of human-written and machine-generated text: we find that the $\infty$-gram LM has fairly high accuracy for next-token prediction (47%), and can complement neural LLMs to greatly reduce their perplexity. When analyzing machine-generated text, we also observe irregularities in the machine--$\infty$-gram agreement level with respect to the suffix length, which indicates deficiencies in neural LLM pretraining and the positional embeddings of Transformers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhang Zhou, Paiheng Xu, Xiyao Wang, Xuan Lu, Ge Gao, Wei Ai</p>
<p>Abstract: Emojis, which encapsulate semantics beyond mere words or phrases, have become prevalent in social network communications. This has spurred increasing scholarly interest in exploring their attributes and functionalities. However, emoji-related research and application face two primary challenges. First, researchers typically rely on crowd-sourcing to annotate emojis in order to understand their sentiments, usage intentions, and semantic meanings. Second, subjective interpretations by users can often lead to misunderstandings of emojis and cause the communication barrier. Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant success in various annotation tasks, with ChatGPT demonstrating expertise across multiple domains. In our study, we assess ChatGPT's effectiveness in handling previously annotated and downstream tasks. Our objective is to validate the hypothesis that ChatGPT can serve as a viable alternative to human annotators in emoji research and that its ability to explain emoji meanings can enhance clarity and transparency in online communications. Our findings indicate that ChatGPT has extensive knowledge of emojis. It is adept at elucidating the meaning of emojis across various application scenarios and demonstrates the potential to replace human annotators in a range of tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gianluca Baldassarre, Richard J. Duro, Emilio Cartoni, Mehdi Khamassi, Alejandro Romero, Vieri Giuliano Santucci</p>
<p>Abstract: The unprecedented advancement of artificial intelligence enables the development of increasingly autonomous robots. These robots hold significant potential, particularly in moving beyond engineered factory settings to operate in the unstructured environments inhabited by humans. However, this possibility also generates a relevant autonomy-alignment problem to ensure that robots' autonomous learning processes still focus on acquiring knowledge relevant to accomplish human practical purposes, while their behaviour still aligns with their broader purposes. The literature has only begun to address this problem, and a conceptual, terminological, and formal framework is still lacking. Here we address one of the most challenging instances of the problem: autonomous open-ended learning (OEL) robots, capable of cumulatively acquiring new skills and knowledge through direct interaction with the environment, guided by self-generated goals and intrinsic motivations. In particular, we propose a computational framework, first introduced qualitatively and then formalised, to support the design of OEL robot architectures that balance autonomy and control. The framework pivots on the novel concept of purpose. A human purpose specifies what humans (e.g., designers or users) want the robot to learn, do or not do, within a certain boundary of autonomy and independently of the domains in which it operates.The framework decomposes the autonomy-alignment problem into more tractable sub-problems: the alignment of `robot purposes' with human purposes, either by hardwiring or through learning; the arbitration between multiple purposes; the grounding of purposes into specific domain-dependent robot goals; and the competence acquisition needed to accomplish these goals. The framework and its potential utility are further elucidated through the discussion of hypothetical example scenarios framed within it.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiatong Li, Wei Liu, Zhihao Ding, Wenqi Fan, Yuqiang Li, Qing Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in biochemical tasks, especially the molecule caption translation task, which aims to bridge the gap between molecules and natural language texts. However, previous methods in adapting LLMs to the molecule-caption translation task required extra domain-specific pre-training stages, suffered weak alignment between molecular and textual spaces, or imposed stringent demands on the scale of LLMs. To resolve the challenges, we propose In-Context Molecule Adaptation (ICMA), as a new paradigm allowing LLMs to learn the molecule-text alignment from context examples via In-Context Molecule Tuning. Specifically, ICMA incorporates the following three stages: Hybrid Context Retrieval, Post-retrieval Re-ranking, and In-context Molecule Tuning. Initially, Hybrid Context Retrieval utilizes BM25 Caption Retrieval and Molecule Graph Retrieval to retrieve similar informative context examples. Additionally, Post-retrieval Re-ranking is composed of Sequence Reversal and Random Walk selection to further improve the quality of retrieval results. Finally, In-Context Molecule Tuning unlocks the in-context learning and reasoning capability of LLMs with the retrieved examples and adapts the parameters of LLMs for better alignment between molecules and texts. Experimental results demonstrate that ICMA can empower LLMs to achieve state-of-the-art or comparable performance without extra training corpora and intricate structures, showing that LLMs are inherently in-context molecule learners.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Liu, Anish Gupta, Erfaun Noorani, Pratap Tokekar</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown exceptional performance across various applications, enabling autonomous agents to learn optimal policies through interaction with their environments. However, traditional RL frameworks often face challenges in terms of iteration efficiency and robustness. Risk-sensitive policy gradient methods, which incorporate both expected return and risk measures, have been explored for their ability to yield more robust policies, yet their iteration complexity remains largely underexplored. In this work, we conduct a rigorous iteration complexity analysis for the risk-sensitive policy gradient method, focusing on the REINFORCE algorithm with an exponential utility function. We establish an iteration complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ to reach an $\epsilon$-approximate first-order stationary point (FOSP). Furthermore, we investigate whether risk-sensitive algorithms can achieve better iteration complexity compared to their risk-neutral counterparts. Our analysis indicates that risk-sensitive REINFORCE can potentially converge faster. To validate our analysis, we empirically evaluate the learning performance and convergence efficiency of the risk-neutral and risk-sensitive REINFORCE algorithms in multiple environments: CartPole, MiniGrid, and Robot Navigation. Empirical results confirm that risk-averse cases can converge and stabilize faster compared to their risk-neutral counterparts.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yahya Badran, Christine Preisach</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge Tracing (KT) is concerned with predicting students' future performance on learning items in intelligent tutoring systems. Learning items are tagged with skill labels called knowledge concepts (KCs). Many KT models expand the sequence of item-student interactions into KC-student interactions by replacing learning items with their constituting KCs. This approach addresses the issue of sparse item-student interactions and minimises the number of model parameters. However, we identified a label leakage problem with this approach. The model's ability to learn correlations between KCs belonging to the same item can result in the leakage of ground truth labels, which leads to decreased performance, particularly on datasets with a high number of KCs per item.
  In this paper, we present methods to prevent label leakage in knowledge tracing (KT) models. Our model variants that utilize these methods consistently outperform their original counterparts. This further underscores the impact of label leakage on model performance. Additionally, these methods enhance the overall performance of KT models, with one model variant surpassing all tested baselines on different benchmarks. Notably, our methods are versatile and can be applied to a wide range of KT models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaskirat Singh, Emad Fallahzadeh, Bram Adams, Ahmed E. Hassan</p>
<p>Abstract: Deciding what combination of operators to use across the Edge AI tiers to achieve specific latency and model performance requirements is an open question for MLOps engineers. This study aims to empirically assess the accuracy vs inference time trade-off of different black-box Edge AI deployment strategies, i.e., combinations of deployment operators and deployment tiers. In this paper, we conduct inference experiments involving 3 deployment operators (i.e., Partitioning, Quantization, Early Exit), 3 deployment tiers (i.e., Mobile, Edge, Cloud) and their combinations on four widely used Computer-Vision models to investigate the optimal strategies from the point of view of MLOps developers. Our findings suggest that Edge deployment using the hybrid Quantization + Early Exit operator could be preferred over non-hybrid operators (Quantization/Early Exit on Edge, Partition on Mobile-Edge) when faster latency is a concern at medium accuracy loss. However, when minimizing accuracy loss is a concern, MLOps engineers should prefer using only a Quantization operator on edge at a latency reduction or increase, respectively over the Early Exit/Partition (on edge/mobile-edge) and Quantized Early Exit (on edge) operators. In scenarios constrained by Mobile CPU/RAM resources, a preference for Partitioning across mobile and edge tiers is observed over mobile deployment. For models with smaller input data samples (such as FCN), a network-constrained cloud deployment can also be a better alternative than Mobile/Edge deployment and Partitioning strategies. For models with large input data samples (ResNet, ResNext, DUC), an edge tier having higher network/computational capabilities than Cloud/Mobile can be a more viable option than Partitioning and Mobile/Cloud deployment strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Walid Abdullah Al, Il Dong Yun, Yun Jung Bae</p>
<p>Abstract: Dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging is commonly used for monitoring Parkinson's disease (PD), where striatal DAT uptake amount is computed to assess PD severity. However, DAT imaging has a high cost and the risk of radiance exposure and is not available in general clinics. Recently, MRI patch of the nigral region has been proposed as a safer and easier alternative. This paper proposes a symmetric regressor for predicting the DAT uptake amount from the nigral MRI patch. Acknowledging the symmetry between the right and left nigrae, the proposed regressor incorporates a paired input-output model that simultaneously predicts the DAT uptake amounts for both the right and left striata. Moreover, it employs a symmetric loss that imposes a constraint on the difference between right-to-left predictions, resembling the high correlation in DAT uptake amounts in the two lateral sides. Additionally, we propose a symmetric Monte-Carlo (MC) dropout method for providing a fruitful uncertainty estimate of the DAT uptake prediction, which utilizes the above symmetry. We evaluated the proposed approach on 734 nigral patches, which demonstrated significantly improved performance of the symmetric regressor compared with the standard regressors while giving better explainability and feature representation. The symmetric MC dropout also gave precise uncertainty ranges with a high probability of including the true DAT uptake amounts within the range.</p>

<p>Abstract: Current 3D reconstruction techniques struggle to infer unbounded scenes from a few images faithfully. Specifically, existing methods have high computational demands, require detailed pose information, and cannot reconstruct occluded regions reliably. We introduce 6Img-to-3D, an efficient, scalable transformer-based encoder-renderer method for single-shot image to 3D reconstruction. Our method outputs a 3D-consistent parameterized triplane from only six outward-facing input images for large-scale, unbounded outdoor driving scenarios. We take a step towards resolving existing shortcomings by combining contracted custom cross- and self-attention mechanisms for triplane parameterization, differentiable volume rendering, scene contraction, and image feature projection. We showcase that six surround-view vehicle images from a single timestamp without global pose information are enough to reconstruct 360$^{\circ}$ scenes during inference time, taking 395 ms. Our method allows, for example, rendering third-person images and birds-eye views.

<p>Abstract: Deferring systems extend supervised Machine Learning (ML) models with the possibility to defer predictions to human experts. However, evaluating the impact of a deferring strategy on system accuracy is still an overlooked area. This paper fills this gap by evaluating deferring systems through a causal lens. We link the potential outcomes framework for causal inference with deferring systems, which allows to identify the causal impact of the deferring strategy on predictive accuracy. We distinguish two scenarios. In the first one, we have access to both the human and ML model predictions for the deferred instances. Here, we can identify the individual causal effects for deferred instances and the aggregates of them. In the second one, only human predictions are available for the deferred instances. Here, we can resort to regression discontinuity designs to estimate a local causal effect. We evaluate our approach on synthetic and real datasets for seven deferring systems from the literature.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rishi Hazra, Alkis Sygkounas, Andreas Persson, Amy Loutfi, Pedro Zuidberg Dos Martires</p>
<p>Abstract: Designing effective reward functions is crucial to training reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. However, this design is non-trivial, even for domain experts, due to the subjective nature of certain tasks that are hard to quantify explicitly. In recent works, large language models (LLMs) have been used for reward generation from natural language task descriptions, leveraging their extensive instruction tuning and commonsense understanding of human behavior. In this work, we hypothesize that LLMs, guided by human feedback, can be used to formulate reward functions that reflect human implicit knowledge. We study this in three challenging settings -- autonomous driving, humanoid locomotion, and dexterous manipulation -- wherein notions of ``good" behavior are tacit and hard to quantify. To this end, we introduce REvolve, a truly evolutionary framework that uses LLMs for reward design in RL. REvolve generates and refines reward functions by utilizing human feedback to guide the evolution process, effectively translating implicit human knowledge into explicit reward functions for training (deep) RL agents. Experimentally, we demonstrate that agents trained on REvolve-designed rewards outperform other state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: Contextual bandit algorithms are essential for solving real-world decision making problems. In practice, collecting a contextual bandit's feedback from different domains may involve different costs. For example, measuring drug reaction from mice (as a source domain) and humans (as a target domain). Unfortunately, adapting a contextual bandit algorithm from a source domain to a target domain with distribution shift still remains a major challenge and largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce the first general domain adaptation method for contextual bandits. Our approach learns a bandit model for the target domain by collecting feedback from the source domain. Our theoretical analysis shows that our algorithm maintains a sub-linear regret bound even adapting across domains. Empirical results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art contextual bandit algorithms on real-world datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding alignment techniques begins with comprehending zero-shot generalization brought by instruction tuning, but little of the mechanism has been understood. Existing work has largely been confined to the task level, without considering that tasks are artificially defined and, to LLMs, merely consist of tokens and representations. To bridge this gap, we investigate zero-shot generalization from the perspective of the data itself. We first demonstrate that zero-shot generalization happens very early during instruction tuning, with loss serving as a stable indicator. Next, we investigate training data arrangement through similarity and granularity perspectives, confirming that the timing of exposure to certain training examples may greatly facilitate generalization on unseen tasks. Finally, we propose a more grounded training data arrangement framework, Test-centric Multi-turn Arrangement, and show its effectiveness in promoting continual learning and further loss reduction. For the first time, we show that zero-shot generalization during instruction tuning is a form of similarity-based generalization between training and test data at the instance level.

However, these methods neglect the computational overhead, and to the best of our knowledge, none is designed to run on mobile devices. This paper presents MobilePortrait, a lightweight one-shot neural head avatars method that reduces learning complexity by integrating external knowledge into both the motion modeling and image synthesis, enabling real-time inference on mobile devices. Specifically, we introduce a mixed representation of explicit and implicit keypoints for precise motion modeling and precomputed visual features for enhanced foreground and background synthesis. With these two key designs and using simple U-Nets as backbones, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with less than one-tenth the computational demand. It has been validated to reach speeds of over 100 FPS on mobile devices and support both video and audio-driven inputs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Tabular reasoning involves interpreting natural language queries about tabular data, which presents a unique challenge of combining language understanding with structured data analysis. Existing methods employ either textual reasoning, which excels in semantic interpretation but struggles with mathematical operations, or symbolic reasoning, which handles computations well but lacks semantic understanding. This paper introduces a novel algorithm H-STAR that integrates both symbolic and semantic (textual) approaches in a two-stage process to address these limitations. H-STAR employs: (1) step-wise table extraction using `multi-view' column retrieval followed by row extraction, and (2) adaptive reasoning that adapts reasoning strategies based on question types, utilizing semantic reasoning for direct lookup and complex lexical queries while augmenting textual reasoning with symbolic reasoning support for quantitative and logical tasks. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that H-STAR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across three tabular question-answering (QA) and fact-verification datasets, underscoring its effectiveness and efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Li, Deshui Miao, Zhenyu He, Yaowei Wang, Huchuan Lu, Ming-Hsuan Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Tracking and segmenting multiple similar objects with distinct or complex parts in long-term videos is particularly challenging due to the ambiguity in identifying target components and the confusion caused by occlusion, background clutter, and changes in appearance or environment over time. In this paper, we propose a robust video object segmentation framework that learns spatial-semantic features and discriminative object queries to address the above issues. Specifically, we construct a spatial-semantic block comprising a semantic embedding component and a spatial dependency modeling part for associating global semantic features and local spatial features, providing a comprehensive target representation. In addition, we develop a masked cross-attention module to generate object queries that focus on the most discriminative parts of target objects during query propagation, alleviating noise accumulation to ensure effective long-term query propagation. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark data sets, including the DAVIS2017 test (\textbf{87.8\%}), YoutubeVOS 2019 (\textbf{88.1\%}), MOSE val (\textbf{74.0\%}), and LVOS test (\textbf{73.0\%}), and demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization capacity of our model.

<p>Abstract: Cloud-edge computing requires applications to operate across diverse infrastructures, often triggered by cyber-physical events. Containers offer a lightweight deployment option but pulling images from central repositories can cause delays. This article presents a novel declarative approach and open-source prototype for replicating container images across the cloud-edge continuum. Considering resource availability, network QoS, and storage costs, we leverage logic programming to (i) determine optimal initial placements via Answer Set Programming (ASP) and (ii) adapt placements using Prolog-based continuous reasoning. We evaluate our solution through simulations, showcasing how combining ASP and Prolog continuous reasoning can balance cost optimisation and prompt decision-making in placement adaptation at increasing infrastructure sizes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Feiyang Kang, Yifan Sun, Bingbing Wen, Si Chen, Dawn Song, Rafid Mahmood, Ruoxi Jia</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain reweighting is an emerging research area aimed at adjusting the relative weights of different data sources to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of LLM pre-training. We show that data mixtures that perform well at smaller scales may not retain their advantage at larger scales, challenging the existing practice of determining competitive mixtures in small-scale experiments and directly applying them at much larger scales. To address this, we propose AutoScale, a two-stage, scale-aware data composition framework. First, AutoScale fits a parametric model that predicts the model's loss under different data compositions, then uses it to find an approximate best allocation at smaller, more manageable budgets. Next, leveraging a novel theoretical analysis of how optimal compositions evolve with scale, AutoScale extrapolates that composition to larger budgets without further retraining. Empirically, AutoScale accelerates convergence and improves downstream performance. For instance, when pre-training GPT-2 Large, it achieves a 28% faster perplexity reduction than baselines and up to a 38% speed-up over unweighted training, while yielding best-average results on various downstream tasks. Overall, our findings illustrate how domain importance shifts with training scale, underscoring the need for scale-dependent data curation in LLM training. Our code is open-sourced.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bruce W. Lee, Yeongheon Lee, Hyunsoo Cho</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit non-deterministic behavior, and prompting has emerged as a primary method for steering their outputs toward desired directions. One popular strategy involves assigning a specific "persona" to the model to induce more varied and context-sensitive responses, akin to the diversity found in human perspectives. However, contrary to the expectation that persona-based prompting would yield a wide range of opinions, our experiments demonstrate that LLMs maintain consistent value orientations. In particular, we observe a persistent inertia in their responses, where certain moral and value dimensions, especially harm avoidance and fairness, remain distinctly skewed in one direction despite varied persona settings. To investigate this phenomenon systematically, use role-play at scale, which combines randomized, diverse persona prompts with a macroscopic trend analysis of model outputs. Our findings highlight the strong internal biases and value preferences in LLMs, underscoring the need for careful scrutiny and potential adjustment of these models to ensure balanced and equitable applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luyang Luo, Mingxiang Wu, Mei Li, Yi Xin, Qiong Wang, Varut Vardhanabhuti, Winnie CW Chu, Zhenhui Li, Juan Zhou, Pranav Rajpurkar, Hao Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Breast Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) demonstrates the highest sensitivity for breast cancer detection among imaging modalities and is standard practice for high-risk women. Interpreting the multi-sequence MRI is time-consuming and prone to subjective variation. We develop a large mixture-of-modality-experts model (MOME) that integrates multiparametric MRI information within a unified structure, leveraging breast MRI scans from 5,205 female patients in China for model development and validation. MOME matches four senior radiologists' performance in identifying breast cancer and outperforms a junior radiologist. The model is able to reduce unnecessary biopsies in Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) 4 patients, classify triple-negative breast cancer, and predict pathological complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. MOME further supports inference with missing modalities and provides decision explanations by highlighting lesions and measuring modality contributions. To summarize, MOME exemplifies an accurate and robust multimodal model for noninvasive, personalized management of breast cancer patients via multiparametric MRI.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziniu Li, Congliang Chen, Tian Xu, Zeyu Qin, Jiancong Xiao, Zhi-Quan Luo, Ruoyu Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) typically rely on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to specialize in downstream tasks, with the Cross Entropy (CE) loss being the de facto choice. However, CE maximizes the likelihood of observed data without accounting for alternative possibilities. As such, CE usually leads to reduced diversity in the model's outputs, which hinders further development that requires sampling to explore better responses. To address this limitation, this paper introduces a new game-theoretic formulation for SFT. In this framework, an auxiliary variable is introduced to regulate the learning process. We prove that the proposed game-theoretic approach connects to the problem of reverse KL minimization with entropy regularization. This regularization prevents over-memorization of training data and promotes output diversity. To implement this framework, we develop GEM, a new training algorithm that is computationally efficient as CE by leveraging some unique properties of LLMs. Empirical studies of pre-trained models from 3B to 70B parameters show that GEM achieves comparable downstream performance to CE while significantly enhancing output diversity. This increased diversity translates to performance gains in test-time compute scaling for chat and code generation tasks. Moreover, we observe that preserving output diversity has the added benefit of mitigating forgetting, as maintaining diverse outputs encourages models to retain pre-trained knowledge throughout the training process.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shen Li, Liuyi Yao, Lan Zhang, Yaliang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Aligned LLMs are secure, capable of recognizing and refusing to answer malicious questions. However, the role of internal parameters in maintaining such security is not well understood yet, further these models can be vulnerable to security degradation when subjected to fine-tuning attacks. To address these challenges, our work uncovers the mechanism behind security in aligned LLMs at the parameter level, identifying a small set of contiguous layers in the middle of the model that are crucial for distinguishing malicious queries from normal ones, referred to as ``safety layers". We first confirm the existence of these safety layers by analyzing variations in input vectors within the model's internal layers. Additionally, we leverage the over-rejection phenomenon and parameters scaling analysis to precisely locate the safety layers. Building on these findings, we propose a novel fine-tuning approach, Safely Partial-Parameter Fine-Tuning (SPPFT), that fixes the gradient of the safety layers during fine-tuning to address the security degradation. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach can significantly preserve LLM security while maintaining performance and reducing computational resources compared to full fine-tuning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenxuan Tan, Nicholas Roberts, Tzu-Heng Huang, Jitian Zhao, John Cooper, Samuel Guo, Chengyu Duan, Frederic Sala</p>
<p>Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques have unlocked the potential to cheaply and easily specialize large pretrained models. However, the most prominent approaches, like low-rank adapters (LoRA), depend on heuristics or rules-of-thumb for their architectural choices -- potentially limiting their performance for new models and architectures. This limitation suggests that techniques from neural architecture search could be used to obtain optimal adapter architectures, but these are often expensive and difficult to implement. We address this challenge with Monarch Rectangular Fine-tuning (MoRe), a simple framework to search over adapter architectures that relies on the Monarch matrix class. Theoretically, we show that MoRe is more expressive than LoRA. Empirically, our approach is more parameter-efficient and performant than state-of-the-art PEFTs on a range of tasks and models, with as few as 5\% of LoRA's parameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Naoki Wake, Atsushi Kanehira, Kazuhiro Sasabuchi, Jun Takamatsu, Katsushi Ikeuchi</p>
<p>Abstract: Video action localization aims to find the timings of specific actions from a long video. Although existing learning-based approaches have been successful, they require annotating videos, which comes with a considerable labor cost. This paper proposes a training-free, open-vocabulary approach based on emerging off-the-shelf vision-language models (VLMs). The challenge stems from the fact that VLMs are neither designed to process long videos nor tailored for finding actions. We overcome these problems by extending an iterative visual prompting technique. Specifically, we sample video frames and create a concatenated image with frame index labels, allowing a VLM to identify the frames that most likely correspond to the start and end of the action. By iteratively narrowing the sampling window around the selected frames, the estimation gradually converges to more precise temporal boundaries. We demonstrate that this technique yields reasonable performance, achieving results comparable to state-of-the-art zero-shot action localization. These results support the use of VLMs as a practical tool for understanding videos. Sample code is available at https://microsoft.github.io/VLM-Video-Action-Localization/</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Menglin Liu, Ge Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer substantial promise for text classification in political science, yet their effectiveness often depends on high-quality prompts and exemplars. To address this, we introduce a three-stage framework that enhances LLM performance through automatic prompt optimization, dynamic exemplar selection, and a consensus mechanism. Our approach automates prompt refinement using task-specific exemplars, eliminating speculative trial-and-error adjustments and producing structured prompts aligned with human-defined criteria. In the second stage, we dynamically select the most relevant exemplars, ensuring contextually appropriate guidance for each query. Finally, our consensus mechanism mimics the role of multiple human coders for a single task, combining outputs from LLMs to achieve high reliability and consistency at a reduced cost. Evaluated across tasks including sentiment analysis, stance detection, and campaign ad tone classification, our method enhances classification accuracy without requiring task-specific model retraining or extensive manual adjustments to prompts. This framework not only boosts accuracy, interpretability and transparency but also provides a cost-effective, scalable solution tailored to political science applications. An open-source Python package (PoliPrompt) is available on GitHub.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion-based video generation technology has advanced significantly, catalyzing a proliferation of research in human animation. However, the majority of these studies are confined to same-modality driving settings, with cross-modality human body animation remaining relatively underexplored. In this paper, we introduce, an end-to-end audio-driven human animation framework that ensures hand integrity, identity consistency, and natural motion. The key design of CyberHost is the Region Codebook Attention mechanism, which improves the generation quality of facial and hand animations by integrating fine-grained local features with learned motion pattern priors. Furthermore, we have developed a suite of human-prior-guided training strategies, including body movement map, hand clarity score, pose-aligned reference feature, and local enhancement supervision, to improve synthesis results. To our knowledge, CyberHost is the first end-to-end audio-driven human diffusion model capable of facilitating zero-shot video generation within the scope of human body. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CyberHost surpasses previous works in both quantitative and qualitative aspects.</p>

<p>Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) affects children's social and communication abilities, with eye-tracking widely used to identify atypical gaze patterns. While unsupervised clustering can automate the creation of areas of interest for gaze feature extraction, the use of internal cluster validity indices, like Silhouette Coefficient, to distinguish gaze pattern differences between ASD and typically developing (TD) children remains underexplored. We explore whether internal cluster validity indices can distinguish ASD from TD children. Specifically, we apply seven clustering algorithms to gaze points and extract 63 internal cluster validity indices to reveal correlations with ASD diagnosis. Using these indices, we train predictive models for ASD diagnosis. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate high predictive accuracy (81\% AUC), validating the effectiveness of these indices.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs), an increasing number of open-source software projects are using LLMs as their core functional component. Although research and practice on LLMs are capturing considerable interest, no dedicated studies explored the challenges faced by practitioners of LLM open-source projects, the causes of these challenges, and potential solutions. To fill this research gap, we conducted an empirical study to understand the issues that practitioners encounter when developing and using LLM open-source software, the possible causes of these issues, and potential solutions. We collected all closed issues from 15 LLM open-source projects and labelled issues that met our requirements. We then randomly selected 994 issues from the labelled issues as the sample for data extraction and analysis to understand the prevalent issues, their underlying causes, and potential solutions. Our study results show that (1) Model Issue is the most common issue faced by practitioners, (2) Model Problem, Configuration and Connection Problem, and Feature and Method Problem are identified as the most frequent causes of the issues, and (3) Optimize Model is the predominant solution to the issues. Based on the study results, we provide implications for practitioners and researchers of LLM open-source projects.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zedian Shao, Hongbin Liu, Jaden Mu, Neil Zhenqiang Gong</p>
<p>Abstract: In a prompt injection attack, an attacker injects a prompt into the original one, aiming to make an LLM follow the injected prompt to perform an attacker-chosen task. Existing attacks primarily focus on how to blend the injected prompt into the original prompt without altering the LLM itself. Our experiments show that these attacks achieve some success, but there is still significant room for improvement. In this work, we show that an attacker can boost the success of prompt injection attacks by poisoning the LLM's alignment process. Specifically, we propose PoisonedAlign, a method to strategically create poisoned alignment samples. When even a small fraction of the alignment data is poisoned using our method, the aligned LLM becomes more vulnerable to prompt injection while maintaining its foundational capabilities.

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have shown significant potential for solving combinatorial optimization problems in real-time. Unlike traditional methods, deep learning can generate high-quality solutions efficiently, which is crucial for applications like routing and scheduling. However, existing approaches like deep reinforcement learning (RL) and behavioral cloning have notable limitations, with deep RL suffering from slow learning and behavioral cloning relying solely on expert actions, which can lead to generalization issues and neglect of the optimization objective. This paper introduces a novel offline RL method designed for combinatorial optimization problems with complex constraints, where the state is represented as a heterogeneous graph and the action space is variable. Our approach encodes actions in edge attributes and balances expected rewards with the imitation of expert solutions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on job-shop scheduling and flexible job-shop scheduling benchmarks, achieving superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> A M Muntasir Rahman, Junyi Ye, Wei Yao, Sierra S. Liu, Jesse Yu, Jonathan Yu, Wenpeng Yin, Guiling Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Consider the math problem: "Lily received 3 cookies from her best friend yesterday and ate 5 for breakfast. Today, her friend gave her 3 more cookies. How many cookies does Lily have now?" Many large language models (LLMs) in previous research approach this problem by calculating the answer "1" using the equation "3 - 5 + 3." However, from a human perspective, we recognize the inherent flaw in this problem: Lily cannot eat 5 cookies if she initially only had 3. This discrepancy prompts a key question: Are current LLMs merely Blind Solver that apply mathematical operations without deeper reasoning, or can they function as Logical Thinker capable of identifying logical inconsistencies?
  To explore this question, we propose a benchmark dataset, FaultyMath, which includes faulty math problems of rich diversity: i) multiple mathematical categories, e.g., algebra, geometry, number theory, etc., ii) varying levels of difficulty, and iii) different origins of faultiness -- ranging from violations of common sense and ambiguous statements to mathematical contradictions and more. We evaluate a broad spectrum of LLMs, including open-source, closed-source, and math-specialized models, using FaultyMath across three dimensions: (i) How accurately can the models detect faulty math problems without being explicitly prompted to do so? (ii) When provided with hints -- either correct or misleading -- about the validity of the problems, to what extent do LLMs adapt to become reliable Logical Thinker? (iii) How trustworthy are the explanations generated by LLMs when they recognize a math problem as flawed? Through extensive experimentation and detailed analysis, our results demonstrate that existing LLMs largely function as Blind Solver and fall short of the reasoning capabilities required to perform as Logical Thinker.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiulong Liu, Kun Su, Eli Shlizerman</p>
<p>Abstract: The content of visual and audio scenes is multi-faceted such that a video can be paired with various audio and vice-versa. Thereby, in video-to-audio generation task, it is imperative to introduce steering approaches for controlling the generated audio. While Video-to-Audio generation is a well-established generative task, existing methods lack such controllability. In this work, we propose VATT, a multi-modal generative framework that takes a video and an optional text prompt as input, and generates audio and optional textual description of the audio. Such a framework has two advantages: i) Video-to-Audio generation process can be refined and controlled via text which complements the context of visual information, and ii) The model can suggest what audio to generate for the video by generating audio captions. VATT consists of two key modules: VATT Converter, a LLM that is fine-tuned for instructions and includes a projection layer that maps video features to the LLM vector space; and VATT Audio, a transformer that generates audio tokens from visual frames and from optional text prompt using iterative parallel decoding. The audio tokens are converted to a waveform by pretrained neural codec. Experiments show that when VATT is compared to existing video-to-audio generation methods in objective metrics, it achieves competitive performance when the audio caption is not provided. When the audio caption is provided as a prompt, VATT achieves even more refined performance (lowest KLD score of 1.41). Furthermore, subjective studies show that VATT Audio has been chosen as preferred generated audio than audio generated by existing methods. VATT enables controllable video-to-audio generation through text as well as suggesting text prompts for videos through audio captions, unlocking novel applications such as text-guided video-to-audio generation and video-to-audio captioning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zi-Xuan Huang, Jia-Wei Chen, Zhi-Peng Zhang, Chia-Mu Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual prompting (VP) is a new technique that adapts well-trained frozen models for source domain tasks to target domain tasks. This study examines VP's benefits for black-box model-level backdoor detection. The visual prompt in VP maps class subspaces between source and target domains. We identify a misalignment, termed class subspace inconsistency, between clean and poisoned datasets. Based on this, we introduce \textsc{BProm}, a black-box model-level detection method to identify backdoors in suspicious models, if any. \textsc{BProm} leverages the low classification accuracy of prompted models when backdoors are present. Extensive experiments confirm \textsc{BProm}'s effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenwei Yang, Jilei Mao, Wenxian Yang, Yibo Ai, Yu Kong, Haibao Yu, Weidong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Temporal perception, defined as the capability to detect and track objects across temporal sequences, serves as a fundamental component in autonomous driving systems. While single-vehicle perception systems encounter limitations, stemming from incomplete perception due to object occlusion and inherent blind spots, cooperative perception systems present their own challenges in terms of sensor calibration precision and positioning accuracy. To address these issues, we introduce LET-VIC, a LiDAR-based End-to-End Tracking framework for Vehicle-Infrastructure Cooperation (VIC). First, we employ Temporal Self-Attention and VIC Cross-Attention modules to effectively integrate temporal and spatial information from both vehicle and infrastructure perspectives. Then, we develop a novel Calibration Error Compensation (CEC) module to mitigate sensor misalignment issues and facilitate accurate feature alignment. Experiments on the V2X-Seq-SPD dataset demonstrate that LET-VIC significantly outperforms baseline models. Compared to LET-V, LET-VIC achieves +15.0% improvement in mAP and a +17.3% improvement in AMOTA. Furthermore, LET-VIC surpasses representative Tracking by Detection models, including V2VNet, FFNet, and PointPillars, with at least a +13.7% improvement in mAP and a +13.1% improvement in AMOTA without considering communication delays, showcasing its robust detection and tracking performance. The experiments demonstrate that the integration of multi-view perspectives, temporal sequences, or CEC in end-to-end training significantly improves both detection and tracking performance. All code will be open-sourced.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chan Hee Song, Valts Blukis, Jonathan Tremblay, Stephen Tyree, Yu Su, Stan Birchfield</p>
<p>Abstract: Spatial understanding is a crucial capability that enables robots to perceive their surroundings, reason about their environment, and interact with it meaningfully. In modern robotics, these capabilities are increasingly provided by vision-language models. However, these models face significant challenges in spatial reasoning tasks, as their training data are based on general-purpose image datasets that often lack sophisticated spatial understanding. For example, datasets frequently do not capture reference frame comprehension, yet effective spatial reasoning requires understanding whether to reason from ego-, world-, or object-centric perspectives. To address this issue, we introduce RoboSpatial, a large-scale dataset for spatial understanding in robotics. It consists of real indoor and tabletop scenes, captured as 3D scans and egocentric images, and annotated with rich spatial information relevant to robotics. The dataset includes 1M images, 5k 3D scans, and 3M annotated spatial relationships, and the pairing of 2D egocentric images with 3D scans makes it both 2D- and 3D- ready. Our experiments show that models trained with RoboSpatial outperform baselines on downstream tasks such as spatial affordance prediction, spatial relationship prediction, and robot manipulation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jubin Abhishek Soni</p>
<p>Abstract: While the Web has become a global platform for communication; malicious actors, including hackers and hacktivist groups, often disseminate ideological content and coordinate activities through the "Dark Web" an obscure counterpart of the conventional web. Presently, challenges such as information overload and the fragmented nature of cyber threat data impede comprehensive profiling of these actors, thereby limiting the efficacy of predictive analyses of their online activities. Concurrently, the proliferation of internet-connected devices has surpassed the global human population, with this disparity projected to widen as the Internet of Things (IoT) expands. Technical communities are actively advancing IoT-related research to address its growing societal integration. This paper proposes a novel predictive threat intelligence framework designed to systematically collect, analyze, and visualize Dark Web data to identify malicious websites and correlate this information with potential IoT vulnerabilities. The methodology integrates automated data harvesting, analytical techniques, and visual mapping tools, while also examining vulnerabilities in IoT devices to assess exploitability. By bridging gaps in cybersecurity research, this study aims to enhance predictive threat modeling and inform policy development, thereby contributing to intelligence research initiatives focused on mitigating cyber risks in an increasingly interconnected digital ecosystem.</p>

<p>Abstract: Business intelligence (BI) transforms large volumes of data within modern organizations into actionable insights for informed decision-making. Recently, large language model (LLM)-based agents have streamlined the BI workflow by automatically performing task planning, reasoning, and actions in executable environments based on natural language (NL) queries. However, existing approaches primarily focus on individual BI tasks such as NL2SQL and NL2VIS. The fragmentation of tasks across different data roles and tools lead to inefficiencies and potential errors due to the iterative and collaborative nature of BI. In this paper, we introduce DataLab, a unified BI platform that integrates a one-stop LLM-based agent framework with an augmented computational notebook interface. DataLab supports various BI tasks for different data roles in data preparation, analysis, and visualization by seamlessly combining LLM assistance with user customization within a single environment. To achieve this unification, we design a domain knowledge incorporation module tailored for enterprise-specific BI tasks, an inter-agent communication mechanism to facilitate information sharing across the BI workflow, and a cell-based context management strategy to enhance context utilization efficiency in BI notebooks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DataLab achieves state-of-the-art performance on various BI tasks across popular research benchmarks. Moreover, DataLab maintains high effectiveness and efficiency on real-world datasets from Tencent, achieving up to a 58.58% increase in accuracy and a 61.65% reduction in token cost on enterprise-specific BI tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingyang Mao, Qi Liu, Zhi Li, Mingyue Cheng, Zheng Zhang, Rui Li</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, table reasoning has garnered substantial research interest, particularly its integration with Large Language Models (LLMs) which revolutionize natural language applications. Existing typical LLM-based studies realize step-by-step reasoning, promoting the capabilities in table understanding and analyzing. While these approaches emphasize autonomous exploration to accomplish the task objective, they overlook systematic thinking in the reasoning process, leading to potential risks of omitted steps, disorganized logic and misleading results. In this paper, we propose PoTable, a novel stage-oriented plan-then-execute reasoning approach that achieves systematic thinking on tables. Specifically, PoTable deploys several distinct tabular analytical stages with clear objectives and achieves stage-by-stage reasoning. To accomplish the stage-specific goal, PoTable conducts plan-then-execute reasoning, which first plans the operation chain under the stage objective, and then executes each operation sequentially through code generation, real-time running and feedback processing. As a result, PoTable can produce reliable table reasoning results with highly accurate, steply commented and completely executable programs. It possesses a high degree of alignment with a distinguished tabular data analyst, offering advantages of high accuracy and explainability. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments over four evaluation datasets from WikiTQ and TabFact benchmarks, where the results demonstrate the effectiveness of PoTable, as well as the efficiency and explainability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaiwen Zha, Lijun Yu, Alireza Fathi, David A. Ross, Cordelia Schmid, Dina Katabi, Xiuye Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: Image tokenization, the process of transforming raw image pixels into a compact low-dimensional latent representation, has proven crucial for scalable and efficient image generation. However, mainstream image tokenization methods generally have limited compression rates, making high-resolution image generation computationally expensive. To address this challenge, we propose to leverage language for efficient image tokenization, and we call our method Text-Conditioned Image Tokenization (TexTok). TexTok is a simple yet effective tokenization framework that leverages language to provide a compact, high-level semantic representation. By conditioning the tokenization process on descriptive text captions, TexTok simplifies semantic learning, allowing more learning capacity and token space to be allocated to capture fine-grained visual details, leading to enhanced reconstruction quality and higher compression rates. Compared to the conventional tokenizer without text conditioning, TexTok achieves average reconstruction FID improvements of 29.2% and 48.1% on ImageNet-256 and -512 benchmarks respectively, across varying numbers of tokens. These tokenization improvements consistently translate to 16.3% and 34.3% average improvements in generation FID. By simply replacing the tokenizer in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) with TexTok, our system can achieve a 93.5x inference speedup while still outperforming the original DiT using only 32 tokens on ImageNet-512. TexTok with a vanilla DiT generator achieves state-of-the-art FID scores of 1.46 and 1.62 on ImageNet-256 and -512 respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate TexTok's superiority on the text-to-image generation task, effectively utilizing the off-the-shelf text captions in tokenization.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyeonho Jeong, Chun-Hao Paul Huang, Jong Chul Ye, Niloy Mitra, Duygu Ceylan</p>
<p>Abstract: While recent foundational video generators produce visually rich output, they still struggle with appearance drift, where objects gradually degrade or change inconsistently across frames, breaking visual coherence. We hypothesize that this is because there is no explicit supervision in terms of spatial tracking at the feature level. We propose Track4Gen, a spatially aware video generator that combines video diffusion loss with point tracking across frames, providing enhanced spatial supervision on the diffusion features. Track4Gen merges the video generation and point tracking tasks into a single network by making minimal changes to existing video generation architectures. Using Stable Video Diffusion as a backbone, Track4Gen demonstrates that it is possible to unify video generation and point tracking, which are typically handled as separate tasks. Our extensive evaluations show that Track4Gen effectively reduces appearance drift, resulting in temporally stable and visually coherent video generation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yixin Zhang, Kevin Kramer, Maciej A. Mazurowski</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated segmentation of medical images heavily relies on the availability of precise manual annotations. However, generating these annotations is often time-consuming, expensive, and sometimes requires specialized expertise (especially for cross-sectional medical images). Therefore, it is essential to optimize the use of annotation resources to ensure efficiency and effectiveness. In this paper, we systematically address the question: "in a non-interactive annotation pipeline, how should slices from cross-sectional medical images be selected for annotation to maximize the performance of the resulting deep learning segmentation models?" We conducted experiments on 4 medical imaging segmentation tasks with varying annotation budgets, numbers of annotated cases, numbers of annotated slices per volume, slice selection techniques, and mask interpolations. We found that:
  1) It is almost always preferable to annotate fewer slices per volume and more volumes given an annotation budget. 2) Selecting slices for annotation by unsupervised active learning (UAL) is not superior to selecting slices randomly or at fixed intervals, provided that each volume is allocated the same number of annotated slices. 3) Interpolating masks between annotated slices rarely enhances model performance, with exceptions of some specific configuration for 3D models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gaojian Wang, Feng Lin, Tong Wu, Zhenguang Liu, Zhongjie Ba, Kui Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: This work asks: with abundant, unlabeled real faces, how to learn a robust and transferable facial representation that boosts various face security tasks with respect to generalization performance? We make the first attempt and propose a self-supervised pretraining framework to learn fundamental representations of real face images, FSFM, that leverages the synergy between masked image modeling (MIM) and instance discrimination (ID). We explore various facial masking strategies for MIM and present a simple yet powerful CRFR-P masking, which explicitly forces the model to capture meaningful intra-region consistency and challenging inter-region coherency. Furthermore, we devise the ID network that naturally couples with MIM to establish underlying local-to-global correspondence via tailored self-distillation. These three learning objectives, namely 3C, empower encoding both local features and global semantics of real faces. After pretraining, a vanilla ViT serves as a universal vision foundation model for downstream face security tasks: cross-dataset deepfake detection, cross-domain face anti-spoofing, and unseen diffusion facial forgery detection. Extensive experiments on 10 public datasets demonstrate that our model transfers better than supervised pretraining, visual and facial self-supervised learning arts, and even outperforms task-specialized SOTA methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aditya Ganeshan, Thibault Groueix, Paul Guerrero, Radom\'ir M\v{e}ch, Matthew Fisher, Daniel Ritchie</p>
<p>Abstract: Pattern images are everywhere in the digital and physical worlds, and tools to edit them are valuable. But editing pattern images is tricky: desired edits are often programmatic: structure-aware edits that alter the underlying program which generates the pattern. One could attempt to infer this underlying program, but current methods for doing so struggle with complex images and produce unorganized programs that make editing tedious. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to perform programmatic edits on pattern images. By using a pattern analogy -- a pair of simple patterns to demonstrate the intended edit -- and a learning-based generative model to execute these edits, our method allows users to intuitively edit patterns. To enable this paradigm, we introduce SplitWeave, a domain-specific language that, combined with a framework for sampling synthetic pattern analogies, enables the creation of a large, high-quality synthetic training dataset. We also present TriFuser, a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) designed to overcome critical issues that arise when naively deploying LDMs to this task. Extensive experiments on real-world, artist-sourced patterns reveals that our method faithfully performs the demonstrated edit while also generalizing to related pattern styles beyond its training distribution.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Miles Q. Li, Benjamin C. M. Fung, Shih-Chia Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Pretraining large language models is a complex endeavor influenced by multiple factors, including model architecture, data quality, training continuity, and hardware constraints. In this paper, we share insights gained from the experience of training DMaS-LLaMa-Lite, a fully open source, 1.7-billion-parameter, LLaMa-based model, on approximately 20 billion tokens of carefully curated data. We chronicle the full training trajectory, documenting how evolving validation loss levels and downstream benchmarks reflect transitions from incoherent text to fluent, contextually grounded output. Beyond pretraining, we extend our analysis to include a post-training phase focused on instruction tuning, where the model was refined to produce more contextually appropriate, user-aligned responses. We highlight practical considerations such as the importance of restoring optimizer states when resuming from checkpoints, and the impact of hardware changes on training stability and throughput. While qualitative evaluation provides an intuitive understanding of model improvements, our analysis extends to various performance benchmarks, demonstrating how high-quality data and thoughtful scaling enable competitive results with significantly fewer training tokens. By detailing these experiences and offering training logs, checkpoints, and sample outputs, we aim to guide future researchers and practitioners in refining their pretraining strategies.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jongmin Yu, Zhongtian Sun, Chen Bene Chi, Jinhong Yang, Shan Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Semantic segmentation requires extensive pixel-level annotation, motivating unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) to transfer knowledge from labelled source domains to unlabelled or weakly labelled target domains. One of the most efficient strategies involves using synthetic datasets generated within controlled virtual environments, such as video games or traffic simulators, which can automatically generate pixel-level annotations. However, even when such datasets are available, learning a well-generalised representation that captures both domains remains challenging, owing to probabilistic and geometric discrepancies between the virtual world and real-world imagery. This work introduces a semantic segmentation method based on latent diffusion models, termed Inter-Coder Connected Latent Diffusion (ICCLD), alongside an unsupervised domain adaptation approach. The model employs an inter-coder connection to enhance contextual understanding and preserve fine details, while adversarial learning aligns latent feature distributions across domains during the latent diffusion process. Experiments on GTA5, Synthia, and Cityscapes demonstrate that ICCLD outperforms state-of-the-art UDA methods, achieving mIoU scores of 74.4 (GTA5$\rightarrow$Cityscapes) and 67.2 (Synthia$\rightarrow$Cityscapes).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andreas Goulas, Vasileios Mezaris, Ioannis Patras</p>
<p>Abstract: To address computational and memory limitations of Large Multimodal Models in the Video Question-Answering task, several recent methods extract textual representations per frame (e.g., by captioning) and feed them to a Large Language Model (LLM) that processes them to produce the final response. However, in this way, the LLM does not have access to visual information and often has to process repetitive textual descriptions of nearby frames. To address those shortcomings, in this paper, we introduce VidCtx, a novel training-free VideoQA framework which integrates both modalities, i.e. both visual information from input frames and textual descriptions of others frames that give the appropriate context. More specifically, in the proposed framework a pre-trained Large Multimodal Model (LMM) is prompted to extract at regular intervals, question-aware textual descriptions (captions) of video frames. Those will be used as context when the same LMM will be prompted to answer the question at hand given as input a) a certain frame, b) the question and c) the context/caption of an appropriate frame. To avoid redundant information, we chose as context the descriptions of distant frames. Finally, a simple yet effective max pooling mechanism is used to aggregate the frame-level decisions. This methodology enables the model to focus on the relevant segments of the video and scale to a high number of frames. Experiments show that VidCtx achieves competitive performance among approaches that rely on open models on three public Video QA benchmarks, NExT-QA, IntentQA and STAR.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziming Guo, Chao Ma, Yinggang Sun, Tiancheng Zhao, Guangyao Wang, Hai Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced text-to-SQL systems. However, most LLM-based methods often narrowly focus on SQL generation, neglecting the complexities of real-world conversational queries. This oversight can lead to unreliable responses, particularly for ambiguous questions that cannot be directly addressed with SQL. To bridge this gap, we propose MMSQL, a comprehensive test suite designed to evaluate the question classification and SQL generation capabilities of LLMs by simulating real-world scenarios with diverse question types and multi-turn Q&A interactions. Using MMSQL, we assessed the performance of popular LLMs, including both open-source and closed-source models, and identified key factors impacting their performance in such scenarios. Moreover, we introduce an LLM-based multi-agent framework that employs specialized agents to identify question types and determine appropriate answering strategies. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach significantly enhances the model's ability to navigate the complexities of conversational dynamics, effectively handling the diverse and complex nature of user queries.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanlin Feng, Simone Papicchio, Sajjadur Rahman</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval from graph data is crucial for augmenting large language models (LLM) with both open-domain knowledge and private enterprise data, and it is also a key component in the recent GraphRAG system (edge et al., 2024). Despite decades of research on knowledge graphs and knowledge base question answering, leading LLM frameworks (e.g. Langchain and LlamaIndex) have only minimal support for retrieval from modern encyclopedic knowledge graphs like Wikidata. In this paper, we analyze the root cause and suggest that modern RDF knowledge graphs (e.g. Wikidata, Freebase) are less efficient for LLMs due to overly large schemas that far exceed the typical LLM context window, use of resource identifiers, overlapping relation types and lack of normalization. As a solution, we propose property graph views on top of the underlying RDF graph that can be efficiently queried by LLMs using Cypher. We instantiated this idea on Wikidata and introduced CypherBench, the first benchmark with 11 large-scale, multi-domain property graphs with 7.8 million entities and over 10,000 questions. To achieve this, we tackled several key challenges, including developing an RDF-to-property graph conversion engine, creating a systematic pipeline for text-to-Cypher task generation, and designing new evaluation metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kedi Chen, Qin Chen, Jie Zhou, Xinqi Tao, Bowen Ding, Jingwen Xie, Mingchen Xie, Peilong Li, Feng Zheng, Liang He</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to hallucination with non-factual or unfaithful statements, which undermines the applications in real-world scenarios. Recent researches focus on uncertainty-based hallucination detection, which utilizes the output probability of LLMs for uncertainty calculation and does not rely on external knowledge or frequent sampling from LLMs. Whereas, most approaches merely consider the uncertainty of each independent token, while the intricate semantic relations among tokens and sentences are not well studied, which limits the detection of hallucination that spans over multiple tokens and sentences in the passage. In this paper, we propose a method to enhance uncertainty modeling with semantic graph for hallucination detection. Specifically, we first construct a semantic graph that well captures the relations among entity tokens and sentences. Then, we incorporate the relations between two entities for uncertainty propagation to enhance sentence-level hallucination detection. Given that hallucination occurs due to the conflict between sentences, we further present a graph-based uncertainty calibration method that integrates the contradiction probability of the sentence with its neighbors in the semantic graph for uncertainty calculation. Extensive experiments on two datasets show the great advantages of our proposed approach. In particular, we obtain substantial improvements with 19.78% in passage-level hallucination detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anurag Awasthi</p>
<p>Abstract: Active Appearance Models (AAMs) are a well-established technique for fitting deformable models to images, but they are limited by linear appearance assumptions and can struggle with complex variations. In this paper, we explore if the AAM fitting process can benefit from a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). We uses a U-Net based generator and a PatchGAN discriminator for GAN-augmented framework in an attempt to refine the appearance model during fitting. This approach attempts to addresses challenges such as non-linear appearance variations and occlusions that traditional AAM optimization methods may fail to handle. Limited experiments on face alignment datasets demonstrate that the GAN-enhanced AAM can achieve higher accuracy and faster convergence than classic approaches with some manual interventions. These results establish feasibility of GANs as a tool for improving deformable model fitting in challenging conditions while maintaining efficient performance, and establishes the need for more future work to evaluate this approach at scale.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guanghan Wu, Sasu Tarkoma, Roberto Morabito</p>
<p>Abstract: The evolving requirements of Internet of Things (IoT) applications are driving an increasing shift toward bringing intelligence to the edge, enabling real-time insights and decision-making within resource-constrained environments. Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) has emerged as a key enabler of this evolution, facilitating the deployment of ML models on devices such as microcontrollers and embedded systems. However, the complexity of managing the TinyML lifecycle, including stages such as data processing, model optimization and conversion, and device deployment, presents significant challenges and often requires substantial human intervention. Motivated by these challenges, we began exploring whether Large Language Models (LLMs) could help automate and streamline the TinyML lifecycle. We developed a framework that leverages the natural language processing (NLP) and code generation capabilities of LLMs to reduce development time and lower the barriers to entry for TinyML deployment. Through a case study involving a computer vision classification model, we demonstrate the framework's ability to automate key stages of the TinyML lifecycle. Our findings suggest that LLM-powered automation holds potential for improving the lifecycle development process and adapting to diverse requirements. However, while this approach shows promise, there remain obstacles and limitations, particularly in achieving fully automated solutions. This paper sheds light on both the challenges and opportunities of integrating LLMs into TinyML workflows, providing insights into the path forward for efficient, AI-assisted embedded system development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenhao Zheng, Yixiao Chen, Weitong Zhang, Souvik Kundu, Yun Li, Zhengzhong Liu, Eric P. Xing, Hongyi Wang, Huaxiu Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models have achieved remarkable success in various tasks but suffer from high computational costs during inference, limiting their deployment in resource-constrained applications. To address this issue, we propose a novel Collaborative Inference with Token-lEvel Routing (CITER) framework that enables efficient collaboration between small and large language models (SLMs \& LLMs) through a token-level routing strategy. Specifically, CITER routes non-critical tokens to an SLM for efficiency and routes critical tokens to an LLM for generalization quality. We formulate router training as a policy optimization, where the router receives rewards based on both the quality of predictions and the inference costs of generation. This allows the router to learn to predict token-level routing scores and make routing decisions based on both the current token and the future impact of its decisions. To further accelerate the reward evaluation process, we introduce a shortcut which significantly reduces the costs of the reward estimation and improving the practicality of our approach. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that CITER reduces the inference costs while preserving high-quality generation, offering a promising solution for real-time and resource-constrained applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shihan Fu, Bingsheng Yao, Smit Desai, Yuqi Hu, Yuling Sun, Samantha Stonbraker, Yanjun Gao, Elizabeth M. Goldberg, Dakuo Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Older adult patients constitute a rapidly growing subgroup of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients. In these situations, their family caregivers are expected to represent the unconscious patients to access and interpret patients' medical information. However, caregivers currently have to rely on overloaded clinicians for information updates and typically lack the health literacy to understand complex medical information. Our project aims to explore the information needs of caregivers of ICU older adult patients, from which we can propose design opportunities to guide future AI systems. The project begins with formative interviews with 11 caregivers to identify their challenges in accessing and interpreting medical information; From these findings, we then synthesize design requirements and propose an AI system prototype to cope with caregivers' challenges. The system prototype has two key features: a timeline visualization to show the AI extracted and summarized older adult patients' key medical events; and an LLM-based chatbot to provide context-aware informational support. We conclude our paper by reporting on the follow-up user evaluation of the system and discussing future AI-based systems for ICU caregivers of older adults.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haywood Gelman, John D. Hastings</p>
<p>Abstract: Insider threats wield an outsized influence on organizations, disproportionate to their small numbers. This is due to the internal access insiders have to systems, information, and infrastructure. %One example of this influence is where anonymous respondents submit web-based job search site reviews, an insider threat risk to organizations. Signals for such risks may be found in anonymous submissions to public web-based job search site reviews. This research studies the potential for large language models (LLMs) to analyze and detect insider threat sentiment within job site reviews. Addressing ethical data collection concerns, this research utilizes synthetic data generation using LLMs alongside existing job review datasets. A comparative analysis of sentiment scores generated by LLMs is benchmarked against expert human scoring. Findings reveal that LLMs demonstrate alignment with human evaluations in most cases, thus effectively identifying nuanced indicators of threat sentiment. The performance is lower on human-generated data than synthetic data, suggesting areas for improvement in evaluating real-world data. Text diversity analysis found differences between human-generated and LLM-generated datasets, with synthetic data exhibiting somewhat lower diversity. Overall, the results demonstrate the applicability of LLMs to insider threat detection, and a scalable solution for insider sentiment testing by overcoming ethical and logistical barriers tied to data acquisition.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> V\'ictor Gallego</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a novel dynamic safety framework that optimizes language model (LM) safety reasoning at inference time without modifying model weights. Building on recent advances in self-critique methods, our approach leverages a meta-critique mechanism that iteratively updates safety prompts-termed specifications-to drive the critique and revision process adaptively. This test-time optimization not only improves performance against adversarial jailbreak requests but also in diverse general safety-related tasks, such as avoiding moral harm or pursuing honest responses. Our empirical evaluations across several language models demonstrate that dynamically optimized safety prompts yield significantly higher safety scores compared to fixed system prompts and static self-critique defenses.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyundong Cho, Karishma Sharma, Nicolaas Jedema, Leonardo F. R. Ribeiro, Alessandro Moschitti, Ravi Krishnan, Jonathan May</p>
<p>Abstract: Language models are aligned to the collective voice of many, resulting in generic outputs that do not align with specific users' styles. In this work, we present Trial-Error-Explain In-Context Learning (TICL), a tuning-free method that personalizes language models for text generation tasks with fewer than 10 examples per user. TICL iteratively expands an in-context learning prompt via a trial-error-explain process, adding model-generated negative samples and explanations that provide fine-grained guidance towards a specific user's style. TICL achieves favorable win rates on pairwise comparisons with LLM-as-a-judge up to 91.5% against the previous state-of-the-art and outperforms competitive tuning-free baselines for personalized alignment tasks of writing emails, essays and news articles. Both lexical and qualitative analyses show that the negative samples and explanations enable language models to learn stylistic context more effectively and overcome the bias towards structural and formal phrases observed in their zero-shot outputs. By front-loading inference compute to create a user-specific in-context learning prompt that does not require extra generation steps at test time, TICL presents a novel yet simple approach for personalized alignment.</p>

<p>Abstract: Foundation models are becoming increasingly effective in the medical domain, offering pre-trained models on large datasets that can be readily adapted for downstream tasks. Despite progress, fetal ultrasound images remain a challenging domain for foundation models due to their inherent complexity, often requiring substantial additional training and facing limitations due to the scarcity of paired multimodal data. To overcome these challenges, here we introduce FetalCLIP, a vision-language foundation model capable of generating universal representation of fetal ultrasound images. FetalCLIP was pre-trained using a multimodal learning approach on a diverse dataset of 210,035 fetal ultrasound images paired with text. This represents the largest paired dataset of its kind used for foundation model development to date. This unique training approach allows FetalCLIP to effectively learn the intricate anatomical features present in fetal ultrasound images, resulting in robust representations that can be used for a variety of downstream applications. In extensive benchmarking across a range of key fetal ultrasound applications, including classification, gestational age estimation, congenital heart defect (CHD) detection, and fetal structure segmentation, FetalCLIP outperformed all baselines while demonstrating remarkable generalizability and strong performance even with limited labeled data. We plan to release the FetalCLIP model publicly for the benefit of the broader scientific community.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arefeh Kazemi, Sri Balaaji Natarajan Kalaivendan, Joachim Wagner, Hamza Qadeer, Brian Davis</p>
<p>Abstract: Cyberbullying (CB) presents a pressing threat, especially to children, underscoring the urgent need for robust detection systems to ensure online safety. However, progress in developing such systems is hindered by the scarcity of large, labeled datasets that are specifically tailored for specialized tasks and the target age groups. Creating these datasets relies heavily on human annotation, which not only strains resources but also raises significant ethical and legal concerns due to annotators' exposure to harmful content, notwithstanding the acquisition of this type of data from vulnerable populations such as children. In this paper, we address these challenges by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate synthetic data and labels. Our experiments demonstrate that synthetic data enables BERT-based CB classifiers to achieve performance close to that of those trained on fully authentic datasets (75.8% vs. 81.5% accuracy). Additionally, LLMs can effectively label authentic yet unlabeled data, allowing BERT classifiers to attain a comparable performance level (79.1% vs. 81.5% accuracy). These results highlight the potential of LLMs as a scalable, ethical, and cost-effective solution for generating data for CB detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> William Rudman, Michal Golovanevsky, Amir Bar, Vedant Palit, Yann LeCun, Carsten Eickhoff, Ritambhara Singh</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite strong performance on vision-language tasks, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with mathematical problem-solving, with both open-source and state-of-the-art models falling short of human performance on visual-math benchmarks. To systematically examine visual-mathematical reasoning in MLLMs, we (1) evaluate their understanding of geometric primitives, (2) test multi-step reasoning, and (3) explore a potential solution to improve visual reasoning capabilities. Our findings reveal fundamental shortcomings in shape recognition, with top models achieving under 50% accuracy in identifying regular polygons. We analyze these failures through the lens of dual-process theory and show that MLLMs rely on System 1 (intuitive, memorized associations) rather than System 2 (deliberate reasoning). Consequently, MLLMs fail to count the sides of both familiar and novel shapes, suggesting they have neither learned the concept of sides nor effectively process visual inputs. Finally, we propose Visually Cued Chain-of-Thought (VC-CoT) prompting, which enhances multi-step mathematical reasoning by explicitly referencing visual annotations in diagrams, boosting GPT-4o's accuracy on an irregular polygon side-counting task from 7% to 93%. Our findings suggest that System 2 reasoning in MLLMs remains an open problem, and visually-guided prompting is essential for successfully engaging visual reasoning.

<p>Abstract: We present M2-omni, a cutting-edge, open-source omni-MLLM that achieves competitive performance to GPT-4o. M2-omni employs a unified multimodal sequence modeling framework, which empowers Large Language Models(LLMs) to acquire comprehensive cross-modal understanding and generation capabilities. Specifically, M2-omni can process arbitrary combinations of audio, video, image, and text modalities as input, generating multimodal sequences interleaving with audio, image, or text outputs, thereby enabling an advanced and interactive real-time experience. The training of such an omni-MLLM is challenged by significant disparities in data quantity and convergence rates across modalities. To address these challenges, we propose a step balance strategy during pre-training to handle the quantity disparities in modality-specific data. Additionally, a dynamically adaptive balance strategy is introduced during the instruction tuning stage to synchronize the modality-wise training progress, ensuring optimal convergence. Notably, we prioritize preserving strong performance on pure text tasks to maintain the robustness of M2-omni's language understanding capability throughout the training process. To our best knowledge, M2-omni is currently a very competitive open-source model to GPT-4o, characterized by its comprehensive modality and task support, as well as its exceptional performance. We expect M2-omni will advance the development of omni-MLLMs, thus facilitating future research in this domain.</p>

Central to the pipeline is BERTopic, a modular framework that allows unsupervised topic modeling. After a series of preprocessing and postprocessing steps, we assign one of 12 topics and several additional labels to incoming emails, allowing the customer service to filter and access them through a custom-made application. The model's performance was evaluated by assessing the speed and correctness of the automatically assigned topics, with a weighted average processing time of 0.041 seconds per email and a weighted average F1 score of 0.96. The pipeline shows broad applicability across languages, particularly to those that are low-resourced and morphologically rich.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiawei Huang, Bingcong Li, Christoph Dann, Niao He</p>
<p>Abstract: Sample efficiency is critical for online Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). While existing works investigate sample-efficient online exploration strategies, the potential of utilizing misspecified yet relevant reward models to accelerate learning remains underexplored. This paper studies how to transfer knowledge from those imperfect reward models in online RLHF. We start by identifying a novel property of the KL-regularized RLHF objective: \emph{a policy's coverability of the optimal policy is captured by its sub-optimality}. Building on this insight, we propose novel transfer learning principles and a theoretical algorithm with provable benefits compared to standard online learning. Our approach achieves low regret in the early stage by quickly adapting to the best available source reward models without prior knowledge of their quality, and over time, it attains an $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound \emph{independent} of structural complexity measures. Empirically, inspired by our theoretical findings, we develop a win-rate-based transfer policy selection method with improved computational efficiency. Moreover, our empirical transfer learning technique is modular and can be integrated with various policy optimization methods, such as DPO, IPO and XPO, to further enhance their performance. We validate the effectiveness of our method through experiments on summarization tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Real-time video segmentation is a promising feature for AI-assisted surgery, providing intraoperative guidance by identifying surgical tools and anatomical structures. However, deploying state-of-the-art segmentation models, such as SAM2, in real-time settings is computationally demanding, which makes it essential to balance frame rate and segmentation performance. In this study, we investigate the impact of frame rate on zero-shot surgical video segmentation, evaluating SAM2's effectiveness across multiple frame sampling rates for cholecystectomy procedures. Surprisingly, our findings indicate that in conventional evaluation settings, frame rates as low as a single frame per second can outperform 25 FPS, as fewer frames smooth out segmentation inconsistencies. However, when assessed in a real-time streaming scenario, higher frame rates yield superior temporal coherence and stability, particularly for dynamic objects such as surgical graspers. Finally, we investigate human perception of real-time surgical video segmentation among professionals who work closely with such data and find that respondents consistently prefer high FPS segmentation mask overlays, reinforcing the importance of real-time evaluation in AI-assisted surgery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arvin Hosseinzadeh, Ladan Khoshnevisan, Mohammad Pirani, Shojaeddin Chenouri, Amir Khajepour</p>
<p>Abstract: In continual time series analysis using neural networks, catastrophic forgetting (CF) of previously learned models when training on new data domains has always been a significant challenge. This problem is especially challenging in vehicle estimation and control, where new information is sequentially introduced to the model. Unfortunately, existing work on continual learning has not sufficiently addressed the adverse effects of catastrophic forgetting in time series analysis, particularly in multivariate output environments. In this paper, we present EM-ReSeleCT (Efficient Multivariate Representative Selection for Continual Learning in Time Series Tasks), an enhanced approach designed to handle continual learning in multivariate environments. Our approach strategically selects representative subsets from old and historical data and incorporates memory-based continual learning techniques with an improved optimization algorithm to adapt the pre-trained model on new information while preserving previously acquired information. Additionally, we develop a sequence-to-sequence transformer model (autoregressive model) specifically designed for vehicle state estimation. Moreover, we propose an uncertainty quantification framework using conformal prediction to assess the sensitivity of the memory size and to showcase the robustness of the proposed method. Experimental results from tests on an electric Equinox vehicle highlight the superiority of our method in continually learning new information while retaining prior knowledge, outperforming state-of-the-art continual learning methods. Furthermore, EM-ReSeleCT significantly reduces training time, a critical advantage in continual learning applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanshu Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal in-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a key capability of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), driven by their increasing scale and applicability. Despite its promise, effective ICL in the multimodal setting remains challenging due to the inherent complexity of image-text inputs and the high sensitivity of ICL performance to input configurations. In this work, we shed light on the core mechanism underlying multimodal ICL, identifying task mapping as a crucial factor in configuring robust in-context demonstration (ICD) sequences. Building on these insights, we propose \textit{SabER}, a lightweight yet powerful decoder-only transformer equipped with task-aware attention, which intelligently selects and arranges ICDs from a demonstration library in an autoregressive fashion. This design enables fine-grained feature extraction and cross-modal reasoning, iteratively refining task mapping to generate high-quality ICD sequences. Through extensive experiments covering five LVLMs and nine benchmark datasets, SabER not only demonstrates strong empirical performance, but also provides deeper understanding of how task semantics interact with multimodal ICDs. Our findings highlight the importance of principled ICD sequence configuration and open new avenues to enhance multimodal ICL in a wide range of real-world scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiming Li, Kaiying Yan, Shuo Shao, Tongqing Zhai, Shu-Tao Xia, Zhan Qin, Dacheng Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: With the increasing adoption of deep learning in speaker verification, large-scale speech datasets have become valuable intellectual property. To audit and prevent the unauthorized usage of these valuable released datasets, especially in commercial or open-source scenarios, we propose a novel dataset ownership verification method. Our approach introduces a clustering-based backdoor watermark (CBW), enabling dataset owners to determine whether a suspicious third-party model has been trained on a protected dataset under a black-box setting. The CBW method consists of two key stages: dataset watermarking and ownership verification. During watermarking, we implant multiple trigger patterns in the dataset to make similar samples (measured by their feature similarities) close to the same trigger while dissimilar samples are near different triggers. This ensures that any model trained on the watermarked dataset exhibits specific misclassification behaviors when exposed to trigger-embedded inputs. To verify dataset ownership, we design a hypothesis-test-based framework that statistically evaluates whether a suspicious model exhibits the expected backdoor behavior. We conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, verifying the effectiveness and robustness of our method against potential adaptive attacks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dom Huh, Prasant Mohapatra</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a diffusion-based auto-bidding framework that leverages graph representations to model large-scale auction environments. In such settings, agents must dynamically optimize bidding strategies under constraints defined by key performance indicator (KPI) metrics, all while operating in competitive environments characterized by uncertain, sparse, and stochastic variables. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel approach combining learnable graph-based embeddings with a planning-based latent diffusion model (LDM). By capturing patterns and nuances underlying the interdependence of impression opportunities and the multi-agent dynamics of the auction environment, the graph representation enable expressive computations regarding auto-bidding outcomes. With reward alignment techniques, the LDM's posterior is fine-tuned to generate auto-bidding trajectories that maximize KPI metrics while satisfying constraint thresholds. Empirical evaluations on both real-world and synthetic auction environments demonstrate significant improvements in auto-bidding performance across multiple common KPI metrics, as well as accuracy in forecasting auction outcomes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Feng Gu, Zongxia Li, Carlos Rafael Colon, Benjamin Evans, Ishani Mondal, Jordan Lee Boyd-Graber</p>
<p>Abstract: Event annotation is important for identifying market changes, monitoring breaking news, and understanding sociological trends. Although expert annotators set the gold standards, human coding is expensive and inefficient. Unlike information extraction experiments that focus on single contexts, we evaluate a holistic workflow that removes irrelevant documents, merges documents about the same event, and annotates the events. Although LLM-based automated annotations are better than traditional TF-IDF-based methods or Event Set Curation, they are still not reliable annotators compared to human experts. However, adding LLMs to assist experts for Event Set Curation can reduce the time and mental effort required for Variable Annotation. When using LLMs to extract event variables to assist expert annotators, they agree more with the extracted variables than fully automated LLMs for annotation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bardia Safaei, Faizan Siddiqui, Jiacong Xu, Vishal M. Patel, Shao-Yuan Lo</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual instruction tuning (VIT) for large vision-language models (LVLMs) requires training on expansive datasets of image-instruction pairs, which can be costly. Recent efforts in VIT data selection aim to select a small subset of high-quality image-instruction pairs, reducing VIT runtime while maintaining performance comparable to full-scale training. However, a major challenge often overlooked is that generating instructions from unlabeled images for VIT is highly expensive. Most existing VIT datasets rely heavily on human annotations or paid services like the GPT API, which limits users with constrained resources from creating VIT datasets for custom applications. To address this, we introduce Pre-Instruction Data Selection (PreSel), a more practical data selection paradigm that directly selects the most beneficial unlabeled images and generates instructions only for the selected images. PreSel first estimates the relative importance of each vision task within VIT datasets to derive task-wise sampling budgets. It then clusters image features within each task, selecting the most representative images with the budget. This approach reduces computational overhead for both instruction generation during VIT data formation and LVLM fine-tuning. By generating instructions for only 15% of the images, PreSel achieves performance comparable to full-data VIT on the LLaVA-1.5 and Vision-Flan datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adel ElZemity, Budi Arief, Shujun Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into cyber security applications presents significant opportunities, such as enhancing threat analysis and malware detection, but can also introduce critical risks and safety concerns, including personal data leakage and automated generation of new malware. To address these challenges, we developed CyberLLMInstruct, a dataset of 54,928 instruction-response pairs spanning cyber security tasks such as malware analysis, phishing simulations, and zero-day vulnerabilities. The dataset was constructed through a multi-stage process. This involved sourcing data from multiple resources, filtering and structuring it into instruction-response pairs, and aligning it with real-world scenarios to enhance its applicability. Seven open-source LLMs were chosen to test the usefulness of CyberLLMInstruct: Phi 3 Mini 3.8B, Mistral 7B, Qwen 2.5 7B, Llama 3 8B, Llama 3.1 8B, Gemma 2 9B, and Llama 2 70B. In our primary example, we rigorously assess the safety of fine-tuned models using the OWASP top 10 framework, finding that fine-tuning reduces safety resilience across all tested LLMs and every adversarial attack (e.g., the security score of Llama 3.1 8B against prompt injection drops from 0.95 to 0.15). In our second example, we show that these same fine-tuned models can also achieve up to 92.50 percent accuracy on the CyberMetric benchmark. These findings highlight a trade-off between performance and safety, showing the importance of adversarial testing and further research into fine-tuning methodologies that can mitigate safety risks while still improving performance across diverse datasets and domains. The dataset creation pipeline, along with comprehensive documentation, examples, and resources for reproducing our results, is publicly available at https://github.com/Adelsamir01/CyberLLMInstruct.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dejan Milojevic, Gioele Zardini, Miriam Elser, Andrea Censi, Emilio Frazzoli</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper discusses the integration challenges and strategies for designing mobile robots, by focusing on the task-driven, optimal selection of hardware and software to balance safety, efficiency, and minimal usage of resources such as costs, energy, computational requirements, and weight. We emphasize the interplay between perception and motion planning in decision-making by introducing the concept of occupancy queries to quantify the perception requirements for sampling-based motion planners. Sensor and algorithm performance are evaluated using False Negative Rates (FPR) and False Positive Rates (FPR) across various factors such as geometric relationships, object properties, sensor resolution, and environmental conditions. By integrating perception requirements with perception performance, an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) approach is proposed for efficient sensor and algorithm selection and placement. This forms the basis for a co-design optimization that includes the robot body, motion planner, perception pipeline, and computing unit. We refer to this framework for solving the co-design problem of mobile robots as CODEI, short for Co-design of Embodied Intelligence. A case study on developing an Autonomous Vehicle (AV) for urban scenarios provides actionable information for designers, and shows that complex tasks escalate resource demands, with task performance affecting choices of the autonomy stack. The study demonstrates that resource prioritization influences sensor choice: cameras are preferred for cost-effective and lightweight designs, while lidar sensors are chosen for better energy and computational efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Liu, Pei Liu, Guoming Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: The linear growth of key-value (KV) cache memory and quadratic computational in attention mechanisms complexity pose significant bottlenecks for large language models (LLMs) in long-context processing. While existing KV cache optimization methods address these challenges through token pruning or feature merging, they often incur irreversible information loss or require costly parameter retraining. To this end, we propose ZSMerge, a dynamic KV cache compression framework designed for efficient cache management, featuring three key operations: (1) fine-grained memory allocation guided by multi-dimensional token importance metrics at head-level granularity, (2) a residual merging mechanism that preserves critical context through compensated attention scoring, and (3) a zero-shot adaptation mechanism compatible with diverse LLM architectures without requiring retraining. ZSMerge significantly enhances memory efficiency and inference speed with negligible performance degradation across LLMs. When applied to LLaMA2-7B, it demonstrates a 20:1 compression ratio for key-value cache retention (reducing memory footprint to 5\% of baseline) while sustaining comparable generation quality, coupled with triple throughput gains at extreme 54k-token contexts that eliminate out-of-memory failures.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hai Zhao, Hongqiu Wu, Dongjie Yang, Anni Zou, Jiale Hong</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper reports the first brain-inspired large language model (BriLLM). This is a non-Transformer, non-GPT, non-traditional machine learning input-output controlled generative language model. The model is based on the Signal Fully-connected flowing (SiFu) definition on the directed graph in terms of the neural network, and has the interpretability of all nodes on the graph of the whole model, instead of the traditional machine learning model that only has limited interpretability at the input and output ends. In the language model scenario, the token is defined as a node in the graph. A randomly shaped or user-defined signal flow flows between nodes on the principle of "least resistance" along paths. The next token or node to be predicted or generated is the target of the signal flow. As a language model, BriLLM theoretically supports infinitely long $n$-gram models when the model size is independent of the input and predicted length of the model. The model's working signal flow provides the possibility of recall activation and innate multi-modal support similar to the cognitive patterns of the human brain. At present, we released the first BriLLM version in Chinese, with 4000 tokens, 32-dimensional node width, 16-token long sequence prediction ability, and language model prediction performance comparable to GPT-1. More computing power will help us explore the infinite possibilities depicted above.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yucheng Suo, Fan Ma, Kaixin Shen, Linchao Zhu, Yi Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual instructions for long-horizon tasks are crucial as they intuitively clarify complex concepts and enhance retention across extended steps. Directly generating a series of images using text-to-image models without considering the context of previous steps results in inconsistent images, increasing cognitive load. Additionally, the generated images often miss objects or the attributes such as color, shape, and state of the objects are inaccurate. To address these challenges, we propose LIGER, the first training-free framework for Long-horizon Instruction GEneration with logic and attribute self-Reflection. LIGER first generates a draft image for each step with the historical prompt and visual memory of previous steps. This step-by-step generation approach maintains consistency between images in long-horizon tasks. Moreover, LIGER utilizes various image editing tools to rectify errors including wrong attributes, logic errors, object redundancy, and identity inconsistency in the draft images. Through this self-reflection mechanism, LIGER improves the logic and object attribute correctness of the images. To verify whether the generated images assist human understanding, we manually curated a new benchmark consisting of various long-horizon tasks. Human-annotated ground truth expressions reflect the human-defined criteria for how an image should appear to be illustrative. Experiments demonstrate the visual instructions generated by LIGER are more comprehensive compared with baseline methods.</p>

We organize our analysis across three foundational dimensions: data distribution, representation learning, and OOD evaluation. For each dimension, we present several popular algorithms in detail. Furthermore, we highlight key application scenarios, emphasizing their real-world impact. Finally, we identify persistent challenges and propose future research directions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaymari Chua, Chen Wang, Lina Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: As artificial intelligence surpasses human performance in select tasks, disclosing superhuman capabilities poses distinct challenges for fairness, accountability, and trust. However, the impact of such disclosures on diverse user attitudes and behaviors remains unclear, particularly concerning potential negative reactions like discouragement or overreliance. This paper investigates these effects by utilizing Persona Cards: a validated, standardized set of synthetic personas designed to simulate diverse user reactions and fairness perspectives. We conducted an ethics board-approved study (N=32), utilizing these personas to investigate how capability disclosure influenced behaviors with a superhuman game AI in competitive StarCraft II scenarios. Our results reveal transparency is double-edged: while disclosure could alleviate suspicion, it also provoked frustration and strategic defeatism among novices in cooperative scenarios, as well as overreliance in competitive contexts. Experienced and competitive players interpreted disclosure as confirmation of an unbeatable opponent, shifting to suboptimal goals. We release the Persona Cards Dataset, including profiles, prompts, interaction logs, and protocols, to foster reproducible research into human alignment AI design. This work demonstrates that transparency is not a cure-all; successfully leveraging disclosure to enhance trust and accountability requires careful tailoring to user characteristics, domain norms, and specific fairness objectives.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anket Mehra, Andreas A{\ss}muth, Malte Prie{\ss}</p>
<p>Abstract: With AI-based software becoming widely available, the risk of exploiting its capabilities, such as high automation and complex pattern recognition, could significantly increase. An AI used offensively to attack non-AI assets is referred to as offensive AI.
  Current research explores how offensive AI can be utilized and how its usage can be classified. Additionally, methods for threat modeling are being developed for AI-based assets within organizations. However, there are gaps that need to be addressed. Firstly, there is a need to quantify the factors contributing to the AI threat. Secondly, there is a requirement to create threat models that analyze the risk of being attacked by AI for vulnerability assessment across all assets of an organization. This is particularly crucial and challenging in cloud environments, where sophisticated infrastructure and access control landscapes are prevalent. The ability to quantify and further analyze the threat posed by offensive AI enables analysts to rank vulnerabilities and prioritize the implementation of proactive countermeasures.
  To address these gaps, this paper introduces the Graph of Effort, an intuitive, flexible, and effective threat modeling method for analyzing the effort required to use offensive AI for vulnerability exploitation by an adversary. While the threat model is functional and provides valuable support, its design choices need further empirical validation in future work.</p>

<p>Abstract: Detecting and tracking multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in thermal infrared video is inherently challenging due to low contrast, environmental noise, and small target sizes. This paper provides a straightforward approach to address multi-UAV tracking in thermal infrared video, leveraging recent advances in detection and tracking. Instead of relying on the well-established YOLOv5 with DeepSORT combination, we present a tracking framework built on YOLOv12 and BoT-SORT, enhanced with tailored training and inference strategies. We evaluate our approach following the 4th Anti-UAV Challenge metrics and reach competitive performance. Notably, we achieved strong results without using contrast enhancement or temporal information fusion to enrich UAV features, highlighting our approach as a "Strong Baseline" for multi-UAV tracking tasks. We provide implementation details, in-depth experimental analysis, and a discussion of potential improvements. The code is available at https://github.com/wish44165/YOLOv12-BoT-SORT-ReID .</p>

<p>Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating diverse portraits, but lack intuitive shadow control. Existing editing approaches, as post-processing, struggle to offer effective manipulation across diverse styles. Additionally, these methods either rely on expensive real-world light-stage data collection or require extensive computational resources for training. To address these limitations, we introduce Shadow Director, a method that extracts and manipulates hidden shadow attributes within well-trained diffusion models. Our approach uses a small estimation network that requires only a few thousand synthetic images and hours of training-no costly real-world light-stage data needed. Shadow Director enables parametric and intuitive control over shadow shape, placement, and intensity during portrait generation while preserving artistic integrity and identity across diverse styles. Despite training only on synthetic data built on real-world identities, it generalizes effectively to generated portraits with diverse styles, making it a more accessible and resource-friendly solution.</p>

<p>Abstract: Autonomous driving has made significant progress in both academia and industry, including performance improvements in perception task and the development of end-to-end autonomous driving systems. However, the safety and robustness assessment of autonomous driving has not received sufficient attention. Current evaluations of autonomous driving are typically conducted in natural driving scenarios. However, many accidents often occur in edge cases, also known as safety-critical scenarios. These safety-critical scenarios are difficult to collect, and there is currently no clear definition of what constitutes a safety-critical scenario. In this work, we explore the safety and robustness of autonomous driving in safety-critical scenarios. First, we provide a definition of safety-critical scenarios, including static traffic scenarios such as adversarial attack scenarios and natural distribution shifts, as well as dynamic traffic scenarios such as accident scenarios. Then, we develop an autonomous driving safety testing platform to comprehensively evaluate autonomous driving systems, encompassing not only the assessment of perception modules but also system-level evaluations. Our work systematically constructs a safety verification process for autonomous driving, providing technical support for the industry to establish standardized test framework and reduce risks in real-world road deployment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mike Winer, Boris Hanin</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural networks are complex functions of both their inputs and parameters. Much prior work in deep learning theory analyzes the distribution of network outputs at a fixed a set of inputs (e.g. a training dataset) over random initializations of the network parameters. The purpose of this article is to consider the opposite situation: we view a randomly initialized Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) as a Hamiltonian over its inputs. For typical realizations of the network parameters, we study the properties of the energy landscape induced by this Hamiltonian, focusing on the structure of near-global minimum in the limit of infinite width. Specifically, we use the replica trick to perform an exact analytic calculation giving the entropy (log volume of space) at a given energy. We further derive saddle point equations that describe the overlaps between inputs sampled iid from the Gibbs distribution induced by the random MLP. For linear activations we solve these saddle point equations exactly. But we also solve them numerically for a variety of depths and activation functions, including $\tanh, \sin, \text{ReLU}$, and shaped non-linearities. We find even at infinite width a rich range of behaviors. For some non-linearities, such as $\sin$, for instance, we find that the landscapes of random MLPs exhibit full replica symmetry breaking, while shallow $\tanh$ and ReLU networks or deep shaped MLPs are instead replica symmetric.</p>

<p>Abstract: The opioid overdose epidemic remains a critical public health crisis, particularly in the United States, leading to significant mortality and societal costs. Social media platforms like Reddit provide vast amounts of unstructured data that offer insights into public perceptions, discussions, and experiences related to opioid use. This study leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP), specifically Opioid Named Entity Recognition (ONER-2025), to extract actionable information from these platforms. Our research makes four key contributions. First, we created a unique, manually annotated dataset sourced from Reddit, where users share self-reported experiences of opioid use via different administration routes. This dataset contains 331,285 tokens and includes eight major opioid entity categories. Second, we detail our annotation process and guidelines while discussing the challenges of labeling the ONER-2025 dataset. Third, we analyze key linguistic challenges, including slang, ambiguity, fragmented sentences, and emotionally charged language, in opioid discussions. Fourth, we propose a real-time monitoring system to process streaming data from social media, healthcare records, and emergency services to identify overdose events. Using 5-fold cross-validation in 11 experiments, our system integrates machine learning, deep learning, and transformer-based language models with advanced contextual embeddings to enhance understanding. Our transformer-based models (bert-base-NER and roberta-base) achieved 97% accuracy and F1-score, outperforming baselines by 10.23% (RF=0.88).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Giovanni Cioffi, Leonard Bauersfeld, Davide Scaramuzza</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual-inertial odometry (VIO) is widely used for state estimation in autonomous micro aerial vehicles using onboard sensors. Current methods improve VIO by incorporating a model of the translational vehicle dynamics, yet their performance degrades when faced with low-accuracy vehicle models or continuous external disturbances, like wind. Additionally, incorporating rotational dynamics in these models is computationally intractable when they are deployed in online applications, e.g., in a closed-loop control system. We present HDVIO2.0, which models full 6-DoF, translational and rotational, vehicle dynamics and tightly incorporates them into a VIO with minimal impact on the runtime. HDVIO2.0 builds upon the previous work, HDVIO, and addresses these challenges through a hybrid dynamics model combining a point-mass vehicle model with a learning-based component, with access to control commands and IMU history, to capture complex aerodynamic effects. The key idea behind modeling the rotational dynamics is to represent them with continuous-time functions. HDVIO2.0 leverages the divergence between the actual motion and the predicted motion from the hybrid dynamics model to estimate external forces as well as the robot state. Our system surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art methods in experiments using public and new drone dynamics datasets, as well as real-world flights in winds up to 25 km/h. Unlike existing approaches, we also show that accurate vehicle dynamics predictions are achievable without precise knowledge of the full vehicle state.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juncheng Wu, Wenlong Deng, Xingxuan Li, Sheng Liu, Taomian Mi, Yifan Peng, Ziyang Xu, Yi Liu, Hyunjin Cho, Chang-In Choi, Yihan Cao, Hui Ren, Xiang Li, Xiaoxiao Li, Yuyin Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical tasks such as diagnosis and treatment planning require precise and complex reasoning, particularly in life-critical domains. Unlike mathematical reasoning, medical reasoning demands meticulous, verifiable thought processes to ensure reliability and accuracy. However, there is a notable lack of datasets that provide transparent, step-by-step reasoning to validate and enhance the medical reasoning ability of AI models. To bridge this gap, we introduce MedReason, a large-scale high-quality medical reasoning dataset designed to enable faithful and explainable medical problem-solving in large language models (LLMs). We utilize a structured medical knowledge graph (KG) to convert clinical QA pairs into logical chains of reasoning, or ``thinking paths'', which trace connections from question elements to answers via relevant KG entities. Each path is validated for consistency with clinical logic and evidence-based medicine. Our pipeline generates detailed reasoning for various medical questions from 7 medical datasets, resulting in a dataset of 32,682 question-answer pairs, each with detailed, step-by-step explanations. Experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning with our dataset consistently boosts medical problem-solving capabilities, achieving significant gains of up to 7.7% for DeepSeek-Ditill-8B. Our top-performing model, MedReason-8B, outperforms the Huatuo-o1-8B, a state-of-the-art medical reasoning model, by up to 4.2% on the clinical benchmark MedBullets. We also engage medical professionals from diverse specialties to assess our dataset's quality, ensuring MedReason offers accurate and coherent medical reasoning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aofan Liu, Lulu Tang, Ting Pan, Yuguo Yin, Bin Wang, Ao Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which integrate vision and other modalities into Large Language Models (LLMs), significantly enhance AI capabilities but also introduce new security vulnerabilities. By exploiting the vulnerabilities of the visual modality and the long-tail distribution characteristic of code training data, we present PiCo, a novel jailbreaking framework designed to progressively bypass multi-tiered defense mechanisms in advanced MLLMs. PiCo employs a tier-by-tier jailbreak strategy, using token-level typographic attacks to evade input filtering and embedding harmful intent within programming context instructions to bypass runtime monitoring. To comprehensively assess the impact of attacks, a new evaluation metric is further proposed to assess both the toxicity and helpfulness of model outputs post-attack. By embedding harmful intent within code-style visual instructions, PiCo achieves an average Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 84.13% on Gemini-Pro Vision and 52.66% on GPT-4, surpassing previous methods. Experimental results highlight the critical gaps in current defenses, underscoring the need for more robust strategies to secure advanced MLLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuchen Wang, Shangxin Guo, Chee Wei Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid pace of large-scale software development places increasing demands on traditional testing methodologies, often leading to bottlenecks in efficiency, accuracy, and coverage. We propose a novel perspective on software testing by positing bug detection and coding with fewer bugs as two interconnected problems that share a common goal, which is reducing bugs with limited resources. We extend our previous work on AI-assisted programming, which supports code auto-completion and chatbot-powered Q&A, to the realm of software testing. We introduce Copilot for Testing, an automated testing system that synchronizes bug detection with codebase updates, leveraging context-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Our evaluation demonstrates a 31.2% improvement in bug detection accuracy, a 12.6% increase in critical test coverage, and a 10.5% higher user acceptance rate, highlighting the transformative potential of AI-driven technologies in modern software development practices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zijun Liu, Peiyi Wang, Runxin Xu, Shirong Ma, Chong Ruan, Peng Li, Yang Liu, Yu Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely adopted in post-training for large language models (LLMs) at scale. Recently, the incentivization of reasoning capabilities in LLMs from RL indicates that $\textit{proper learning methods could enable effective inference-time scalability}$. A key challenge of RL is to obtain accurate reward signals for LLMs in various domains beyond verifiable questions or artificial rules. In this work, we investigate how to improve reward modeling (RM) with more inference compute for general queries, i.e. the $\textbf{inference-time scalability of generalist RM}$, and further, how to improve the effectiveness of performance-compute scaling with proper learning methods. For the RM approach, we adopt pointwise generative reward modeling (GRM) to enable flexibility for different input types and potential for inference-time scaling. For the learning method, we propose Self-Principled Critique Tuning (SPCT) to foster scalable reward generation behaviors in GRMs through online RL, to generate principles adaptively and critiques accurately, resulting in $\textbf{DeepSeek-GRM}$ models. Furthermore, for effective inference-time scaling, we use parallel sampling to expand compute usage, and introduce a meta RM to guide voting process for better scaling performance. Empirically, we show that SPCT significantly improves the quality and scalability of GRMs, outperforming existing methods and models in various RM benchmarks without severe biases, and could achieve better performance compared to training-time scaling. DeepSeek-GRM still meets challenges in some tasks, which we believe can be addressed by future efforts in generalist reward systems. The models will be released and open-sourced.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhishek Sharma, Dan Goldwasser</p>
<p>Abstract: LLMs' remarkable ability to tackle a wide range of language tasks opened new opportunities for collaborative human-AI problem solving. LLMs can amplify human capabilities by applying their intuitions and reasoning strategies at scale. We explore whether human guides can be simulated, by generalizing from human demonstrations of guiding an AI system to solve complex language problems. We introduce CoLa, a novel self-guided learning paradigm for training automated $\textit{guides}$ and evaluate it on two QA datasets, a puzzle-solving task, and a constrained text generation task. Our empirical results show that CoLa consistently outperforms competitive approaches across all domains. Moreover, a small-sized trained guide outperforms a strong model like GPT-4 when acting as a guide. We compare the strategies employed by humans and automated guides by conducting a human study on a QA dataset. We show that automated guides outperform humans by adapting their strategies to reasoners' capabilities and conduct qualitative analyses highlighting distinct differences in guiding strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huiyong Li, Boxuan Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) tools have demonstrated their potential to deliver high-quality assistance by providing instant, personalized feedback that is crucial for effective programming education. However, many of these tools operate independently from institutional Learning Management Systems, which creates a significant disconnect. This isolation limits the ability to leverage learning materials and exercise context for generating tailored, context-aware feedback. Furthermore, previous research on self-regulated learning and LLM support mainly focused on knowledge acquisition, not the development of important self-regulation skills. To address these challenges, we developed CodeRunner Agent, an LLM-based programming assistant that integrates the CodeRunner, a student-submitted code executing and automated grading plugin in Moodle. CodeRunner Agent empowers educators to customize AI-generated feedback by incorporating detailed context from lecture materials, programming questions, student answers, and execution results. Additionally, it enhances students' self-regulated learning by providing strategy-based AI responses. This integrated, context-aware, and skill-focused approach offers promising avenues for data-driven improvements in programming education.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kexin Tian, Jingrui Mao, Yunlong Zhang, Jiwan Jiang, Yang Zhou, Zhengzhong Tu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong potential for autonomous driving tasks. However, their spatial understanding and reasoning-key capabilities for autonomous driving-still exhibit significant limitations. Notably, none of the existing benchmarks systematically evaluate VLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities in driving scenarios. To fill this gap, we propose NuScenes-SpatialQA, the first large-scale ground-truth-based Question-Answer (QA) benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the spatial understanding and reasoning capabilities of VLMs in autonomous driving. Built upon the NuScenes dataset, the benchmark is constructed through an automated 3D scene graph generation pipeline and a QA generation pipeline. The benchmark systematically evaluates VLMs' performance in both spatial understanding and reasoning across multiple dimensions. Using this benchmark, we conduct extensive experiments on diverse VLMs, including both general and spatial-enhanced models, providing the first comprehensive evaluation of their spatial capabilities in autonomous driving. Surprisingly, the experimental results show that the spatial-enhanced VLM outperforms in qualitative QA but does not demonstrate competitiveness in quantitative QA. In general, VLMs still face considerable challenges in spatial understanding and reasoning.</p>
