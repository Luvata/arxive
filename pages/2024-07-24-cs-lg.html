<p><b>Authors:</b> Simen Eide, Arnoldo Frigessi</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces Bayesian Hierarchical Low-Rank Adaption (BoRA), a novel method for finetuning multi-task Large Language Models (LLMs). Current finetuning approaches, such as Low-Rank Adaption (LoRA), perform exeptionally well in reducing training parameters and memory usage but face limitations when applied to multiple similar tasks. Practitioners usually have to choose between training separate models for each task or a single model for all tasks, both of which come with trade-offs in specialization and data utilization.
  BoRA addresses these trade-offs by leveraging a Bayesian hierarchical model that allows tasks to share information through global hierarchical priors. This enables tasks with limited data to benefit from the overall structure derived from related tasks while allowing tasks with more data to specialize. Our experimental results show that BoRA outperforms both individual and unified model approaches, achieving lower perplexity and better generalization across tasks. This method provides a scalable and efficient solution for multi-task LLM finetuning, with significant practical implications for diverse applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiuhong Wei, Ying Cui, Mengwei Ding, Yanqin Wang, Lingling Xiang, Zhengxiong Yao, Ceran Chen, Ying Long, Zhezhen Jin, Ximing Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential applications in medicine, yet data privacy and computational burden limit their deployment in healthcare institutions. Open-source and lightweight versions of LLMs emerge as potential solutions, but their performance, particularly in pediatric settings remains underexplored. In this cross-sectional study, 250 patient consultation questions were randomly selected from a public online medical forum, with 10 questions from each of 25 pediatric departments, spanning from December 1, 2022, to October 30, 2023. Two lightweight open-source LLMs, ChatGLM3-6B and Vicuna-7B, along with a larger-scale model, Vicuna-13B, and the widely-used proprietary ChatGPT-3.5, independently answered these questions in Chinese between November 1, 2023, and November 7, 2023. To assess reproducibility, each inquiry was replicated once. We found that ChatGLM3-6B demonstrated higher accuracy and completeness than Vicuna-13B and Vicuna-7B (P < .001), but all were outperformed by ChatGPT-3.5. ChatGPT-3.5 received the highest ratings in accuracy (65.2%) compared to ChatGLM3-6B (41.2%), Vicuna-13B (11.2%), and Vicuna-7B (4.4%). Similarly, in completeness, ChatGPT-3.5 led (78.4%), followed by ChatGLM3-6B (76.0%), Vicuna-13B (34.8%), and Vicuna-7B (22.0%) in highest ratings. ChatGLM3-6B matched ChatGPT-3.5 in readability, both outperforming Vicuna models (P < .001). In terms of empathy, ChatGPT-3.5 outperformed the lightweight LLMs (P < .001). In safety, all models performed comparably well (P > .05), with over 98.4% of responses being rated as safe. Repetition of inquiries confirmed these findings. In conclusion, Lightweight LLMs demonstrate promising application in pediatric healthcare. However, the observed gap between lightweight and large-scale proprietary LLMs underscores the need for continued development efforts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zachary Rabin, Jim Davis, Benjamin Lewis, Matthew Scherreik</p>
<p>Abstract: Overfitting describes a machine learning phenomenon where the model fits too closely to the training data, resulting in poor generalization. While this occurrence is thoroughly documented for many forms of supervised learning, it is not well examined in the context of \underline{un}supervised learning. In this work we examine the nature of overfitting in unsupervised contrastive learning. We show that overfitting can indeed occur and the mechanism behind overfitting.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive survey of AI-driven mini-grid solutions aimed at enhancing sustainable energy access. It emphasises the potential of mini-grids, which can operate independently or in conjunction with national power grids, to provide reliable and affordable electricity to remote communities. Given the inherent unpredictability of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind, the necessity for accurate energy forecasting and management is discussed, highlighting the role of advanced AI techniques in forecasting energy supply and demand, optimising grid operations, and ensuring sustainable energy distribution. This paper reviews various forecasting models, including statistical methods, machine learning algorithms, and hybrid approaches, evaluating their effectiveness for both short-term and long-term predictions. Additionally, it explores public datasets and tools such as Prophet, NeuralProphet, and N-BEATS for model implementation and validation. The survey concludes with recommendations for future research, addressing challenges in model adaptation and optimisation for real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Xie, Asad Ul Haq, Linsen Ma, Krystal Sun, Sanchari Sen, Swagath Venkataramani, Liu Liu, Tong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that, during the inference on generative AI models such as transformer, the importance of different weights exhibits substantial context-dependent variations. This naturally manifests a promising potential of adaptively configuring weight quantization to improve the generative AI inference efficiency. Although configurable weight quantization can readily leverage the hardware support of variable-precision arithmetics in modern GPU and AI accelerators, little prior research has studied how one could exploit variable weight quantization to proportionally improve the AI model memory access speed and energy efficiency. Motivated by the rapidly maturing CXL ecosystem, this work develops a CXL-based design solution to fill this gap. The key is to allow CXL memory controllers play an active role in supporting and exploiting runtime configurable weight quantization. Using transformer as a representative generative AI model, we carried out experiments that well demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design solution.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chao Ma, Yikai Hou, Xiang Li, Yinggang Sun, Haining Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Short fixed-length inputs are the main bottleneck of deep learning methods in long time-series forecasting tasks. Prolonging input length causes overfitting, rapidly deteriorating accuracy. Our research indicates that the overfitting is a combination reaction of the multi-scale pattern coupling in time series and the fixed focusing scale of current models. First, we find that the patterns exhibited by a time series across various scales are reflective of its multi-periodic nature, where each scale corresponds to specific period length. Second, We find that the token size predominantly dictates model behavior, as it determines the scale at which the model focuses and the context size it can accommodate. Our idea is to decouple the multi-scale temporal patterns of time series and to model each pattern with its corresponding period length as token size. We introduced a novel series-decomposition module(MPSD), and a Multi-Token Pattern Recognition neural network(MTPR), enabling the model to handle \textit{inputs up to $10\times$ longer}. Sufficient context enhances performance(\textit{38% maximum precision improvement}), and the decoupling approach offers \textit{Low complexity($0.22\times$ cost)} and \textit{high interpretability}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Orfeas Menis-Mastromichalakis, Giorgos Filandrianos, Jason Liartis, Edmund Dervakos, Giorgos Stamou</p>
<p>Abstract: As machine learning (ML) models and datasets increase in complexity, the demand for methods that enhance explainability and interpretability becomes paramount. Prototypes, by encapsulating essential characteristics within data, offer insights that enable tactical decision-making and enhance transparency. Traditional prototype methods often rely on sub-symbolic raw data and opaque latent spaces, reducing explainability and increasing the risk of misinterpretations. This paper presents a novel framework that utilizes semantic descriptions to define prototypes and provide clear explanations, effectively addressing the shortcomings of conventional methods. Our approach leverages concept-based descriptions to cluster data on the semantic level, ensuring that prototypes not only represent underlying properties intuitively but are also straightforward to interpret. Our method simplifies the interpretative process and effectively bridges the gap between complex data structures and human cognitive processes, thereby enhancing transparency and fostering trust. Our approach outperforms existing widely-used prototype methods in facilitating human understanding and informativeness, as validated through a user survey.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Huergo, Laura Alonso, Saumitra Joshi, Adrian Juanicoteca, Gonzalo Rubio, Esteban Ferrer</p>
<p>Abstract: We explore a reinforcement learning strategy to automate and accelerate h/p-multigrid methods in high-order solvers. Multigrid methods are very efficient but require fine-tuning of numerical parameters, such as the number of smoothing sweeps per level and the correction fraction (i.e., proportion of the corrected solution that is transferred from a coarser grid to a finer grid). The objective of this paper is to use a proximal policy optimization algorithm to automatically tune the multigrid parameters and, by doing so, improve stability and efficiency of the h/p-multigrid strategy.
  Our findings reveal that the proposed reinforcement learning h/p-multigrid approach significantly accelerates and improves the robustness of steady-state simulations for one dimensional advection-diffusion and nonlinear Burgers' equations, when discretized using high-order h/p methods, on uniform and nonuniform grids.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15873">CRMSP: A Semi-supervised Approach for Key Information Extraction with Class-Rebalancing and Merged Semantic Pseudo-Labeling</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Qi Zhang, Yonghong Song, Pengcheng Guo, Yangyang Hui</p>
<p>Abstract: There is a growing demand in the field of KIE (Key Information Extraction) to apply semi-supervised learning to save manpower and costs, as training document data using fully-supervised methods requires labor-intensive manual annotation. The main challenges of applying SSL in the KIE are (1) underestimation of the confidence of tail classes in the long-tailed distribution and (2) difficulty in achieving intra-class compactness and inter-class separability of tail features. To address these challenges, we propose a novel semi-supervised approach for KIE with Class-Rebalancing and Merged Semantic Pseudo-Labeling (CRMSP). Firstly, the Class-Rebalancing Pseudo-Labeling (CRP) module introduces a reweighting factor to rebalance pseudo-labels, increasing attention to tail classes. Secondly, we propose the Merged Semantic Pseudo-Labeling (MSP) module to cluster tail features of unlabeled data by assigning samples to Merged Prototypes (MP). Additionally, we designed a new contrastive loss specifically for MSP. Extensive experimental results on three well-known benchmarks demonstrate that CRMSP achieves state-of-the-art performance. Remarkably, CRMSP achieves 3.24% f1-score improvement over state-of-the-art on the CORD.</p>

<p>Abstract: Neural network pruning is a rich field with a variety of approaches. In this work, we propose to connect the existing pruning concepts such as leave-one-out pruning and oracle pruning and develop them into a more general Shapley value-based framework that targets the compression of convolutional neural networks. To allow for practical applications in utilizing the Shapley value, this work presents the Shapley value approximations, and performs the comparative analysis in terms of cost-benefit utility for the neural network compression. The proposed ranks are evaluated against a new benchmark, Oracle rank, constructed based on oracle sets. The broad experiments show that the proposed normative ranking and its approximations show practical results, obtaining state-of-the-art network compression.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xi Chen, Yashika Sharma, Hao Helen Zhang, Xin Hao, Qiang Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: In simulation-based engineering design with time-consuming simulators, Gaussian process (GP) models are widely used as fast emulators to speed up the design optimization process. In its most commonly used form, the input of GP is a simple list of design parameters. With rapid development of additive manufacturing (also known as 3D printing), design inputs with 2D/3D spatial information become prevalent in some applications, for example, neighboring relations between pixels/voxels and material distributions in heterogeneous materials. Such spatial information, vital to 3D printed designs, is hard to incorporate into existing GP models with common kernels such as squared exponential or Mat\'ern. In this work, we propose to embed a generalized distance measure into a GP kernel, offering a novel and convenient technique to incorporate spatial information from freeform 3D printed designs into the GP framework. The proposed method allows complex design problems for 3D printed objects to take advantage of a plethora of tools available from the GP surrogate-based simulation optimization such as designed experiments and GP-based optimizations including Bayesian optimization. We investigate the properties of the proposed method and illustrate its performance by several numerical examples of 3D printed antennas. The dataset is publicly available at: https://github.com/xichennn/GP_dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaqing Lyu, Changjie Chen, Bing Liang, Yijia Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The AIDS epidemic has killed 40 million people and caused serious global problems. The identification of new HIV-inhibiting molecules is of great importance for combating the AIDS epidemic. Here, the Classifier Guidance Diffusion model and ligand-based virtual screening strategy are combined to discover potential HIV-inhibiting molecules for the first time. We call it Diff4VS. An extra classifier is trained using the HIV molecule dataset, and the gradient of the classifier is used to guide the Diffusion to generate HIV-inhibiting molecules. Experiments show that Diff4VS can generate more candidate HIV-inhibiting molecules than other methods. Inspired by ligand-based virtual screening, a new metric DrugIndex is proposed. The DrugIndex is the ratio of the proportion of candidate drug molecules in the generated molecule to the proportion of candidate drug molecules in the training set. DrugIndex provides a new evaluation method for evolving molecular generative models from a pharmaceutical perspective. Besides, we report a new phenomenon observed when using molecule generation models for virtual screening. Compared to real molecules, the generated molecules have a lower proportion that is highly similar to known drug molecules. We call it Degradation in molecule generation. Based on the data analysis, the Degradation may result from the difficulty of generating molecules with a specific structure in the generative model. Our research contributes to the application of generative models in drug design from method, metric, and phenomenon analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siddharth Khedkar, R. Willem Vervoort, Rohitash Chandra</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, climate extremes such as floods have created significant environmental and economic hazards for Australia, causing damage to the environment and economy and losses of human and animal lives. An efficient method of forecasting floods is crucial to limit this damage. Techniques for flood prediction are currently based on hydrological, and hydrodynamic (physically-based) numerical models. Machine learning methods that include deep learning offer certain advantages over conventional physically based approaches, including flexibility and accuracy. Deep learning methods have been promising for predicting small to medium-sized climate extreme events over a short time horizon; however, large flooding events present a critical challenge. We present an ensemble-based machine learning approach that addresses large-scale extreme flooding challenges using a switching mechanism motivated by extreme-value theory for long-short-term-memory (LSTM) deep learning models. We use a multivariate and multi-step time-series prediction approach to predict streamflow for multiple days ahead in the major catchments of Australia. The ensemble framework also employs static information to enrich the time-series information, allowing for regional modelling across catchments. Our results demonstrate enhanced prediction of streamflow extremes, with notable efficacy for large flooding scenarios in the selected Australian catchments. Through comparative analysis, our methodology underscores the potential for deep learning models to revolutionise flood forecasting across diverse regions.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the intensive care unit, the capability to predict the need for mechanical ventilation (MV) facilitates more timely interventions to improve patient outcomes. Recent works have demonstrated good performance in this task utilizing machine learning models. This paper explores the novel application of a deep learning model with multi-head attention (FFNN-MHA) to make more accurate MV predictions and reduce false positives by learning personalized contextual information of individual patients. Utilizing the publicly available MIMIC-IV dataset, FFNN-MHA demonstrates an improvement of 0.0379 in AUC and a 17.8\% decrease in false positives compared to baseline models such as feed-forward neural networks. Our results highlight the potential of the FFNN-MHA model as an effective tool for accurate prediction of the need for mechanical ventilation in critical care settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luis Mandl, Somdatta Goswami, Lena Lambers, Tim Ricken</p>
<p>Abstract: The deep operator network (DeepONet) is a popular neural operator architecture that has shown promise in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by using deep neural networks to map between infinite-dimensional function spaces. In the absence of labeled datasets, we utilize the PDE residual loss to learn the physical system, an approach known as physics-informed DeepONet. This method faces significant computational challenges, primarily due to the curse of dimensionality, as the computational cost increases exponentially with finer discretization. In this paper, we introduce the Separable DeepONet framework to address these challenges and improve scalability for high-dimensional PDEs. Our approach involves a factorization technique where sub-networks handle individual one-dimensional coordinates, thereby reducing the number of forward passes and the size of the Jacobian matrix. By using forward-mode automatic differentiation, we further optimize the computational cost related to the Jacobian matrix. As a result, our modifications lead to a linear scaling of computational cost with discretization density, making Separable DeepONet suitable for high-dimensional PDEs. We validate the effectiveness of the separable architecture through three benchmark PDE models: the viscous Burgers equation, Biot's consolidation theory, and a parametrized heat equation. In all cases, our proposed framework achieves comparable or improved accuracy while significantly reducing computational time compared to conventional DeepONet. These results demonstrate the potential of Separable DeepONet in efficiently solving complex, high-dimensional PDEs, advancing the field of physics-informed machine learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanlin Tang, Yang Lin, Jing Lin, Qingsen Han, Shikuan Hong, Yiwu Yao, Gongyi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The memory and computational demands of Key-Value (KV) cache present significant challenges for deploying long-context language models. Previous approaches attempt to mitigate this issue by selectively dropping tokens, which irreversibly erases critical information that might be needed for future queries. In this paper, we propose a novel compression technique for KV cache that preserves all token information. Our investigation reveals that: i) Most attention heads primarily focus on the local context; ii) Only a few heads, denoted as retrieval heads, can essentially pay attention to all input tokens. These key observations motivate us to use separate caching strategy for attention heads. Therefore, we propose RazorAttention, a training-free KV cache compression algorithm, which maintains a full cache for these crucial retrieval heads and discards the remote tokens in non-retrieval heads. Furthermore, we introduce a novel mechanism involving a "compensation token" to further recover the information in the dropped tokens. Extensive evaluations across a diverse set of large language models (LLMs) demonstrate that RazorAttention achieves a reduction in KV cache size by over 70% without noticeable impacts on performance. Additionally, RazorAttention is compatible with FlashAttention, rendering it an efficient and plug-and-play solution that enhances LLM inference efficiency without overhead or retraining of the original model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cheng Luo, Jiawei Zhao, Zhuoming Chen, Beidi Chen, Anima Anandkumar</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Mini-Sequence Transformer (MsT), a simple and effective methodology for highly efficient and accurate LLM training with extremely long sequences. MsT partitions input sequences and iteratively processes mini-sequences to reduce intermediate memory usage. Integrated with activation recomputation, it enables significant memory savings in both forward and backward passes. In experiments with the Llama3-8B model, with MsT, we measure no degradation in throughput or convergence even with 12x longer sequences than standard implementations due to our careful memory optimizations. MsT is fully general, implementation-agnostic, and requires minimal code changes to integrate with existing LLM training frameworks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuepeng Chen, Weiping Ding, Hengrong Ju, Jiashuang Huang, Tao Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Feature selection is a vital technique in machine learning, as it can reduce computational complexity, improve model performance, and mitigate the risk of overfitting. However, the increasing complexity and dimensionality of datasets pose significant challenges in the selection of features. Focusing on these challenges, this paper proposes a cascaded two-stage feature clustering and selection algorithm for fuzzy decision systems. In the first stage, we reduce the search space by clustering relevant features and addressing inter-feature redundancy. In the second stage, a clustering-based sequentially forward selection method that explores the global and local structure of data is presented. We propose a novel metric for assessing the significance of features, which considers both global separability and local consistency. Global separability measures the degree of intra-class cohesion and inter-class separation based on fuzzy membership, providing a comprehensive understanding of data separability. Meanwhile, local consistency leverages the fuzzy neighborhood rough set model to capture uncertainty and fuzziness in the data. The effectiveness of our proposed algorithm is evaluated through experiments conducted on 18 public datasets and a real-world schizophrenia dataset. The experiment results demonstrate our algorithm's superiority over benchmarking algorithms in both classification accuracy and the number of selected features.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Letian Gong, Huaiyu Wan, Shengnan Guo, Xiucheng Li, Yan Lin, Erwen Zheng, Tianyi Wang, Zeyu Zhou, Youfang Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid growth of location-based services (LBS) has yielded massive amounts of data on human mobility. Effectively extracting meaningful representations for user-generated check-in sequences is pivotal for facilitating various downstream services. However, the user-generated check-in data are simultaneously influenced by the surrounding objective circumstances and the user's subjective intention. Specifically, the temporal uncertainty and spatial diversity exhibited in check-in data make it difficult to capture the macroscopic spatial-temporal patterns of users and to understand the semantics of user mobility activities. Furthermore, the distinct characteristics of the temporal and spatial information in check-in sequences call for an effective fusion method to incorporate these two types of information. In this paper, we propose a novel Spatial-Temporal Cross-view Contrastive Representation (STCCR) framework for check-in sequence representation learning. Specifically, STCCR addresses the above challenges by employing self-supervision from "spatial topic" and "temporal intention" views, facilitating effective fusion of spatial and temporal information at the semantic level. Besides, STCCR leverages contrastive clustering to uncover users' shared spatial topics from diverse mobility activities, while employing angular momentum contrast to mitigate the impact of temporal uncertainty and noise. We extensively evaluate STCCR on three real-world datasets and demonstrate its superior performance across three downstream tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jakob Benjamin Wessel, Christopher A. T. Ferro, Gavin R. Evans, Frank Kwasniok</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate forecasts of extreme wind speeds are of high importance for many applications. Such forecasts are usually generated by ensembles of numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, which however can be biased and have errors in dispersion, thus necessitating the application of statistical post-processing techniques. In this work we aim to improve statistical post-processing models for probabilistic predictions of extreme wind speeds. We do this by adjusting the training procedure used to fit ensemble model output statistics (EMOS) models - a commonly applied post-processing technique - and propose estimating parameters using the so-called threshold-weighted continuous ranked probability score (twCRPS), a proper scoring rule that places special emphasis on predictions over a threshold. We show that training using the twCRPS leads to improved extreme event performance of post-processing models for a variety of thresholds. We find a distribution body-tail trade-off where improved performance for probabilistic predictions of extreme events comes with worse performance for predictions of the distribution body. However, we introduce strategies to mitigate this trade-off based on weighted training and linear pooling. Finally, we consider some synthetic experiments to explain the training impact of the twCRPS and derive closed-form expressions of the twCRPS for a number of distributions, giving the first such collection in the literature. The results will enable researchers and practitioners alike to improve the performance of probabilistic forecasting models for extremes and other events of interest.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mehshan Ahmed Khan, Houshyar Asadi, Mohammad Reza Chalak Qazani, Adetokunbo Arogbonlo, Siamak Pedrammehr, Adnan Anwar, Asim Bhatti, Saeid Nahavandi, Chee Peng Lim</p>
<p>Abstract: Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is employed as a non-invasive method to monitor functional brain activation by capturing changes in the concentrations of oxygenated haemoglobin (HbO) and deoxygenated haemo-globin (HbR). Various machine learning classification techniques have been utilized to distinguish cognitive states. However, conventional machine learning methods, although simpler to implement, undergo a complex pre-processing phase before network training and demonstrate reduced accuracy due to inadequate data preprocessing. Additionally, previous research in cog-nitive load assessment using fNIRS has predominantly focused on differ-sizeentiating between two levels of mental workload. These studies mainly aim to classify low and high levels of cognitive load or distinguish between easy and difficult tasks. To address these limitations associated with conven-tional methods, this paper conducts a comprehensive exploration of the im-pact of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers on the effectiveness of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) within deep learning models. This is to address the issues related to spatial features overfitting and lack of tem-poral dependencies in CNN in the previous studies. By integrating LSTM layers, the model can capture temporal dependencies in the fNIRS data, al-lowing for a more comprehensive understanding of cognitive states. The primary objective is to assess how incorporating LSTM layers enhances the performance of CNNs. The experimental results presented in this paper demonstrate that the integration of LSTM layers with Convolutional layers results in an increase in the accuracy of deep learning models from 97.40% to 97.92%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aayush Saxena, Arit Kumar Bishwas, Ayush Ashok Mishra, Ryan Armstrong</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved tremendous success in most of the industries in recent years. The evolution of these models has also led to an increase in the model size and energy requirement, making it difficult to deploy in production on low compute devices. An increase in the number of connected devices around the world warrants compressed models that can be easily deployed at the local devices with low compute capacity and power accessibility. A wide range of solutions have been proposed by different researchers to reduce the size and complexity of such models, prominent among them are, Weight Quantization, Parameter Pruning, Network Pruning, low-rank representation, weights sharing, neural architecture search, knowledge distillation etc. In this research work, we investigate the performance impacts on various trained deep learning models, compressed using quantization and pruning techniques. We implemented both, quantization and pruning, compression techniques on popular deep learning models used in the image classification, object detection, language models and generative models-based problem statements. We also explored performance of various large language models (LLMs) after quantization and low rank adaptation. We used the standard evaluation metrics (model's size, accuracy, and inference time) for all the related problem statements and concluded this paper by discussing the challenges and future work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> B. Kaan Karamete, Eli Glaser</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper discusses how to generate general graph node embeddings from knowledge graph representations. The embedded space is composed of a number of sub-features to mimic both local affinity and remote structural relevance. These sub-feature dimensions are defined by several indicators that we speculate to catch nodal similarities, such as hop-based topological patterns, the number of overlapping labels, the transitional probabilities (markov-chain probabilities), and the cluster indices computed by our recursive spectral bisection (RSB) algorithm. These measures are flattened over the one dimensional vector space into their respective sub-component ranges such that the entire set of vector similarity functions could be used for finding similar nodes. The error is defined by the sum of pairwise square differences across a randomly selected sample of graph nodes between the assumed embeddings and the ground truth estimates as our novel loss function. The ground truth is estimated to be a combination of pairwise Jaccard similarity and the number of overlapping labels. Finally, we demonstrate a multi-variate stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm to compute the weighing factors among sub-vector spaces to minimize the average error using a random sampling logic.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pierre-Daniel Arsenault, Shengrui Wang, Jean-Marc Patenande</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) models have reached a very significant level of accuracy. While their superior performance offers considerable benefits, their inherent complexity often decreases human trust, which slows their application in high-risk decision-making domains, such as finance. The field of eXplainable AI (XAI) seeks to bridge this gap, aiming to make AI models more understandable. This survey, focusing on published work from the past five years, categorizes XAI approaches that predict financial time series. In this paper, explainability and interpretability are distinguished, emphasizing the need to treat these concepts separately as they are not applied the same way in practice. Through clear definitions, a rigorous taxonomy of XAI approaches, a complementary characterization, and examples of XAI's application in the finance industry, this paper provides a comprehensive view of XAI's current role in finance. It can also serve as a guide for selecting the most appropriate XAI approach for future applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anjali Sureshkumar Nair, Dr. Prashant Nitnaware</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, the clandestine nature of darknet activities has presented an escalating challenge to cybersecurity efforts, necessitating sophisticated methods for the detection and classification of network traffic associated with these covert operations. The system addresses the significant challenge of class imbalance within Darknet traffic datasets, where malicious traffic constitutes a minority, hindering effective discrimination between normal and malicious behavior. By leveraging boosting algorithms like AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting coupled with decision trees, this study proposes a robust solution for network traffic classification. Boosting algorithms ensemble learning corrects errors iteratively and assigns higher weights to minority class instances, complemented by the hierarchical structure of decision trees. The additional Feature Selection which is a preprocessing method by utilizing Information Gain metrics, Fisher's Score, and Chi-Square test selection for features is employed. Rigorous experimentation with diverse Darknet traffic datasets validates the efficacy of the proposed multistage classifier, evaluated through various performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, offering a comprehensive solution for accurate detection and classification of Darknet activities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ikhtiyor Nematov, Dimitris Sacharidis, Tomer Sagi, Katja Hose</p>
<p>Abstract: For many use-cases, it is often important to explain the prediction of a black-box model by identifying the most influential training data samples. Existing approaches lack customization for user intent and often provide a homogeneous set of explanation samples, failing to reveal the model's reasoning from different angles.
  In this paper, we propose AIDE, an approach for providing antithetical (i.e., contrastive), intent-based, diverse explanations for opaque and complex models. AIDE distinguishes three types of explainability intents: interpreting a correct, investigating a wrong, and clarifying an ambiguous prediction. For each intent, AIDE selects an appropriate set of influential training samples that support or oppose the prediction either directly or by contrast. To provide a succinct summary, AIDE uses diversity-aware sampling to avoid redundancy and increase coverage of the training data.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of AIDE on image and text classification tasks, in three ways: quantitatively, assessing correctness and continuity; qualitatively, comparing anecdotal evidence from AIDE and other example-based approaches; and via a user study, evaluating multiple aspects of AIDE. The results show that AIDE addresses the limitations of existing methods and exhibits desirable traits for an explainability method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gift Modekwe, Saif Al-Wahaibi, Qiugang Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Lithium-ion batteries are pivotal to technological advancements in transportation, electronics, and clean energy storage. The optimal operation and safety of these batteries require proper and reliable estimation of battery capacities to monitor the state of health. Current methods for estimating the capacities fail to adequately account for long-term temporal dependencies of key variables (e.g., voltage, current, and temperature) associated with battery aging and degradation. In this study, we explore the usage of transformer networks to enhance the estimation of battery capacity. We develop a transformer-based battery capacity prediction model that accounts for both long-term and short-term patterns in battery data. Further, to tackle the data scarcity issue, data augmentation is used to increase the data size, which helps to improve the performance of the model. Our proposed method is validated with benchmark datasets. Simulation results show the effectiveness of data augmentation and the transformer network in improving the accuracy and robustness of battery capacity prediction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kuluhan Binici, Weiming Wu, Tulika Mitra</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a model compression method that entails training a compact student model to emulate the performance of a more complex teacher model. However, the architectural capacity gap between the two models limits the effectiveness of knowledge transfer. Addressing this issue, previous works focused on customizing teacher-student pairs to improve compatibility, a computationally expensive process that needs to be repeated every time either model changes. Hence, these methods are impractical when a teacher model has to be compressed into different student models for deployment on multiple hardware devices with distinct resource constraints. In this work, we propose Generic Teacher Network (GTN), a one-off KD-aware training to create a generic teacher capable of effectively transferring knowledge to any student model sampled from a given finite pool of architectures. To this end, we represent the student pool as a weight-sharing supernet and condition our generic teacher to align with the capacities of various student architectures sampled from this supernet. Experimental evaluation shows that our method both improves overall KD effectiveness and amortizes the minimal additional training cost of the generic teacher across students in the pool.</p>

<p>Abstract: Time series classification stands as a pivotal and intricate challenge across various domains, including finance, healthcare, and industrial systems. In contemporary research, there has been a notable upsurge in exploring feature extraction through random sampling. Unlike deep convolutional networks, these methods sidestep elaborate training procedures, yet they often necessitate generating a surplus of features to comprehensively encapsulate time series nuances. Consequently, some features may lack relevance to labels or exhibit multi-collinearity with others. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical feature selection method aided by ANOVA variance analysis to address this challenge. Through meticulous experimentation, we demonstrate that our method substantially reduces features by over 94% while preserving accuracy -- a significant advancement in the field of time series analysis and feature selection.</p>

<p>Abstract: Are score function estimators an underestimated approach to learning with $k$-subset sampling? Sampling $k$-subsets is a fundamental operation in many machine learning tasks that is not amenable to differentiable parametrization, impeding gradient-based optimization. Prior work has focused on relaxed sampling or pathwise gradient estimators. Inspired by the success of score function estimators in variational inference and reinforcement learning, we revisit them within the context of $k$-subset sampling. Specifically, we demonstrate how to efficiently compute the $k$-subset distribution's score function using a discrete Fourier transform, and reduce the estimator's variance with control variates. The resulting estimator provides both exact samples and unbiased gradient estimates while also applying to non-differentiable downstream models, unlike existing methods. Experiments in feature selection show results competitive with current methods, despite weaker assumptions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jia Shi, Gautam Gare, Jinjin Tian, Siqi Chai, Zhiqiu Lin, Arun Vasudevan, Di Feng, Francesco Ferroni, Shu Kong</p>
<p>Abstract: We tackle the challenge of predicting models' Out-of-Distribution (OOD) performance using in-distribution (ID) measurements without requiring OOD data. Existing evaluations with "Effective Robustness", which use ID accuracy as an indicator of OOD accuracy, encounter limitations when models are trained with diverse supervision and distributions, such as class labels (Vision Models, VMs, on ImageNet) and textual descriptions (Visual-Language Models, VLMs, on LAION). VLMs often generalize better to OOD data than VMs despite having similar or lower ID performance. To improve the prediction of models' OOD performance from ID measurements, we introduce the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)-on-the-Line framework. This approach revisits the established concept of LCA distance, which measures the hierarchical distance between labels and predictions within a predefined class hierarchy, such as WordNet. We assess 75 models using ImageNet as the ID dataset and five significantly shifted OOD variants, uncovering a strong linear correlation between ID LCA distance and OOD top-1 accuracy. Our method provides a compelling alternative for understanding why VLMs tend to generalize better. Additionally, we propose a technique to construct a taxonomic hierarchy on any dataset using K-means clustering, demonstrating that LCA distance is robust to the constructed taxonomic hierarchy. Moreover, we demonstrate that aligning model predictions with class taxonomies, through soft labels or prompt engineering, can enhance model generalization.

<p>Abstract: Spectroscopy is a powerful analytical technique for characterizing matter across physical and biological realms1-5. However, its fundamental principle necessitates specialized instrumentation per physical phenomena probed, limiting broad adoption and use in all relevant research. In this study, we introduce SpectroGen, a novel physical prior-informed deep generative model for generating relevant spectral signatures across modalities using experimentally collected spectral input only from a single modality. We achieve this by reimagining the representation of spectral data as mathematical constructs of distributions instead of their traditional physical and molecular state representations. The results from 319 standard mineral samples tested demonstrate generating with 99% correlation and 0.01 root mean square error with superior resolution than experimentally acquired ground truth spectra. We showed transferring capability across Raman, Infrared, and X-ray Diffraction modalities with Gaussian, Lorentzian, and Voigt distribution priors respectively6-10. This approach however is globally generalizable for any spectral input that can be represented by a distribution prior, making it universally applicable. We believe our work revolutionizes the application sphere of spectroscopy, which has traditionally been limited by access to the required sophisticated and often expensive equipment towards accelerating material, pharmaceutical, and biological discoveries.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhao Li, Yang Liu, Chuan Zhou, Xuanwu Liu, Xuming Pan, Buqing Cao, Xindong Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: The concept of the sharing economy has gained broad recognition, and within this context, Sharing E-Bike Battery (SEB) have emerged as a focal point of societal interest. Despite the popularity, a notable discrepancy remains between user expectations regarding the remaining battery range of SEBs and the reality, leading to a pronounced inclination among users to find an available SEB during emergency situations. In response to this challenge, the integration of Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) and battery-swap services has surfaced as a viable solution. In this paper, we propose a novel structural Transformer-based model, referred to as the SEB-Transformer, designed specifically for predicting the battery range of SEBs. The scenario is conceptualized as a dynamic heterogeneous graph that encapsulates the interactions between users and bicycles, providing a comprehensive framework for analysis. Furthermore, we incorporate the graph structure into the SEB-Transformer to facilitate the estimation of the remaining e-bike battery range, in conjunction with mean structural similarity, enhancing the prediction accuracy. By employing the predictions made by our model, we are able to dynamically adjust the optimal cycling routes for users in real-time, while also considering the strategic locations of charging stations, thereby optimizing the user experience. Empirically our results on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model against nine competitive baselines. These innovations, powered by AIoT, not only bridge the gap between user expectations and the physical limitations of battery range but also significantly improve the operational efficiency and sustainability of SEB services. Through these advancements, the shared electric bicycle ecosystem is evolving, making strides towards a more reliable, user-friendly, and sustainable mode of transportation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenxing Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid development of location based services, multimodal spatio-temporal (ST) data including trajectories, transportation modes, traffic flow and social check-ins are being collected for deep learning based methods. These deep learning based methods learn ST correlations to support the downstream tasks in the fields such as smart mobility, smart city and other intelligent transportation systems. Despite their effectiveness, ST data fusion and forecasting methods face practical challenges in real-world scenarios. First, forecasting performance for ST data-insufficient area is inferior, making it necessary to transfer meta knowledge from heterogeneous area to enhance the sparse representations. Second, it is nontrivial to accurately forecast in multi-transportation-mode scenarios due to the fine-grained ST features of similar transportation modes, making it necessary to distinguish and measure the ST correlations to alleviate the influence caused by entangled ST features. At last, partial data modalities (e.g., transportation mode) are lost due to privacy or technical issues in certain scenarios, making it necessary to effectively fuse the multimodal sparse ST features and enrich the ST representations. To tackle these challenges, our research work aim to develop effective fusion and forecasting methods for multimodal ST data in smart mobility scenario. In this paper, we will introduce our recent works that investigates the challenges in terms of various real-world applications and establish the open challenges in this field for future work.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion Transformer, the backbone of Sora for video generation, successfully scales the capacity of diffusion models, pioneering new avenues for high-fidelity sequential data generation. Unlike static data such as images, sequential data consists of consecutive data frames indexed by time, exhibiting rich spatial and temporal dependencies. These dependencies represent the underlying dynamic model and are critical to validate the generated data. In this paper, we make the first theoretical step towards bridging diffusion transformers for capturing spatial-temporal dependencies. Specifically, we establish score approximation and distribution estimation guarantees of diffusion transformers for learning Gaussian process data with covariance functions of various decay patterns. We highlight how the spatial-temporal dependencies are captured and affect learning efficiency. Our study proposes a novel transformer approximation theory, where the transformer acts to unroll an algorithm. We support our theoretical results by numerical experiments, providing strong evidence that spatial-temporal dependencies are captured within attention layers, aligning with our approximation theory.</p>

<p>Abstract: In traditional Federated Learning approaches like FedAvg, the global model underperforms when faced with data heterogeneity. Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) enables clients to train personalized models to fit their local data distribution better. However, we surprisingly find that the feature extractor in FedAvg is superior to those in most PFL methods. More interestingly, by applying a linear transformation on local features extracted by the feature extractor to align with the classifier, FedAvg can surpass the majority of PFL methods. This suggests that the primary cause of FedAvg's inadequate performance stems from the mismatch between the locally extracted features and the classifier. While current PFL methods mitigate this issue to some extent, their designs compromise the quality of the feature extractor, thus limiting the full potential of PFL. In this paper, we propose a new PFL framework called FedPFT to address the mismatch problem while enhancing the quality of the feature extractor. FedPFT integrates a feature transformation module, driven by personalized prompts, between the global feature extractor and classifier. In each round, clients first train prompts to transform local features to match the global classifier, followed by training model parameters. This approach can also align the training objectives of clients, reducing the impact of data heterogeneity on model collaboration. Moreover, FedPFT's feature transformation module is highly scalable, allowing for the use of different prompts to tailor local features to various tasks. Leveraging this, we introduce a collaborative contrastive learning task to further refine feature extractor quality. Our experiments demonstrate that FedPFT outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 7.08%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Renming Huang, Yunqiang Pei, Guoqing Wang, Yangming Zhang, Yang Yang, Peng Wang, Hengtao Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have shown strong competitiveness in offline reinforcement learning tasks by formulating decision-making as sequential generation. However, the practicality of these methods is limited due to the lengthy inference processes they require. In this paper, we address this problem by decomposing the sampling process of diffusion models into two decoupled subprocesses: 1) generating a feasible trajectory, which is a time-consuming process, and 2) optimizing the trajectory. With this decomposition approach, we are able to partially separate efficiency and quality factors, enabling us to simultaneously gain efficiency advantages and ensure quality assurance. We propose the Trajectory Diffuser, which utilizes a faster autoregressive model to handle the generation of feasible trajectories while retaining the trajectory optimization process of diffusion models. This allows us to achieve more efficient planning without sacrificing capability. To evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the Trajectory Diffuser, we conduct experiments on the D4RL benchmarks. The results demonstrate that our method achieves $\it 3$-$\it 10 \times$ faster inference speed compared to previous sequence modeling methods, while also outperforming them in terms of overall performance. https://github.com/RenMing-Huang/TrajectoryDiffuser

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dipika Khullar, Emmett Goodman, Negin Sokhandan</p>
<p>Abstract: Through a simple multiple choice language prompt a VQA model can operate as a zero-shot image classifier, producing a classification label. Compared to typical image encoders, VQA models offer an advantage: VQA-produced image embeddings can be infused with the most relevant visual information through tailored language prompts. Nevertheless, for most tasks, zero-shot VQA performance is lacking, either because of unfamiliar category names, or dissimilar pre-training data and test data distributions. We propose a simple method to boost VQA performance for image classification using only a handful of labeled examples and a multiple-choice question. This few-shot method is training-free and maintains the dynamic and flexible advantages of the VQA model. Rather than relying on the final language output, our approach uses multiple-choice questions to extract prompt-specific latent representations, which are enriched with relevant visual information. These representations are combined to create a final overall image embedding, which is decoded via reference to latent class prototypes constructed from the few labeled examples. We demonstrate this method outperforms both pure visual encoders and zero-shot VQA baselines to achieve impressive performance on common few-shot tasks including MiniImageNet, Caltech-UCSD Birds, and CIFAR-100. Finally, we show our approach does particularly well in settings with numerous diverse visual attributes such as the fabric, article-style, texture, and view of different articles of clothing, where other few-shot approaches struggle, as we can tailor our image representations only on the semantic features of interest.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenjun Gu, Yihao Zhong, Shizun Li, Changsong Wei, Liting Dong, Zhuoyue Wang, Chao Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: The stock market's ascent typically mirrors the flourishing state of the economy, whereas its decline is often an indicator of an economic downturn. Therefore, for a long time, significant correlation elements for predicting trends in financial stock markets have been widely discussed, and people are becoming increasingly interested in the task of financial text mining. The inherent instability of stock prices makes them acutely responsive to fluctuations within the financial markets. In this article, we use deep learning networks, based on the history of stock prices and articles of financial, business, technical news that introduce market information to predict stock prices. We illustrate the enhancement of predictive precision by integrating weighted news categories into the forecasting model. We developed a pre-trained NLP model known as FinBERT, designed to discern the sentiments within financial texts. Subsequently, we advanced this model by incorporating the sophisticated Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) architecture, thus constructing the innovative FinBERT-LSTM model. This model utilizes news categories related to the stock market structure hierarchy, namely market, industry, and stock related news categories, combined with the stock market's stock price situation in the previous week for prediction. We selected NASDAQ-100 index stock data and trained the model on Benzinga news articles, and utilized Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and Accuracy as the key metrics for the assessment and comparative analysis of the model's performance. The results indicate that FinBERT-LSTM performs the best, followed by LSTM, and DNN model ranks third in terms of effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Noah Amsel, Gilad Yehudai, Joan Bruna</p>
<p>Abstract: Attention-based mechanisms are widely used in machine learning, most prominently in transformers. However, hyperparameters such as the rank of the attention matrices and the number of heads are scaled nearly the same way in all realizations of this architecture, without theoretical justification. In this work we show that there are dramatic trade-offs between the rank and number of heads of the attention mechanism. Specifically, we present a simple and natural target function that can be represented using a single full-rank attention head for any context length, but that cannot be approximated by low-rank attention unless the number of heads is exponential in the embedding dimension, even for short context lengths. Moreover, we prove that, for short context lengths, adding depth allows the target to be approximated by low-rank attention. For long contexts, we conjecture that full-rank attention is necessary. Finally, we present experiments with off-the-shelf transformers that validate our theoretical findings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zizhuo Meng, Boyu Li, Xuhui Fan, Zhidong Li, Yang Wang, Fang Chen, Feng Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: The classical temporal point process (TPP) constructs an intensity function by taking the occurrence times into account. Nevertheless, occurrence time may not be the only relevant factor, other contextual data, termed covariates, may also impact the event evolution. Incorporating such covariates into the model is beneficial, while distinguishing their relevance to the event dynamics is of great practical significance. In this work, we propose a Transformer-based covariate temporal point process (TransFeat-TPP) model to improve the interpretability of deep covariate-TPPs while maintaining powerful expressiveness. TransFeat-TPP can effectively model complex relationships between events and covariates, and provide enhanced interpretability by discerning the importance of various covariates. Experimental results on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate improved prediction accuracy and consistently interpretable feature importance when compared to existing deep covariate-TPPs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingli Fang, Jung-Eun Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: The privacy-preserving approaches to machine learning (ML) models have made substantial progress in recent years. However, it is still opaque in which circumstances and conditions the model becomes privacy-vulnerable, leading to a challenge for ML models to maintain both performance and privacy. In this paper, we first explore the disparity between member and non-member data in the representation of models under common training frameworks. We identify how the representation magnitude disparity correlates with privacy vulnerability and address how this correlation impacts privacy vulnerability. Based on the observations, we propose Saturn Ring Classifier Module (SRCM), a plug-in model-level solution to mitigate membership privacy leakage. Through a confined yet effective representation space, our approach ameliorates models' privacy vulnerability while maintaining generalizability.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hiroyuki Tokunaga, Joel Nicholls, Daria Vazhenina, Atsunori Kanemura</p>
<p>Abstract: By quantizing network weights and activations to low bitwidth, we can obtain hardware-friendly and energy-efficient networks. However, existing quantization techniques utilizing the straight-through estimator and piecewise constant functions face the issue of how to represent originally high-bit input data with low-bit values. To fully quantize deep neural networks, we propose pixel embedding, which replaces each float-valued input pixel with a vector of quantized values by using a lookup table. The lookup table or low-bit representation of pixels is differentiable and trainable by backpropagation. Such replacement of inputs with vectors is similar to word embedding in the natural language processing field. Experiments on ImageNet and CIFAR-100 show that pixel embedding reduces the top-5 error gap caused by quantizing the floating points at the first layer to only 1% for the ImageNet dataset, and the top-1 error gap caused by quantizing first and last layers to slightly over 1% for the CIFAR-100 dataset. The usefulness of pixel embedding is further demonstrated by inference time measurements, which demonstrate over 1.7 times speedup compared to floating point precision first layer.</p>

Path methods are one such class of attribution methods susceptible to adversarial attacks. Adversarial learning is typically phrased as a constrained optimisation problem.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmet Zahid Balc{\i}o\u{g}lu, Emil Carlsson, Fredrik D. Johansson</p>
<p>Abstract: Bandit algorithms hold great promise for improving personalized decision-making but are notoriously sample-hungry. In most health applications, it is infeasible to fit a new bandit for each patient, and observable variables are often insufficient to determine optimal treatments, ruling out applying contextual bandits learned from multiple patients. Latent bandits offer both rapid exploration and personalization beyond what context variables can reveal but require that a latent variable model can be learned consistently. In this work, we propose bandit algorithms based on nonlinear independent component analysis that can be provably identified from observational data to a degree sufficient to infer the optimal action in a new bandit instance consistently. We verify this strategy in simulated data, showing substantial improvement over learning independent multi-armed bandits for every instance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinyang Sun, Xi Chen, Xiumei Wang, Dandan Zhu, Xingping Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Non-Abelian braiding has attracted substantial attention because of its pivotal role in describing the exchange behaviour of anyons, in which the input and outcome of non-Abelian braiding are connected by a unitary matrix. Implementing braiding in a classical system can assist the experimental investigation of non-Abelian physics. However, the design of non-Abelian gauge fields faces numerous challenges stemmed from the intricate interplay of group structures, Lie algebra properties, representation theory, topology, and symmetry breaking. The extreme diversity makes it a powerful tool for the study of condensed matter physics. Whereas the widely used artificial intelligence with data-driven approaches has greatly promoted the development of physics, most works are limited on the data-to-data design. Here we propose a self-reasoning assistant learning framework capable of directly generating non-Abelian gauge fields. This framework utilizes the forward diffusion process to capture and reproduce the complex patterns and details inherent in the target distribution through continuous transformation. Then the reverse diffusion process is used to make the generated data closer to the distribution of the original situation. Thus, it owns strong self-reasoning capabilities, allowing to automatically discover the feature representation and capture more subtle relationships from the dataset. Moreover, the self-reasoning eliminates the need for manual feature engineering and simplifies the process of model building. Our framework offers a disruptive paradigm shift to parse complex physical processes, automatically uncovering patterns from massive datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shoaib Ahmed Siddiqui, Xin Dong, Greg Heinrich, Thomas Breuel, Jan Kautz, David Krueger, Pavlo Molchanov</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are not only resource-intensive to train but even more costly to deploy in production. Therefore, recent work has attempted to prune blocks of LLMs based on cheap proxies for estimating block importance, effectively removing 10% of blocks in well-trained LLaMa-2 and Mistral 7b models without any significant degradation of downstream metrics. In this paper, we explore different block importance metrics by considering adaptive metrics such as Shapley value in addition to static ones explored in prior work. We show that adaptive metrics exhibit a trade-off in performance between tasks i.e., improvement on one task may degrade performance on the other due to differences in the computed block influences. Furthermore, we extend this analysis from a complete block to individual self-attention and feed-forward layers, highlighting the propensity of the self-attention layers to be more amendable to pruning, even allowing removal of upto 33% of the self-attention layers without incurring any performance degradation on MMLU for Mistral 7b (significant reduction in costly maintenance of KV-cache). Finally, we look at simple performance recovery techniques to emulate the pruned layers by training lightweight additive bias or low-rank linear adapters. Performance recovery using emulated updates avoids performance degradation for the initial blocks (up to 5% absolute improvement on MMLU), which is either competitive or superior to the learning-based technique.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Zhou, Kun Sun, Shaoming Li, Yangfeng Fan, Guibin Jiang, Jiaqi Zheng, Tao Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Online controlled experiments play a crucial role in enabling data-driven decisions across a wide range of companies. Variance reduction is an effective technique to improve the sensitivity of experiments, achieving higher statistical power while using fewer samples and shorter experimental periods. However, typical variance reduction methods (e.g., regression-adjusted estimators) are built upon the intuitional assumption of Gaussian distributions and cannot properly characterize the real business metrics with heavy-tailed distributions. Furthermore, outliers diminish the correlation between pre-experiment covariates and outcome metrics, greatly limiting the effectiveness of variance reduction.
  In this paper, we develop a novel framework that integrates the Student's t-distribution with machine learning tools to fit heavy-tailed metrics and construct a robust average treatment effect estimator in online controlled experiments, which we call STATE. By adopting a variational EM method to optimize the loglikehood function, we can infer a robust solution that greatly eliminates the negative impact of outliers and achieves significant variance reduction. Moreover, we extend the STATE method from count metrics to ratio metrics by utilizing linear transformation that preserves unbiased estimation, whose variance reduction is more complex but less investigated in existing works. Finally, both simulations on synthetic data and long-term empirical results on Meituan experiment platform demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Compared with the state-of-the-art estimators (CUPAC/MLRATE), STATE achieves over 50% variance reduction, indicating it can reach the same statistical power with only half of the observations, or half the experimental duration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matteo Russo, Andrea Celli, Riccardo Colini Baldeschi, Federico Fusco, Daniel Haimovich, Dima Karamshuk, Stefano Leonardi, Niek Tax</p>
<p>Abstract: In online learning, a decision maker repeatedly selects one of a set of actions, with the goal of minimizing the overall loss incurred. Following the recent line of research on algorithms endowed with additional predictive features, we revisit this problem by allowing the decision maker to acquire additional information on the actions to be selected. In particular, we study the power of \emph{best-action queries}, which reveal beforehand the identity of the best action at a given time step. In practice, predictive features may be expensive, so we allow the decision maker to issue at most $k$ such queries. We establish tight bounds on the performance any algorithm can achieve when given access to $k$ best-action queries for different types of feedback models. In particular, we prove that in the full feedback model, $k$ queries are enough to achieve an optimal regret of $\Theta\left(\min\left\{\sqrt T, \frac Tk\right\}\right)$. This finding highlights the significant multiplicative advantage in the regret rate achievable with even a modest (sublinear) number $k \in \Omega(\sqrt{T})$ of queries. Additionally, we study the challenging setting in which the only available feedback is obtained during the time steps corresponding to the $k$ best-action queries. There, we provide a tight regret rate of $\Theta\left(\min\left\{\frac{T}{\sqrt k},\frac{T^2}{k^2}\right\}\right)$, which improves over the standard $\Theta\left(\frac{T}{\sqrt k}\right)$ regret rate for label efficient prediction for $k \in \Omega(T^{2/3})$.</p>

<p>Abstract: Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is a quality management method that aims to systematically investigate and identify the cause-and-effect relationships of problems and their underlying causes. Traditional methods are based on the analysis of problems by subject matter experts. In modern production processes, large amounts of data are collected. For this reason, increasingly computer-aided and data-driven methods are used for RCA. One of these methods are Causal Discovery Algorithms (CDA). This publication demonstrates the application of CDA on data from the assembly of a leading automotive manufacturer. The algorithms used learn the causal structure between the characteristics of the manufactured vehicles, the ergonomics and the temporal scope of the involved assembly processes, and quality-relevant product features based on representative data. This publication compares various CDAs in terms of their suitability in the context of quality management. For this purpose, the causal structures learned by the algorithms as well as their runtime are compared. This publication provides a contribution to quality management and demonstrates how CDAs can be used for RCA in assembly processes.</p>

<p>Abstract: Statistical heterogeneity is a root cause of tension among accuracy, fairness, and robustness of federated learning (FL), and is key in paving a path forward. Personalized FL (PFL) is an approach that aims to reduce the impact of statistical heterogeneity by developing personalized models for individual users, while also inherently providing benefits in terms of fairness and robustness. However, existing PFL frameworks focus on improving the performance of personalized models while neglecting the global model. Moreover, these frameworks achieve sublinear convergence rates and rely on strong assumptions. In this paper, we propose FLAME, an optimization framework by utilizing the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to train personalized and global models. We propose a model selection strategy to improve performance in situations where clients have different types of heterogeneous data. Our theoretical analysis establishes the global convergence and two kinds of convergence rates for FLAME under mild assumptions. We theoretically demonstrate that FLAME is more robust and fair than the state-of-the-art methods on a class of linear problems. Our experimental findings show that FLAME outperforms state-of-the-art methods in convergence and accuracy, and it achieves higher test accuracy under various attacks and performs more uniformly across clients.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> A. O. M. Kilicsoy, J. Liedmann, M. A. Valdebenito, F. -J. Barthold, M. G. R. Faes</p>
<p>Abstract: Areas of computational mechanics such as uncertainty quantification and optimization usually involve repeated evaluation of numerical models that represent the behavior of engineering systems. In the case of complex nonlinear systems however, these models tend to be expensive to evaluate, making surrogate models quite valuable. Artificial neural networks approximate systems very well by taking advantage of the inherent information of its given training data. In this context, this paper investigates the improvement of the training process by including sensitivity information, which are partial derivatives w.r.t. inputs, as outlined by Sobolev training. In computational mechanics, sensitivities can be applied to neural networks by expanding the training loss function with additional loss terms, thereby improving training convergence resulting in lower generalisation error. This improvement is shown in two examples of linear and non-linear material behavior. More specifically, the Sobolev designed loss function is expanded with residual weights adjusting the effect of each loss on the training step. Residual weighting is the given scaling to the different training data, which in this case are response and sensitivities. These residual weights are optimized by an adaptive scheme, whereby varying objective functions are explored, with some showing improvements in accuracy and precision of the general training convergence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daria Pugacheva, Andrei Ermakov, Igor Lyskov, Ilya Makarov, Yuriy Zotov</p>
<p>Abstract: Combinatorial optimization (CO) problems are crucial in various scientific and industrial applications. Recently, researchers have proposed using unsupervised Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to address NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems, which can be reformulated as Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems. GNNs have demonstrated high performance with nearly linear scalability and significantly outperformed classic heuristic-based algorithms in terms of computational efficiency on large-scale problems. However, when utilizing standard node features, GNNs tend to get trapped to suboptimal local minima of the energy landscape, resulting in low quality solutions. We introduce a novel algorithm, denoted hereafter as QRF-GNN, leveraging the power of GNNs to efficiently solve CO problems with QUBO formulation. It relies on unsupervised learning by minimizing the loss function derived from QUBO relaxation. The proposed key components of the architecture include the recurrent use of intermediate GNN predictions, parallel convolutional layers and combination of static node features as input. Altogether, it helps to adapt the intermediate solution candidate to minimize QUBO-based loss function, taking into account not only static graph features, but also intermediate predictions treated as dynamic, i.e. iteratively changing recurrent features. The performance of the proposed algorithm has been evaluated on the canonical benchmark datasets for maximum cut, graph coloring and maximum independent set problems. Results of experiments show that QRF-GNN drastically surpasses existing learning-based approaches and is comparable to the state-of-the-art conventional heuristics, improving their scalability on large instances.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Davide Napolitano, Luca Cagliero</p>
<p>Abstract: Shapley Values are concepts established for eXplainable AI. They are used to explain black-box predictive models by quantifying the features' contributions to the model's outcomes. Since computing the exact Shapley Values is known to be computationally intractable on real-world datasets, neural estimators have emerged as alternative, more scalable approaches to get approximated Shapley Values estimates. However, experiments with neural estimators are currently hard to replicate as algorithm implementations, explainer evaluators, and results visualizations are neither standardized nor promptly usable. To bridge this gap, we present BONES, a new benchmark focused on neural estimation of Shapley Value. It provides researchers with a suite of state-of-the-art neural and traditional estimators, a set of commonly used benchmark datasets, ad hoc modules for training black-box models, as well as specific functions to easily compute the most popular evaluation metrics and visualize results. The purpose is to simplify XAI model usage, evaluation, and comparison. In this paper, we showcase BONES results and visualizations for XAI model benchmarking on both tabular and image data.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16485">Learning General Continuous Constraint from Demonstrations via Positive-Unlabeled Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Baiyu Peng, Aude Billard</p>
<p>Abstract: Planning for a wide range of real-world tasks necessitates to know and write all constraints. However, instances exist where these constraints are either unknown or challenging to specify accurately. A possible solution is to infer the unknown constraints from expert demonstration. The majority of prior works limit themselves to learning simple linear constraints, or require strong knowledge of the true constraint parameterization or environmental model. To mitigate these problems, this paper presents a positive-unlabeled (PU) learning approach to infer a continuous, arbitrary and possibly nonlinear, constraint from demonstration. From a PU learning view, We treat all data in demonstrations as positive (feasible) data, and learn a (sub)-optimal policy to generate high-reward-winning but potentially infeasible trajectories, which serve as unlabeled data containing both feasible and infeasible states. Under an assumption on data distribution, a feasible-infeasible classifier (i.e., constraint model) is learned from the two datasets through a postprocessing PU learning technique. The entire method employs an iterative framework alternating between updating the policy, which generates and selects higher-reward policies, and updating the constraint model. Additionally, a memory buffer is introduced to record and reuse samples from previous iterations to prevent forgetting. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated in two Mujoco environments, successfully inferring continuous nonlinear constraints and outperforming a baseline method in terms of constraint accuracy and policy safety.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cristiana Lalletti, Stefano Teso</p>
<p>Abstract: Long-running machine learning models face the issue of concept drift (CD), whereby the data distribution changes over time, compromising prediction performance. Updating the model requires detecting drift by monitoring the data and/or the model for unexpected changes. We show that, however, spurious correlations (SCs) can spoil the statistics tracked by detection algorithms. Motivated by this, we introduce ebc-exstream, a novel detector that leverages model explanations to identify potential SCs and human feedback to correct for them. It leverages an entropy-based heuristic to reduce the amount of necessary feedback, cutting annotation costs. Our preliminary experiments on artificially confounded data highlight the promise of ebc-exstream for reducing the impact of SCs on detection.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16539">Enhancing Encrypted Internet Traffic Classification Through Advanced Data Augmentation Techniques</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yehonatan Zion, Porat Aharon, Ran Dubin, Amit Dvir, Chen Hajaj</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing popularity of online services has made Internet Traffic Classification a critical field of study. However, the rapid development of internet protocols and encryption limits usable data availability. This paper addresses the challenges of classifying encrypted internet traffic, focusing on the scarcity of open-source datasets and limitations of existing ones. We propose two Data Augmentation (DA) techniques to synthetically generate data based on real samples: Average augmentation and MTU augmentation. Both augmentations are aimed to improve the performance of the classifier, each from a different perspective: The Average augmentation aims to increase dataset size by generating new synthetic samples, while the MTU augmentation enhances classifier robustness to varying Maximum Transmission Units (MTUs). Our experiments, conducted on two well-known academic datasets and a commercial dataset, demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches in improving model performance and mitigating constraints associated with limited and homogeneous datasets. Our findings underscore the potential of data augmentation in addressing the challenges of modern internet traffic classification. Specifically, we show that our augmentation techniques significantly enhance encrypted traffic classification models. This improvement can positively impact user Quality of Experience (QoE) by more accurately classifying traffic as video streaming (e.g., YouTube) or chat (e.g., Google Chat). Additionally, it can enhance Quality of Service (QoS) for file downloading activities (e.g., Google Docs).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christodoulos Kechris, Jonathan Dan, Jose Miranda, David Atienza</p>
<p>Abstract: Non-linear activation functions are crucial in Convolutional Neural Networks. However, until now they have not been well described in the frequency domain. In this work, we study the spectral behavior of ReLU, a popular activation function. We use the ReLU's Taylor expansion to derive its frequency domain behavior. We demonstrate that ReLU introduces higher frequency oscillations in the signal and a constant DC component. Furthermore, we investigate the importance of this DC component, where we demonstrate that it helps the model extract meaningful features related to the input frequency content. We accompany our theoretical derivations with experiments and real-world examples. First, we numerically validate our frequency response model. Then we observe ReLU's spectral behavior on two example models and a real-world one. Finally, we experimentally investigate the role of the DC component introduced by ReLU in the CNN's representations. Our results indicate that the DC helps to converge to a weight configuration that is close to the initial random weights.</p>

<p>Abstract: We apply functional acceleration to the Policy Mirror Descent (PMD) general family of algorithms, which cover a wide range of novel and fundamental methods in Reinforcement Learning (RL). Leveraging duality, we propose a momentum-based PMD update. By taking the functional route, our approach is independent of the policy parametrization and applicable to large-scale optimization, covering previous applications of momentum at the level of policy parameters as a special case. We theoretically analyze several properties of this approach and complement with a numerical ablation study, which serves to illustrate the policy optimization dynamics on the value polytope, relative to different algorithmic design choices in this space. We further characterize numerically several features of the problem setting relevant for functional acceleration, and lastly, we investigate the impact of approximation on their learning mechanics.</p>

<p>Abstract: Continual learning is the problem of integrating new information in a model while retaining the knowledge acquired in the past. Despite the tangible improvements achieved in recent years, the problem of continual learning is still an open one. A better understanding of the mechanisms behind the successes and failures of existing continual learning algorithms can unlock the development of new successful strategies. In this work, we view continual learning from the perspective of the multi-task loss approximation, and we compare two alternative strategies, namely local and global approximations. We classify existing continual learning algorithms based on the approximation used, and we assess the practical effects of this distinction in common continual learning settings.Additionally, we study optimal continual learning objectives in the case of local polynomial approximations and we provide examples of existing algorithms implementing the optimal objectives</p>

<p>Abstract: Hyperbolic embeddings are a class of representation learning methods that offer competitive performances when data can be abstracted as a tree-like graph. However, in practice, learning hyperbolic embeddings of hierarchical data is difficult due to the different geometry between hyperbolic space and the Euclidean space. To address such difficulties, we first categorize three kinds of illness that harm the performance of the embeddings. Then, we develop a geometry-aware algorithm using a dilation operation and a transitive closure regularization to tackle these illnesses. We empirically validate these techniques and present a theoretical analysis of the mechanism behind the dilation operation. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets reveal superior performances of our algorithm.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper is about the recent notion of computably probably approximately correct learning, which lies between the statistical learning theory where there is no computational requirement on the learner and efficient PAC where the learner must be polynomially bounded. Examples have recently been given of hypothesis classes which are PAC learnable but not computably PAC learnable, but these hypothesis classes are unnatural or non-canonical in the sense that they depend on a numbering of proofs, formulas, or programs. We use the on-a-cone machinery from computability theory to prove that, under mild assumptions such as that the hypothesis class can be computably listable, any natural hypothesis class which is learnable must be computably learnable. Thus the counterexamples given previously are necessarily unnatural.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Runpeng Yu, Weihao Yu, Xinchao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper does not introduce a novel method. Instead, it offers a fairer and more comprehensive comparison of KAN and MLP models across various tasks, including machine learning, computer vision, audio processing, natural language processing, and symbolic formula representation. Specifically, we control the number of parameters and FLOPs to compare the performance of KAN and MLP. Our main observation is that, except for symbolic formula representation tasks, MLP generally outperforms KAN. We also conduct ablation studies on KAN and find that its advantage in symbolic formula representation mainly stems from its B-spline activation function. When B-spline is applied to MLP, performance in symbolic formula representation significantly improves, surpassing or matching that of KAN. However, in other tasks where MLP already excels over KAN, B-spline does not substantially enhance MLP's performance. Furthermore, we find that KAN's forgetting issue is more severe than that of MLP in a standard class-incremental continual learning setting, which differs from the findings reported in the KAN paper. We hope these results provide insights for future research on KAN and other MLP alternatives. Project link: https://github.com/yu-rp/KANbeFair</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jos\'e A. Carrillo, Yifan Chen, Daniel Zhengyu Huang, Jiaoyang Huang, Dongyi Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: The dynamics of probability density functions has been extensively studied in science and engineering to understand physical phenomena and facilitate algorithmic design. Of particular interest are dynamics that can be formulated as gradient flows of energy functionals under the Wasserstein metric. The development of functional inequalities, such as the log-Sobolev inequality, plays a pivotal role in analyzing the convergence of these dynamics. The goal of this paper is to parallel the success of techniques using functional inequalities, for dynamics that are gradient flows under the Fisher-Rao metric, with various $f$-divergences as energy functionals. Such dynamics take the form of a nonlocal differential equation, for which existing analysis critically relies on using the explicit solution formula in special cases. We provide a comprehensive study on functional inequalities and the relevant geodesic convexity for Fisher-Rao gradient flows under minimal assumptions. A notable feature of the obtained functional inequalities is that they do not depend on the log-concavity or log-Sobolev constants of the target distribution. Consequently, the convergence rate of the dynamics (assuming well-posed) is uniform across general target distributions, making them potentially desirable dynamics for posterior sampling applications in Bayesian inference.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of foundation models in medical imaging represents a significant leap toward enhancing diagnostic accuracy and personalized treatment. However, the deployment of foundation models in healthcare necessitates a rigorous examination of their trustworthiness, encompassing privacy, robustness, reliability, explainability, and fairness. The current body of survey literature on foundation models in medical imaging reveals considerable gaps, particularly in the area of trustworthiness. Additionally, extant surveys on the trustworthiness of foundation models fail to address their specific variations and applications within the medical imaging domain. This survey paper reviews the current research on foundation models in the major medical imaging applications, with a focus on segmentation, medical report generation, medical question and answering (Q&A), and disease diagnosis, which includes trustworthiness discussion in their manuscripts. We explore the complex challenges of making foundation models for medical image analysis trustworthy, associated with each application, and summarize the current concerns and strategies to enhance trustworthiness. Furthermore, we explore the future promises of these models in revolutionizing patient care. Our analysis underscores the imperative for advancing towards trustworthy AI in medical image analysis, advocating for a balanced approach that fosters innovation while ensuring ethical and equitable healthcare delivery.</p>

<p>Abstract: Emerging technologies drive the ongoing transformation of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). This transformation has given rise to cybersecurity concerns, among which data poisoning attack emerges as a new threat as ITS increasingly relies on data. In data poisoning attacks, attackers inject malicious perturbations into datasets, potentially leading to inaccurate results in offline learning and real-time decision-making processes. This paper concentrates on data poisoning attack models against ITS. We identify the main ITS data sources vulnerable to poisoning attacks and application scenarios that enable staging such attacks. A general framework is developed following rigorous study process from cybersecurity but also considering specific ITS application needs. Data poisoning attacks against ITS are reviewed and categorized following the framework. We then discuss the current limitations of these attack models and the future research directions. Our work can serve as a guideline to better understand the threat of data poisoning attacks against ITS applications, while also giving a perspective on the future development of trustworthy ITS.</p>

<p>Abstract: With low-cost computing devices, improved sensor technology, and the proliferation of data-driven algorithms, we have more data than we know what to do with. In transportation, we are seeing a surge in spatiotemporal data collection. At the same time, concerns over user privacy have led to research on differential privacy in applied settings. In this paper, we look at some recent developments in differential privacy in the context of spatiotemporal data. Spatiotemporal data contain not only features about users but also the geographical locations of their frequent visits. Hence, the public release of such data carries extreme risks. To address the need for such data in research and inference without exposing private information, significant work has been proposed. This survey paper aims to summarize these efforts and provide a review of differential privacy mechanisms and related software. We also discuss related work in transportation where such mechanisms have been applied. Furthermore, we address the challenges in the deployment and mass adoption of differential privacy in transportation spatiotemporal data for downstream analyses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Honggui Li, Sinan Chen, Nahid Md Lokman Hossain, Maria Trocan, Beata Mikovicova, Muhammad Fahimullah, Dimitri Galayko, Mohamad Sawan</p>
<p>Abstract: Learned image compression (LIC) is currently the cutting-edge method. However, the inherent difference between testing and training images of LIC results in performance degradation to some extent. Especially for out-of-sample, out-of-distribution, or out-of-domain testing images, the performance of LIC dramatically degraded. Classical LIC is a serial image compression (SIC) approach that utilizes an open-loop architecture with serial encoding and decoding units. Nevertheless, according to the theory of automatic control, a closed-loop architecture holds the potential to improve the dynamic and static performance of LIC. Therefore, a circular image compression (CIC) approach with closed-loop encoding and decoding elements is proposed to minimize the gap between testing and training images and upgrade the capability of LIC. The proposed CIC establishes a nonlinear loop equation and proves that steady-state error between reconstructed and original images is close to zero by Talor series expansion. The proposed CIC method possesses the property of Post-Training and plug-and-play which can be built on any existing advanced SIC methods. Experimental results on five public image compression datasets demonstrate that the proposed CIC outperforms five open-source state-of-the-art competing SIC algorithms in reconstruction capacity. Experimental results further show that the proposed method is suitable for out-of-sample testing images with dark backgrounds, sharp edges, high contrast, grid shapes, or complex patterns.</p>

<p>Abstract: The increasing security and privacy concerns in the Smart Grid sector have led to a significant demand for robust intrusion detection systems within critical smart grid infrastructure. To address the challenges posed by privacy preservation and decentralized power system zones with distinct data ownership, Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising privacy-preserving solution which facilitates collaborative training of attack detection models without necessitating the sharing of raw data. However, FL presents several implementation limitations in the power system domain due to its heavy reliance on a centralized aggregator and the risks of privacy leakage during model update transmission. To overcome these technical bottlenecks, this paper introduces a novel decentralized federated anomaly detection scheme based on two main gossip protocols namely Random Walk and Epidemic. Our findings indicate that the Random Walk protocol exhibits superior performance compared to the Epidemic protocol, highlighting its efficacy in decentralized federated learning environments. Experimental validation of the proposed framework utilizing publicly available industrial control systems datasets demonstrates superior attack detection accuracy while safeguarding data confidentiality and mitigating the impact of communication latency and stragglers. Furthermore, our approach yields a notable 35% improvement in training time compared to conventional FL, underscoring the efficacy and robustness of our decentralized learning method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alex Clinton, Yiding Chen, Xiaojin Zhu, Kirthevasan Kandasamy</p>
<p>Abstract: We study a collaborative learning problem where $m$ agents estimate a vector $\mu\in\mathbb{R}^d$ by collecting samples from normal distributions, with each agent $i$ incurring a cost $c_{i,k} \in (0, \infty]$ to sample from the $k^{\text{th}}$ distribution $\mathcal{N}(\mu_k, \sigma^2)$. Instead of working on their own, agents can collect data that is cheap to them, and share it with others in exchange for data that is expensive or even inaccessible to them, thereby simultaneously reducing data collection costs and estimation error. However, when agents have different collection costs, we need to first decide how to fairly divide the work of data collection so as to benefit all agents. Moreover, in naive sharing protocols, strategic agents may under-collect and/or fabricate data, leading to socially undesirable outcomes. Our mechanism addresses these challenges by combining ideas from cooperative and non-cooperative game theory. We use ideas from axiomatic bargaining to divide the cost of data collection. Given such a solution, we develop a Nash incentive-compatible (NIC) mechanism to enforce truthful reporting. We achieve a $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{m})$ approximation to the minimum social penalty (sum of agent estimation errors and data collection costs) in the worst case, and a $\mathcal{O}(1)$ approximation under favorable conditions. We complement this with a hardness result, showing that $\Omega(\sqrt{m})$ is unavoidable in any NIC mechanism.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuchen Zhang, Ratish Kumar Chandrakant Jha, Soumya Bharadwaj, Vatsal Sanjaykumar Thakkar, Adrienne Hoarfrost, Jin Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Predicting gene function from its DNA sequence is a fundamental challenge in biology. Many deep learning models have been proposed to embed DNA sequences and predict their enzymatic function, leveraging information in public databases linking DNA sequences to an enzymatic function label. However, much of the scientific community's knowledge of biological function is not represented in these categorical labels, and is instead captured in unstructured text descriptions of mechanisms, reactions, and enzyme behavior. These descriptions are often captured alongside DNA sequences in biological databases, albeit in an unstructured manner. Deep learning of models predicting enzymatic function are likely to benefit from incorporating this multi-modal data encoding scientific knowledge of biological function. There is, however, no dataset designed for machine learning algorithms to leverage this multi-modal information. Here we propose a novel dataset and benchmark suite that enables the exploration and development of large multi-modal neural network models on gene DNA sequences and natural language descriptions of gene function. We present baseline performance on benchmarks for both unsupervised and supervised tasks that demonstrate the difficulty of this modeling objective, while demonstrating the potential benefit of incorporating multi-modal data types in function prediction compared to DNA sequences alone.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhen Wang, Dylan G. Ildefonzo, Linbing Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to the varying intensity of pavement cracks, the complexity of topological structure, and the noise of texture background, image classification for asphalt pavement cracking has proven to be a challenging problem. Fatigue cracking, also known as alligator cracking, is one of the common distresses of asphalt pavement. It is thus important to detect and monitor the condition of alligator cracking on roadway pavements. Most research in this area has typically focused on pixel-level detection of cracking using limited datasets. A novel deep convolutional neural network that can achieve two objectives is proposed. The first objective of the proposed neural network is to classify presence of fatigue cracking based on pavement surface images. The second objective is to classify the fatigue cracking severity level based on the Distress Identification Manual (DIM) standard. In this paper, a databank of 4484 high-resolution pavement surface images is established in which images are taken locally in the Town of Blacksburg, Virginia, USA. In the data pre-preparation, over 4000 images are labeled into 4 categories manually according to DIM standards. A four-layer convolutional neural network model is then built to achieve the goal of classification of images by pavement crack severity category. The trained model reached the highest accuracy among all existing methods. After only 30 epochs of training, the model achieved a crack existence classification accuracy of 96.23% and a severity level classification accuracy of 96.74%. After 20 epochs of training, the model achieved a pavement marking presence classification accuracy of 97.64%.</p>

<p>Abstract: Temporal reasoning over tabular data presents substantial challenges for large language models (LLMs), as evidenced by recent research. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of temporal datasets to pinpoint the specific limitations of LLMs. Our investigation leads to enhancements in TempTabQA, a dataset specifically designed for tabular temporal question answering. We provide critical insights for improving LLM performance in temporal reasoning tasks with tabular data. Furthermore, we introduce a novel approach, C.L.E.A.R to strengthen LLM capabilities in this domain. Our findings demonstrate that our method significantly improves evidence-based reasoning across various models. Additionally, our experimental results reveal that indirect supervision with auxiliary data substantially boosts model performance in these tasks. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of LLMs' temporal reasoning abilities over tabular data and promotes advancements in their application across diverse fields.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nina Deliu, Bibhas Chakraborty</p>
<p>Abstract: Precision health, increasingly supported by digital technologies, is a domain of research that broadens the paradigm of precision medicine, advancing everyday healthcare. This vision goes hand in hand with the groundbreaking advent of artificial intelligence (AI), which is reshaping the way we diagnose, treat, and monitor both clinical subjects and the general population. AI tools powered by machine learning have shown considerable improvements in a variety of healthcare domains. In particular, reinforcement learning (RL) holds great promise for sequential and dynamic problems such as dynamic treatment regimes and just-in-time adaptive interventions in digital health. In this work, we discuss the opportunity offered by AI, more specifically RL, to current trends in healthcare, providing a methodological survey of RL methods in the context of precision and digital health. Focusing on the area of adaptive interventions, we expand the methodological survey with illustrative case studies that used RL in real practice.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saaketh Desai, Sadhvikas Addamane, Jeffery Y. Tsao, Igal Brener, Remi Dingreville, Prasad P. Iyer</p>
<p>Abstract: We developed an autonomous experimentation platform to accelerate interpretable scientific discovery in ultrafast nanophotonics, targeting a novel method to steer spontaneous emission from reconfigurable semiconductor metasurfaces. Controlling spontaneous emission is crucial for clean-energy solutions in illumination, thermal radiation engineering, and remote sensing. Despite the potential of reconfigurable semiconductor metasurfaces with embedded sources for spatiotemporal control, achieving arbitrary far-field control remains challenging. Here, we present a self-driving lab (SDL) platform that addresses this challenge by discovering the governing equations for predicting the far-field emission profile from light-emitting metasurfaces. We discover that both the spatial gradient (grating-like) and the curvature (lens-like) of the local refractive index are key factors in steering spontaneous emission. The SDL employs a machine-learning framework comprising: (1) a variational autoencoder for generating complex spatial refractive index profiles, (2) an active learning agent for guiding experiments with real-time closed-loop feedback, and (3) a neural network-based equation learner to uncover structure-property relationships. The SDL demonstrated a four-fold enhancement in peak emission directivity (up to 77%) over a 72{\deg} field of view within ~300 experiments. Our findings reveal that combinations of positive gratings and lenses are as effective as negative lenses and gratings for all emission angles, offering a novel strategy for controlling spontaneous emission beyond conventional Fourier optics.</p>

<p>Abstract: Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that significantly impacts both motor and non-motor functions, including speech. Early and accurate recognition of PD through speech analysis can greatly enhance patient outcomes by enabling timely intervention. This paper provides a comprehensive review of methods for PD recognition using speech data, highlighting advances in machine learning and data-driven approaches. We discuss the process of data wrangling, including data collection, cleaning, transformation, and exploratory data analysis, to prepare the dataset for machine learning applications. Various classification algorithms are explored, including logistic regression, SVM, and neural networks, with and without feature selection. Each method is evaluated based on accuracy, precision, and training time. Our findings indicate that specific acoustic features and advanced machine-learning techniques can effectively differentiate between individuals with PD and healthy controls. The study concludes with a comparison of the different models, identifying the most effective approaches for PD recognition, and suggesting potential directions for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongshen Yang, Avinash Malik</p>
<p>Abstract: Cryptocurrency is a cryptography-based digital asset with extremely volatile prices. Around $70 billion worth of crypto-currency is traded daily on exchanges. Trading crypto-currency is difficult due to the inherent volatility of the crypto-market. In this work, we want to test the hypothesis: "Can techniques from artificial intelligence help with algorithmically trading cryptocurrencies?". In order to address this question, we combine Reinforcement Learning (RL) with pair trading. Pair trading is a statistical arbitrage trading technique which exploits the price difference between statistically correlated assets. We train reinforcement learners to determine when and how to trade pairs of cryptocurrencies. We develop new reward shaping and observation/action spaces for reinforcement learning. We performed experiments with the developed reinforcement learner on pairs of BTC-GBP and BTC-EUR data separated by 1-minute intervals (n = 263,520). The traditional non-RL pair trading technique achieved an annualised profit of 8.33%, while the proposed RL-based pair trading technique achieved annualised profits from 9.94% - 31.53%, depending upon the RL learner. Our results show that RL can significantly outperform manual and traditional pair trading techniques when applied to volatile markets such as cryptocurrencies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Atul Kumar, Siddharth Garg, Soumya Dutta</p>
<p>Abstract: The widespread use of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has recently resulted in their application to challenging scientific visualization tasks. While advanced DNNs demonstrate impressive generalization abilities, understanding factors like prediction quality, confidence, robustness, and uncertainty is crucial. These insights aid application scientists in making informed decisions. However, DNNs lack inherent mechanisms to measure prediction uncertainty, prompting the creation of distinct frameworks for constructing robust uncertainty-aware models tailored to various visualization tasks. In this work, we develop uncertainty-aware implicit neural representations to model steady-state vector fields effectively. We comprehensively evaluate the efficacy of two principled deep uncertainty estimation techniques: (1) Deep Ensemble and (2) Monte Carlo Dropout, aimed at enabling uncertainty-informed visual analysis of features within steady vector field data. Our detailed exploration using several vector data sets indicate that uncertainty-aware models generate informative visualization results of vector field features. Furthermore, incorporating prediction uncertainty improves the resilience and interpretability of our DNN model, rendering it applicable for the analysis of non-trivial vector field data sets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongyi Wang, Ji Sun, Jinzhe Liang, Li Zhai, Zitian Tang, Zijian Li, Wei Zhai, Xusheng Wang, Weihao Gao, Sheng Gong, Bolong Huang, Hua Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The ionic bonding across the lattice and ordered microscopic structures endow crystals with unique symmetry and determine their macroscopic properties. Unconventional crystals, in particular, exhibit non-traditional lattice structures or possess exotic physical properties, making them intriguing subjects for investigation. Therefore, to accurately predict the physical and chemical properties of crystals, it is crucial to consider long-range orders. While GNN excels at capturing the local environment of atoms in crystals, they often face challenges in effectively capturing longer-ranged interactions due to their limited depth. In this paper, we propose CrysToGraph ($\textbf{Crys}$tals with $\textbf{T}$ransformers $\textbf{o}$n $\textbf{Graph}$s), a novel transformer-based geometric graph network designed specifically for unconventional crystalline systems, and UnconvBench, a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate models' predictive performance on unconventional crystal materials such as defected crystals, low-dimension crystals and MOF. CrysToGraph effectively captures short-range interactions with transformer-based graph convolution blocks as well as long-range interactions with graph-wise transformer blocks. CrysToGraph proofs its effectiveness in modelling unconventional crystal materials in multiple tasks, and moreover, it outperforms most existing methods, achieving new state-of-the-art results on the benchmarks of both unconventional crystals and traditional crystals.</p>

<p>Abstract: Trauma is a significant cause of mortality and disability, particularly among individuals under forty. Traditional diagnostic methods for traumatic injuries, such as X-rays, CT scans, and MRI, are often time-consuming and dependent on medical expertise, which can delay critical interventions. This study explores the application of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to improve the speed and accuracy of abdominal trauma diagnosis. We developed an advanced AI-based model combining 3D segmentation, 2D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to enhance diagnostic performance. Our model processes abdominal CT scans to provide real-time, precise assessments, thereby improving clinical decision-making and patient outcomes. Comprehensive experiments demonstrated that our approach significantly outperforms traditional diagnostic methods, as evidenced by rigorous evaluation metrics. This research sets a new benchmark for automated trauma detection, leveraging the strengths of AI and ML to revolutionize trauma care.</p>

<p>Abstract: Many roboticists dream of presenting a robot with a task in the evening and returning the next morning to find the robot capable of solving the task. What is preventing us from achieving this? Sim-to-real reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved impressive performance on challenging robotics tasks, but requires substantial human effort to set up the task in a way that is amenable to RL. It's our position that algorithmic improvements in policy optimization and other ideas should be guided towards resolving the primary bottleneck of shaping the training environment, i.e., designing observations, actions, rewards and simulation dynamics. Most practitioners don't tune the RL algorithm, but other environment parameters to obtain a desirable controller. We posit that scaling RL to diverse robotic tasks will only be achieved if the community focuses on automating environment shaping procedures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shi Lin, Rongchang Li, Xun Wang, Changting Lin, Wenpeng Xing, Meng Han</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has brought remarkable generative capabilities across diverse tasks. However, despite the impressive achievements, these models still have numerous security vulnerabilities, particularly when faced with jailbreak attacks. Therefore, by investigating jailbreak attacks, we can uncover hidden weaknesses in LLMs and guide us in developing more robust defense mechanisms to fortify their security. In this paper, we further explore the boundary of jailbreak attacks on LLMs and propose Analyzing-based Jailbreak (ABJ). This effective jailbreak attack method takes advantage of LLMs' growing analyzing and reasoning capability and reveals their underlying vulnerabilities when facing analysis-based tasks. We conduct a detailed evaluation of ABJ across various open-source and closed-source LLMs, which achieves 94.8% Attack Success Rate (ASR) and 1.06 Attack Efficiency (AE) on GPT-4-turbo-0409, demonstrating state-of-the-art attack effectiveness and efficiency. Our research highlights the importance of prioritizing and enhancing the safety of LLMs to mitigate the risks of misuse.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in physics-based character animation leverage deep learning to generate agile and natural motion, enabling characters to execute movements such as backflips, boxing, and tennis. However, reproducing the selection and use of diverse motor skills in dynamic environments to solve complex tasks, as humans do, still remains a challenge. We present a strategy and skill learning approach for physics-based table tennis animation. Our method addresses the issue of mode collapse, where the characters do not fully utilize the motor skills they need to perform to execute complex tasks. More specifically, we demonstrate a hierarchical control system for diversified skill learning and a strategy learning framework for effective decision-making. We showcase the efficacy of our method through comparative analysis with state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its capabilities in executing various skills for table tennis. Our strategy learning framework is validated through both agent-agent interaction and human-agent interaction in Virtual Reality, handling both competitive and cooperative tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matan Shamir, Osher Elhadad, Matthew E. Taylor, Reuth Mirsky</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditionally, Reinforcement Learning (RL) problems are aimed at optimization of the behavior of an agent. This paper proposes a novel take on RL, which is used to learn the policy of another agent, to allow real-time recognition of that agent's goals. Goal Recognition (GR) has traditionally been framed as a planning problem where one must recognize an agent's objectives based on its observed actions. Recent approaches have shown how reinforcement learning can be used as part of the GR pipeline, but are limited to recognizing predefined goals and lack scalability in domains with a large goal space. This paper formulates a novel problem, "Online Dynamic Goal Recognition" (ODGR), as a first step to address these limitations. Contributions include introducing the concept of dynamic goals into the standard GR problem definition, revisiting common approaches by reformulating them using ODGR, and demonstrating the feasibility of solving ODGR in a navigation domain using transfer learning. These novel formulations open the door for future extensions of existing transfer learning-based GR methods, which will be robust to changing and expansive real-time environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent studies have illuminated that Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit substantial potential in the realm of RTL (Register Transfer Level) code generation, with notable advancements evidenced by commercial models such as GPT-4 and Claude3-Opus. Despite their proficiency, these commercial LLMs often raise concerns regarding privacy and security. Conversely, open-source LLMs, which offer solutions to these concerns, have inferior performance in RTL code generation tasks to commercial models due to the lack of highquality open-source RTL datasets. To address this issue, we introduce OriGen, a fully open-source framework featuring self-reflection capabilities and a dataset augmentation methodology for generating high-quality, large-scale RTL code. We propose a novel code-to-code augmentation methodology that leverages knowledge distillation to enhance the quality of the open-source RTL code datasets. Additionally, OriGen is capable of correcting syntactic errors by leveraging a self-reflection process based on feedback from the compiler. The self-reflection ability of the model is facilitated by a carefully constructed dataset, which comprises a comprehensive collection of samples. Experimental results demonstrate that OriGen remarkably outperforms other open-source alternatives in RTL code generation, surpassing the previous best-performing LLM by 9.8% on the VerilogEval-Human benchmark. Furthermore, OriGen exhibits superior capabilities in self-reflection and error rectification, surpassing GPT-4 by 18.1% on the benchmark designed to evaluate the capability of self-reflection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Malte Luttermann, Johann Machemer, Marcel Gehrke</p>
<p>Abstract: Lifted probabilistic inference exploits symmetries in probabilistic graphical models to allow for tractable probabilistic inference with respect to domain sizes. To exploit symmetries in, e.g., factor graphs, it is crucial to identify commutative factors, i.e., factors having symmetries within themselves due to their arguments being exchangeable. The current state of the art to check whether a factor is commutative with respect to a subset of its arguments iterates over all possible subsets of the factor's arguments, i.e., $O(2^n)$ iterations for a factor with $n$ arguments in the worst case. In this paper, we efficiently solve the problem of detecting commutative factors in a factor graph. In particular, we introduce the detection of commutative factors (DECOR) algorithm, which allows us to drastically reduce the computational effort for checking whether a factor is commutative in practice. We prove that DECOR efficiently identifies restrictions to drastically reduce the number of required iterations and validate the efficiency of DECOR in our empirical evaluation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) for face recognition aggregates locally optimized models from individual clients to construct a generalized face recognition model. However, previous studies present two major challenges: insufficient incorporation of self-supervised learning and the necessity for clients to accommodate multiple subjects. To tackle these limitations, we propose FedFS (Federated Learning for personalized Face recognition via intra-subject Self-supervised learning framework), a novel federated learning architecture tailored to train personalized face recognition models without imposing subjects. Our proposed FedFS comprises two crucial components that leverage aggregated features of the local and global models to cooperate with representations of an off-the-shelf model. These components are (1) adaptive soft label construction, utilizing dot product operations to reformat labels within intra-instances, and (2) intra-subject self-supervised learning, employing cosine similarity operations to strengthen robust intra-subject representations. Additionally, we introduce a regularization loss to prevent overfitting and ensure the stability of the optimized model. To assess the effectiveness of FedFS, we conduct comprehensive experiments on the DigiFace-1M and VGGFace datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to previous methods.</p>

Specifically, the EffiSegNet-B4 network variant achieved an F1 score of 0.9552, mean Dice (mDice) 0.9483, mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) 0.9056, Precision 0.9679, and Recall 0.9429 with a pre-trained backbone - to the best of our knowledge, the highest reported scores in the literature for this dataset. Additional training from scratch also demonstrated exceptional performance compared to previous work, achieving an F1 score of 0.9286, mDice 0.9207, mIoU 0.8668, Precision 0.9311 and Recall 0.9262.

<p>Abstract: Pancreas segmentation has been traditionally challenging due to its small size in computed tomography abdominal volumes, high variability of shape and positions among patients, and blurred boundaries due to low contrast between the pancreas and surrounding organs. Many deep learning models for pancreas segmentation have been proposed in the past few years. We present a thorough systematic review based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement. The literature search was conducted on PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and IEEE Xplore on original studies published in peer-reviewed journals from 2013 to 2023. Overall, 130 studies were retrieved. We initially provided an overview of the technical background of the most common network architectures and publicly available datasets. Then, the analysis of the studies combining visual presentation in tabular form and text description was reported. The tables grouped the studies specifying the application, dataset size, design (model architecture, learning strategy, and loss function), results, and main contributions. We first analyzed the studies focusing on parenchyma segmentation using coarse-to-fine approaches, multi-organ segmentation, semi-supervised learning, and unsupervised learning, followed by those studies on generalization to other datasets and those concerning the design of new loss functions. Then, we analyzed the studies on segmentation of tumors, cysts, and inflammation reporting multi-stage methods, semi-supervised learning, generalization to other datasets, and design of new loss functions. Finally, we provided a critical discussion on the subject based on the published evidence underlining current issues that need to be addressed before clinical translation.</p>

Despite wide dissemination of KGE in various tasks, KGE methods have limitations in reasoning abilities. In this paper we propose a mathematical framework to compare reasoning abilities of KGE methods. We show that STransE has a higher capability than TransComplEx, and then present new STransCoRe method, which improves the STransE by combining it with the TransCoRe insights, which can reduce the STransE space complexity.</p>

<p>Abstract: We study multistage distributionally robust linear optimization, where the uncertainty set is defined as a ball of distribution centered at a scenario tree using the nested distance. The resulting minimax problem is notoriously difficult to solve due to its inherent non-convexity. In this paper, we demonstrate that, under mild conditions, the robust risk evaluation of a given policy can be expressed in an equivalent recursive form. Furthermore, assuming stagewise independence, we derive equivalent dynamic programming reformulations to find an optimal robust policy that is time-consistent and well-defined on unseen sample paths. Our reformulations reconcile two modeling frameworks: the multistage-static formulation (with nested distance) and the multistage-dynamic formulation (with one-period Wasserstein distance). Moreover, we identify tractable cases when the value functions can be computed efficiently using convex optimization techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinpeng Chen, Runmin Cong, Yuxuan Luo, Horace Ho Shing Ip, Sam Kwong</p>
<p>Abstract: This study explores the emerging area of continual panoptic segmentation, highlighting three key balances. First, we introduce past-class backtrace distillation to balance the stability of existing knowledge with the adaptability to new information. This technique retraces the features associated with past classes based on the final label assignment results, performing knowledge distillation targeting these specific features from the previous model while allowing other features to flexibly adapt to new information. Additionally, we introduce a class-proportional memory strategy, which aligns the class distribution in the replay sample set with that of the historical training data. This strategy maintains a balanced class representation during replay, enhancing the utility of the limited-capacity replay sample set in recalling prior classes. Moreover, recognizing that replay samples are annotated only for the classes of their original step, we devise balanced anti-misguidance losses, which combat the impact of incomplete annotations without incurring classification bias. Building upon these innovations, we present a new method named Balanced Continual Panoptic Segmentation (BalConpas). Our evaluation on the challenging ADE20K dataset demonstrates its superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

<p>Abstract: We address the selection and evaluation of uncertain segmentation methods in medical imaging and present two case studies: prostate segmentation, illustrating that for minimal annotator variation simple deterministic models can suffice, and lung lesion segmentation, highlighting the limitations of the Generalized Energy Distance (GED) in model selection. Our findings lead to guidelines for accurately choosing and developing uncertain segmentation models, that integrate aleatoric and epistemic components. These guidelines are designed to aid researchers and practitioners in better developing, selecting, and evaluating uncertain segmentation methods, thereby facilitating enhanced adoption and effective application of segmentation uncertainty in practice.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ioanna-Yvonni Tsaknaki, Fabrizio Lillo, Piero Mazzarisi</p>
<p>Abstract: Change points in real-world systems mark significant regime shifts in system dynamics, possibly triggered by exogenous or endogenous factors. These points define regimes for the time evolution of the system and are crucial for understanding transitions in financial, economic, social, environmental, and technological contexts. Building upon the Bayesian approach introduced in \cite{c:07}, we devise a new method for online change point detection in the mean of a univariate time series, which is well suited for real-time applications and is able to handle the general temporal patterns displayed by data in many empirical contexts. We first describe time series as an autoregressive process of an arbitrary order. Second, the variance and correlation of the data are allowed to vary within each regime driven by a scoring rule that updates the value of the parameters for a better fit of the observations. Finally, a change point is detected in a probabilistic framework via the posterior distribution of the current regime length. By modeling temporal dependencies and time-varying parameters, the proposed approach enhances both the estimate accuracy and the forecasting power. Empirical validations using various datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness in capturing memory and dynamic patterns, offering deeper insights into the non-stationary dynamics of real-world systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Isaac Boixaderas, Sergi Mor\'e, Javier Bartolome, David Vicente, Petar Radojkovi\'c, Paul M. Carpenter, Eduard Ayguad\'e</p>
<p>Abstract: Scaling to larger systems, with current levels of reliability, requires cost-effective methods to mitigate hardware failures. One of the main causes of hardware failure is an uncorrected error in memory, which terminates the current job and wastes all computation since the last checkpoint. This paper presents the first adaptive method for triggering uncorrected error mitigation. It uses a prediction approach that considers the likelihood of an uncorrected error and its current potential cost. The method is based on reinforcement learning, and the only user-defined parameters are the mitigation cost and whether the job can be restarted from a mitigation point. We evaluate our method using classical machine learning metrics together with a cost-benefit analysis, which compares the cost of mitigation actions with the benefits from mitigating some of the errors. On two years of production logs from the MareNostrum supercomputer, our method reduces lost compute time by 54% compared with no mitigation and is just 6% below the optimal Oracle method. All source code is open source.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoran Wang, Xinji Mai, Zeng Tao, Yan Wang, Jiawen Yu, Ziheng Zhou, Xuan Tong, Shaoqi Yan, Qing Zhao, Shuyong Gao, Wenqiang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Affective Forecasting, a research direction in psychology that predicts individuals future emotions, is often constrained by numerous external factors like social influence and temporal distance. To address this, we transform Affective Forecasting into a Deep Learning problem by designing an Emotion Forecasting paradigm based on two-party interactions. We propose a novel Emotion Forecasting (EF) task grounded in the theory that an individuals emotions are easily influenced by the emotions or other information conveyed during interactions with another person. To tackle this task, we have developed a specialized dataset, Human-interaction-based Emotion Forecasting (Hi-EF), which contains 3069 two-party Multilayered-Contextual Interaction Samples (MCIS) with abundant affective-relevant labels and three modalities. Hi-EF not only demonstrates the feasibility of the EF task but also highlights its potential. Additionally, we propose a methodology that establishes a foundational and referential baseline model for the EF task and extensive experiments are provided. The dataset and code is available at https://github.com/Anonymize-Author/Hi-EF.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Petar Bevanda, Nicolas Hoischen, Stefan Sosnowski, Sandra Hirche, Boris Houska</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a fully data-driven approach for optimal control of nonlinear control-affine systems represented by a stochastic diffusion. The focus is on the scenario where both the nonlinear dynamics and stage cost functions are unknown, while only control penalty function and constraints are provided. Leveraging the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, we introduce novel kernel mean embeddings (KMEs) to identify the Markov transition operators associated with controlled diffusion processes. The KME learning approach seamlessly integrates with modern convex operator-theoretic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman recursions. Thus, unlike traditional dynamic programming methods, our approach exploits the ``kernel trick'' to break the curse of dimensionality. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through numerical examples, highlighting its ability to solve a large class of nonlinear optimal control problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eklavya Sarkar, Mathew Magimai. -Doss</p>
<p>Abstract: Marmoset monkeys encode vital information in their calls and serve as a surrogate model for neuro-biologists to understand the evolutionary origins of human vocal communication. Traditionally analyzed with signal processing-based features, recent approaches have utilized self-supervised models pre-trained on human speech for feature extraction, capitalizing on their ability to learn a signal's intrinsic structure independently of its acoustic domain. However, the utility of such foundation models remains unclear for marmoset call analysis in terms of multi-class classification, bandwidth, and pre-training domain. This study assesses feature representations derived from speech and general audio domains, across pre-training bandwidths of 4, 8, and 16 kHz for marmoset call-type and caller classification tasks. Results show that models with higher bandwidth improve performance, and pre-training on speech or general audio yields comparable results, improving over a spectral baseline.</p>

<p>Abstract: Most useful weather prediction for the public is near the surface. The processes that are most relevant for near-surface weather prediction are also those that are most interactive and exhibit positive feedback or have key role in energy partitioning. Land surface models (LSMs) consider these processes together with surface heterogeneity and forecast water, carbon and energy fluxes, and coupled with an atmospheric model provide boundary and initial conditions. This numerical parametrization of atmospheric boundaries being computationally expensive, statistical surrogate models are increasingly used to accelerated progress in experimental research. We evaluated the efficiency of three surrogate models in speeding up experimental research by simulating land surface processes, which are integral to forecasting water, carbon, and energy fluxes in coupled atmospheric models. Specifically, we compared the performance of a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) encoder-decoder network, extreme gradient boosting, and a feed-forward neural network within a physics-informed multi-objective framework. This framework emulates key states of the ECMWF's Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) land surface scheme, ECLand, across continental and global scales. Our findings indicate that while all models on average demonstrate high accuracy over the forecast period, the LSTM network excels in continental long-range predictions when carefully tuned, the XGB scores consistently high across tasks and the MLP provides an excellent implementation-time-accuracy trade-off. The runtime reduction achieved by the emulators in comparison to the full numerical models are significant, offering a faster, yet reliable alternative for conducting numerical experiments on land surfaces.</p>

<p>Abstract: Lymphoid infiltration at tumor margins is a key prognostic marker in solid tumors, playing a crucial role in guiding immunotherapy decisions. Current assessment methods, heavily reliant on immunohistochemistry (IHC), face challenges in tumor margin delineation and are affected by tissue preservation conditions. In contrast, we propose a Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining-based approach, underpinned by an advanced lymphocyte segmentation model trained on a public dataset for the precise detection of CD3+ and CD20+ lymphocytes. In our colorectal cancer study, we demonstrate that our H&E-based method offers a compelling alternative to traditional IHC, achieving comparable results in many cases. Our method's validity is further explored through a Turing test, involving blinded assessments by a pathologist of anonymized curves from H&E and IHC slides. This approach invites the medical community to consider Turing tests as a standard for evaluating medical applications involving expert human evaluation, thereby opening new avenues for enhancing cancer management and immunotherapy planning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Miriam Fahimi, Mayra Russo, Kristen M. Scott, Maria-Esther Vidal, Bettina Berendt, Katharina Kinder-Kurlanda</p>
<p>Abstract: The field of fair AI aims to counter biased algorithms through computational modelling. However, it faces increasing criticism for perpetuating the use of overly technical and reductionist methods. As a result, novel approaches appear in the field to address more socially-oriented and interdisciplinary (SOI) perspectives on fair AI. In this paper, we take this dynamic as the starting point to study the tension between computer science (CS) and SOI research. By drawing on STS and CSCW theory, we position fair AI research as a matter of 'organizational alignment': what makes research 'doable' is the successful alignment of three levels of work organization (the social world, the laboratory and the experiment). Based on qualitative interviews with CS researchers, we analyze the tasks, resources, and actors required for doable research in the case of fair AI. We find that CS researchers engage with SOI to some extent, but organizational conditions, articulation work, and ambiguities of the social world constrain the doability of SOI research. Based on our findings, we identify and discuss problems for aligning CS and SOI as fair AI continues to evolve.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aristeidis Panos, Rahaf Aljundi, Daniel Olmeda Reino, Richard E Turner</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities in visual question answering and image captioning, acting as a crucial link between visual and language models. However, existing open-source VLMs heavily rely on pretrained and frozen vision encoders (such as CLIP). Despite CLIP's robustness across diverse domains, it still exhibits non-negligible image understanding errors. These errors propagate to the VLM responses, resulting in sub-optimal performance. In our work, we propose an efficient and robust method for updating vision encoders within VLMs. Our approach selectively and locally updates encoders, leading to substantial performance improvements on data where previous mistakes occurred, while maintaining overall robustness. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method during continual few-shot updates. Theoretical grounding, generality, and computational efficiency characterize our approach.</p>

<p>Abstract: This work stages Foosball as a versatile platform for advancing scientific research, particularly in the realm of robot learning. We present an automated Foosball table along with its corresponding simulated counterpart, showcasing a diverse range of challenges through example tasks within the Foosball environment. Initial findings are shared using a simple baseline approach. Foosball constitutes a versatile learning environment with the potential to yield cutting-edge research in various fields of artificial intelligence and machine learning, notably robust learning, while also extending its applicability to industrial robotics and automation setups. To transform our physical Foosball table into a research-friendly system, we augmented it with a 2 degrees of freedom kinematic chain to control the goalkeeper rod as an initial setup with the intention to be extended to the full game as soon as possible. Our experiments reveal that a realistic simulation is essential for mastering complex robotic tasks, yet translating these accomplishments to the real system remains challenging, often accompanied by a performance decline. This emphasizes the critical importance of research in this direction. In this concern, we spotlight the automated Foosball table as an invaluable tool, possessing numerous desirable attributes, to serve as a demanding learning environment for advancing robotics and automation research.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16607">Data Mixture Inference: What do BPE Tokenizers Reveal about their Training Data?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonathan Hayase, Alisa Liu, Yejin Choi, Sewoong Oh, Noah A. Smith</p>
<p>Abstract: The pretraining data of today's strongest language models is opaque. In particular, little is known about the proportions of various domains or languages represented. In this work, we tackle a task which we call data mixture inference, which aims to uncover the distributional make-up of training data. We introduce a novel attack based on a previously overlooked source of information -- byte-pair encoding (BPE) tokenizers, used by the vast majority of modern language models. Our key insight is that the ordered list of merge rules learned by a BPE tokenizer naturally reveals information about the token frequencies in its training data: the first merge is the most common byte pair, the second is the most common pair after merging the first token, and so on. Given a tokenizer's merge list along with data samples for each category of interest, we formulate a linear program that solves for the proportion of each category in the tokenizer's training set. Importantly, to the extent to which tokenizer training data is representative of the pretraining data, we indirectly learn about the pretraining data. In controlled experiments, we show that our attack recovers mixture ratios with high precision for tokenizers trained on known mixtures of natural languages, programming languages, and data sources. We then apply our approach to off-the-shelf tokenizers released with recent LMs. We confirm much publicly disclosed information about these models, and also make several new inferences: GPT-4o's tokenizer is much more multilingual than its predecessors, training on 39% non-English data; Llama3 extends GPT-3.5's tokenizer primarily for multilingual (48%) use; GPT-3.5's and Claude's tokenizers are trained on predominantly code (~60%). We hope our work sheds light on current design practices for pretraining data, and inspires continued research into data mixture inference for LMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Annotation and classification of legal text are central components of empirical legal research. Traditionally, these tasks are often delegated to trained research assistants. Motivated by the advances in language modeling, empirical legal scholars are increasingly turning to prompting commercial models, hoping that it will alleviate the significant cost of human annotation. Despite growing use, our understanding of how to best utilize large language models for legal tasks remains limited. We conduct a comprehensive study of 260 legal text classification tasks, nearly all new to the machine learning community. Starting from GPT-4 as a baseline, we show that it has non-trivial but highly varied zero-shot accuracy, often exhibiting performance that may be insufficient for legal work. We then demonstrate that a lightly fine-tuned Llama 3 model vastly outperforms GPT-4 on almost all tasks, typically by double-digit percentage points. We find that larger models respond better to fine-tuning than smaller models. A few tens to hundreds of examples suffice to achieve high classification accuracy. Notably, we can fine-tune a single model on all 260 tasks simultaneously at a small loss in accuracy relative to having a separate model for each task. Our work points to a viable alternative to the predominant practice of prompting commercial models. For concrete legal tasks with some available labeled data, researchers are better off using a fine-tuned open-source model.</p>

<p>Abstract: The risk of harmful content generated by large language models (LLMs) becomes a critical concern. This paper presents a systematic study on assessing and improving LLMs' capability to perform the task of \textbf{course-correction}, \ie, the model can steer away from generating harmful content autonomously. To start with, we introduce the \textsc{C$^2$-Eval} benchmark for quantitative assessment and analyze 10 popular LLMs, revealing varying proficiency of current safety-tuned LLMs in course-correction. To improve, we propose fine-tuning LLMs with preference learning, emphasizing the preference for timely course-correction. Using an automated pipeline, we create \textsc{C$^2$-Syn}, a synthetic dataset with 750K pairwise preferences, to teach models the concept of timely course-correction through data-driven preference learning. Experiments on 2 LLMs, \textsc{Llama2-Chat 7B} and \textsc{Qwen2 7B}, show that our method effectively enhances course-correction skills without affecting general performance. Additionally, it effectively improves LLMs' safety, particularly in resisting jailbreak attacks.</p>

In the general asymmetric case, we are not aware of any nontrivial estimates on this quantity. Our contribution consists of sharp upper and lower bounds on the optimal error probability in the general case, which recover and sharpen the best known results in the symmetric special case. Since this amounts to estimating the total variation distance between two product distributions, our results also have bearing on this important and challenging problem.</p>

<p>Abstract: Systems for synthesizer sound matching, which automatically set the parameters of a synthesizer to emulate an input sound, have the potential to make the process of synthesizer programming faster and easier for novice and experienced musicians alike, whilst also affording new means of interaction with synthesizers. Considering the enormous variety of synthesizers in the marketplace, and the complexity of many of them, general-purpose sound matching systems that function with minimal knowledge or prior assumptions about the underlying synthesis architecture are particularly desirable. With this in mind, we introduce a synthesizer sound matching model based on the Audio Spectrogram Transformer. We demonstrate the viability of this model by training on a large synthetic dataset of randomly generated samples from the popular Massive synthesizer. We show that this model can reconstruct parameters of samples generated from a set of 16 parameters, highlighting its improved fidelity relative to multi-layer perceptron and convolutional neural network baselines. We also provide audio examples demonstrating the out-of-domain model performance in emulating vocal imitations, and sounds from other synthesizers and musical instruments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lars Ankile, Anthony Simeonov, Idan Shenfeld, Marcel Torne, Pulkit Agrawal</p>
<p>Abstract: Behavior cloning (BC) currently stands as a dominant paradigm for learning real-world visual manipulation. However, in tasks that require locally corrective behaviors like multi-part assembly, learning robust policies purely from human demonstrations remains challenging. Reinforcement learning (RL) can mitigate these limitations by allowing policies to acquire locally corrective behaviors through task reward supervision and exploration. This paper explores the use of RL fine-tuning to improve upon BC-trained policies in precise manipulation tasks. We analyze and overcome technical challenges associated with using RL to directly train policy networks that incorporate modern architectural components like diffusion models and action chunking. We propose training residual policies on top of frozen BC-trained diffusion models using standard policy gradient methods and sparse rewards, an approach we call ResiP (Residual for Precise manipulation). Our experimental results demonstrate that this residual learning framework can significantly improve success rates beyond the base BC-trained models in high-precision assembly tasks by learning corrective actions. We also show that by combining ResiP with teacher-student distillation and visual domain randomization, our method can enable learning real-world policies for robotic assembly directly from RGB images.

<p>Abstract: Despite the availability of international prize-money competitions, scaled vehicles, and simulation environments, research on autonomous racing and the control of sports cars operating close to the limit of handling has been limited by the high costs of vehicle acquisition and management, as well as the limited physics accuracy of open-source simulators.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Florian Mockenhaupt, Joscha Simon Rieber, Shahan Nercessian</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a novel approach for the automatic equalization of individual musical instrument tracks. Our method begins by identifying the instrument present within a source recording in order to choose its corresponding ideal spectrum as a target. Next, the spectral difference between the recording and the target is calculated, and accordingly, an equalizer matching model is used to predict settings for a parametric equalizer. To this end, we build upon a differentiable parametric equalizer matching neural network, demonstrating improvements relative to previously established state-of-the-art. Unlike past approaches, we show how our system naturally allows real-world audio data to be leveraged during the training of our matching model, effectively generating suitably produced training targets in an automated manner mirroring conditions at inference time. Consequently, we illustrate how fine-tuning our matching model on such examples considerably improves parametric equalizer matching performance in real-world scenarios, decreasing mean absolute error by 24% relative to methods relying solely on random parameter sampling techniques as a self-supervised learning strategy. We perform listening tests, and demonstrate that our proposed automatic equalization solution subjectively enhances the tonal characteristics for recordings of common instrument types.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyue Xu, Qinyuan Ye, Xiang Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Lifelong ICL, a problem setting that challenges long-context language models (LMs) to learn from a sequence of language tasks through in-context learning (ICL). We further introduce Task Haystack, an evaluation suite dedicated to assessing and diagnosing how long-context LMs utilizes contexts in Lifelong ICL. When given a task instruction and test inputs, long-context LMs are expected to leverage the relevant demonstrations in the Lifelong ICL prompt, avoid distraction and interference from other tasks, and achieve test accuracies that are not significantly worse than the Single-task ICL baseline.
  Task Haystack draws inspiration from the widely-adopted "needle-in-a-haystack" (NIAH) evaluation, but presents new and unique challenges. It demands that models (1) utilize the contexts with deeper understanding, rather than resorting to simple copying and pasting; (2) navigate through long streams of evolving topics and tasks, which closely approximates the complexities of real-world usage of long-context LMs. Additionally, Task Haystack inherits the controllability aspect of NIAH, providing model developers with tools and visualizations to identify model vulnerabilities effectively.
  We benchmark 12 long-context LMs using Task Haystack. We find that state-of-the-art closed models such as GPT-4o still struggle in this setting, failing 15% of the cases on average, while all open-weight models we evaluate further lack behind by a large margin, failing up to 61% of the cases. In our controlled analysis, we identify factors such as distraction and recency bias as contributors to these failure cases. Further, we observe declines in performance when task instructions are paraphrased at test time or when ICL demonstrations are repeated excessively, raising concerns about the robustness, instruction understanding, and true context utilization of current long-context LMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chulin Xie, De-An Huang, Wenda Chu, Daguang Xu, Chaowei Xiao, Bo Li, Anima Anandkumar</p>
<p>Abstract: Personalized Federated Learning (pFL) has emerged as a promising solution to tackle data heterogeneity across clients in FL. However, existing pFL methods either (1) introduce high communication and computation costs or (2) overfit to local data, which can be limited in scope, and are vulnerable to evolved test samples with natural shifts. In this paper, we propose PerAda, a parameter-efficient pFL framework that reduces communication and computational costs and exhibits superior generalization performance, especially under test-time distribution shifts. PerAda reduces the costs by leveraging the power of pretrained models and only updates and communicates a small number of additional parameters from adapters. PerAda has good generalization since it regularizes each client's personalized adapter with a global adapter, while the global adapter uses knowledge distillation to aggregate generalized information from all clients. Theoretically, we provide generalization bounds to explain why PerAda improves generalization, and we prove its convergence to stationary points under non-convex settings. Empirically, PerAda demonstrates competitive personalized performance (+4.85% on CheXpert) and enables better out-of-distribution generalization (+5.23% on CIFAR-10-C) on different datasets across natural and medical domains compared with baselines, while only updating 12.6% of parameters per model based on the adapter.

<p><b>Authors:</b> O\u{g}uz Kaan Y\"uksel, Etienne Boursier, Nicolas Flammarion</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to its empirical success in few-shot classification and reinforcement learning, meta-learning has recently received significant interest. Meta-learning methods leverage data from previous tasks to learn a new task in a sample-efficient manner. In particular, model-agnostic methods look for initialization points from which gradient descent quickly adapts to any new task. Although it has been empirically suggested that such methods perform well by learning shared representations during pretraining, there is limited theoretical evidence of such behavior. More importantly, it has not been shown that these methods still learn a shared structure, despite architectural misspecifications. In this direction, this work shows, in the limit of an infinite number of tasks, that first-order ANIL with a linear two-layer network architecture successfully learns linear shared representations. This result even holds with overparametrization; having a width larger than the dimension of the shared representations results in an asymptotically low-rank solution. The learned solution then yields a good adaptation performance on any new task after a single gradient step. Overall, this illustrates how well model-agnostic methods such as first-order ANIL can learn shared representations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhimeng Guo, Teng Xiao, Zongyu Wu, Charu Aggarwal, Hui Liu, Suhang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph-structured data are pervasive in the real-world such as social networks, molecular graphs and transaction networks. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved great success in representation learning on graphs, facilitating various downstream tasks. However, GNNs have several drawbacks such as lacking interpretability, can easily inherit the bias of data and cannot model casual relations. Recently, counterfactual learning on graphs has shown promising results in alleviating these drawbacks. Various approaches have been proposed for counterfactual fairness, explainability, link prediction and other applications on graphs. To facilitate the development of this promising direction, in this survey, we categorize and comprehensively review papers on graph counterfactual learning. We divide existing methods into four categories based on problems studied. For each category, we provide background and motivating examples, a general framework summarizing existing works and a detailed review of these works. We point out promising future research directions at the intersection of graph-structured data, counterfactual learning, and real-world applications. To offer a comprehensive view of resources for future studies, we compile a collection of open-source implementations, public datasets, and commonly-used evaluation metrics. This survey aims to serve as a ``one-stop-shop'' for building a unified understanding of graph counterfactual learning categories and current resources. We also maintain a repository for papers and resources and will keep updating the repository https://github.com/TimeLovercc/Awesome-Graph-Causal-Learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Ishaq, Sana Zahir, Laila Iftikhar, Mohammad Farhad Bulbul, Seungmin Rho, Mi Young Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: In order to predict and fill in the gaps in categorical datasets, this research looked into the use of machine learning algorithms. The emphasis was on ensemble models constructed using the Error Correction Output Codes framework, including models based on SVM and KNN as well as a hybrid classifier that combines models based on SVM, KNN,and MLP. Three diverse datasets, the CPU, Hypothyroid, and Breast Cancer datasets were employed to validate these algorithms. Results indicated that these machine learning techniques provided substantial performance in predicting and completing missing data, with the effectiveness varying based on the specific dataset and missing data pattern. Compared to solo models, ensemble models that made use of the ECOC framework significantly improved prediction accuracy and robustness. Deep learning for missing data imputation has obstacles despite these encouraging results, including the requirement for large amounts of labeled data and the possibility of overfitting. Subsequent research endeavors ought to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of deep learning algorithms in the context of the imputation of missing data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Egor Cherepanov, Alexey Staroverov, Dmitry Yudin, Alexey K. Kovalev, Aleksandr I. Panov</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, the use of transformers in offline reinforcement learning has become a rapidly developing area. This is due to their ability to treat the agent's trajectory in the environment as a sequence, thereby reducing the policy learning problem to sequence modeling. In environments where the agent's decisions depend on past events (POMDPs), capturing both the event itself and the decision point in the context of the model is essential. However, the quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism limits the potential for context expansion. One solution to this problem is to enhance transformers with memory mechanisms. This paper proposes a Recurrent Action Transformer with Memory (RATE), a novel model architecture incorporating a recurrent memory mechanism designed to regulate information retention. To evaluate our model, we conducted extensive experiments on memory-intensive environments (ViZDoom-Two-Colors, T-Maze, Memory Maze, Minigrid.Memory), classic Atari games and MuJoCo control environments. The results show that using memory can significantly improve performance in memory-intensive environments while maintaining or improving results in classic environments. We hope our findings will stimulate research on memory mechanisms for transformers applicable to offline reinforcement learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Xu, Yunming Liao, Hongli Xu, Zhipeng Sun, Liusheng Huang, Chunming Qiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged to allow multiple clients to collaboratively train machine learning models on their private data at the network edge. However, training and deploying large-scale models on resource-constrained devices is challenging. Fortunately, Split Federated Learning (SFL) offers a feasible solution by alleviating the computation and/or communication burden on clients. However, existing SFL works often assume sufficient labeled data on clients, which is usually impractical. Besides, data non-IIDness poses another challenge to ensure efficient model training. To our best knowledge, the above two issues have not been simultaneously addressed in SFL. Herein, we propose a novel Semi-supervised SFL system, termed SemiSFL, which incorporates clustering regularization to perform SFL with unlabeled and non-IID client data. Moreover, our theoretical and experimental investigations into model convergence reveal that the inconsistent training processes on labeled and unlabeled data have an influence on the effectiveness of clustering regularization. To mitigate the training inconsistency, we develop an algorithm for dynamically adjusting the global updating frequency, so as to improve training performance. Extensive experiments on benchmark models and datasets show that our system provides a 3.8x speed-up in training time, reduces the communication cost by about 70.3% while reaching the target accuracy, and achieves up to 5.8% improvement in accuracy under non-IID scenarios compared to the state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haokun Chen, Denis Krompass, Jindong Gu, Volker Tresp</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning (ML) paradigm, in which multiple clients collaboratively train ML models without centralizing their local data. Similar to conventional ML pipelines, the client local optimization and server aggregation procedure in FL are sensitive to the hyperparameter (HP) selection. Despite extensive research on tuning HPs for centralized ML, these methods yield suboptimal results when employed in FL. This is mainly because their "training-after-tuning" framework is unsuitable for FL with limited client computation power. While some approaches have been proposed for HP-Tuning in FL, they are limited to the HPs for client local updates. In this work, we propose a novel HP-tuning algorithm, called Federated Population-based Hyperparameter Tuning (FedPop), to address this vital yet challenging problem. FedPop employs population-based evolutionary algorithms to optimize the HPs, which accommodates various HP types at both the client and server sides. Compared with prior tuning methods, FedPop employs an online "tuning-while-training" framework, offering computational efficiency and enabling the exploration of a broader HP search space. Our empirical validation on the common FL benchmarks and complex real-world FL datasets, including full-sized Non-IID ImageNet-1K, demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method, which substantially outperforms the concurrent state-of-the-art HP-tuning methods in FL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nima Taghipourbazargani, Lalitha Sankar, Oliver Kosut</p>
<p>Abstract: Event identification is increasingly recognized as crucial for enhancing the reliability, security, and stability of the electric power system. With the growing deployment of Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) and advancements in data science, there are promising opportunities to explore data-driven event identification via machine learning classification techniques. However, obtaining accurately-labeled eventful PMU data samples remains challenging due to its labor-intensive nature and uncertainty about the event type (class) in real-time. Thus, it is natural to use semi-supervised learning techniques, which make use of both labeled and unlabeled samples. %We propose a novel semi-supervised framework to assess the effectiveness of incorporating unlabeled eventful samples to enhance existing event identification methodologies. We evaluate three categories of classical semi-supervised approaches: (i) self-training, (ii) transductive support vector machines (TSVM), and (iii) graph-based label spreading (LS) method. Our approach characterizes events using physically interpretable features extracted from modal analysis of synthetic eventful PMU data. In particular, we focus on the identification of four event classes whose identification is crucial for grid operations. We have developed and publicly shared a comprehensive Event Identification package which consists of three aspects: data generation, feature extraction, and event identification with limited labels using semi-supervised methodologies. Using this package, we generate and evaluate eventful PMU data for the South Carolina synthetic network. Our evaluation consistently demonstrates that graph-based LS outperforms the other two semi-supervised methods that we consider, and can noticeably improve event identification performance relative to the setting with only a small number of labeled samples.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14496">Era Splitting: Invariant Learning for Decision Trees</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Timothy DeLise</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-life machine learning problems exhibit distributional shifts in the data from one time to another or from one place to another. This behavior is beyond the scope of the traditional empirical risk minimization paradigm, which assumes i.i.d. distribution of data over time and across locations. The emerging field of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization addresses this reality with new theory and algorithms which incorporate "environmental", or "era-wise" information into the algorithms. So far, most research has been focused on linear models and/or neural networks . In this research we develop two new splitting criteria for decision trees, which allow us to apply ideas from OOD generalization research to decision tree models, namely, gradient boosting decision trees (GBDTs). The new splitting criteria use era-wise information associated with the data to grow tree-based models that are optimal across all disjoint eras in the data, instead of optimal over the entire data set pooled together, which is the default setting. In this paper, two new splitting criteria are defined and analyzed theoretically. Effectiveness is tested on four experiments, ranging from simple, synthetic to complex, real-world applications. In particular we cast the OOD domain-adaptation problem in the context of financial markets, where the new models out-perform state-of-the-art GBDT models on the Numerai data set. The new criteria are incorporated into the Scikit-Learn code base and made freely available online.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marvin Schmitt, Desi R. Ivanova, Daniel Habermann, Ullrich K\"othe, Paul-Christian B\"urkner, Stefan T. Radev</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a method to improve the efficiency and accuracy of amortized Bayesian inference by leveraging universal symmetries in the joint probabilistic model of parameters and data. In a nutshell, we invert Bayes' theorem and estimate the marginal likelihood based on approximate representations of the joint model. Upon perfect approximation, the marginal likelihood is constant across all parameter values by definition. However, errors in approximate inference lead to undesirable variance in the marginal likelihood estimates across different parameter values. We penalize violations of this symmetry with a \textit{self-consistency loss} which significantly improves the quality of approximate inference in low data regimes and can be used to augment the training of popular neural density estimators. We apply our method to a number of synthetic problems and realistic scientific models, discovering notable advantages in the context of both neural posterior and likelihood approximation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dominik Hintersdorf, Lukas Struppek, Daniel Neider, Kristian Kersting</p>
<p>Abstract: The proliferation of large AI models trained on uncurated, often sensitive web-scraped data has raised significant privacy concerns. One of the concerns is that adversaries can extract information about the training data using privacy attacks. Unfortunately, the task of removing specific information from the models without sacrificing performance is not straightforward and has proven to be challenging. We propose a rather easy yet effective defense based on backdoor attacks to remove private information, such as names and faces of individuals, from vision-language models by fine-tuning them for only a few minutes instead of re-training them from scratch. Specifically, by strategically inserting backdoors into text encoders, we align the embeddings of sensitive phrases with those of neutral terms-"a person" instead of the person's actual name. For image encoders, we map individuals' embeddings to be removed from the model to a universal, anonymous embedding. The results of our extensive experimental evaluation demonstrate the effectiveness of our backdoor-based defense on CLIP by assessing its performance using a specialized privacy attack for zero-shot classifiers. Our approach provides a new "dual-use" perspective on backdoor attacks and presents a promising avenue to enhance the privacy of individuals within models trained on uncurated web-scraped data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Out-of-distribution generalization in neural networks is often hampered by spurious correlations. A common strategy is to mitigate this by removing spurious concepts from the neural network representation of the data. Existing concept-removal methods tend to be overzealous by inadvertently eliminating features associated with the main task of the model, thereby harming model performance. We propose an iterative algorithm that separates spurious from main-task concepts by jointly identifying two low-dimensional orthogonal subspaces in the neural network representation. We evaluate the algorithm on benchmark datasets for computer vision (Waterbirds, CelebA) and natural language processing (MultiNLI), and show that it outperforms existing concept removal methods</p>

<p>Abstract: Soft sensors are crucial in bridging autonomous systems' physical and digital realms, enhancing sensor fusion and perception. Instead of deploying soft sensors on the Cloud, this study shift towards employing on-device soft sensors, promising heightened efficiency and bolstering data security. Our approach substantially improves energy efficiency by deploying Artificial Intelligence (AI) directly on devices within a wireless sensor network. Furthermore, the synergistic integration of the Microcontroller Unit and Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) leverages the rapid AI inference capabilities of the latter. Empirical evidence from our real-world use case demonstrates that FPGA-based soft sensors achieve inference times ranging remarkably from 1.04 to 12.04 microseconds. These compelling results highlight the considerable potential of our innovative approach for executing real-time inference tasks efficiently, thereby presenting a feasible alternative that effectively addresses the latency challenges intrinsic to Cloud-based deployments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Second-order methods such as KFAC can be useful for neural net training. However, they are often memory-inefficient since their preconditioning Kronecker factors are dense, and numerically unstable in low precision as they require matrix inversion or decomposition. These limitations render such methods unpopular for modern mixed-precision training. We address them by (i) formulating an inverse-free KFAC update and (ii) imposing structures in the Kronecker factors, resulting in structured inverse-free natural gradient descent (SINGD). On modern neural networks, we show that SINGD is memory-efficient and numerically robust, in contrast to KFAC, and often outperforms AdamW even in half precision. Our work closes a gap between first- and second-order methods in modern low-precision training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ryan Greenblatt, Buck Shlegeris, Kshitij Sachan, Fabien Roger</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become more powerful and are deployed more autonomously, it will be increasingly important to prevent them from causing harmful outcomes. Researchers have investigated a variety of safety techniques for this purpose, e.g. using models to review the outputs of other models, or red-teaming techniques to surface subtle failure modes. However, researchers have not evaluated whether such techniques still ensure safety if the model is itself intentionally trying to subvert them. In this paper, we develop and evaluate pipelines of safety techniques ("protocols") that are robust to intentional subversion.
  We investigate a scenario in which we want to solve a sequence of programming problems, using access to a powerful but untrusted model (in our case, GPT-4), access to a less powerful trusted model (in our case, GPT-3.5), and limited access to high-quality trusted labor. We investigate protocols that aim to never submit solutions containing backdoors, which we operationalize here as logical errors that are not caught by test cases.
  We investigate a range of protocols and test each against strategies that the untrusted model could use to subvert them. One protocol is what we call trusted editing. This protocol first asks GPT-4 to write code, and then asks GPT-3.5 to rate the suspiciousness of that code. If the code is below some suspiciousness threshold, it is submitted. Otherwise, GPT-3.5 edits the solution to remove parts that seem suspicious and then submits the edited code. Another protocol is untrusted monitoring. This protocol asks GPT-4 to write code, and then asks another instance of GPT-4 whether the code is backdoored, using various techniques to prevent the GPT-4 instances from colluding. These protocols improve substantially on simple baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: As neural networks grow in scale, their training becomes both computationally demanding and rich in dynamics. Amidst the flourishing interest in these training dynamics, we present a novel observation: Parameters during training exhibit intrinsic correlations over time. Capitalizing on this, we introduce Correlation Mode Decomposition (CMD). This algorithm clusters the parameter space into groups, termed modes, that display synchronized behavior across epochs. This enables CMD to efficiently represent the training dynamics of complex networks, like ResNets and Transformers, using only a few modes. Moreover, test set generalization is enhanced. We introduce an efficient CMD variant, designed to run concurrently with training. Our experiments indicate that CMD surpasses the state-of-the-art method for compactly modeled dynamics on image classification. Our modeling can improve training efficiency and lower communication overhead, as shown by our preliminary experiments in the context of federated learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elissa Mhanna, Mohamad Assaad</p>
<p>Abstract: Cross-device federated learning (FL) is a growing machine learning setting whereby multiple edge devices collaborate to train a model without disclosing their raw data. With the great number of mobile devices participating in more FL applications via the wireless environment, the practical implementation of these applications will be hindered due to the limited uplink capacity of devices, causing critical bottlenecks. In this work, we propose a novel doubly communication-efficient zero-order (ZO) method with a one-point gradient estimator that replaces communicating long vectors with scalar values and that harnesses the nature of the wireless communication channel, overcoming the need to know the channel state coefficient. It is the first method that includes the wireless channel in the learning algorithm itself instead of wasting resources to analyze it and remove its impact. We then offer a thorough analysis of the proposed zero-order federated learning (ZOFL) framework and prove that our method converges \textit{almost surely}, which is a novel result in nonconvex ZO optimization. We further prove a convergence rate of $O(\frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{K}})$ in the nonconvex setting. We finally demonstrate the potential of our algorithm with experimental results.</p>

Our analysis provides the first no dimensional coresets, so the size does not depend on the dimension. Moreover, our results are general, apply for distributional input and can use iid samples, so provide sample complexity bounds, and work for a variety of loss functions.

<p>Abstract: Multi-objective optimization problems can be found in many real-world applications, where the objectives often conflict each other and cannot be optimized by a single solution. In the past few decades, numerous methods have been proposed to find Pareto solutions that represent optimal trade-offs among the objectives for a given problem. However, these existing methods could have high computational complexity or may not have good theoretical properties for solving a general differentiable multi-objective optimization problem. In this work, by leveraging the smooth optimization technique, we propose a lightweight and efficient smooth Tchebycheff scalarization approach for gradient-based multi-objective optimization. It has good theoretical properties for finding all Pareto solutions with valid trade-off preferences, while enjoying significantly lower computational complexity compared to other methods. Experimental results on various real-world application problems fully demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p>

We also introduce BrowserGym, an environment for the design and evaluation of such agents, offering a rich set of actions as well as multimodal observations. Our empirical evaluation reveals that while current agents show promise on WorkArena, there remains a considerable gap towards achieving full task automation. Notably, our analysis uncovers a significant performance disparity between open and closed-source LLMs, highlighting a critical area for future exploration and development in the field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Rundel, Julius Kobialka, Constantin von Crailsheim, Matthias Feurer, Thomas Nagler, David R\"ugamer</p>
<p>Abstract: The recently developed Prior-Data Fitted Networks (PFNs) have shown very promising results for applications in low-data regimes. The TabPFN model, a special case of PFNs for tabular data, is able to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a variety of classification tasks while producing posterior predictive distributions in mere seconds by in-context learning without the need for learning parameters or hyperparameter tuning. This makes TabPFN a very attractive option for a wide range of domain applications. However, a major drawback of the method is its lack of interpretability. Therefore, we propose several adaptations of popular interpretability methods that we specifically design for TabPFN. By taking advantage of the unique properties of the model, our adaptations allow for more efficient computations than existing implementations. In particular, we show how in-context learning facilitates the estimation of Shapley values by avoiding approximate retraining and enables the use of Leave-One-Covariate-Out (LOCO) even when working with large-scale Transformers. In addition, we demonstrate how data valuation methods can be used to address scalability challenges of TabPFN. Our proposed methods are implemented in a package tabpfn_iml and made available at https://github.com/david-rundel/tabpfn_iml.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Miltiadis Kofinas, Boris Knyazev, Yan Zhang, Yunlu Chen, Gertjan J. Burghouts, Efstratios Gavves, Cees G. M. Snoek, David W. Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural networks that process the parameters of other neural networks find applications in domains as diverse as classifying implicit neural representations, generating neural network weights, and predicting generalization errors. However, existing approaches either overlook the inherent permutation symmetry in the neural network or rely on intricate weight-sharing patterns to achieve equivariance, while ignoring the impact of the network architecture itself. In this work, we propose to represent neural networks as computational graphs of parameters, which allows us to harness powerful graph neural networks and transformers that preserve permutation symmetry. Consequently, our approach enables a single model to encode neural computational graphs with diverse architectures. We showcase the effectiveness of our method on a wide range of tasks, including classification and editing of implicit neural representations, predicting generalization performance, and learning to optimize, while consistently outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhijeet Pendyala, Asma Atamna, Tobias Glasmachers</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a proximal policy optimization (PPO) agent trained through curriculum learning (CL) principles and meticulous reward engineering to optimize a real-world high-throughput waste sorting facility. Our work addresses the challenge of effectively balancing the competing objectives of operational safety, volume optimization, and minimizing resource usage. A vanilla agent trained from scratch on these multiple criteria fails to solve the problem due to its inherent complexities. This problem is particularly difficult due to the environment's extremely delayed rewards with long time horizons and class (or action) imbalance, with important actions being infrequent in the optimal policy. This forces the agent to anticipate long-term action consequences and prioritize rare but rewarding behaviours, creating a non-trivial reinforcement learning task. Our five-stage CL approach tackles these challenges by gradually increasing the complexity of the environmental dynamics during policy transfer while simultaneously refining the reward mechanism. This iterative and adaptable process enables the agent to learn a desired optimal policy. Results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves inference-time safety, achieving near-zero safety violations in addition to enhancing waste sorting plant efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bartlomiej Sobieski, Przemys{\l}aw Biecek</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite increasing progress in development of methods for generating visual counterfactual explanations, especially with the recent rise of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models, previous works consider them as an entirely local technique. In this work, we take the first step at globalizing them. Specifically, we discover that the latent space of Diffusion Autoencoders encodes the inference process of a given classifier in the form of global directions. We propose a novel proxy-based approach that discovers two types of these directions with the use of only single image in an entirely black-box manner. Precisely, g-directions allow for flipping the decision of a given classifier on an entire dataset of images, while h-directions further increase the diversity of explanations. We refer to them in general as Global Counterfactual Directions (GCDs). Moreover, we show that GCDs can be naturally combined with Latent Integrated Gradients resulting in a new black-box attribution method, while simultaneously enhancing the understanding of counterfactual explanations. We validate our approach on existing benchmarks and show that it generalizes to real-world use-cases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qianyu Long, Qiyuan Wang, Christos Anagnostopoulos, Daning Bi</p>
<p>Abstract: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) has become popular due to its robustness and avoidance of centralized coordination. In this paradigm, clients actively engage in training by exchanging models with their networked neighbors. However, DFL introduces increased costs in terms of training and communication. Existing methods focus on minimizing communication often overlooking training efficiency and data heterogeneity. To address this gap, we propose a novel \textit{sparse-to-sparser} training scheme: DA-DPFL. DA-DPFL initializes with a subset of model parameters, which progressively reduces during training via \textit{dynamic aggregation} and leads to substantial energy savings while retaining adequate information during critical learning periods.
  Our experiments showcase that DA-DPFL substantially outperforms DFL baselines in test accuracy, while achieving up to $5$ times reduction in energy costs. We provide a theoretical analysis of DA-DPFL's convergence by solidifying its applicability in decentralized and personalized learning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minyoung Huh, Brian Cheung, Tongzhou Wang, Phillip Isola</p>
<p>Abstract: We argue that representations in AI models, particularly deep networks, are converging. First, we survey many examples of convergence in the literature: over time and across multiple domains, the ways by which different neural networks represent data are becoming more aligned. Next, we demonstrate convergence across data modalities: as vision models and language models get larger, they measure distance between datapoints in a more and more alike way. We hypothesize that this convergence is driving toward a shared statistical model of reality, akin to Plato's concept of an ideal reality. We term such a representation the platonic representation and discuss several possible selective pressures toward it. Finally, we discuss the implications of these trends, their limitations, and counterexamples to our analysis.</p>

Building on the idea of momentum-based acceleration, we develop the Primal-Dual Accelerated Natural Policy Gradient (PD-ANPG) algorithm that guarantees an $\epsilon$ global optimality gap and $\epsilon$ constraint violation with $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$ sample complexity for general parameterized policies. This improves the state-of-the-art sample complexity in general parameterized CMDPs by a factor of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ and achieves the theoretical lower bound.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Claudio Battiloro, Ege Karaismailo\u{g}lu, Mauricio Tec, George Dasoulas, Michelle Audirac, Francesca Dominici</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph neural networks excel at modeling pairwise interactions, but they cannot flexibly accommodate higher-order interactions and features. Topological deep learning (TDL) has emerged recently as a promising tool for addressing this issue. TDL enables the principled modeling of arbitrary multi-way, hierarchical higher-order interactions by operating on combinatorial topological spaces, such as simplicial or cell complexes, instead of graphs. However, little is known about how to leverage geometric features such as positions and velocities for TDL. This paper introduces E(n)-Equivariant Topological Neural Networks (ETNNs), which are E(n)-equivariant message-passing networks operating on combinatorial complexes, formal objects unifying graphs, hypergraphs, simplicial, path, and cell complexes. ETNNs incorporate geometric node features while respecting rotation and translation equivariance. Moreover, ETNNs are natively ready for settings with heterogeneous interactions. We provide a theoretical analysis to show the improved expressiveness of ETNNs over architectures for geometric graphs. We also show how several E(n) equivariant variants of TDL models can be directly derived from our framework. The broad applicability of ETNNs is demonstrated through two tasks of vastly different nature: i) molecular property prediction on the QM9 benchmark and ii) land-use regression for hyper-local estimation of air pollution with multi-resolution irregular geospatial data. The experiment results indicate that ETNNs are an effective tool for learning from diverse types of richly structured data, highlighting the benefits of principled geometric inductive bias.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep learning benefits from the growing abundance of available data. Meanwhile, efficiently dealing with the growing data scale has become a challenge. Data publicly available are from different sources with various qualities, and it is impractical to do manual cleaning against noise and redundancy given today's data scale. There are existing techniques for cleaning/selecting the collected data. However, these methods are mainly proposed for offline settings that target one of the cleanness and redundancy problems. In practice, data are growing exponentially with both problems. This leads to repeated data curation with sub-optimal efficiency. To tackle this challenge, we propose InfoGrowth, an efficient online algorithm for data cleaning and selection, resulting in a growing dataset that keeps up to date with awareness of cleanliness and diversity. InfoGrowth can improve data quality/efficiency on both single-modal and multi-modal tasks, with an efficient and scalable design. Its framework makes it practical for real-world data engines.</p>

<p>Abstract: There is a recent boom in the development of AI solutions to facilitate and enhance diagnostic procedures for established clinical tools. To assess the integrity of the developing nervous system, the Prechtl general movement assessment (GMA) is recognized for its clinical value in diagnosing neurological impairments in early infancy. GMA has been increasingly augmented through machine learning approaches intending to scale-up its application, circumvent costs in the training of human assessors and further standardize classification of spontaneous motor patterns. Available deep learning tools, all of which are based on single sensor modalities, are however still considerably inferior to that of well-trained human assessors. These approaches are hardly comparable as all models are designed, trained and evaluated on proprietary/silo-data sets. With this study we propose a sensor fusion approach for assessing fidgety movements (FMs) comparing three different sensor modalities (pressure, inertial, and visual sensors). Various combinations and two sensor fusion approaches (late and early fusion) for infant movement classification were tested to evaluate whether a multi-sensor system outperforms single modality assessments. The performance of the three-sensor fusion (classification accuracy of 94.5\%) was significantly higher than that of any single modality evaluated, suggesting the sensor fusion approach is a promising avenue for automated classification of infant motor patterns. The development of a robust sensor fusion system may significantly enhance AI-based early recognition of neurofunctions, ultimately facilitating automated early detection of neurodevelopmental conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tao Li, Weisen Jiang, Fanghui Liu, Xiaolin Huang, James T. Kwok</p>
<p>Abstract: Pre-training followed by fine-tuning is widely adopted among practitioners. The performance can be improved by "model soups"~\cite{wortsman2022model} via exploring various hyperparameter configurations.The Learned-Soup, a variant of model soups, significantly improves the performance but suffers from substantial memory and time costs due to the requirements of (i) having to load all fine-tuned models simultaneously, and (ii) a large computational graph encompassing all fine-tuned models. In this paper, we propose Memory Efficient Hyperplane Learned Soup (MEHL-Soup) to tackle this issue by formulating the learned soup as a hyperplane optimization problem and introducing block coordinate gradient descent to learn the mixing coefficients. At each iteration, MEHL-Soup only needs to load a few fine-tuned models and build a computational graph with one combined model. We further extend MEHL-Soup to MEHL-Soup+ in a layer-wise manner. Experimental results on various ViT models and data sets show that MEHL-Soup(+) outperforms Learned-Soup(+) in terms of test accuracy, and also reduces memory usage by more than $13\times$. Moreover, MEHL-Soup(+) can be run on a single GPU and achieves $9\times$ speed up in soup construction compared with the Learned-Soup. The code is released at https://github.com/nblt/MEHL-Soup.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent work has established an alternative to traditional multi-layer perceptron neural networks in the form of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN). The general KAN framework uses learnable activation functions on the edges of the computational graph followed by summation on nodes. The learnable edge activation functions in the original implementation are basis spline functions (B-Spline). Here, we present a model in which learnable grids of B-Spline activation functions are replaced by grids of re-weighted sine functions. We show that this leads to better or comparable numerical performance to B-Spline KAN models on the MNIST benchmark, while also providing a substantial speed increase on the order of 4-8 times.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmad Naser Eddin, Jacopo Bono, David Apar\'icio, Hugo Ferreira, Pedro Ribeiro, Pedro Bizarro</p>
<p>Abstract: Continuous-time dynamic graphs (CTDGs) are essential for modeling interconnected, evolving systems. Traditional methods for extracting knowledge from these graphs often depend on feature engineering or deep learning. Feature engineering is limited by the manual and time-intensive nature of crafting features, while deep learning approaches suffer from high inference latency, making them impractical for real-time applications. This paper introduces Deep-Graph-Sprints (DGS), a novel deep learning architecture designed for efficient representation learning on CTDGs with low-latency inference requirements. We benchmark DGS against state-of-the-art feature engineering and graph neural network methods using five diverse datasets. The results indicate that DGS achieves competitive performance while improving inference speed up to 12x compared to other deep learning approaches on our tested benchmarks. Our method effectively bridges the gap between deep representation learning and low-latency application requirements for CTDGs.</p>

<p>Abstract: We revisit the effectiveness of topological descriptors for molecular graph classification and design a simple, yet strong baseline. We demonstrate that a simple approach to feature engineering - employing histogram aggregation of edge descriptors and one-hot encoding for atomic numbers and bond types - when combined with a Random Forest classifier, can establish a strong baseline for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The novel algorithm, Molecular Topological Profile (MOLTOP), integrates Edge Betweenness Centrality, Adjusted Rand Index and SCAN Structural Similarity score. This approach proves to be remarkably competitive when compared to modern GNNs, while also being simple, fast, low-variance and hyperparameter-free. Our approach is rigorously tested on MoleculeNet datasets using fair evaluation protocol provided by Open Graph Benchmark. We additionally show out-of-domain generation capabilities on peptide classification task from Long Range Graph Benchmark. The evaluations across eleven benchmark datasets reveal MOLTOP's strong discriminative capabilities, surpassing the $1$-WL test and even $3$-WL test for some classes of graphs. Our conclusion is that descriptor-based baselines, such as the one we propose, are still crucial for accurately assessing advancements in the GNN domain.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces LiNR, LinkedIn's large-scale, GPU-based retrieval system. LiNR supports a billion-sized index on GPU models. We discuss our experiences and challenges in creating scalable, differentiable search indexes using TensorFlow and PyTorch at production scale. In LiNR, both items and model weights are integrated into the model binary. Viewing index construction as a form of model training, we describe scaling our system for large indexes, incorporating full scans and efficient filtering. A key focus is on enabling attribute-based pre-filtering for exhaustive GPU searches, addressing the common challenge of post-filtering in KNN searches that often reduces system quality. We further provide multi-embedding retrieval algorithms and strategies for tackling cold start issues in retrieval. Our advancements in supporting larger indexes through quantization are also discussed. We believe LiNR represents one of the industry's first Live-updated model-based retrieval indexes. Applied to out-of-network post recommendations on LinkedIn Feed, LiNR has contributed to a 3% relative increase in professional daily active users. We envisage LiNR as a step towards integrating retrieval and ranking into a single GPU model, simplifying complex infrastructures and enabling end-to-end optimization of the entire differentiable infrastructure through gradient descent.</p>

<p>Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neuro-developmental challenge, presenting a spectrum of difficulties in social interaction, communication, and the expression of repetitive behaviors in different situations. This increasing prevalence underscores the importance of ASD as a major public health concern and the need for comprehensive research initiatives to advance our understanding of the disorder and its early detection methods. This study introduces a novel hierarchical feature fusion method aimed at enhancing the early detection of ASD in children through the analysis of code-switched speech (English and Hindi). Employing advanced audio processing techniques, the research integrates acoustic, paralinguistic, and linguistic information using Transformer Encoders. This innovative fusion strategy is designed to improve classification robustness and accuracy, crucial for early and precise ASD identification. The methodology involves collecting a code-switched speech corpus, CoSAm, from children diagnosed with ASD and a matched control group. The dataset comprises 61 voice recordings from 30 children diagnosed with ASD and 31 from neurotypical children, aged between 3 and 13 years, resulting in a total of 159.75 minutes of voice recordings. The feature analysis focuses on MFCCs and extensive statistical attributes to capture speech pattern variability and complexity. The best model performance is achieved using a hierarchical fusion technique with an accuracy of 98.75% using a combination of acoustic and linguistic features first, followed by paralinguistic features in a hierarchical manner.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback plays a crucial role in aligning language models towards human preferences, traditionally represented through comparisons between pairs or sets of responses within a given context. While many studies have enhanced algorithmic techniques to optimize learning from such data, this work shifts focus to improving preference learning through a data-centric approach. Specifically, we propose enriching existing preference datasets with machine-generated rationales that explain the reasons behind choices. We develop a simple and principled framework to augment current preference learning methods with rationale information. Our comprehensive analysis highlights how rationales enhance learning efficiency. Extensive experiments reveal that rationale-enriched preference learning offers multiple advantages: it improves data efficiency, accelerates convergence to higher-performing models, and reduces verbosity bias and hallucination. Furthermore, this framework is versatile enough to integrate with various preference optimization algorithms. Overall, our findings highlight the potential of re-imagining data design for preference learning, demonstrating that even freely available machine-generated rationales can significantly boost performance across multiple dimensions.

<p>Abstract: Evaluating the contribution of individual data points to a model's prediction is critical for interpreting model predictions and improving model performance. Existing data contribution methods have been applied to various data types, including tabular data, images, and texts; however, their primary focus has been on i.i.d. settings. Despite the pressing need for principled approaches tailored to time series datasets, the problem of estimating data contribution in such settings remains unexplored, possibly due to challenges associated with handling inherent temporal dependencies. This paper introduces TimeInf, a data contribution estimation method for time-series datasets. TimeInf uses influence functions to attribute model predictions to individual time points while preserving temporal structures. Our extensive empirical results demonstrate that TimeInf outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identifying harmful anomalies and helpful time points for forecasting. Additionally, TimeInf offers intuitive and interpretable attributions of data values, allowing us to easily distinguish diverse anomaly patterns through visualizations.</p>

To solve this problem, we embed a Large Language Model (LLM) as knowledge into the GNN explanation network to avoid the learning bias problem.

We conduct experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The innovation of our work lies in two parts: 1. We provide a novel view of the possibility of an LLM functioning as a Bayesian inference to improve the performance of existing algorithms; 2. We are the first to discuss the learning bias issues in the GNN explanation problem.</p>

However, sharpness involves problem-specific constants that are typically unknown, and restart schemes typically reduce convergence rates. Moreover, these schemes are challenging to apply in the presence of noise or with approximate model classes (e.g., in compressive imaging or learning problems), and they generally assume that the first-order method used produces feasible iterates. We consider the assumption of approximate sharpness, a generalization of sharpness that incorporates an unknown constant perturbation to the objective function error. This constant offers greater robustness (e.g., with respect to noise or relaxation of model classes) for finding approximate minimizers. By employing a new type of search over the unknown constants, we design a restart scheme that applies to general first-order methods and does not require the first-order method to produce feasible iterates. Our scheme maintains the same convergence rate as when the constants are known. The convergence rates we achieve for various first-order methods match the optimal rates or improve on previously established rates for a wide range of problems. We showcase our restart scheme in several examples and highlight potential future applications and developments of our framework and theory.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Zhang, Zhewei Wei, Ye Yuan, Chongxuan Li, Wenbing Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Predicting the binding sites of target proteins plays a fundamental role in drug discovery. Most existing deep-learning methods consider a protein as a 3D image by spatially clustering its atoms into voxels and then feed the voxelized protein into a 3D CNN for prediction. However, the CNN-based methods encounter several critical issues: 1) defective in representing irregular protein structures; 2) sensitive to rotations; 3) insufficient to characterize the protein surface; 4) unaware of protein size shift. To address the above issues, this work proposes EquiPocket, an E(3)-equivariant Graph Neural Network (GNN) for binding site prediction, which comprises three modules: the first one to extract local geometric information for each surface atom, the second one to model both the chemical and spatial structure of protein and the last one to capture the geometry of the surface via equivariant message passing over the surface atoms. We further propose a dense attention output layer to alleviate the effect incurred by variable protein size. Extensive experiments on several representative benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our framework to the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kilian Zepf, Selma Wanna, Marco Miani, Juston Moore, Jes Frellsen, S{\o}ren Hauberg, Frederik Warburg, Aasa Feragen</p>
<p>Abstract: Image segmentation relies heavily on neural networks which are known to be overconfident, especially when making predictions on out-of-distribution (OOD) images. This is a common scenario in the medical domain due to variations in equipment, acquisition sites, or image corruptions. This work addresses the challenge of OOD detection by proposing Laplacian Segmentation Networks (LSN): methods which jointly model epistemic (model) and aleatoric (data) uncertainty for OOD detection. In doing so, we propose the first Laplace approximation of the weight posterior that scales to large neural networks with skip connections that have high-dimensional outputs. We demonstrate on three datasets that the LSN-modeled parameter distributions, in combination with suitable uncertainty measures, gives superior OOD detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicholas Konz, Haoyu Dong, Maciej A. Mazurowski</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated tumor detection in Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) is a difficult task due to natural tumor rarity, breast tissue variability, and high resolution. Given the scarcity of abnormal images and the abundance of normal images for this problem, an anomaly detection/localization approach could be well-suited. However, most anomaly localization research in machine learning focuses on non-medical datasets, and we find that these methods fall short when adapted to medical imaging datasets. The problem is alleviated when we solve the task from the image completion perspective, in which the presence of anomalies can be indicated by a discrepancy between the original appearance and its auto-completion conditioned on the surroundings. However, there are often many valid normal completions given the same surroundings, especially in the DBT dataset, making this evaluation criterion less precise. To address such an issue, we consider pluralistic image completion by exploring the distribution of possible completions instead of generating fixed predictions. This is achieved through our novel application of spatial dropout on the completion network during inference time only, which requires no additional training cost and is effective at generating diverse completions. We further propose minimum completion distance (MCD), a new metric for detecting anomalies, thanks to these stochastic completions. We provide theoretical as well as empirical support for the superiority over existing methods of using the proposed method for anomaly localization. On the DBT dataset, our model outperforms other state-of-the-art methods by at least 10\% AUROC for pixel-level detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jason M. Klusowski, Jonathan W. Siegel</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the fundamental limits of matching pursuit, or the pure greedy algorithm, for approximating a target function $ f $ by a linear combination $f_n$ of $n$ elements from a dictionary. When the target function is contained in the variation space corresponding to the dictionary, many impressive works over the past few decades have obtained upper and lower bounds on the error $\|f-f_n\|$ of matching pursuit, but they do not match. The main contribution of this paper is to close this gap and obtain a sharp characterization of the decay rate, $n^{-\alpha}$, of matching pursuit. Specifically, we construct a worst case dictionary which shows that the existing best upper bound cannot be significantly improved. It turns out that, unlike other greedy algorithm variants which converge at the optimal rate $ n^{-1/2}$, the convergence rate $n^{-\alpha}$ is suboptimal. Here, $\alpha \approx 0.182$ is determined by the solution to a certain non-linear equation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andreas Loukas, Pan Kessel, Vladimir Gligorijevic, Richard Bonneau</p>
<p>Abstract: In silico screening uses predictive models to select a batch of compounds with favorable properties from a library for experimental validation. Unlike conventional learning paradigms, success in this context is measured by the performance of the predictive model on the selected subset of compounds rather than the entire set of predictions. By extending learning theory, we show that the selectivity of the selection policy can significantly impact generalization, with a higher risk of errors occurring when exclusively selecting predicted positives and when targeting rare properties. Our analysis suggests a way to mitigate these challenges. We show that generalization can be markedly enhanced when considering a model's ability to predict the fraction of desired outcomes in a batch. This is promising, as the primary aim of screening is not necessarily to pinpoint the label of each compound individually, but rather to assemble a batch enriched for desirable compounds. Our theoretical insights are empirically validated across diverse tasks, architectures, and screening scenarios, underscoring their applicability.</p>

<p>Abstract: The morphology and distribution of airway tree abnormalities enables diagnosis and disease characterisation across a variety of chronic respiratory conditions. In this regard, airway segmentation plays a critical role in the production of the outline of the entire airway tree to enable estimation of disease extent and severity. In this study, we propose a data-centric deep learning technique to segment the airway tree. The proposed technique utilises interpolation and image split to improve data usefulness and quality. Then, an ensemble learning strategy is implemented to aggregate the segmented airway trees at different scales. In terms of segmentation performance (dice similarity coefficient), our method outperforms the baseline model by 2.5% on average when a combined loss is used. Further, our proposed technique has a low GPU usage and high flexibility enabling it to be deployed on any 2D deep learning model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas Power, Dmitry Berenson</p>
<p>Abstract: We present Constrained Stein Variational Trajectory Optimization (CSVTO), an algorithm for performing trajectory optimization with constraints on a set of trajectories in parallel. We frame constrained trajectory optimization as a novel form of constrained functional minimization over trajectory distributions, which avoids treating the constraints as a penalty in the objective and allows us to generate diverse sets of constraint-satisfying trajectories. Our method uses Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) to find a set of particles that approximates a distribution over low-cost trajectories while obeying constraints. CSVTO is applicable to problems with differentiable equality and inequality constraints and includes a novel particle re-sampling step to escape local minima. By explicitly generating diverse sets of trajectories, CSVTO is better able to avoid poor local minima and is more robust to initialization. We demonstrate that CSVTO outperforms baselines in challenging highly-constrained tasks, such as a 7DoF wrench manipulation task, where CSVTO outperforms all baselines both in success and constraint satisfaction.</p>

<p>Abstract: Fetal brain MRI is becoming an increasingly relevant complement to neurosonography for perinatal diagnosis, allowing fundamental insights into fetal brain development throughout gestation. However, uncontrolled fetal motion and heterogeneity in acquisition protocols lead to data of variable quality, potentially biasing the outcome of subsequent studies. We present FetMRQC, an open-source machine-learning framework for automated image quality assessment and quality control that is robust to domain shifts induced by the heterogeneity of clinical data. FetMRQC extracts an ensemble of quality metrics from unprocessed anatomical MRI and combines them to predict experts' ratings using random forests. We validate our framework on a pioneeringly large and diverse dataset of more than 1600 manually rated fetal brain T2-weighted images from four clinical centers and 13 different scanners. Our study shows that FetMRQC's predictions generalize well to unseen data while being interpretable. FetMRQC is a step towards more robust fetal brain neuroimaging, which has the potential to shed new insights on the developing human brain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kirill Vishniakov, Zhiqiang Shen, Zhuang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern computer vision offers a great variety of models to practitioners, and selecting a model from multiple options for specific applications can be challenging. Conventionally, competing model architectures and training protocols are compared by their classification accuracy on ImageNet. However, this single metric does not fully capture performance nuances critical for specialized tasks. In this work, we conduct an in-depth comparative analysis of model behaviors beyond ImageNet accuracy, for both ConvNet and Vision Transformer architectures, each across supervised and CLIP training paradigms. Although our selected models have similar ImageNet accuracies and compute requirements, we find that they differ in many other aspects: types of mistakes, output calibration, transferability, and feature invariance, among others. This diversity in model characteristics, not captured by traditional metrics, highlights the need for more nuanced analysis when choosing among different models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kelly Ramsay, Dylan Spicker</p>
<p>Abstract: We develop $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differentially private projection-depth-based medians using the propose-test-release (PTR) and exponential mechanisms. Under general conditions on the input parameters and the population measure, (e.g. we do not assume any moment bounds), we quantify the probability the test in PTR fails, as well as the cost of privacy via finite sample deviation bounds. Next, we show that when some observations are contaminated, the private projection-depth-based median does not break down, provided its input location and scale estimators do not break down. We demonstrate our main results on the canonical projection-depth-based median, as well as on projection-depth-based medians derived from trimmed estimators. In the Gaussian setting, we show that the resulting deviation bound matches the known lower bound for private Gaussian mean estimation. In the Cauchy setting, we show that the ``outlier error amplification'' effect resulting from the heavy tails outweighs the cost of privacy. This result is then verified via numerical simulations. Additionally, we present results on general PTR mechanisms and a uniform concentration result on the projected spacings of order statistics, which may be of general interest.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen Yang, Peng Liang, Zinan Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Stakeholders constantly make assumptions in the development of deep learning (DL) frameworks. These assumptions are related to various types of software artifacts (e.g., requirements, design decisions, and technical debt) and can turn out to be invalid, leading to system failures. Existing approaches and tools for assumption management usually depend on manual identification of assumptions. However, assumptions are scattered in various sources (e.g., code comments, commits, and issues) of DL framework development, and manually identifying assumptions has high costs (e.g., time and resources). The objective of the study is to evaluate different classification models for the purpose of identification with respect to assumptions from the point of view of developers and users in the context of DL framework projects (i.e., issues, pull requests, and commits) on GitHub. We constructed a new and largest dataset (i.e., AssuEval) of assumptions collected from the TensorFlow and Keras repositories on GitHub; explored the performance of seven non-transformers based models (e.g., Support Vector Machine, Classification and Regression Trees), the ALBERT model, and three large language models (i.e., ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini) for identifying assumptions on the AssuEval dataset. The study results show that ALBERT achieves the best performance (f1-score: 0.9584) for identifying assumptions on the AssuEval dataset, which is much better than the other models (the 2nd best f1-score is 0.8858, achieved by the Claude 3.5 Sonnet model). Though ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini are popular large language models, we do not recommend using them to identify assumptions in DL framework development because of their low performance. This study provides researchers with the largest dataset of assumptions for further research and helps practitioners better understand assumptions and how to manage them in their projects.</p>

<p>Abstract: As the number of accepted papers at AI and ML conferences reaches into the thousands, it has become unclear how researchers access and read research publications. In this paper, we investigate the role of social media influencers in enhancing the visibility of machine learning research, particularly the citation counts of papers they share. We have compiled a comprehensive dataset of over 8,000 papers, spanning tweets from December 2018 to October 2023, alongside controls precisely matched by 9 key covariates. Our statistical and causal inference analysis reveals a significant increase in citations for papers endorsed by these influencers, with median citation counts 2-3 times higher than those of the control group. Additionally, the study delves into the geographic, gender, and institutional diversity of highlighted authors. Given these findings, we advocate for a responsible approach to curation, encouraging influencers to uphold the journalistic standard that includes showcasing diverse research topics, authors, and institutions.</p>

<p>Abstract: We demonstrate the feasibility of integrating physics-based animations of solids and fluids with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to create novel effects in virtual scenes reconstructed using 3DGS. Leveraging the coherence of the Gaussian Splatting and Position-Based Dynamics (PBD) in the underlying representation, we manage rendering, view synthesis, and the dynamics of solids and fluids in a cohesive manner. Similar to GaussianShader, we enhance each Gaussian kernel with an added normal, aligning the kernel's orientation with the surface normal to refine the PBD simulation. This approach effectively eliminates spiky noises that arise from rotational deformation in solids. It also allows us to integrate physically based rendering to augment the dynamic surface reflections on fluids. Consequently, our framework is capable of realistically reproducing surface highlights on dynamic fluids and facilitating interactions between scene objects and fluids from new views.

<p>Abstract: Citywalk, a recently popular form of urban travel, requires genuine personalization and understanding of fine-grained requests compared to traditional itinerary planning.

We then present ITINERA, an OUIP system that integrates spatial optimization with large language models to provide customized urban itineraries based on user needs. This involves decomposing user requests, selecting candidate points of interest (POIs), ordering the POIs based on cluster-aware spatial optimization, and generating the itinerary. Experiments on real-world datasets and the performance of the deployed system demonstrate our system's capacity to deliver personalized and spatially coherent itineraries compared to current solutions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ameya Prabhu, Shiven Sinha, Ponnurangam Kumaraguru, Philip H. S. Torr, Ozan Sener, Puneet K. Dokania</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual learning has primarily focused on the issue of catastrophic forgetting and the associated stability-plasticity tradeoffs. However, little attention has been paid to the efficacy of continually learned representations, as representations are learned alongside classifiers throughout the learning process. Our primary contribution is empirically demonstrating that existing online continually trained deep networks produce inferior representations compared to a simple pre-defined random transforms. Our approach embeds raw pixels using a fixed random transform, approximating an RBF-Kernel initialized before any data is seen. We then train a simple linear classifier on top without storing any exemplars, processing one sample at a time in an online continual learning setting. This method, called RanDumb, significantly outperforms state-of-the-art continually learned representations across all standard online continual learning benchmarks. Our study reveals the significant limitations of representation learning, particularly in low-exemplar and online continual learning scenarios. Extending our investigation to popular exemplar-free scenarios with pretrained models, we find that training only a linear classifier on top of pretrained representations surpasses most continual fine-tuning and prompt-tuning strategies. Overall, our investigation challenges the prevailing assumptions about effective representation learning in online continual learning. Our code is available at://github.com/drimpossible/RanDumb.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kim Hammar, Tao Li, Rolf Stadler, Quanyan Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: We study automated security response for an IT infrastructure and formulate the interaction between an attacker and a defender as a partially observed, non-stationary game. We relax the standard assumption that the game model is correctly specified and consider that each player has a probabilistic conjecture about the model, which may be misspecified in the sense that the true model has probability 0. This formulation allows us to capture uncertainty about the infrastructure and the intents of the players. To learn effective game strategies online, we design a novel method where a player iteratively adapts its conjecture using Bayesian learning and updates its strategy through rollout. We prove that the conjectures converge to best fits, and we provide a bound on the performance improvement that rollout enables with a conjectured model. To characterize the steady state of the game, we propose a variant of the Berk-Nash equilibrium. We present our method through an advanced persistent threat use case. Testbed evaluations show that our method produces effective security strategies that adapt to a changing environment. We also find that our method enables faster convergence than current reinforcement learning techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lele Cao, Valentin Buchner, Zineb Senane, Fangkai Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are typically assessed using expensive annotated multimodal benchmarks, which often lag behind the rapidly evolving demands of MLLM evaluation. This paper outlines and validates GenCeption, a novel, annotation-free evaluation method that requires only unimodal data to measure inter-modality semantic coherence and inversely assesses MLLMs' tendency to hallucinate. This approach eliminates the need for costly data annotation, minimizes the risk of training data contamination, results in slower benchmark saturation, and avoids the illusion of emerging abilities. Inspired by the DrawCeption game, GenCeption begins with a non-textual sample and proceeds through iterative description and generation steps. The semantic drift across iterations is quantified using the GC@T metric. Based on the GenCeption method, we establish the MMECeption benchmark for evaluating Vision LLMs (VLLMs), and compare performance of several popular VLLMs and human annotators. Our empirical results validate GenCeption's effectiveness, demonstrating strong correlations with established VLLM benchmarks. VLLMs still significantly lack behind human performance and struggle especially with text-intensive tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaihong Zhang, Caitlyn H. Yin, Feng Liang, Jingbo Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the asymptotic error of score-based diffusion model sampling in large-sample scenarios from a non-parametric statistics perspective. We show that a kernel-based score estimator achieves an optimal mean square error of $\widetilde{O}\left(n^{-1} t^{-\frac{d+2}{2}}(t^{\frac{d}{2}} \vee 1)\right)$ for the score function of $p_0*\mathcal{N}(0,t\boldsymbol{I}_d)$, where $n$ and $d$ represent the sample size and the dimension, $t$ is bounded above and below by polynomials of $n$, and $p_0$ is an arbitrary sub-Gaussian distribution. As a consequence, this yields an $\widetilde{O}\left(n^{-1/2} t^{-\frac{d}{4}}\right)$ upper bound for the total variation error of the distribution of the sample generated by the diffusion model under a mere sub-Gaussian assumption. If in addition, $p_0$ belongs to the nonparametric family of the $\beta$-Sobolev space with $\beta\le 2$, by adopting an early stopping strategy, we obtain that the diffusion model is nearly (up to log factors) minimax optimal. This removes the crucial lower bound assumption on $p_0$ in previous proofs of the minimax optimality of the diffusion model for nonparametric families.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongshu Liu, J\'er\'emie Laydevant, Adrien Pontlevy, Damien Querlioz, Julie Grollier</p>
<p>Abstract: Designing algorithms for versatile AI hardware that can learn on the edge using both labeled and unlabeled data is challenging. Deep end-to-end training methods incorporating phases of self-supervised and supervised learning are accurate and adaptable to input data but self-supervised learning requires even more computational and memory resources than supervised learning, too high for current embedded hardware. Conversely, unsupervised layer-by-layer training, such as Hebbian learning, is more compatible with existing hardware but does not integrate well with supervised learning. To address this, we propose a method enabling networks or hardware designed for end-to-end supervised learning to also perform high-performance unsupervised learning by adding two simple elements to the output layer: Winner-Take-All (WTA) selectivity and homeostasis regularization. These mechanisms introduce a "self-defined target" for unlabeled data, allowing purely unsupervised training for both fully-connected and convolutional layers using backpropagation or equilibrium propagation on datasets like MNIST (up to 99.2%), Fashion-MNIST (up to 90.3%), and SVHN (up to 81.5%). We extend this method to semi-supervised learning, adjusting targets based on data type, achieving 96.6% accuracy with only 600 labeled MNIST samples in a multi-layer perceptron. Our results show that this approach can effectively enable networks and hardware initially dedicated to supervised learning to also perform unsupervised learning, adapting to varying availability of labeled data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nigel Fernandez, Alexander Scarlatos, Andrew Lan</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated teaching assistants and chatbots have significant potential to reduce the workload of human instructors, especially for logistics-related question answering, which is important to students yet repetitive for instructors. However, due to privacy concerns, there is a lack of publicly available datasets. We introduce SyllabusQA, an open-source dataset with 63 real course syllabi covering 36 majors, containing 5,078 open-ended course logistics-related question-answer pairs that are diverse in both question types and answer formats. Since many logistics-related questions contain critical information like the date of an exam, it is important to evaluate the factuality of answers. We benchmark several strong baselines on this task, from large language model prompting to retrieval-augmented generation. We introduce Fact-QA, an LLM-based (GPT-4) evaluation metric to evaluate the factuality of predicted answers. We find that despite performing close to humans on traditional metrics of textual similarity, there remains a significant gap between automated approaches and humans in terms of fact precision.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sina Sharifi, Taha Entesari, Bardia Safaei, Vishal M. Patel, Mahyar Fazlyab</p>
<p>Abstract: One of the challenges for neural networks in real-life applications is the overconfident errors these models make when the data is not from the original training distribution.
  Addressing this issue is known as Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection.
  Many state-of-the-art OOD methods employ an auxiliary dataset as a surrogate for OOD data during training to achieve improved performance.
  However, these methods fail to fully exploit the local information embedded in the auxiliary dataset.
  In this work, we propose the idea of leveraging the information embedded in the gradient of the loss function during training to enable the network to not only learn a desired OOD score for each sample but also to exhibit similar behavior in a local neighborhood around each sample.
  We also develop a novel energy-based sampling method to allow the network to be exposed to more informative OOD samples during the training phase. This is especially important when the auxiliary dataset is large. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments on several OOD benchmarks, improving the existing state-of-the-art FPR95 by 4% on our ImageNet experiment.
  We further provide a theoretical analysis through the lens of certified robustness and Lipschitz analysis to showcase the theoretical foundation of our work. Our code is available at https://github.com/o4lc/Greg-OOD.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samee Arif, Sualeha Farid, Awais Athar, Agha Ali Raza</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces UQA, a novel dataset for question answering and text comprehension in Urdu, a low-resource language with over 70 million native speakers. UQA is generated by translating the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD2.0), a large-scale English QA dataset, using a technique called EATS (Enclose to Anchor, Translate, Seek), which preserves the answer spans in the translated context paragraphs. The paper describes the process of selecting and evaluating the best translation model among two candidates: Google Translator and Seamless M4T. The paper also benchmarks several state-of-the-art multilingual QA models on UQA, including mBERT, XLM-RoBERTa, and mT5, and reports promising results. For XLM-RoBERTa-XL, we have an F1 score of 85.99 and 74.56 EM. UQA is a valuable resource for developing and testing multilingual NLP systems for Urdu and for enhancing the cross-lingual transferability of existing models. Further, the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of EATS for creating high-quality datasets for other languages and domains. The UQA dataset and the code are publicly available at www.github.com/sameearif/UQA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> \c{S}\"ukr\"u \"Ozt\"urk, Hacer Yalim Keles</p>
<p>Abstract: This study introduces the continuous Educational Turkish Sign Language (E-TSL) dataset, collected from online Turkish language lessons for 5th, 6th, and 8th grades. The dataset comprises 1,410 videos totaling nearly 24 hours and includes performances from 11 signers. Turkish, an agglutinative language, poses unique challenges for sign language translation, particularly with a vocabulary where 64% are singleton words and 85% are rare words, appearing less than five times. We developed two baseline models to address these challenges: the Pose to Text Transformer (P2T-T) and the Graph Neural Network based Transformer (GNN-T) models. The GNN-T model achieved 19.13% BLEU-1 score and 3.28% BLEU-4 score, presenting a significant challenge compared to existing benchmarks. The P2T-T model, while demonstrating slightly lower performance in BLEU scores, achieved a higher ROUGE-L score of 22.09%. Additionally, we benchmarked our model using the well-known PHOENIX-Weather 2014T dataset to validate our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiou Ge, Ali Mousavi, Edouard Grave, Armand Joulin, Kun Qian, Benjamin Han, Mostafa Arefiyan, Yunyao Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capability in different tasks and are bringing transformative changes to many domains. However, keeping the knowledge in LLMs up-to-date remains a challenge once pretraining is complete. It is thus essential to design effective methods to both update obsolete knowledge and induce new knowledge into LLMs. Existing locate-and-edit knowledge editing (KE) method suffers from two limitations. First, the post-edit LLMs by such methods generally have poor capability in answering complex queries that require multi-hop reasoning. Second, the long run-time of such locate-and-edit methods to perform knowledge edits make it infeasible for large scale KE in practice. In this paper, we explore Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques as an alternative for KE. We curate a more comprehensive temporal KE dataset with both knowledge update and knowledge injection examples for KE performance benchmarking. We further probe the effect of fine-tuning on a range of layers in an LLM for the multi-hop QA task. We find that PEFT performs better than locate-and-edit techniques for time-sensitive knowledge edits.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vivin Vinod, Peter Zaspel</p>
<p>Abstract: Progress in both Machine Learning (ML) and Quantum Chemistry (QC) methods have resulted in high accuracy ML models for QC properties. Datasets such as MD17 and WS22 have been used to benchmark these models at some level of QC method, or fidelity, which refers to the accuracy of the chosen QC method. Multifidelity ML (MFML) methods, where models are trained on data from more than one fidelity, have shown to be effective over single fidelity methods. Much research is progressing in this direction for diverse applications ranging from energy band gaps to excitation energies. One hurdle for effective research here is the lack of a diverse multifidelity dataset for benchmarking. We provide the quantum Chemistry MultiFidelity (CheMFi) dataset consisting of five fidelities calculated with the TD-DFT formalism. The fidelities differ in their basis set choice: STO-3G, 3-21G, 6-31G, def2-SVP, and def2-TZVP. CheMFi offers to the community a variety of QC properties such as vertical excitation properties and molecular dipole moments, further including QC computation times allowing for a time benefit benchmark of multifidelity models for ML-QC.</p>

<p>Abstract: The neonatal period is the most vulnerable time for the development of seizures. Seizures in the immature brain lead to detrimental consequences, therefore require early diagnosis. The gold-standard for neonatal seizure detection currently relies on continuous video-EEG monitoring; which involves recording multi-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) alongside real-time video monitoring within a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). However, video-EEG monitoring technology requires clinical expertise and is often limited to technologically advanced and resourceful settings. Cost-effective new techniques could help the medical fraternity make an accurate diagnosis and advocate treatment without delay. In this work, a novel explainable deep learning model to automate the neonatal seizure detection process with a reduced EEG montage is proposed, which employs convolutional nets, graph attention layers, and fully connected layers. Beyond its ability to detect seizures in real-time with a reduced montage, this model offers the unique advantage of real-time interpretability. By evaluating the performance on the Zenodo dataset with 10-fold cross-validation, the presented model achieves an absolute improvement of 8.31% and 42.86% in area under curve (AUC) and recall, respectively.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17536">MedMNIST-C: Comprehensive benchmark and improved classifier robustness by simulating realistic image corruptions</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Francesco Di Salvo, Sebastian Doerrich, Christian Ledig</p>
<p>Abstract: The integration of neural-network-based systems into clinical practice is limited by challenges related to domain generalization and robustness. The computer vision community established benchmarks such as ImageNet-C as a fundamental prerequisite to measure progress towards those challenges. Similar datasets are largely absent in the medical imaging community which lacks a comprehensive benchmark that spans across imaging modalities and applications. To address this gap, we create and open-source MedMNIST-C, a benchmark dataset based on the MedMNIST+ collection covering 12 datasets and 9 imaging modalities. We simulate task and modality-specific image corruptions of varying severity to comprehensively evaluate the robustness of established algorithms against real-world artifacts and distribution shifts. We further provide quantitative evidence that our simple-to-use artificial corruptions allow for highly performant, lightweight data augmentation to enhance model robustness. Unlike traditional, generic augmentation strategies, our approach leverages domain knowledge, exhibiting significantly higher robustness when compared to widely adopted methods. By introducing MedMNIST-C and open-sourcing the corresponding library allowing for targeted data augmentations, we contribute to the development of increasingly robust methods tailored to the challenges of medical imaging.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiyi Wang, Yang Nan, Sheng Zhang, Federico Felder, Xiaodan Xing, Yingying Fang, Javier Del Ser, Simon L F Walsh, Guang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: In pulmonary tracheal segmentation, the scarcity of annotated data is a prevalent issue in medical segmentation. Additionally, Deep Learning (DL) methods face challenges: the opacity of 'black box' models and the need for performance enhancement. Our Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) based models (RS_UNet, LC_UNet, UUNet, and WD_UNet) address these challenges by combining diverse query strategies with various DL models. We train four HCI models and repeat these steps: (1) Query Strategy: The HCI models select samples that provide the most additional representative information when labeled in each iteration and identify unlabeled samples with the greatest predictive disparity using Wasserstein Distance, Least Confidence, Entropy Sampling, and Random Sampling. (2) Central line correction: Selected samples are used for expert correction of system-generated tracheal central lines in each training round. (3) Update training dataset: Experts update the training dataset after each DL model's training epoch, enhancing the trustworthiness and performance of the models. (4) Model training: The HCI model is trained using the updated dataset and an enhanced UNet version. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of these HCI-based approaches, showing that WD-UNet, LC-UNet, UUNet, and RS-UNet achieve comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art DL models. Notably, WD-UNet achieves this with only 15%-35% of the training data, reducing physician annotation time by 65%-85%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ilya Trofimov, Daria Voronkova, Eduard Tulchinskii, Evgeny Burnaev, Serguei Barannikov</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a new topological tool for computer vision - Scalar Function Topology Divergence (SFTD), which measures the dissimilarity of multi-scale topology between sublevel sets of two functions having a common domain. Functions can be defined on an undirected graph or Euclidean space of any dimensionality. Most of the existing methods for comparing topology are based on Wasserstein distance between persistence barcodes and they don't take into account the localization of topological features. The minimization of SFTD ensures that the corresponding topological features of scalar functions are located in the same places. The proposed tool provides useful visualizations depicting areas where functions have topological dissimilarities. We provide applications of the proposed method to 3D computer vision. In particular, experiments demonstrate that SFTD as an additional loss improves the reconstruction of cellular 3D shapes from 2D fluorescence microscopy images, and helps to identify topological errors in 3D segmentation. Additionally, we show that SFTD outperforms Betti matching loss in 2D segmentation problems.</p>

<p>Abstract: The objective of this study was to develop an automated pipeline that enhances thyroid disease classification using thyroid scintigraphy images, aiming to decrease assessment time and increase diagnostic accuracy. Anterior thyroid scintigraphy images from 2,643 patients were collected and categorized into diffuse goiter (DG), multinodal goiter (MNG), and thyroiditis (TH) based on clinical reports, and then segmented by an expert. A ResUNet model was trained to perform auto-segmentation. Radiomic features were extracted from both physician (scenario 1) and ResUNet segmentations (scenario 2), followed by omitting highly correlated features using Spearman's correlation, and feature selection using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) with XGBoost as the core. All models were trained under leave-one-center-out cross-validation (LOCOCV) scheme, where nine instances of algorithms were iteratively trained and validated on data from eight centers and tested on the ninth for both scenarios separately. Segmentation performance was assessed using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), while classification performance was assessed using metrics, such as precision, recall, F1-score, accuracy, area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC AUC), and area under the precision-recall curve (PRC AUC). ResUNet achieved DSC values of 0.84$\pm$0.03, 0.71$\pm$0.06, and 0.86$\pm$0.02 for MNG, TH, and DG, respectively. Classification in scenario 1 achieved an accuracy of 0.76$\pm$0.04 and a ROC AUC of 0.92$\pm$0.02 while in scenario 2, classification yielded an accuracy of 0.74$\pm$0.05 and a ROC AUC of 0.90$\pm$0.02. The automated pipeline demonstrated comparable performance to physician segmentations on several classification metrics across different classes, effectively reducing assessment time while maintaining high diagnostic accuracy.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yizi Zhang, Yanchen Wang, Donato Jimenez-Beneto, Zixuan Wang, Mehdi Azabou, Blake Richards, Olivier Winter, International Brain Laboratory, Eva Dyer, Liam Paninski, Cole Hurwitz</p>
<p>Abstract: Neuroscience research has made immense progress over the last decade, but our understanding of the brain remains fragmented and piecemeal: the dream of probing an arbitrary brain region and automatically reading out the information encoded in its neural activity remains out of reach. In this work, we build towards a first foundation model for neural spiking data that can solve a diverse set of tasks across multiple brain areas. We introduce a novel self-supervised modeling approach for population activity in which the model alternates between masking out and reconstructing neural activity across different time steps, neurons, and brain regions. To evaluate our approach, we design unsupervised and supervised prediction tasks using the International Brain Laboratory repeated site dataset, which is comprised of Neuropixels recordings targeting the same brain locations across 48 animals and experimental sessions. The prediction tasks include single-neuron and region-level activity prediction, forward prediction, and behavior decoding. We demonstrate that our multi-task-masking (MtM) approach significantly improves the performance of current state-of-the-art population models and enables multi-task learning. We also show that by training on multiple animals, we can improve the generalization ability of the model to unseen animals, paving the way for a foundation model of the brain at single-cell, single-spike resolution.</p>

<p>Abstract: The task of searching through patent documents is crucial for chemical patent recommendation and retrieval. This can be enhanced by creating a patent knowledge base (ChemPatKB) to aid in prior art searches and to provide a platform for domain experts to explore new innovations in chemical compound synthesis and use-cases. An essential foundational component of this KB is the extraction of important reaction snippets from long patents documents which facilitates multiple downstream tasks such as reaction co-reference resolution and chemical entity role identification. In this work, we explore the problem of extracting reactions spans from chemical patents in order to create a reactions resource database. We formulate this task as a paragraph-level sequence tagging problem, where the system is required to return a sequence of paragraphs that contain a description of a reaction. We propose several approaches and modifications of the baseline models and study how different methods generalize across different domains of chemical patents.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose a new algorithm for learning a bridged diffusion process using score-matching methods. Our method relies on reversing the dynamics of the forward process and using this to learn a score function, which, via Doob's $h$-transform, gives us a bridged diffusion process; that is, a process conditioned on an endpoint. In contrast to prior methods, ours learns the score term $\nabla_x \log p(t, x; T, y)$, for given $t, Y$ directly, completely avoiding the need for first learning a time reversal. We compare the performance of our algorithm with existing methods and see that it outperforms using the (learned) time-reversals to learn the score term.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juan Diego Toscano, Theo K\"aufer, Zhibo Wang, Martin Maxey, Christian Cierpka, George Em Karniadakis</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose the Artificial Intelligence Velocimetry-Thermometry (AIVT) method to infer hidden temperature fields from experimental turbulent velocity data. This physics-informed machine learning method enables us to infer continuous temperature fields using only sparse velocity data, hence eliminating the need for direct temperature measurements. Specifically, AIVT is based on physics-informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (not neural networks) and is trained by optimizing a combined loss function that minimizes the residuals of the velocity data, boundary conditions, and the governing equations. We apply AIVT to a unique set of experimental volumetric and simultaneous temperature and velocity data of Rayleigh-B\'enard convection (RBC) that we acquired by combining Particle Image Thermometry and Lagrangian Particle Tracking. This allows us to compare AIVT predictions and measurements directly. We demonstrate that we can reconstruct and infer continuous and instantaneous velocity and temperature fields from sparse experimental data at a fidelity comparable to direct numerical simulations (DNS) of turbulence. This, in turn, enables us to compute important quantities for quantifying turbulence, such as fluctuations, viscous and thermal dissipation, and QR distribution. This paradigm shift in processing experimental data using AIVT to infer turbulent fields at DNS-level fidelity is a promising avenue in breaking the current deadlock of quantitative understanding of turbulence at high Reynolds numbers, where DNS is computationally infeasible.</p>
