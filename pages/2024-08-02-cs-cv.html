<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenhao Wang, Yifan Sun, Zongxin Yang, Zhengdong Hu, Zhentao Tan, Yi Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual diffusion models have revolutionized the field of creative AI, producing high-quality and diverse content. However, they inevitably memorize training images or videos, subsequently replicating their concepts, content, or styles during inference. This phenomenon raises significant concerns about privacy, security, and copyright within generated outputs. In this survey, we provide the first comprehensive review of replication in visual diffusion models, marking a novel contribution to the field by systematically categorizing the existing studies into unveiling, understanding, and mitigating this phenomenon. Specifically, unveiling mainly refers to the methods used to detect replication instances. Understanding involves analyzing the underlying mechanisms and factors that contribute to this phenomenon. Mitigation focuses on developing strategies to reduce or eliminate replication. Beyond these aspects, we also review papers focusing on its real-world influence. For instance, in the context of healthcare, replication is critically worrying due to privacy concerns related to patient data. Finally, the paper concludes with a discussion of the ongoing challenges, such as the difficulty in detecting and benchmarking replication, and outlines future directions including the development of more robust mitigation techniques. By synthesizing insights from diverse studies, this paper aims to equip researchers and practitioners with a deeper understanding at the intersection between AI technology and social good. We release this project at https://github.com/WangWenhao0716/Awesome-Diffusion-Replication.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Subek Sharma, Sisir Dhakal, Mansi Bhavsar</p>
<p>Abstract: Biodiversity plays a crucial role in maintaining the balance of the ecosystem. However, poaching and unintentional human activities contribute to the decline in the population of many species. Hence, active monitoring is required to preserve these endangered species. Current human-led monitoring techniques are prone to errors and are labor-intensive. Therefore, we study the application of deep learning methods like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transfer learning, which can aid in automating the process of monitoring endangered species. For this, we create our custom dataset utilizing trustworthy online databases like iNaturalist and ZooChat. To choose the best model for our use case, we compare the performance of different architectures like DenseNet, ResNet, VGGNet, and YOLOv8 on the custom wildlife dataset. Transfer learning reduces training time by freezing the pre-trained weights and replacing only the output layer with custom, fully connected layers designed for our dataset. Our results indicate that YOLOv8 performs better, achieving a training accuracy of 97.39 % and an F1 score of 96.50 %, surpassing other models. Our findings suggest that integrating YOLOv8 into conservation efforts could revolutionize wildlife monitoring with its high accuracy and efficiency, potentially transforming how endangered species are monitored and protected worldwide.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanyuan Xiao, Yingshu Chen, Huajian Huang, Haolin Xiong, Jing Yang, Pratusha Prasad, Yajie Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent text-guided generation of individual 3D object has achieved great success using diffusion priors. However, these methods are not suitable for object insertion and replacement tasks as they do not consider the background, leading to illumination mismatches within the environment. To bridge the gap, we introduce an illumination-aware 3D scene editing pipeline for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation. Our key observation is that inpainting by the state-of-the-art conditional 2D diffusion model is consistent with background in lighting. To leverage the prior knowledge from the well-trained diffusion models for 3D object generation, our approach employs a coarse-to-fine objection optimization pipeline with inpainted views. In the first coarse step, we achieve image-to-3D lifting given an ideal inpainted view. The process employs 3D-aware diffusion prior from a view-conditioned diffusion model, which preserves illumination present in the conditioning image. To acquire an ideal inpainted image, we introduce an Anchor View Proposal (AVP) algorithm to find a single view that best represents the scene illumination in target region. In the second Texture Enhancement step, we introduce a novel Depth-guided Inpainting Score Distillation Sampling (DI-SDS), which enhances geometry and texture details with the inpainting diffusion prior, beyond the scope of the 3D-aware diffusion prior knowledge in the first coarse step. DI-SDS not only provides fine-grained texture enhancement, but also urges optimization to respect scene lighting. Our approach efficiently achieves local editing with global illumination consistency without explicitly modeling light transport. We demonstrate robustness of our method by evaluating editing in real scenes containing explicit highlight and shadows, and compare against the state-of-the-art text-to-3D editing methods.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00096">From Attributes to Natural Language: A Survey and Foresight on Text-based Person Re-identification</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Fanzhi Jiang, Su Yang, Mark W. Jones, Liumei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-based person re-identification (Re-ID) is a challenging topic in the field of complex multimodal analysis, its ultimate aim is to recognize specific pedestrians by scrutinizing attributes/natural language descriptions. Despite the wide range of applicable areas such as security surveillance, video retrieval, person tracking, and social media analytics, there is a notable absence of comprehensive reviews dedicated to summarizing the text-based person Re-ID from a technical perspective. To address this gap, we propose to introduce a taxonomy spanning Evaluation, Strategy, Architecture, and Optimization dimensions, providing a comprehensive survey of the text-based person Re-ID task. We start by laying the groundwork for text-based person Re-ID, elucidating fundamental concepts related to attribute/natural language-based identification. Then a thorough examination of existing benchmark datasets and metrics is presented. Subsequently, we further delve into prevalent feature extraction strategies employed in text-based person Re-ID research, followed by a concise summary of common network architectures within the domain. Prevalent loss functions utilized for model optimization and modality alignment in text-based person Re-ID are also scrutinized. To conclude, we offer a concise summary of our findings, pinpointing challenges in text-based person Re-ID. In response to these challenges, we outline potential avenues for future open-set text-based person Re-ID and present a baseline architecture for text-based pedestrian image generation-guided re-identification(TBPGR).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xudong Xie, Yuzhe Li, Yang Liu, Zhifei Zhang, Zhaowen Wang, Wei Xiong, Xiang Bai</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate text segmentation results are crucial for text-related generative tasks, such as text image generation, text editing, text removal, and text style transfer. Recently, some scene text segmentation methods have made significant progress in segmenting regular text. However, these methods perform poorly in scenarios containing artistic text. Therefore, this paper focuses on the more challenging task of artistic text segmentation and constructs a real artistic text segmentation dataset. One challenge of the task is that the local stroke shapes of artistic text are changeable with diversity and complexity. We propose a decoder with the layer-wise momentum query to prevent the model from ignoring stroke regions of special shapes. Another challenge is the complexity of the global topological structure. We further design a skeleton-assisted head to guide the model to focus on the global structure. Additionally, to enhance the generalization performance of the text segmentation model, we propose a strategy for training data synthesis, based on the large multi-modal model and the diffusion model. Experimental results show that our proposed method and synthetic dataset can significantly enhance the performance of artistic text segmentation and achieve state-of-the-art results on other public datasets.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00112">Automated Sperm Morphology Analysis Based on Instance-Aware Part Segmentation</a></h1>

<p>Abstract: Traditional sperm morphology analysis is based on tedious manual annotation. Automated morphology analysis of a high number of sperm requires accurate segmentation of each sperm part and quantitative morphology evaluation. State-of-the-art instance-aware part segmentation networks follow a "detect-then-segment" paradigm. However, due to sperm's slim shape, their segmentation suffers from large context loss and feature distortion due to bounding box cropping and resizing during ROI Align. Moreover, morphology measurement of sperm tail is demanding because of the long and curved shape and its uneven width. This paper presents automated techniques to measure sperm morphology parameters automatically and quantitatively. A novel attention-based instance-aware part segmentation network is designed to reconstruct lost contexts outside bounding boxes and to fix distorted features, by refining preliminary segmented masks through merging features extracted by feature pyramid network. An automated centerline-based tail morphology measurement method is also proposed, in which an outlier filtering method and endpoint detection algorithm are designed to accurately reconstruct tail endpoints. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed network outperformed the state-of-the-art top-down RP-R-CNN by 9.2% [AP]_vol^p, and the proposed automated tail morphology measurement method achieved high measurement accuracies of 95.34%,96.39%,91.2% for length, width and curvature, respectively.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00117">Certifying Robustness of Learning-Based Keypoint Detection and Pose Estimation Methods</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xusheng Luo, Tianhao Wei, Simin Liu, Ziwei Wang, Luis Mattei-Mendez, Taylor Loper, Joshua Neighbor, Casidhe Hutchison, Changliu Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: This work addresses the certification of the local robustness of vision-based two-stage 6D object pose estimation. The two-stage method for object pose estimation achieves superior accuracy by first employing deep neural network-driven keypoint regression and then applying a Perspective-n-Point (PnP) technique. Despite advancements, the certification of these methods' robustness remains scarce. This research aims to fill this gap with a focus on their local robustness on the system level--the capacity to maintain robust estimations amidst semantic input perturbations. The core idea is to transform the certification of local robustness into neural network verification for classification tasks. The challenge is to develop model, input, and output specifications that align with off-the-shelf verification tools. To facilitate verification, we modify the keypoint detection model by substituting nonlinear operations with those more amenable to the verification processes. Instead of injecting random noise into images, as is common, we employ a convex hull representation of images as input specifications to more accurately depict semantic perturbations. Furthermore, by conducting a sensitivity analysis, we propagate the robustness criteria from pose to keypoint accuracy, and then formulating an optimal error threshold allocation problem that allows for the setting of a maximally permissible keypoint deviation thresholds. Viewing each pixel as an individual class, these thresholds result in linear, classification-akin output specifications. Under certain conditions, we demonstrate that the main components of our certification framework are both sound and complete, and validate its effects through extensive evaluations on realistic perturbations. To our knowledge, this is the first study to certify the robustness of large-scale, keypoint-based pose estimation given images in real-world scenarios.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00169">Strike the Balance: On-the-Fly Uncertainty based User Interactions for Long-Term Video Object Segmentation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> St\'ephane Vujasinovi\'c, Stefan Becker, Sebastian Bullinger, Norbert Scherer-Negenborn, Michael Arens</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a variant of video object segmentation (VOS) that bridges interactive and semi-automatic approaches, termed Lazy Video Object Segmentation (ziVOS). In contrast, to both tasks, which handle video object segmentation in an off-line manner (i.e., pre-recorded sequences), we propose through ziVOS to target online recorded sequences. Here, we strive to strike a balance between performance and robustness for long-term scenarios by soliciting user feedback's on-the-fly during the segmentation process. Hence, we aim to maximize the tracking duration of an object of interest, while requiring minimal user corrections to maintain tracking over an extended period. We propose a competitive baseline, i.e., Lazy-XMem, as a reference for future works in ziVOS. Our proposed approach uses an uncertainty estimation of the tracking state to determine whether a user interaction is necessary to refine the model's prediction. To quantitatively assess the performance of our method and the user's workload, we introduce complementary metrics alongside those already established in the field. We evaluate our approach using the recently introduced LVOS dataset, which offers numerous long-term videos. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Vujas-Eteph/LazyXMem.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00181">CC-SAM: SAM with Cross-feature Attention and Context for Ultrasound Image Segmentation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shreyank N Gowda, David A. Clifton</p>
<p>Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has achieved remarkable successes in the realm of natural image segmentation, but its deployment in the medical imaging sphere has encountered challenges. Specifically, the model struggles with medical images that feature low contrast, faint boundaries, intricate morphologies, and small-sized objects. To address these challenges and enhance SAM's performance in the medical domain, we introduce a comprehensive modification. Firstly, we incorporate a frozen Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) branch as an image encoder, which synergizes with SAM's original Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder through a novel variational attention fusion module. This integration bolsters the model's capability to capture local spatial information, which is often paramount in medical imagery. Moreover, to further optimize SAM for medical imaging, we introduce feature and position adapters within the ViT branch, refining the encoder's representations. We see that compared to current prompting strategies to fine-tune SAM for ultrasound medical segmentation, the use of text descriptions that serve as text prompts for SAM helps significantly improve the performance. Leveraging ChatGPT's natural language understanding capabilities, we generate prompts that offer contextual information and guidance to SAM, enabling it to better understand the nuances of ultrasound medical images and improve its segmentation accuracy. Our method, in its entirety, represents a significant stride towards making universal image segmentation models more adaptable and efficient in the medical domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrea Kim, Niloufar Saharkhiz, Elena Sizikova, Miguel Lago, Berkman Sahiner, Jana Delfino, Aldo Badano</p>
<p>Abstract: Development of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in medical imaging requires access to large-scale and diverse datasets for training and evaluation. In dermatology, obtaining such datasets remains challenging due to significant variations in patient populations, illumination conditions, and acquisition system characteristics. In this work, we propose S-SYNTH, the first knowledge-based, adaptable open-source skin simulation framework to rapidly generate synthetic skin, 3D models and digitally rendered images, using an anatomically inspired multi-layer, multi-component skin and growing lesion model. The skin model allows for controlled variation in skin appearance, such as skin color, presence of hair, lesion shape, and blood fraction among other parameters. We use this framework to study the effect of possible variations on the development and evaluation of AI models for skin lesion segmentation, and show that results obtained using synthetic data follow similar comparative trends as real dermatologic images, while mitigating biases and limitations from existing datasets including small dataset size, lack of diversity, and underrepresentation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yadong Lu, Jianwei Yang, Yelong Shen, Ahmed Awadallah</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent success of large vision language models shows great potential in driving the agent system operating on user interfaces. However, we argue that the power multimodal models like GPT-4V as a general agent on multiple operating systems across different applications is largely underestimated due to the lack of a robust screen parsing technique capable of: 1) reliably identifying interactable icons within the user interface, and 2) understanding the semantics of various elements in a screenshot and accurately associate the intended action with the corresponding region on the screen. To fill these gaps, we introduce \textsc{OmniParser}, a comprehensive method for parsing user interface screenshots into structured elements, which significantly enhances the ability of GPT-4V to generate actions that can be accurately grounded in the corresponding regions of the interface. We first curated an interactable icon detection dataset using popular webpages and an icon description dataset. These datasets were utilized to fine-tune specialized models: a detection model to parse interactable regions on the screen and a caption model to extract the functional semantics of the detected elements. \textsc{OmniParser} significantly improves GPT-4V's performance on ScreenSpot benchmark. And on Mind2Web and AITW benchmark, \textsc{OmniParser} with screenshot only input outperforms the GPT-4V baselines requiring additional information outside of screenshot.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qi Xiong, Xinman Zhang, Jun Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Blind iris images, which result from unknown degradation during the process of iris recognition at long distances, often lead to decreased iris recognition rates. Currently, little existing literature offers a solution to this problem. In response, we propose a prior embedding-driven architecture for long distance blind iris recognition. We first proposed a blind iris image restoration network called Iris-PPRGAN. To effectively restore the texture of the blind iris, Iris-PPRGAN includes a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) used as a Prior Decoder, and a DNN used as the encoder. To extract iris features more efficiently, we then proposed a robust iris classifier by modifying the bottleneck module of InsightFace, which called Insight-Iris. A low-quality blind iris image is first restored by Iris-PPRGAN, then the restored iris image undergoes recognition via Insight-Iris. Experimental results on the public CASIA-Iris-distance dataset demonstrate that our proposed method significantly superior results to state-of-the-art blind iris restoration methods both quantitatively and qualitatively, Specifically, the recognition rate for long-distance blind iris images reaches 90% after processing with our methods, representing an improvement of approximately ten percentage points compared to images without restoration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Congqi Cao, Yueran Zhang, Yating Yu, Qinyi Lv, Lingtong Min, Yanning Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing works in few-shot action recognition mostly fine-tune a pre-trained image model and design sophisticated temporal alignment modules at feature level. However, simply fully fine-tuning the pre-trained model could cause overfitting due to the scarcity of video samples. Additionally, we argue that the exploration of task-specific information is insufficient when relying solely on well extracted abstract features. In this work, we propose a simple but effective task-specific adaptation method (Task-Adapter) for few-shot action recognition. By introducing the proposed Task-Adapter into the last several layers of the backbone and keeping the parameters of the original pre-trained model frozen, we mitigate the overfitting problem caused by full fine-tuning and advance the task-specific mechanism into the process of feature extraction. In each Task-Adapter, we reuse the frozen self-attention layer to perform task-specific self-attention across different videos within the given task to capture both distinctive information among classes and shared information within classes, which facilitates task-specific adaptation and enhances subsequent metric measurement between the query feature and support prototypes. Experimental results consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed Task-Adapter on four standard few-shot action recognition datasets. Especially on temporal challenging SSv2 dataset, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenyu Bao, Guibiao Liao, Kaichen Zhou, Kanglin Liu, Qing Li, Guoping Qiu</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the photorealistic novel view synthesis (NVS) performance achieved by the original 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS), its rendering quality significantly degrades with sparse input views. This performance drop is mainly caused by the limited number of initial points generated from the sparse input, insufficient supervision during the training process, and inadequate regularization of the oversized Gaussian ellipsoids. To handle these issues, we propose the LoopSparseGS, a loop-based 3DGS framework for the sparse novel view synthesis task. In specific, we propose a loop-based Progressive Gaussian Initialization (PGI) strategy that could iteratively densify the initialized point cloud using the rendered pseudo images during the training process. Then, the sparse and reliable depth from the Structure from Motion, and the window-based dense monocular depth are leveraged to provide precise geometric supervision via the proposed Depth-alignment Regularization (DAR). Additionally, we introduce a novel Sparse-friendly Sampling (SFS) strategy to handle oversized Gaussian ellipsoids leading to large pixel errors. Comprehensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that LoopSparseGS outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods for sparse-input novel view synthesis, across indoor, outdoor, and object-level scenes with various image resolutions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yesheng Zhang, Xu Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose MESA and DMESA as novel feature matching methods, which utilize Segment Anything Model (SAM) to effectively mitigate matching redundancy. The key insight of our methods is to establish implicit-semantic area matching prior to point matching, based on advanced image understanding of SAM. Then, informative area matches with consistent internal semantic are able to undergo dense feature comparison, facilitating precise inside-area point matching. Specifically, MESA adopts a sparse matching framework and first obtains candidate areas from SAM results through a novel Area Graph (AG). Then, area matching among the candidates is formulated as graph energy minimization and solved by graphical models derived from AG. To address the efficiency issue of MESA, we further propose DMESA as its dense counterpart, applying a dense matching framework. After candidate areas are identified by AG, DMESA establishes area matches through generating dense matching distributions. The distributions are produced from off-the-shelf patch matching utilizing the Gaussian Mixture Model and refined via the Expectation Maximization. With less repetitive computation, DMESA showcases a speed improvement of nearly five times compared to MESA, while maintaining competitive accuracy. Our methods are extensively evaluated on five datasets encompassing indoor and outdoor scenes. The results illustrate consistent performance improvements from our methods for five distinct point matching baselines across all datasets. Furthermore, our methods exhibit promise generalization and improved robustness against image resolution variations. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/Easonyesheng/A2PM-MESA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiacheng Deng, Jiahao Lu, Tianzhu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D object detection is essential for understanding 3D scenes. Contemporary techniques often require extensive annotated training data, yet obtaining point-wise annotations for point clouds is time-consuming and laborious. Recent developments in semi-supervised methods seek to mitigate this problem by employing a teacher-student framework to generate pseudo-labels for unlabeled point clouds. However, these pseudo-labels frequently suffer from insufficient diversity and inferior quality. To overcome these hurdles, we introduce an Agent-based Diffusion Model for Semi-supervised 3D Object Detection (Diff3DETR). Specifically, an agent-based object query generator is designed to produce object queries that effectively adapt to dynamic scenes while striking a balance between sampling locations and content embedding. Additionally, a box-aware denoising module utilizes the DDIM denoising process and the long-range attention in the transformer decoder to refine bounding boxes incrementally. Extensive experiments on ScanNet and SUN RGB-D datasets demonstrate that Diff3DETR outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised 3D object detection methods.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00288">Gradient Harmonization in Unsupervised Domain Adaptation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Fuxiang Huang, Suqi Song, Lei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) intends to transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Many current methods focus on learning feature representations that are both discriminative for classification and invariant across domains by simultaneously optimizing domain alignment and classification tasks. However, these methods often overlook a crucial challenge: the inherent conflict between these two tasks during gradient-based optimization. In this paper, we delve into this issue and introduce two effective solutions known as Gradient Harmonization, including GH and GH++, to mitigate the conflict between domain alignment and classification tasks. GH operates by altering the gradient angle between different tasks from an obtuse angle to an acute angle, thus resolving the conflict and trade-offing the two tasks in a coordinated manner. Yet, this would cause both tasks to deviate from their original optimization directions. We thus further propose an improved version, GH++, which adjusts the gradient angle between tasks from an obtuse angle to a vertical angle. This not only eliminates the conflict but also minimizes deviation from the original gradient directions. Finally, for optimization convenience and efficiency, we evolve the gradient harmonization strategies into a dynamically weighted loss function using an integral operator on the harmonized gradient. Notably, GH/GH++ are orthogonal to UDA and can be seamlessly integrated into most existing UDA models. Theoretical insights and experimental analyses demonstrate that the proposed approaches not only enhance popular UDA baselines but also improve recent state-of-the-art models.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00290">Multi-Modal Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning via Graph Neural Network</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Bin Cheng, Jiaxuan Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: With the advent of the era of foundation models, pre-training and fine-tuning have become common paradigms. Recently, parameter-efficient fine-tuning has garnered widespread attention due to its better balance between the number of learnable parameters and performance. However, some current parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods only model a single modality and lack the utilization of structural knowledge in downstream tasks. To address this issue, this paper proposes a multi-modal parameter-efficient fine-tuning method based on graph networks. Each image is fed into a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) to generate a text description. The image and its corresponding text description are then processed by a frozen image encoder and text encoder to generate image features and text features, respectively. A graph is constructed based on the similarity of the multi-modal feature nodes, and knowledge and relationships relevant to these features are extracted from each node. Additionally, Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) regularization is incorporated into the loss function to mitigate the problem of forgetting during task learning. The proposed model achieves test accuracies on the OxfordPets, Flowers102, and Food101 datasets that improve by 4.45%, 2.92%, and 0.23%, respectively.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lu Ou, Shaolin Liao, Shihui Gao, Guandong Huang, Zheng Qi</p>
<p>Abstract: With the widespread sharing of personal face images in applications' public databases, face recognition systems faces real threat of being breached by potential adversaries who are able to access users' face images and use them to intrude the face recognition systems. In this paper, we propose a novel privacy protection method in the multiscale sparsified feature subspaces to protect sensitive facial features, by taking care of the influence or weight ranked feature coefficients on the privacy budget, named "Ranked Differential Privacy (RDP)". After the multiscale feature decomposition, the lightweight Laplacian noise is added to the dimension-reduced sparsified feature coefficients according to the geometric superposition method. Then, we rigorously prove that the RDP satisfies Differential Privacy. After that, the nonlinear Lagrange Multiplier (LM) method is formulated for the constraint optimization problem of maximizing the utility of the visualization quality protected face images with sanitizing noise, under a given facial features privacy budget. Then, two methods are proposed to solve the nonlinear LM problem and obtain the optimal noise scale parameters: 1) the analytical Normalization Approximation (NA) method with identical average noise scale parameter for real-time online applications; and 2) the LM optimization Gradient Descent (LMGD) numerical method to obtain the nonlinear solution through iterative updating for more accurate offline applications. Experimental results on two real-world datasets show that our proposed RDP outperforms other state-of-the-art methods: at a privacy budget of 0.2, the PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) of the RDP is about ~10 dB higher than (10 times as high as) the highest PSNR of all compared methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Creating a 360{\deg} parametric model of a human head is a very challenging task. While recent advancements have demonstrated the efficacy of leveraging synthetic data for building such parametric head models, their performance remains inadequate in crucial areas such as expression-driven animation, hairstyle editing, and text-based modifications. In this paper, we build a dataset of artist-designed high-fidelity human heads and propose to create a novel parametric 360{\deg} renderable parametric head model from it. Our scheme decouples the facial motion/shape and facial appearance, which are represented by a classic parametric 3D mesh model and an attached neural texture, respectively. We further propose a training method for decompositing hairstyle and facial appearance, allowing free-swapping of the hairstyle. A novel inversion fitting method is presented based on single image input with high generalization and fidelity. To the best of our knowledge, our model is the first parametric 3D full-head that achieves 360{\deg} free-view synthesis, image-based fitting, appearance editing, and animation within a single model. Experiments show that facial motions and appearances are well disentangled in the parametric space, leading to SOTA performance in rendering and animating quality.

<p>Abstract: We present a novel approach for synthesizing 3D talking heads with controllable emotion, featuring enhanced lip synchronization and rendering quality. Despite significant progress in the field, prior methods still suffer from multi-view consistency and a lack of emotional expressiveness. To address these issues, we collect EmoTalk3D dataset with calibrated multi-view videos, emotional annotations, and per-frame 3D geometry. By training on the EmoTalk3D dataset, we propose a \textit{`Speech-to-Geometry-to-Appearance'} mapping framework that first predicts faithful 3D geometry sequence from the audio features, then the appearance of a 3D talking head represented by 4D Gaussians is synthesized from the predicted geometry. The appearance is further disentangled into canonical and dynamic Gaussians, learned from multi-view videos, and fused to render free-view talking head animation. Moreover, our model enables controllable emotion in the generated talking heads and can be rendered in wide-range views. Our method exhibits improved rendering quality and stability in lip motion generation while capturing dynamic facial details such as wrinkles and subtle expressions. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in generating high-fidelity and emotion-controllable 3D talking heads.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ragav Sachdeva, Gyungin Shin, Andrew Zisserman</p>
<p>Abstract: Enabling engagement of manga by visually impaired individuals presents a significant challenge due to its inherently visual nature. With the goal of fostering accessibility, this paper aims to generate a dialogue transcript of a complete manga chapter, entirely automatically, with a particular emphasis on ensuring narrative consistency. This entails identifying (i) what is being said, i.e., detecting the texts on each page and classifying them into essential vs non-essential, and (ii) who is saying it, i.e., attributing each dialogue to its speaker, while ensuring the same characters are named consistently throughout the chapter.
  To this end, we introduce: (i) Magiv2, a model that is capable of generating high-quality chapter-wide manga transcripts with named characters and significantly higher precision in speaker diarisation over prior works; (ii) an extension of the PopManga evaluation dataset, which now includes annotations for speech-bubble tail boxes, associations of text to corresponding tails, classifications of text as essential or non-essential, and the identity for each character box; and (iii) a new character bank dataset, which comprises over 11K characters from 76 manga series, featuring 11.5K exemplar character images in total, as well as a list of chapters in which they appear.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huishan Ji, Qingyi Si, Zheng Lin, Weiping Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Throughout rapid development of multimodal large language models, a crucial ingredient is a fair and accurate evaluation of their multimodal comprehension abilities. Although Visual Question Answering (VQA) could serve as a developed test field, limitations of VQA evaluation, like the inflexible pattern of Exact Match, have hindered MLLMs from demonstrating their real capability and discourage rich responses. Therefore, this paper proposes the use of semantics-based evaluators for assessing unconstrained open-ended responses on VQA datasets. As characteristics of VQA have made such evaluation significantly different than the traditional Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) task, to systematically analyze the behaviour and compare the performance of various evaluators including LLM-based ones, we proposes three key properties, i.e., Alignment, Consistency and Generalization, and a corresponding dataset Assessing VQA Evaluators (AVE) to facilitate analysis. In addition, this paper proposes a Semantically Flexible VQA Evaluator (SFVE) with meticulous design based on the unique features of VQA evaluation. Experimental results verify the feasibility of model-based VQA evaluation and effectiveness of the proposed evaluator that surpasses existing semantic evaluators by a large margin. The proposed training scheme generalizes to both the BERT-like encoders and decoder-only LLM.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00303">Neural Octahedral Field: Octahedral prior for simultaneous smoothing and sharp edge regularization</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruichen Zheng, Tao Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural implicit representation, the parameterization of distance function as a coordinate neural field, has emerged as a promising lead in tackling surface reconstruction from unoriented point clouds. To enforce consistent orientation, existing methods focus on regularizing the gradient of the distance function, such as constraining it to be of the unit norm, minimizing its divergence, or aligning it with the eigenvector of Hessian that corresponds to zero eigenvalue. However, under the presence of large scanning noise, they tend to either overfit the noise input or produce an excessively smooth reconstruction. In this work, we propose to guide the surface reconstruction under a new variant of neural field, the octahedral field, leveraging the spherical harmonics representation of octahedral frames originated in the hexahedral meshing. Such field automatically snaps to geometry features when constrained to be smooth, and naturally preserves sharp angles when interpolated over creases. By simultaneously fitting and smoothing the octahedral field alongside the implicit geometry, it behaves analogously to bilateral filtering, resulting in smooth reconstruction while preserving sharp edges. Despite being operated purely pointwise, our method outperforms various traditional and neural approaches across extensive experiments, and is very competitive with methods that require normal and data priors.

<p>Abstract: In this study, we present a novel approach for predicting genomic information from medical imaging modalities using a transformer-based model. We aim to bridge the gap between imaging and genomics data by leveraging transformer networks, allowing for accurate genomic profile predictions from CT/MRI images. Presently most studies rely on the use of whole slide images (WSI) for the association, which are obtained via invasive methodologies. We propose using only available CT/MRI images to predict genomic sequences. Our transformer based approach is able to efficiently generate associations between multiple sequences based on CT/MRI images alone. This work paves the way for the use of non-invasive imaging modalities for precise and personalized healthcare, allowing for a better understanding of diseases and treatment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rakshith Subramanyam, Kowshik Thopalli, Vivek Narayanaswamy, Jayaraman J. Thiagarajan</p>
<p>Abstract: Reliably detecting when a deployed machine learning model is likely to fail on a given input is crucial for ensuring safe operation. In this work, we propose DECIDER (Debiasing Classifiers to Identify Errors Reliably), a novel approach that leverages priors from large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) to detect failures in image classification models. DECIDER utilizes LLMs to specify task-relevant core attributes and constructs a ``debiased'' version of the classifier by aligning its visual features to these core attributes using a VLM, and detects potential failure by measuring disagreement between the original and debiased models. In addition to proactively identifying samples on which the model would fail, DECIDER also provides human-interpretable explanations for failure through a novel attribute-ablation strategy. Through extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks spanning subpopulation shifts (spurious correlations, class imbalance) and covariate shifts (synthetic corruptions, domain shifts), DECIDER consistently achieves state-of-the-art failure detection performance, significantly outperforming baselines in terms of the overall Matthews correlation coefficient as well as failure and success recall.

<p>Abstract: Outdoor sports pose a challenge for people with impaired vision. The demand for higher-speed mobility inspired us to develop a vision-based wearable steering assistance. To ensure broad applicability, we focused on a representative sports environment, the athletics track. Our efforts centered on improving the speed and accuracy of perception, enhancing planning adaptability for the real world, and providing swift and safe assistance for people with impaired vision. In perception, we engineered a lightweight multitask network capable of simultaneously detecting track lines and obstacles. Additionally, due to the limitations of existing datasets for supporting multi-task detection in athletics tracks, we diligently collected and annotated a new dataset (MAT) containing 1000 images. In planning, we integrated the methods of sampling and spline curves, addressing the planning challenges of curves. Meanwhile, we utilized the positions of the track lines and obstacles as constraints to guide people with impaired vision safely along the current track. Our system is deployed on an embedded device, Jetson Orin NX. Through outdoor experiments, it demonstrated adaptability in different sports scenarios, assisting users in achieving free movement of 400-meter at an average speed of 1.34 m/s, meeting the level of normal people in jogging.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiheng Huang, Junhong Chen, Nick Michiels, Muhammad Asim, Luc Claesen, Wenyin Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to the visual properties of reflection and refraction, RGB-D cameras cannot accurately capture the depth of transparent objects, leading to incomplete depth maps. To fill in the missing points, recent studies tend to explore new visual features and design complex networks to reconstruct the depth, however, these approaches tremendously increase computation, and the correlation of different visual features remains a problem. To this end, we propose an efficient depth completion network named DistillGrasp which distillates knowledge from the teacher branch to the student branch. Specifically, in the teacher branch, we design a position correlation block (PCB) that leverages RGB images as the query and key to search for the corresponding values, guiding the model to establish correct correspondence between two features and transfer it to the transparent areas. For the student branch, we propose a consistent feature correlation module (CFCM) that retains the reliable regions of RGB images and depth maps respectively according to the consistency and adopts a CNN to capture the pairwise relationship for depth completion. To avoid the student branch only learning regional features from the teacher branch, we devise a distillation loss that not only considers the distance loss but also the object structure and edge information. Extensive experiments conducted on the ClearGrasp dataset manifest that our teacher network outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and generalization, and the student network achieves competitive results with a higher speed of 48 FPS. In addition, the significant improvement in a real-world robotic grasping system illustrates the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed system.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding the morphological structure of medical images and precisely segmenting the region of interest or abnormality is an important task that can assist in diagnosis. However, the unique properties of medical imaging make clear segmentation difficult, and the high cost and time-consuming task of labeling leads to a coarse-grained representation of ground truth. Facing with these problems, we propose a novel Diffusion Transformer Segmentation (DTS) model for robust segmentation in the presence of noise. We propose an alternative to the dominant Denoising U-Net encoder through experiments applying a transformer architecture, which captures global dependency through self-attention. Additionally, we propose k-neighbor label smoothing, reverse boundary attention, and self-supervised learning with morphology-driven learning to improve the ability to identify complex structures. Our model, which analyzes the morphological representation of images, shows better results than the previous models in various medical imaging modalities, including CT, MRI, and lesion images.</p>

<p>Abstract: In computer vision, it is well-known that a lack of data diversity will impair model performance. In this study, we address the challenges of enhancing the dataset diversity problem in order to benefit various downstream tasks such as object detection and instance segmentation. We propose a simple yet effective data augmentation approach by leveraging advancements in generative models, specifically text-to-image synthesis technologies like Stable Diffusion. Our method focuses on generating variations of labeled real images, utilizing generative object and background augmentation via inpainting to augment existing training data without the need for additional annotations. We find that background augmentation, in particular, significantly improves the models' robustness and generalization capabilities. We also investigate how to adjust the prompt and mask to ensure the generated content comply with the existing annotations. The efficacy of our augmentation techniques is validated through comprehensive evaluations of the COCO dataset and several other key object detection benchmarks, demonstrating notable enhancements in model performance across diverse scenarios. This approach offers a promising solution to the challenges of dataset enhancement, contributing to the development of more accurate and robust computer vision models.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose a new framework for creating and easily manipulating 3D models of arbitrary objects using casually captured videos. Our core ingredient is a novel hierarchy deformation model, which captures motions of objects with a tree-structured bones. Our hierarchy system decomposes motions based on the granularity and reveals the correlations between parts without exploiting any prior structural knowledge. We further propose to regularize the bones to be positioned at the basis of motions, centers of parts, sufficiently covering related surfaces of the part. This is achieved by our bone occupancy function, which identifies whether a given 3D point is placed within the bone. Coupling the proposed components, our framework offers several clear advantages: (1) users can obtain animatable 3D models of the arbitrary objects in improved quality from their casual videos, (2) users can manipulate 3D models in an intuitive manner with minimal costs, and (3) users can interactively add or delete control points as necessary. The experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our framework on diverse instances, in reconstruction quality, interpretability and easier manipulation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Honglei Miao, Fan Ma, Ruijie Quan, Kun Zhan, Yi Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Human motion generation driven by deep generative models has enabled compelling applications, but the ability of text-to-motion (T2M) models to produce realistic motions from text prompts raises security concerns if exploited maliciously. Despite growing interest in T2M, few methods focus on safeguarding these models against adversarial attacks, with existing work on text-to-image models proving insufficient for the unique motion domain. In the paper, we propose ALERT-Motion, an autonomous framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) to craft targeted adversarial attacks against black-box T2M models. Unlike prior methods modifying prompts through predefined rules, ALERT-Motion uses LLMs' knowledge of human motion to autonomously generate subtle yet powerful adversarial text descriptions. It comprises two key modules: an adaptive dispatching module that constructs an LLM-based agent to iteratively refine and search for adversarial prompts; and a multimodal information contrastive module that extracts semantically relevant motion information to guide the agent's search. Through this LLM-driven approach, ALERT-Motion crafts adversarial prompts querying victim models to produce outputs closely matching targeted motions, while avoiding obvious perturbations.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00355">DNTextSpotter: Arbitrary-Shaped Scene Text Spotting via Improved Denoising Training</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Xie, Qian Qiao, Jun Gao, Tianxiang Wu, Shaoyao Huang, Jiaqing Fan, Ziqiang Cao, Zili Wang, Yue Zhang, Jielei Zhang, Huyang Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: More and more end-to-end text spotting methods based on Transformer architecture have demonstrated superior performance. These methods utilize a bipartite graph matching algorithm to perform one-to-one optimal matching between predicted objects and actual objects. However, the instability of bipartite graph matching can lead to inconsistent optimization targets, thereby affecting the training performance of the model. Existing literature applies denoising training to solve the problem of bipartite graph matching instability in object detection tasks. Unfortunately, this denoising training method cannot be directly applied to text spotting tasks, as these tasks need to perform irregular shape detection tasks and more complex text recognition tasks than classification. To address this issue, we propose a novel denoising training method (DNTextSpotter) for arbitrary-shaped text spotting. Specifically, we decompose the queries of the denoising part into noised positional queries and noised content queries. We use the four Bezier control points of the Bezier center curve to generate the noised positional queries. For the noised content queries, considering that the output of the text in a fixed positional order is not conducive to aligning position with content, we employ a masked character sliding method to initialize noised content queries, thereby assisting in the alignment of text content and position. To improve the model's perception of the background, we further utilize an additional loss function for background characters classification in the denoising training part.Although DNTextSpotter is conceptually simple, it outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on four benchmarks (Total-Text, SCUT-CTW1500, ICDAR15, and Inverse-Text), especially yielding an improvement of 11.3% against the best approach in Inverse-Text dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wencheng Han, Jianbing Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: In the area of self-supervised monocular depth estimation, models that utilize rich-resource inputs, such as high-resolution and multi-frame inputs, typically achieve better performance than models that use ordinary single image input. However, these rich-resource inputs may not always be available, limiting the applicability of these methods in general scenarios. In this paper, we propose Rich-resource Prior Depth estimator (RPrDepth), which only requires single input image during the inference phase but can still produce highly accurate depth estimations comparable to rich resource based methods. Specifically, we treat rich-resource data as prior information and extract features from it as reference features in an offline manner. When estimating the depth for a single-image image, we search for similar pixels from the rich-resource features and use them as prior information to estimate the depth. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperform other single-image model and can achieve comparable or even better performance than models with rich-resource inputs, only using low-resolution single-image input.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingfeng Shi, Jing Wei, Fei Shen, Zhengtao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Image generation can solve insufficient labeled data issues in defect detection. Most defect generation methods are only trained on a single product without considering the consistencies among multiple products, leading to poor quality and diversity of generated results. To address these issues, we propose DefectDiffu, a novel text-guided diffusion method to model both intra-product background consistency and inter-product defect consistency across multiple products and modulate the consistency perturbation directions to control product type and defect strength, achieving diversified defect image generation. Firstly, we leverage a text encoder to separately provide consistency prompts for background, defect, and fusion parts of the disentangled integrated architecture, thereby disentangling defects and normal backgrounds. Secondly, we propose the double-free strategy to generate defect images through two-stage perturbation of consistency direction, thereby controlling product type and defect strength by adjusting the perturbation scale. Besides, DefectDiffu can generate defect mask annotations utilizing cross-attention maps from the defect part. Finally, to improve the generation quality of small defects and masks, we propose the adaptive attention-enhance loss to increase the attention to defects. Experimental results demonstrate that DefectDiffu surpasses state-of-the-art methods in terms of generation quality and diversity, thus effectively improving downstream defection performance. Moreover, defect perturbation directions can be transferred among various products to achieve zero-shot defect generation, which is highly beneficial for addressing insufficient data issues.

<p>Abstract: AI-generated synthetic media, also called Deepfakes, have significantly influenced so many domains, from entertainment to cybersecurity. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models (DMs) are the main frameworks used to create Deepfakes, producing highly realistic yet fabricated content. While these technologies open up new creative possibilities, they also bring substantial ethical and security risks due to their potential misuse. The rise of such advanced media has led to the development of a cognitive bias known as Impostor Bias, where individuals doubt the authenticity of multimedia due to the awareness of AI's capabilities. As a result, Deepfake detection has become a vital area of research, focusing on identifying subtle inconsistencies and artifacts with machine learning techniques, especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Research in forensic Deepfake technology encompasses five main areas: detection, attribution and recognition, passive authentication, detection in realistic scenarios, and active authentication. Each area tackles specific challenges, from tracing the origins of synthetic media and examining its inherent characteristics for authenticity. This paper reviews the primary algorithms that address these challenges, examining their advantages, limitations, and future prospects.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the e-commerce realm, compelling advertising images are pivotal for attracting customer attention. While generative models automate image generation, they often produce substandard images that may mislead customers and require significant labor costs to inspect. This paper delves into increasing the rate of available generated images. We first introduce a multi-modal Reliable Feedback Network (RFNet) to automatically inspect the generated images. Combining the RFNet into a recurrent process, Recurrent Generation, results in a higher number of available advertising images. To further enhance production efficiency, we fine-tune diffusion models with an innovative Consistent Condition regularization utilizing the feedback from RFNet (RFFT). This results in a remarkable increase in the available rate of generated images, reducing the number of attempts in Recurrent Generation, and providing a highly efficient production process without sacrificing visual appeal. We also construct a Reliable Feedback 1 Million (RF1M) dataset which comprises over one million generated advertising images annotated by human, which helps to train RFNet to accurately assess the availability of generated images and faithfully reflect the human feedback. Generally speaking, our approach offers a reliable solution for advertising image generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenqing Gan, Yan Sun, Feiran Liu, Xiangfeng Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: The objective of the panoramic activity recognition task is to identify behaviors at various granularities within crowded and complex environments, encompassing individual actions, social group activities, and global activities. Existing methods generally use either parameter-independent modules to capture task-specific features or parameter-sharing modules to obtain common features across all tasks. However, there is often a strong interrelatedness and complementary effect between tasks of different granularities that previous methods have yet to notice. In this paper, we propose a model called MPT-PAR that considers both the unique characteristics of each task and the synergies between different tasks simultaneously, thereby maximizing the utilization of features across multi-granularity activity recognition. Furthermore, we emphasize the significance of temporal and spatial information by introducing a spatio-temporal relation-enhanced module and a scene representation learning module, which integrate the the spatio-temporal context of action and global scene into the feature map of each granularity. Our method achieved an overall F1 score of 47.5\% on the JRDB-PAR dataset, significantly outperforming all the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thiziri Nait Saada, Valentina Di-Proietto, Benoit Schmauch, Katharina Von Loga, Lucas Fidon</p>
<p>Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) models have proven effective for cancer prognosis from Whole Slide Images. However, the original MIL formulation incorrectly assumes the patches of the same image to be independent, leading to a loss of spatial context as information flows through the network. Incorporating contextual knowledge into predictions is particularly important given the inclination for cancerous cells to form clusters and the presence of spatial indicators for tumors. State-of-the-art methods often use attention mechanisms eventually combined with graphs to capture spatial knowledge. In this paper, we take a novel and transversal approach, addressing this issue through the lens of regularization. We propose Context-Aware Regularization for Multiple Instance Learning (CARMIL), a versatile regularization scheme designed to seamlessly integrate spatial knowledge into any MIL model. Additionally, we present a new and generic metric to quantify the Context-Awareness of any MIL model when applied to Whole Slide Images, resolving a previously unexplored gap in the field. The efficacy of our framework is evaluated for two survival analysis tasks on glioblastoma (TCGA GBM) and colon cancer data (TCGA COAD).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youjia Fu, Zihao Xu, Junsong Fu, Huixia Xue, Shuqiu Tan, Lei Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in transformer-based monocular 3D object detection techniques have exhibited exceptional performance in inferring 3D attributes from single 2D images. However, most existing methods rely on resource-intensive transformer architectures, which often lead to significant drops in computational efficiency and performance when handling long sequence data. To address these challenges and advance monocular 3D object detection technology, we propose an innovative network architecture, MonoMM, a Multi-scale \textbf{M}amba-Enhanced network for real-time Monocular 3D object detection. This well-designed architecture primarily includes the following two core modules: Focused Multi-Scale Fusion (FMF) Module, which focuses on effectively preserving and fusing image information from different scales with lower computational resource consumption. By precisely regulating the information flow, the FMF module enhances the model adaptability and robustness to scale variations while maintaining image details. Depth-Aware Feature Enhancement Mamba (DMB) Module: It utilizes the fused features from image characteristics as input and employs a novel adaptive strategy to globally integrate depth information and visual information. This depth fusion strategy not only improves the accuracy of depth estimation but also enhances the model performance under different viewing angles and environmental conditions. Moreover, the modular design of MonoMM provides high flexibility and scalability, facilitating adjustments and optimizations according to specific application needs. Extensive experiments conducted on the KITTI dataset show that our method outperforms previous monocular methods and achieves real-time detection.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00441">Focus, Distinguish, and Prompt: Unleashing CLIP for Efficient and Flexible Scene Text Retrieval</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Gangyan Zeng, Yuan Zhang, Jin Wei, Dongbao Yang, Peng Zhang, Yiwen Gao, Xugong Qin, Yu Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Scene text retrieval aims to find all images containing the query text from an image gallery. Current efforts tend to adopt an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) pipeline, which requires complicated text detection and/or recognition processes, resulting in inefficient and inflexible retrieval. Different from them, in this work we propose to explore the intrinsic potential of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) for OCR-free scene text retrieval. Through empirical analysis, we observe that the main challenges of CLIP as a text retriever are: 1) limited text perceptual scale, and 2) entangled visual-semantic concepts. To this end, a novel model termed FDP (Focus, Distinguish, and Prompt) is developed. FDP first focuses on scene text via shifting the attention to the text area and probing the hidden text knowledge, and then divides the query text into content word and function word for processing, in which a semantic-aware prompting scheme and a distracted queries assistance module are utilized. Extensive experiments show that FDP significantly enhances the inference speed while achieving better or competitive retrieval accuracy compared to existing methods. Notably, on the IIIT-STR benchmark, FDP surpasses the state-of-the-art model by 4.37% with a 4 times faster speed. Furthermore, additional experiments under phrase-level and attribute-aware scene text retrieval settings validate FDP's particular advantages in handling diverse forms of query text.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manuel Kansy, Jacek Naruniec, Christopher Schroers, Markus Gross, Romann M. Weber</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent years have seen a tremendous improvement in the quality of video generation and editing approaches. While several techniques focus on editing appearance, few address motion. Current approaches using text, trajectories, or bounding boxes are limited to simple motions, so we specify motions with a single motion reference video instead. We further propose to use a pre-trained image-to-video model rather than a text-to-video model. This approach allows us to preserve the exact appearance and position of a target object or scene and helps disentangle appearance from motion. Our method, called motion-textual inversion, leverages our observation that image-to-video models extract appearance mainly from the (latent) image input, while the text/image embedding injected via cross-attention predominantly controls motion. We thus represent motion using text/image embedding tokens. By operating on an inflated motion-text embedding containing multiple text/image embedding tokens per frame, we achieve a high temporal motion granularity. Once optimized on the motion reference video, this embedding can be applied to various target images to generate videos with semantically similar motions. Our approach does not require spatial alignment between the motion reference video and target image, generalizes across various domains, and can be applied to various tasks such as full-body and face reenactment, as well as controlling the motion of inanimate objects and the camera. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in the semantic video motion transfer task, significantly outperforming existing methods in this context.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00470">Image Super-Resolution with Taylor Expansion Approximation and Large Field Reception</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiancong Feng, Yuan-Gen Wang, Mingjie Li, Fengchuang Xing</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-similarity techniques are booming in blind super-resolution (SR) due to accurate estimation of the degradation types involved in low-resolution images. However, high-dimensional matrix multiplication within self-similarity computation prohibitively consumes massive computational costs. We find that the high-dimensional attention map is derived from the matrix multiplication between Query and Key, followed by a softmax function. This softmax makes the matrix multiplication between Query and Key inseparable, posing a great challenge in simplifying computational complexity. To address this issue, we first propose a second-order Taylor expansion approximation (STEA) to separate the matrix multiplication of Query and Key, resulting in the complexity reduction from $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(N)$. Then, we design a multi-scale large field reception (MLFR) to compensate for the performance degradation caused by STEA. Finally, we apply these two core designs to laboratory and real-world scenarios by constructing LabNet and RealNet, respectively. Extensive experimental results tested on five synthetic datasets demonstrate that our LabNet sets a new benchmark in qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Tested on the RealWorld38 dataset, our RealNet achieves superior visual quality over existing methods. Ablation studies further verify the contributions of STEA and MLFR towards both LabNet and RealNet frameworks.</p>

<p>Abstract: The coexistence of multiple defect categories as well as the substantial class imbalance problem significantly impair the detection of sewer pipeline defects. To solve this problem, a multi-label pipe defect recognition method is proposed based on mask attention guided feature enhancement and label correlation learning. The proposed method can achieve current approximate state-of-the-art classification performance using just 1/16 of the Sewer-ML training dataset and exceeds the current best method by 11.87\% in terms of F2 metric on the full dataset, while also proving the superiority of the model. The major contribution of this study is the development of a more efficient model for identifying and locating multiple defects in sewer pipe images for a more accurate sewer pipeline condition assessment. Moreover, by employing class activation maps, our method can accurately pinpoint multiple defect categories in the image which demonstrates a strong model interpretability.

<p>Abstract: Modern Machine Learning (ML) has significantly advanced various research fields, but the opaque nature of ML models hinders their adoption in several domains. Explainable AI (XAI) addresses this challenge by providing additional information to help users understand the internal decision-making process of ML models. In the field of neuroscience, enriching a ML model for brain decoding with attribution-based XAI techniques means being able to highlight which brain areas correlate with the task at hand, thus offering valuable insights to domain experts. In this paper, we analyze human and Computer Vision (CV) systems in parallel, training and explaining two ML models based respectively on functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and movie frames. We do so by leveraging the "StudyForrest" dataset, which includes functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) scans of subjects watching the "Forrest Gump" movie, emotion annotations, and eye-tracking data. For human vision the ML task is to link fMRI data with emotional annotations, and the explanations highlight the brain regions strongly correlated with the label. On the other hand, for computer vision, the input data is movie frames, and the explanations are pixel-level heatmaps. We cross-analyzed our results, linking human attention (obtained through eye-tracking) with XAI saliency on CV models and brain region activations. We show how a parallel analysis of human and computer vision can provide useful information for both the neuroscience community (allocation theory) and the ML community (biological plausibility of convolutional models).</p>

<p>Abstract: Medical imaging segmentation plays a significant role in the automatic recognition and analysis of lesions. State-of-the-art methods, particularly those utilizing transformers, have been prominently adopted in 3D semantic segmentation due to their superior performance in scalability and generalizability. However, plain vision transformers encounter challenges due to their neglect of local features and their high computational complexity. To address these challenges, we introduce three key contributions: Firstly, we proposed SegStitch, an innovative architecture that integrates transformers with denoising ODE blocks. Instead of taking whole 3D volumes as inputs, we adapt axial patches and customize patch-wise queries to ensure semantic consistency. Additionally, we conducted extensive experiments on the BTCV and ACDC datasets, achieving improvements up to 11.48% and 6.71% respectively in mDSC, compared to state-of-the-art methods. Lastly, our proposed method demonstrates outstanding efficiency, reducing the number of parameters by 36.7% and the number of FLOPS by 10.7% compared to UNETR.

<p>Abstract: The exploration of video content via Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) models has unveiled a dynamic field of study, emphasizing both the complex challenges and unique opportunities inherent in this area. Despite the growing body of research, the ability of SSL models to detect physical contacts in videos remains largely unexplored, particularly the effectiveness of methods such as downstream supervision with linear probing or full fine-tuning. This work aims to bridge this gap by employing eight different convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based video SSL models to identify instances of physical contact within video sequences specifically. The Something-Something v2 (SSv2) and Epic-Kitchen (EK-100) datasets were chosen for evaluating these approaches due to the promising results on UCF101 and HMDB51, coupled with their limited prior assessment on SSv2 and EK-100. Additionally, these datasets feature diverse environments and scenarios, essential for testing the robustness and accuracy of video-based models. This approach not only examines the effectiveness of each model in recognizing physical contacts but also explores the performance in the action recognition downstream task. By doing so, valuable insights into the adaptability of SSL models in interpreting complex, dynamic visual information are contributed.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00550">Mitigating Multilingual Hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoye Qu, Mingyang Song, Wei Wei, Jianfeng Dong, Yu Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks, they suffer from hallucination problems, where models generate plausible yet incorrect answers given the input image-query pair. This hallucination phenomenon is even more severe when querying the image in non-English languages, while existing methods for mitigating hallucinations in LVLMs only consider the English scenarios. In this paper, we make the first attempt to mitigate this important multilingual hallucination in LVLMs. With thorough experiment analysis, we found that multilingual hallucination in LVLMs is a systemic problem that could arise from deficiencies in multilingual capabilities or inadequate multimodal abilities. To this end, we propose a two-stage Multilingual Hallucination Removal (MHR) framework for LVLMs, aiming to improve resistance to hallucination for both high-resource and low-resource languages. Instead of relying on the intricate manual annotations of multilingual resources, we fully leverage the inherent capabilities of the LVLM and propose a novel cross-lingual alignment method, which generates multiple responses for each image-query input and then identifies the hallucination-aware pairs for each language. These data pairs are finally used for direct preference optimization to prompt the LVLMs to favor non-hallucinating responses. Experimental results show that our MHR achieves a substantial reduction in hallucination generation for LVLMs. Notably, on our extended multilingual POPE benchmark, our framework delivers an average increase of 19.0% in accuracy across 13 different languages.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoye Qu, Qiyuan Chen, Wei Wei, Jishuo Sun, Jianfeng Dong</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the remarkable ability of large vision-language models (LVLMs) in image comprehension, these models frequently generate plausible yet factually incorrect responses, a phenomenon known as hallucination.Recently, in large language models (LLMs), augmenting LLMs by retrieving information from external knowledge resources has been proven as a promising solution to mitigate hallucinations.However, the retrieval augmentation in LVLM significantly lags behind the widespread applications of LVLM. Moreover, when transferred to augmenting LVLMs, sometimes the hallucination degree of the model is even exacerbated.Motivated by the research gap and counter-intuitive phenomenon, we introduce a novel framework, the Active Retrieval-Augmented large vision-language model (ARA), specifically designed to address hallucinations by incorporating three critical dimensions: (i) dissecting the retrieval targets based on the inherent hierarchical structures of images. (ii) pinpointing the most effective retrieval methods and filtering out the reliable retrieval results. (iii) timing the retrieval process to coincide with episodes of low certainty, while circumventing unnecessary retrieval during periods of high certainty. To assess the capability of our proposed ARA model in reducing hallucination, we employ three widely used LVLM models (LLaVA-1.5, Qwen-VL, and mPLUG-Owl2) across four benchmarks. Our empirical observations suggest that by utilizing fitting retrieval mechanisms and timing the retrieval judiciously, we can effectively mitigate the hallucination problem.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangyuan Peng, Miao Tang, Huawei Sun, Kay Bierzynski, Lorenzo Servadei, Robert Wille</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, approaches based on radar object detection have made significant progress in autonomous driving systems due to their robustness under adverse weather compared to LiDAR. However, the sparsity of radar point clouds poses challenges in achieving precise object detection, highlighting the importance of effective and comprehensive feature extraction technologies. To address this challenge, this paper introduces a comprehensive feature extraction method for radar point clouds. This study first enhances the capability of detection networks by using a plug-and-play module, GeoSPA. It leverages the Lalonde features to explore local geometric patterns. Additionally, a distributed multi-view attention mechanism, DEMVA, is designed to integrate the shared information across the entire dataset with the global information of each individual frame. By employing the two modules, we present our method, MUFASA, which enhances object detection performance through improved feature extraction. The approach is evaluated on the VoD and TJ4DRaDSet datasets to demonstrate its effectiveness. In particular, we achieve state-of-the-art results among radar-based methods on the VoD dataset with the mAP of 50.24%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Rudolph, Aron Riemenschneider, Amr Rizk</p>
<p>Abstract: Point cloud compression is essential to experience volumetric multimedia as it drastically reduces the required streaming data rates. Point attributes, specifically colors, extend the challenge of lossy compression beyond geometric representation to achieving joint reconstruction of texture and geometry. State-of-the-art methods separate geometry and attributes to compress them individually. This comes at a computational cost, requiring an encoder and a decoder for each modality. Additionally, as attribute compression methods require the same geometry for encoding and decoding, the encoder emulates the decoder-side geometry reconstruction as an input step to project and compress the attributes. In this work, we propose to learn joint compression of geometry and attributes using a single, adaptive autoencoder model, embedding both modalities into a unified latent space which is then entropy encoded. Key to the technique is to replace the search for trade-offs between rate, attribute quality and geometry quality, through conditioning the model on the desired qualities of both modalities, bypassing the need for training model ensembles. To differentiate important point cloud regions during encoding or to allow view-dependent compression for user-centered streaming, conditioning is pointwise, which allows for local quality and rate variation. Our evaluation shows comparable performance to state-of-the-art compression methods for geometry and attributes, while reducing complexity compared to related compression methods.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00619">Harnessing Uncertainty-aware Bounding Boxes for Unsupervised 3D Object Detection</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruiyang Zhang, Hu Zhang, Hang Yu, Zhedong Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised 3D object detection aims to identify objects of interest from unlabeled raw data, such as LiDAR points. Recent approaches usually adopt pseudo 3D bounding boxes (3D bboxes) from clustering algorithm to initialize the model training, and then iteratively updating both pseudo labels and the trained model. However, pseudo bboxes inevitably contain noises, and such inaccurate annotation accumulates to the final model, compromising the performance. Therefore, in an attempt to mitigate the negative impact of pseudo bboxes, we introduce a new uncertainty-aware framework. In particular, Our method consists of two primary components: uncertainty estimation and uncertainty regularization. (1) In the uncertainty estimation phase, we incorporate an extra auxiliary detection branch alongside the primary detector. The prediction disparity between the primary and auxiliary detectors is leveraged to estimate uncertainty at the box coordinate level, including position, shape, orientation. (2) Based on the assessed uncertainty, we regularize the model training via adaptively adjusting every 3D bboxes coordinates. For pseudo bbox coordinates with high uncertainty, we assign a relatively low loss weight. Experiment verifies that the proposed method is robust against the noisy pseudo bboxes, yielding substantial improvements on nuScenes and Lyft compared to existing techniques, with increases of 6.9% in AP$_{BEV}$ and 2.5% in AP$_{3D}$ on nuScenes, and 2.2% in AP$_{BEV}$ and 1.0% in AP$_{3D}$ on Lyft.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bozhou Li, Hao Liang, Zimo Meng, Wentao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong potential in real-world applications. They are developing rapidly due to their remarkable ability to comprehend multimodal information and their inherent powerful cognitive and reasoning capabilities. Among MLLMs, vision language models (VLM) stand out for their ability to understand vision information. However, the scaling trend of VLMs under the current mainstream paradigm has not been extensively studied. Whether we can achieve better performance by training even larger models is still unclear. To address this issue, we conducted experiments on the pretraining stage of MLLMs. We conduct our experiment using different encoder sizes and large language model (LLM) sizes. Our findings indicate that merely increasing the size of encoders does not necessarily enhance the performance of VLMs. Moreover, we analyzed the effects of LLM backbone parameter size and data quality on the pretraining outcomes. Additionally, we explored the differences in scaling laws between LLMs and VLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenzhe Tian, Haijin Zeng, Yin-Ping Zhao, Yongyong Chen, Zhen Wang, Xuelong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Snapshot Compressive Imaging (SCI) relies on decoding algorithms such as CNN or Transformer to reconstruct the hyperspectral image (HSI) from its compressed measurement. Although existing CNN and Transformer-based methods have proven effective, CNNs are limited by their inadequate modeling of long-range dependencies, while Transformer ones face high computational costs due to quadratic complexity. Recent Mamba models have demonstrated superior performance over CNN and Transformer-based architectures in some visual tasks, but these models have not fully utilized the local similarities in both spatial and spectral dimensions. Moreover, the long-sequence modeling capability of SSM may offer an advantage in processing the numerous spectral bands for HSI reconstruction, which has not yet been explored. In this paper, we introduce a State Space Model with Across-Scanning and Local Enhancement, named ASLE-SSM, that employs a Spatial-Spectral SSM for global-local balanced context encoding and cross-channel interaction promoting. Specifically, we introduce local scanning in the spatial dimension to balance the global and local receptive fields, and then propose our across-scanning method based on spatial-spectral local cubes to leverage local similarities between adjacent spectral bands and pixels to guide the reconstruction process. These two scanning mechanisms extract the HSI's local features while balancing the global perspective without any additional costs. Experimental results illustrate ASLE-SSM's superiority over existing state-of-the-art methods, with an inference speed 2.4 times faster than Transformer-based MST and saving 0.12 (M) of parameters, achieving the lowest computational cost and parameter count.</p>

<p>Abstract: Brain tumors are among the deadliest diseases in the world. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is one of the most effective ways to detect brain tumors. Accurate detection of brain tumors based on MRI scans is critical, as it can potentially save many lives and facilitate better decision-making at the early stages of the disease. Within our paper, four different types of MRI-based images have been collected from the database: glioma tumor, no tumor, pituitary tumor, and meningioma tumor. Our study focuses on making predictions for brain tumor classification. Five models, including four pre-trained models (MobileNet, EfficientNet-B0, ResNet-18, and VGG16) and one new model, MobileNet-BT, have been proposed for this study.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuri Ge, Junchen Fu, Fuhai Chen, Shan An, Nicu Sebe, Joemon M. Jose</p>
<p>Abstract: Facial action units (AUs), as defined in the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), have received significant research interest owing to their diverse range of applications in facial state analysis. Current mainstream FAU recognition models have a notable limitation, i.e., focusing only on the accuracy of AU recognition and overlooking explanations of corresponding AU states. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end Vision-Language joint learning network for explainable FAU recognition (termed VL-FAU), which aims to reinforce AU representation capability and language interpretability through the integration of joint multimodal tasks. Specifically, VL-FAU brings together language models to generate fine-grained local muscle descriptions and distinguishable global face description when optimising FAU recognition. Through this, the global facial representation and its local AU representations will achieve higher distinguishability among different AUs and different subjects. In addition, multi-level AU representation learning is utilised to improve AU individual attention-aware representation capabilities based on multi-scale combined facial stem feature. Extensive experiments on DISFA and BP4D AU datasets show that the proposed approach achieves superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods on most of the metrics. In addition, compared with mainstream FAU recognition methods, VL-FAU can provide local- and global-level interpretability language descriptions with the AUs' predictions.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present SF3D, a novel method for rapid and high-quality textured object mesh reconstruction from a single image in just 0.5 seconds. Unlike most existing approaches, SF3D is explicitly trained for mesh generation, incorporating a fast UV unwrapping technique that enables swift texture generation rather than relying on vertex colors. The method also learns to predict material parameters and normal maps to enhance the visual quality of the reconstructed 3D meshes. Furthermore, SF3D integrates a delighting step to effectively remove low-frequency illumination effects, ensuring that the reconstructed meshes can be easily used in novel illumination conditions. Experiments demonstrate the superior performance of SF3D over the existing techniques. Project page: https://stable-fast-3d.github.io</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kumar Ashutosh, Tushar Nagarajan, Georgios Pavlakos, Kris Kitani, Kristen Grauman</p>
<p>Abstract: Feedback is essential for learning a new skill or improving one's current skill-level. However, current methods for skill-assessment from video only provide scores or compare demonstrations, leaving the burden of knowing what to do differently on the user. We introduce a novel method to generate actionable feedback from video of a person doing a physical activity, such as basketball or soccer. Our method takes a video demonstration and its accompanying 3D body pose and generates (1) free-form expert commentary describing what the person is doing well and what they could improve, and (2) a visual expert demonstration that incorporates the required corrections. We show how to leverage Ego-Exo4D's videos of skilled activity and expert commentary together with a strong language model to create a weakly-supervised training dataset for this task, and we devise a multimodal video-language model to infer coaching feedback. Our method is able to reason across multi-modal input combinations to output full-spectrum, actionable coaching -- expert commentary, expert video retrieval, and the first-of-its-kind expert pose generation -- outperforming strong vision-language models on both established metrics and human preference studies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ryo Nakamura, Ryu Tadokoro, Ryosuke Yamada, Yuki M. Asano, Iro Laina, Christian Rupprecht, Nakamasa Inoue, Rio Yokota, Hirokatsu Kataoka</p>
<p>Abstract: Pre-training and transfer learning are an important building block of current computer vision systems. While pre-training is usually performed on large real-world image datasets, in this paper we ask whether this is truly necessary. To this end, we search for a minimal, purely synthetic pre-training dataset that allows us to achieve performance similar to the 1 million images of ImageNet-1k. We construct such a dataset from a single fractal with perturbations. With this, we contribute three main findings. (i) We show that pre-training is effective even with minimal synthetic images, with performance on par with large-scale pre-training datasets like ImageNet-1k for full fine-tuning. (ii) We investigate the single parameter with which we construct artificial categories for our dataset. We find that while the shape differences can be indistinguishable to humans, they are crucial for obtaining strong performances. (iii) Finally, we investigate the minimal requirements for successful pre-training. Surprisingly, we find that a substantial reduction of synthetic images from 1k to 1 can even lead to an increase in pre-training performance, a motivation to further investigate ``scaling backwards''. Finally, we extend our method from synthetic images to real images to see if a single real image can show similar pre-training effect through shape augmentation. We find that the use of grayscale images and affine transformations allows even real images to ``scale backwards''.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Camilo J. Vargas, Qianni Zhang, Ebroul Izquierdo</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel joint neural networks approach to address the challenging one-shot object recognition and detection tasks. Inspired by Siamese neural networks and state-of-art multi-box detection approaches, the joint neural networks are able to perform object recognition and detection for categories that remain unseen during the training process. Following the one-shot object recognition/detection constraints, the training and testing datasets do not contain overlapped classes, in other words, all the test classes remain unseen during training. The joint networks architecture is able to effectively compare pairs of images via stacked convolutional layers of the query and target inputs, recognising patterns of the same input query category without relying on previous training around this category. The proposed approach achieves 61.41% accuracy for one-shot object recognition on the MiniImageNet dataset and 47.1% mAP for one-shot object detection when trained on the COCO dataset and tested using the Pascal VOC dataset.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00706">Point-supervised Brain Tumor Segmentation with Box-prompted MedSAM</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaofeng Liu, Jonghye Woo, Chao Ma, Jinsong Ouyang, Georges El Fakhri</p>
<p>Abstract: Delineating lesions and anatomical structure is important for image-guided interventions. Point-supervised medical image segmentation (PSS) has great potential to alleviate costly expert delineation labeling. However, due to the lack of precise size and boundary guidance, the effectiveness of PSS often falls short of expectations. Although recent vision foundational models, such as the medical segment anything model (MedSAM), have made significant advancements in bounding-box-prompted segmentation, it is not straightforward to utilize point annotation, and is prone to semantic ambiguity. In this preliminary study, we introduce an iterative framework to facilitate semantic-aware point-supervised MedSAM. Specifically, the semantic box-prompt generator (SBPG) module has the capacity to convert the point input into potential pseudo bounding box suggestions, which are explicitly refined by the prototype-based semantic similarity. This is then succeeded by a prompt-guided spatial refinement (PGSR) module that harnesses the exceptional generalizability of MedSAM to infer the segmentation mask, which also updates the box proposal seed in SBPG. Performance can be progressively improved with adequate iterations. We conducted an evaluation on BraTS2018 for the segmentation of whole brain tumors and demonstrated its superior performance compared to traditional PSS methods and on par with box-supervised methods.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00707">Synthetic dual image generation for reduction of labeling efforts in semantic segmentation of micrographs with a customized metric function</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Matias Oscar Volman Stern, Dominic Hohs, Andreas Jansche, Timo Bernthaler, Gerhard Schneider</p>
<p>Abstract: Training of semantic segmentation models for material analysis requires micrographs and their corresponding masks. It is quite unlikely that perfect masks will be drawn, especially at the edges of objects, and sometimes the amount of data that can be obtained is small, since only a few samples are available. These aspects make it very problematic to train a robust model. We demonstrate a workflow for the improvement of semantic segmentation models of micrographs through the generation of synthetic microstructural images in conjunction with masks. The workflow only requires joining a few micrographs with their respective masks to create the input for a Vector Quantised-Variational AutoEncoder model that includes an embedding space, which is trained such that a generative model (PixelCNN) learns the distribution of each input, transformed into discrete codes, and can be used to sample new codes. The latter will eventually be decoded by VQ-VAE to generate images alongside corresponding masks for semantic segmentation. To evaluate the synthetic data, we have trained U-Net models with different amounts of these synthetic data in conjunction with real data. These models were then evaluated using non-synthetic images only. Additionally, we introduce a customized metric derived from the mean Intersection over Union (mIoU). The proposed metric prevents a few falsely predicted pixels from greatly reducing the value of the mIoU. We have achieved a reduction in sample preparation and acquisition times, as well as the efforts, needed for image processing and labeling tasks, are less when it comes to training semantic segmentation model. The approach could be generalized to various types of image data such that it serves as a user-friendly solution for training models with a small number of real images.</p>

<p>Abstract: The focus of this paper is 3D motion editing. Given a 3D human motion and a textual description of the desired modification, our goal is to generate an edited motion as described by the text. The challenges include the lack of training data and the design of a model that faithfully edits the source motion. In this paper, we address both these challenges. We build a methodology to semi-automatically collect a dataset of triplets in the form of (i) a source motion, (ii) a target motion, and (iii) an edit text, and create the new MotionFix dataset. Having access to such data allows us to train a conditional diffusion model, TMED, that takes both the source motion and the edit text as input. We further build various baselines trained only on text-motion pairs datasets, and show superior performance of our model trained on triplets. We introduce new retrieval-based metrics for motion editing and establish a new benchmark on the evaluation set of MotionFix. Our results are encouraging, paving the way for further research on finegrained motion generation. Code and models will be made publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gilad Deutch, Rinon Gal, Daniel Garibi, Or Patashnik, Daniel Cohen-Or</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have opened the path to a wide range of text-based image editing frameworks. However, these typically build on the multi-step nature of the diffusion backwards process, and adapting them to distilled, fast-sampling methods has proven surprisingly challenging. Here, we focus on a popular line of text-based editing frameworks - the ``edit-friendly'' DDPM-noise inversion approach. We analyze its application to fast sampling methods and categorize its failures into two classes: the appearance of visual artifacts, and insufficient editing strength. We trace the artifacts to mismatched noise statistics between inverted noises and the expected noise schedule, and suggest a shifted noise schedule which corrects for this offset. To increase editing strength, we propose a pseudo-guidance approach that efficiently increases the magnitude of edits without introducing new artifacts. All in all, our method enables text-based image editing with as few as three diffusion steps, while providing novel insights into the mechanisms behind popular text-based editing approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: Foundation models are rapidly being developed for computational pathology applications. However, it remains an open question which factors are most important for downstream performance with data scale and diversity, model size, and training algorithm all playing a role. In this work, we present the result of scaling both data and model size, surpassing previous studies in both dimensions, and introduce two new models: Virchow 2, a 632M parameter vision transformer, and Virchow 2G, a 1.85B parameter vision transformer, each trained with 3.1M histopathology whole slide images. To support this scale, we propose domain-inspired adaptations to the DINOv2 training algorithm, which is quickly becoming the default method in self-supervised learning for computational pathology. We achieve state of the art performance on twelve tile-level tasks, as compared to the top performing competing models. Our results suggest that data diversity and domain-specific training can outperform models that only scale in the number of parameters, but, on average, performance benefits from domain-tailoring, data scale, and model scale.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siyu Jiao, Hongguang Zhu, Jiannan Huang, Yao Zhao, Yunchao Wei, Humphrey Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models, e.g. CLIP, have been increasingly used to address the challenging Open-Vocabulary Segmentation (OVS) task, benefiting from their well-aligned vision-text embedding space. Typical solutions involve either freezing CLIP during training to unilaterally maintain its zero-shot capability, or fine-tuning CLIP vision encoder to achieve perceptual sensitivity to local regions. However, few of them incorporate vision-text collaborative optimization. Based on this, we propose the Content-Dependent Transfer to adaptively enhance each text embedding by interacting with the input image, which presents a parameter-efficient way to optimize the text representation. Besides, we additionally introduce a Representation Compensation strategy, reviewing the original CLIP-V representation as compensation to maintain the zero-shot capability of CLIP. In this way, the vision and text representation of CLIP are optimized collaboratively, enhancing the alignment of the vision-text feature space. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to establish the collaborative vision-text optimizing mechanism within the OVS field. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method achieves superior performance on popular OVS benchmarks. In open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art approaches by +0.5, +2.3, +3.4, +0.4 and +1.1 mIoU, respectively on A-847, A-150, PC-459, PC-59 and PAS-20. Furthermore, in a panoptic setting on ADE20K, we achieve the performance of 27.1 PQ, 73.5 SQ, and 32.9 RQ. Code will be available at https://github.com/jiaosiyu1999/MAFT-Plus.git .</p>

Plant scientists and breeders benefit from tools that can directly measure plant parameters in the field i.e. on-site phenotyping. The estimation of leaf angles by manual means in a field setting is tedious and cumbersome. We mitigate the tedium using a combination of the Mask R-CNN instance segmentation neural network, and Line Segment Transformer (LETR), a vision transformer. The proposed Computer Vision (CV) pipeline is applied on two image datasets, Summer 2015-Ames ULA and Summer 2015- Ames MLA, with a combined total of 1,827 plant images collected in the field using FieldBook, an Android application aimed at on-site phenotyping. The leaf angles estimated by the proposed pipeline on the image datasets are compared to two independent manual measurements using ImageJ, a Java-based image processing program developed at the National Institutes of Health and the Laboratory for Optical and Computational Instrumentation. The results, when compared for similarity using the Cosine Similarity measure, exhibit 0.98 similarity scores on both independent measurements of Summer 2015-Ames ULA and Summer 2015-Ames MLA image datasets, demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed pipeline for on-site measurement of leaf angles.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benlin Liu, Yuhao Dong, Yiqin Wang, Yongming Rao, Yansong Tang, Wei-Chiu Ma, Ranjay Krishna</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal language models (MLLMs) are increasingly being implemented in real-world environments, necessitating their ability to interpret 3D spaces and comprehend temporal dynamics. Despite their potential, current top models within our community still fall short in adequately understanding spatial and temporal dimensions. We introduce Coarse Correspondence, a simple, training-free, effective, and general-purpose visual prompting method to elicit 3D and temporal understanding in multimodal LLMs. Our method uses a lightweight tracking model to find object correspondences between frames in a video or between sets of image viewpoints. It selects the most frequent object instances and visualizes them with markers with unique IDs in the image. With this simple approach, we achieve state-of-the-art results on 3D understanding benchmarks including ScanQA (+20.5\%) and a subset of OpenEQA (+9.7\%), and on long-form video benchmarks such as EgoSchema (+6.0\%). We also curate a small diagnostic dataset to evaluate whether MLLMs can reason about space from a described viewpoint other than the camera viewpoint. Again, Coarse Correspondence improves spatial perspective-taking abilities but we highlight that MLLMs struggle with this task. Together, we demonstrate that our simple prompting method can significantly aid downstream tasks that require 3D or temporal reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyu Dong, Hanxue Gu, Yaqian Chen, Jichen Yang, Maciej A. Mazurowski</p>
<p>Abstract: Segment Anything Model (SAM) has gained significant attention because of its ability to segment a variety of objects in images given a prompt. The recently developed SAM 2 has extended this ability to video inputs. This opens an opportunity to apply SAM to 3D images, one of the fundamental tasks in the medical imaging field. In this paper, we provide an extensive evaluation of SAM 2's ability to segment both 2D and 3D medical images. We collect 18 medical imaging datasets, including common 3D modalities such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET) as well as 2D modalities such as X-ray and ultrasound. We consider two evaluation pipelines of SAM 2: (1) multi-frame 3D segmentation, where prompts are provided to one or multiple slice(s) selected from the volume, and (2) single-frame 2D segmentation, where prompts are provided to each slice. The former is only applicable to 3D modalities, while the latter applies to both 2D and 3D modalities. We learn that SAM 2 exhibits similar performance as SAM under single-frame 2D segmentation, and has variable performance under multi-frame 3D segmentation depending on the choices of slices to annotate, the direction of the propagation, the predictions utilized during the propagation, etc.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Fan, Jue Wang, Shuai Liao, Zhikang Zhang, Vimal Bhat, Xinyu Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent video masked autoencoder (MAE) works have designed improved masking algorithms focused on saliency. These works leverage visual cues such as motion to mask the most salient regions. However, the robustness of such visual cues depends on how often input videos match underlying assumptions. On the other hand, natural language description is an information dense representation of video that implicitly captures saliency without requiring modality-specific assumptions, and has not been explored yet for video MAE. To this end, we introduce a novel text-guided masking algorithm (TGM) that masks the video regions with highest correspondence to paired captions. Without leveraging any explicit visual cues for saliency, our TGM is competitive with state-of-the-art masking algorithms such as motion-guided masking. To further benefit from the semantics of natural language for masked reconstruction, we next introduce a unified framework for joint MAE and masked video-text contrastive learning. We show that across existing masking algorithms, unifying MAE and masked video-text contrastive learning improves downstream performance compared to pure MAE on a variety of video recognition tasks, especially for linear probe. Within this unified framework, our TGM achieves the best relative performance on five action recognition and one egocentric datasets, highlighting the complementary nature of natural language for masked video modeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Susung Hong</p>
<p>Abstract: Conditional diffusion models have shown remarkable success in visual content generation, producing high-quality samples across various domains, largely due to classifier-free guidance (CFG). Recent attempts to extend guidance to unconditional models have relied on heuristic techniques, resulting in suboptimal generation quality and unintended effects. In this work, we propose Smoothed Energy Guidance (SEG), a novel training- and condition-free approach that leverages the energy-based perspective of the self-attention mechanism to enhance image generation. By defining the energy of self-attention, we introduce a method to reduce the curvature of the energy landscape of attention and use the output as the unconditional prediction. Practically, we control the curvature of the energy landscape by adjusting the Gaussian kernel parameter while keeping the guidance scale parameter fixed. Additionally, we present a query blurring method that is equivalent to blurring the entire attention weights without incurring quadratic complexity in the number of tokens. In our experiments, SEG achieves a Pareto improvement in both quality and the reduction of side effects. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/SusungHong/SEG-SDXL}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangyu Fan, Jiaqi Li, Zhiqian Lin, Weiye Xiao, Lei Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Audio-driven 3D facial animation aims to map input audio to realistic facial motion. Despite significant progress, limitations arise from inconsistent 3D annotations, restricting previous models to training on specific annotations and thereby constraining the training scale. In this work, we present UniTalker, a unified model featuring a multi-head architecture designed to effectively leverage datasets with varied annotations. To enhance training stability and ensure consistency among multi-head outputs, we employ three training strategies, namely, PCA, model warm-up, and pivot identity embedding. To expand the training scale and diversity, we assemble A2F-Bench, comprising five publicly available datasets and three newly curated datasets. These datasets contain a wide range of audio domains, covering multilingual speech voices and songs, thereby scaling the training data from commonly employed datasets, typically less than 1 hour, to 18.5 hours. With a single trained UniTalker model, we achieve substantial lip vertex error reductions of 9.2% for BIWI dataset and 13.7% for Vocaset. Additionally, the pre-trained UniTalker exhibits promise as the foundation model for audio-driven facial animation tasks. Fine-tuning the pre-trained UniTalker on seen datasets further enhances performance on each dataset, with an average error reduction of 6.3% on A2F-Bench. Moreover, fine-tuning UniTalker on an unseen dataset with only half the data surpasses prior state-of-the-art models trained on the full dataset.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weihao Yu, Zhengyuan Yang, Linfeng Ren, Linjie Li, Jianfeng Wang, Kevin Lin, Chung-Ching Lin, Zicheng Liu, Lijuan Wang, Xinchao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: MM-Vet, with open-ended vision-language questions targeting at evaluating integrated capabilities, has become one of the most popular benchmarks for large multimodal model evaluation. MM-Vet assesses six core vision-language (VL) capabilities: recognition, knowledge, spatial awareness, language generation, OCR, and math. However, its question format is restricted to single image-text pairs, lacking the interleaved image and text sequences prevalent in real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we introduce MM-Vet v2, which includes a new VL capability called "image-text sequence understanding", evaluating models' ability to process VL sequences. Furthermore, we maintain the high quality of evaluation samples while further expanding the evaluation set size. Using MM-Vet v2 to benchmark large multimodal models, we found that Claude 3.5 Sonnet is the best model with a score of 71.8, slightly outperforming GPT-4o which scored 71.0. Among open-weight models, InternVL2-Llama3-76B leads with a score of 68.4.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion models are promising for joint trajectory prediction and controllable generation in autonomous driving, but they face challenges of inefficient inference steps and high computational demands. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Optimal Gaussian Diffusion (OGD) and Estimated Clean Manifold (ECM) Guidance. OGD optimizes the prior distribution for a small diffusion time $T$ and starts the reverse diffusion process from it. ECM directly injects guidance gradients to the estimated clean manifold, eliminating extensive gradient backpropagation throughout the network. Our methodology streamlines the generative process, enabling practical applications with reduced computational overhead. Experimental validation on the large-scale Argoverse 2 dataset demonstrates our approach's superior performance, offering a viable solution for computationally efficient, high-quality joint trajectory prediction and controllable generation for autonomous driving.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaiyuan Tang, Chaoli Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: In volume visualization, visualization synthesis has attracted much attention due to its ability to generate novel visualizations without following the conventional rendering pipeline. However, existing solutions based on generative adversarial networks often require many training images and take significant training time. Still, issues such as low quality, consistency, and flexibility persist. This paper introduces StyleRF-VolVis, an innovative style transfer framework for expressive volume visualization (VolVis) via neural radiance field (NeRF). The expressiveness of StyleRF-VolVis is upheld by its ability to accurately separate the underlying scene geometry (i.e., content) and color appearance (i.e., style), conveniently modify color, opacity, and lighting of the original rendering while maintaining visual content consistency across the views, and effectively transfer arbitrary styles from reference images to the reconstructed 3D scene. To achieve these, we design a base NeRF model for scene geometry extraction, a palette color network to classify regions of the radiance field for photorealistic editing, and an unrestricted color network to lift the color palette constraint via knowledge distillation for non-photorealistic editing. We demonstrate the superior quality, consistency, and flexibility of StyleRF-VolVis by experimenting with various volume rendering scenes and reference images and comparing StyleRF-VolVis against other image-based (AdaIN), video-based (ReReVST), and NeRF-based (ARF and SNeRF) style rendering solutions.</p>

<p>Abstract: A central problem in biology is to understand how organisms evolve and adapt to their environment by acquiring variations in the observable characteristics or traits of species across the tree of life. With the growing availability of large-scale image repositories in biology and recent advances in generative modeling, there is an opportunity to accelerate the discovery of evolutionary traits automatically from images. Toward this goal, we introduce Phylo-Diffusion, a novel framework for conditioning diffusion models with phylogenetic knowledge represented in the form of HIERarchical Embeddings (HIER-Embeds). We also propose two new experiments for perturbing the embedding space of Phylo-Diffusion: trait masking and trait swapping, inspired by counterpart experiments of gene knockout and gene editing/swapping. Our work represents a novel methodological advance in generative modeling to structure the embedding space of diffusion models using tree-based knowledge. Our work also opens a new chapter of research in evolutionary biology by using generative models to visualize evolutionary changes directly from images. We empirically demonstrate the usefulness of Phylo-Diffusion in capturing meaningful trait variations for fishes and birds, revealing novel insights about the biological mechanisms of their evolution.</p>

<p>Abstract: Modern medical image registration approaches predict deformations using deep networks. These approaches achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) registration accuracy and are generally fast. However, deep learning (DL) approaches are, in contrast to conventional non-deep-learning-based approaches, anatomy-specific. Recently, a universal deep registration approach, uniGradICON, has been proposed. However, uniGradICON focuses on monomodal image registration. In this work, we therefore develop multiGradICON as a first step towards universal *multimodal* medical image registration. Specifically, we show that 1) we can train a DL registration model that is suitable for monomodal *and* multimodal registration; 2) loss function randomization can increase multimodal registration accuracy; and 3) training a model with multimodal data helps multimodal generalization.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiran Xu, Nan Zhong, Zhenxing Qian, Xinpeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep models are being applied in numerous fields and have become a new important digital product. Meanwhile, previous studies have shown that deep models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, in which compromised models return attacker-desired results when a trigger appears. Backdoor attacks severely break the trust-worthiness of deep models. In this paper, we turn this weakness of deep models into a strength, and propose a novel revocable backdoor and deep model trading scenario. Specifically, we aim to compromise deep models without degrading their performance, meanwhile, we can easily detoxify poisoned models without re-training the models. We design specific mask matrices to manage the internal feature maps of the models. These mask matrices can be used to deactivate the backdoors. The revocable backdoor can be adopted in the deep model trading scenario. Sellers train models with revocable backdoors as a trial version. Buyers pay a deposit to sellers and obtain a trial version of the deep model. If buyers are satisfied with the trial version, they pay a final payment to sellers and sellers send mask matrices to buyers to withdraw revocable backdoors. We demonstrate the feasibility and robustness of our revocable backdoor by various datasets and network architectures.</p>

Our results show that U-KAN and UKAN-SE, with approximately 10.6 million parameters, achieve exceptional efficiency, requiring only about 1/4 of the training time of U-Net and Attention U-Net, and 1/6 that of Swin UNETR, while surpassing these models across most evaluation metrics.

<p>Abstract: Recently Diffusion-based Purification (DiffPure) has been recognized as an effective defense method against adversarial examples. However, we find DiffPure which directly employs the original pre-trained diffusion models for adversarial purification, to be suboptimal. This is due to an inherent trade-off between noise purification performance and data recovery quality. Additionally, the reliability of existing evaluations for DiffPure is questionable, as they rely on weak adaptive attacks. In this work, we propose a novel Adversarial Diffusion Bridge Model, termed ADBM. ADBM directly constructs a reverse bridge from the diffused adversarial data back to its original clean examples, enhancing the purification capabilities of the original diffusion models. Through theoretical analysis and experimental validation across various scenarios, ADBM has proven to be a superior and robust defense mechanism, offering significant promise for practical applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Current visual navigation systems often treat the environment as static, lacking the ability to adaptively interact with obstacles. This limitation leads to navigation failure when encountering unavoidable obstructions. In response, we introduce IN-Sight, a novel approach to self-supervised path planning, enabling more effective navigation strategies through interaction with obstacles. Utilizing RGB-D observations, IN-Sight calculates traversability scores and incorporates them into a semantic map, facilitating long-range path planning in complex, maze-like environments. To precisely navigate around obstacles, IN-Sight employs a local planner, trained imperatively on a differentiable costmap using representation learning techniques. The entire framework undergoes end-to-end training within the state-of-the-art photorealistic Intel SPEAR Simulator. We validate the effectiveness of IN-Sight through extensive benchmarking in a variety of simulated scenarios and ablation studies. Moreover, we demonstrate the system's real-world applicability with zero-shot sim-to-real transfer, deploying our planner on the legged robot platform ANYmal, showcasing its practical potential for interactive navigation in real environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: The video topic segmentation (VTS) task segments videos into intelligible, non-overlapping topics, facilitating efficient comprehension of video content and quick access to specific content. VTS is also critical to various downstream video understanding tasks. Traditional VTS methods using shallow features or unsupervised approaches struggle to accurately discern the nuances of topical transitions. Recently, supervised approaches have achieved superior performance on video action or scene segmentation over unsupervised approaches. In this work, we improve supervised VTS by thoroughly exploring multimodal fusion and multimodal coherence modeling. Specifically, (1) we enhance multimodal fusion by exploring different architectures using cross-attention and mixture of experts. (2) To generally strengthen multimodality alignment and fusion, we pre-train and fine-tune the model with multimodal contrastive learning. (3) We propose a new pre-training task tailored for the VTS task, and a novel fine-tuning task for enhancing multimodal coherence modeling for VTS. We evaluate the proposed approaches on educational videos, in the form of lectures, due to the vital role of topic segmentation of educational videos in boosting learning experiences. Additionally, we introduce a large-scale Chinese lecture video dataset to augment the existing English corpus, promoting further research in VTS. Experiments on both English and Chinese lecture datasets demonstrate that our model achieves superior VTS performance compared to competitive unsupervised and supervised baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: Current research on trajectory prediction primarily relies on data collected by onboard sensors of an ego vehicle. With the rapid advancement in connected technologies, such as vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, valuable information from alternate views becomes accessible via wireless networks. The integration of information from alternative views has the potential to overcome the inherent limitations associated with a single viewpoint, such as occlusions and limited field of view. In this work, we introduce V2INet, a novel trajectory prediction framework designed to model multi-view data by extending existing single-view models. Unlike previous approaches where the multi-view data is manually fused or formulated as a separate training stage, our model supports end-to-end training, enhancing both flexibility and performance. Moreover, the predicted multimodal trajectories are calibrated by a post-hoc conformal prediction module to get valid and efficient confidence regions. We evaluated the entire framework using the real-world V2I dataset V2X-Seq. Our results demonstrate superior performance in terms of Final Displacement Error (FDE) and Miss Rate (MR) using a single GPU.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juseung Yun, Yi Hu, Jinhyung Kim, Jongseong Jang, Soonyoung Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in digital pathology have led to the development of numerous foundational models that utilize self-supervised learning on patches extracted from gigapixel whole slide images (WSIs). While this approach leverages vast amounts of unlabeled data, we have discovered a significant issue: features extracted from these self-supervised models tend to cluster by individual WSIs, a phenomenon we term WSI-specific feature collapse. This problem can potentially limit the model's generalization ability and performance on various downstream tasks. To address this issue, we introduce Stain Normalized Pathology Foundational Model, a novel foundational model trained on patches that have undergone stain normalization. Stain normalization helps reduce color variability arising from different laboratories and scanners, enabling the model to learn more consistent features. Stain Normalized Pathology Foundational Model is trained using 285,153,903 patches extracted from a total of 34,795 WSIs, combining data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. Our experiments demonstrate that Stain Normalized Pathology Foundational Model significantly mitigates the feature collapse problem, indicating that the model has learned more generalized features rather than overfitting to individual WSI characteristics. We compared Stain Normalized Pathology Foundational Model with state-of-the-art models across six downstream task datasets, and our results show that \name{} achieves excellent performance relative to the number of WSIs used and the model's parameter count. This suggests that the application of stain normalization has substantially improved the model's efficiency and generalization capabilities.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presented DriveArena, the first high-fidelity closed-loop simulation system designed for driving agents navigating in real scenarios. DriveArena features a flexible, modular architecture, allowing for the seamless interchange of its core components: Traffic Manager, a traffic simulator capable of generating realistic traffic flow on any worldwide street map, and World Dreamer, a high-fidelity conditional generative model with infinite autoregression. This powerful synergy empowers any driving agent capable of processing real-world images to navigate in DriveArena's simulated environment. The agent perceives its surroundings through images generated by World Dreamer and output trajectories. These trajectories are fed into Traffic Manager, achieving realistic interactions with other vehicles and producing a new scene layout. Finally, the latest scene layout is relayed back into World Dreamer, perpetuating the simulation cycle. This iterative process fosters closed-loop exploration within a highly realistic environment, providing a valuable platform for developing and evaluating driving agents across diverse and challenging scenarios. DriveArena signifies a substantial leap forward in leveraging generative image data for the driving simulation platform, opening insights for closed-loop autonomous driving.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chongsheng Zhang, George Almpanidis, Gaojuan Fan, Binquan Deng, Yanbo Zhang, Ji Liu, Aouaidjia Kamel, Paolo Soda, Jo\~ao Gama</p>
<p>Abstract: Long-tailed data is a special type of multi-class imbalanced data with a very large amount of minority/tail classes that have a very significant combined influence. Long-tailed learning aims to build high-performance models on datasets with long-tailed distributions, which can identify all the classes with high accuracy, in particular the minority/tail classes. It is a cutting-edge research direction that has attracted a remarkable amount of research effort in the past few years. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of latest advances in long-tailed visual learning. We first propose a new taxonomy for long-tailed learning, which consists of eight different dimensions, including data balancing, neural architecture, feature enrichment, logits adjustment, loss function, bells and whistles, network optimization, and post hoc processing techniques. Based on our proposed taxonomy, we present a systematic review of long-tailed learning methods, discussing their commonalities and alignable differences. We also analyze the differences between imbalance learning and long-tailed learning approaches. Finally, we discuss prospects and future directions in this field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Bin, Wenhao Shi, Yujuan Ding, Zhiqiang Hu, Zheng Wang, Yang Yang, See-Kiong Ng, Heng Tao Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Artwork analysis is important and fundamental skill for art appreciation, which could enrich personal aesthetic sensibility and facilitate the critical thinking ability. Understanding artworks is challenging due to its subjective nature, diverse interpretations, and complex visual elements, requiring expertise in art history, cultural background, and aesthetic theory. However, limited by the data collection and model ability, previous works for automatically analyzing artworks mainly focus on classification, retrieval, and other simple tasks, which is far from the goal of AI. To facilitate the research progress, in this paper, we step further to compose comprehensive analysis inspired by the remarkable perception and generation ability of large multimodal models. Specifically, we first propose a task of composing paragraph analysis for artworks, i.e., painting in this paper, only focusing on visual characteristics to formulate more comprehensive understanding of artworks. To support the research on formal analysis, we collect a large dataset PaintingForm, with about 19k painting images and 50k analysis paragraphs. We further introduce a superior large multimodal model for painting analysis composing, dubbed GalleryGPT, which is slightly modified and fine-tuned based on LLaVA architecture leveraging our collected data. We conduct formal analysis generation and zero-shot experiments across several datasets to assess the capacity of our model. The results show remarkable performance improvements comparing with powerful baseline LMMs, demonstrating its superb ability of art analysis and generalization. \textcolor{blue}{The codes and model are available at: https://github.com/steven640pixel/GalleryGPT.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jian Li, Bowen Xu, S\"oren Schwertfeger</p>
<p>Abstract: Robotic datasets are important for scientific benchmarking and developing algorithms, for example for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). Modern robotic datasets feature video data of high resolution and high framerates. Storing and sharing those datasets becomes thus very costly, especially if more than one camera is used for the datasets. It is thus essential to store this video data in a compressed format. This paper investigates the use of modern video encoders for robotic datasets. We provide a software that can replay mp4 videos within ROS 1 and ROS 2 frameworks, supporting the synchronized playback in simulated time. Furthermore, the paper evaluates different encoders and their settings to find optimal configurations in terms of resulting size, quality and encoding time. Through this work we show that it is possible to store and share even highest quality video datasets within reasonable storage constraints.</p>

<p>Abstract: Automatic estimation of cardiac ultrasound image quality can be beneficial for guiding operators and ensuring the accuracy of clinical measurements. Previous work often fails to distinguish the view correctness of the echocardiogram from the image quality. Additionally, previous studies only provide a global image quality value, which limits their practical utility. In this work, we developed and compared three methods to estimate image quality: 1) classic pixel-based metrics like the generalized contrast-to-noise ratio (gCNR) on myocardial segments as region of interest and left ventricle lumen as background, obtained using a U-Net segmentation 2) local image coherence derived from a U-Net model that predicts coherence from B-Mode images 3) a deep convolutional network that predicts the quality of each region directly in an end-to-end fashion. We evaluate each method against manual regional image quality annotations by three experienced cardiologists. The results indicate poor performance of the gCNR metric, with Spearman correlation to the annotations of \r{ho} = 0.24. The end-to-end learning model obtains the best result, \r{ho} = 0.69, comparable to the inter-observer correlation, \r{ho} = 0.63. Finally, the coherence-based method, with \r{ho} = 0.58, outperformed the classical metrics and is more generic than the end-to-end approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yichen Lu, Jiaqi Song, Xuankai Chang, Hengwei Bian, Soumi Maiti, Shinji Watanabe</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we present SynesLM, an unified model which can perform three multimodal language understanding tasks: audio-visual automatic speech recognition(AV-ASR) and visual-aided speech/machine translation(VST/VMT). Unlike previous research that focused on lip motion as visual cues for speech signals, our work explores more general visual information within entire frames, such as objects and actions. Additionally, we use synthetic image data to enhance the correlation between image and speech data. We benchmark SynesLM against the How2 dataset, demonstrating performance on par with state-of-the-art (SOTA) models dedicated to AV-ASR while maintaining our multitasking framework. Remarkably, for zero-shot AV-ASR, SynesLM achieved SOTA performance by lowering the Word Error Rate (WER) from 43.4% to 39.4% on the VisSpeech Dataset. Furthermore, our results in VST and VMT outperform the previous results, improving the BLEU score to 43.5 from 37.2 for VST, and to 54.8 from 54.4 for VMT.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francesco Di Salvo, David Tafler, Sebastian Doerrich, Christian Ledig</p>
<p>Abstract: Large and well-annotated datasets are essential for advancing deep learning applications, however often costly or impossible to obtain by a single entity. In many areas, including the medical domain, approaches relying on data sharing have become critical to address those challenges. While effective in increasing dataset size and diversity, data sharing raises significant privacy concerns. Commonly employed anonymization methods based on the k-anonymity paradigm often fail to preserve data diversity, affecting model robustness. This work introduces a novel approach using Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAEs) trained on feature vectors extracted from large pre-trained vision foundation models. Foundation models effectively detect and represent complex patterns across diverse domains, allowing the CVAE to faithfully capture the embedding space of a given data distribution to generate (sample) a diverse, privacy-respecting, and potentially unbounded set of synthetic feature vectors. Our method notably outperforms traditional approaches in both medical and natural image domains, exhibiting greater dataset diversity and higher robustness against perturbations while preserving sample privacy. These results underscore the potential of generative models to significantly impact deep learning applications in data-scarce and privacy-sensitive environments.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Asbj{\o}rn Munk, Jakob Ambsdorf, Sebastian Llambias, Mads Nielsen</p>
<p>Abstract: This study investigates the impact of self-supervised pretraining of 3D semantic segmentation models on a large-scale, domain-specific dataset. We introduce BRAINS-45K, a dataset of 44,756 brain MRI volumes from public sources, the largest public dataset available, and revisit a number of design choices for pretraining modern segmentation architectures by simplifying and optimizing state-of-the-art methods, and combining them with a novel augmentation strategy. The resulting AMAES framework is based on masked-image-modeling and intensity-based augmentation reversal and balances memory usage, runtime, and finetuning performance. Using the popular U-Net and the recent MedNeXt architecture as backbones, we evaluate the effect of pretraining on three challenging downstream tasks, covering single-sequence, low-resource settings, and out-of-domain generalization. The results highlight that pretraining on the proposed dataset with AMAES significantly improves segmentation performance in the majority of evaluated cases, and that it is beneficial to pretrain the model with augmentations, despite pretraing on a large-scale dataset. Code and model checkpoints for reproducing results, as well as the BRAINS-45K dataset are available at \url{https://github.com/asbjrnmunk/amaes}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenyin Gao, Shu Yang, Anru R. Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Noise is ubiquitous during image acquisition. Sufficient denoising is often an important first step for image processing. In recent decades, deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely used for image denoising. Most DNN-based image denoising methods require a large-scale dataset or focus on supervised settings, in which single/pairs of clean images or a set of noisy images are required. This poses a significant burden on the image acquisition process. Moreover, denoisers trained on datasets of limited scale may incur over-fitting. To mitigate these issues, we introduce a new self-supervised framework for image denoising based on the Tucker low-rank tensor approximation. With the proposed design, we are able to characterize our denoiser with fewer parameters and train it based on a single image, which considerably improves the model's generalizability and reduces the cost of data acquisition. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world noisy images have been conducted. Empirical results show that our proposed method outperforms existing non-learning-based methods (e.g., low-pass filter, non-local mean), single-image unsupervised denoisers (e.g., DIP, NN+BM3D) evaluated on both in-sample and out-sample datasets. The proposed method even achieves comparable performances with some supervised methods (e.g., DnCNN).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiheng Han, Irvin Haozhe Zhan, Long Zeng, Yu-Ping Wang, Ran Yi, Minjing Yu, Matthieu Gaetan Lin, Jenny Sheng, Yong-Jin Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Some robust point cloud registration approaches with controllable pose refinement magnitude, such as ICP and its variants, are commonly used to improve 6D pose estimation accuracy. However, the effectiveness of these methods gradually diminishes with the advancement of deep learning techniques and the enhancement of initial pose accuracy, primarily due to their lack of specific design for pose refinement. In this paper, we propose Point Cloud Completion and Keypoint Refinement with Fusion Data (PCKRF), a new pose refinement pipeline for 6D pose estimation. The pipeline consists of two steps. First, it completes the input point clouds via a novel pose-sensitive point completion network. The network uses both local and global features with pose information during point completion. Then, it registers the completed object point cloud with the corresponding target point cloud by our proposed Color supported Iterative KeyPoint (CIKP) method. The CIKP method introduces color information into registration and registers a point cloud around each keypoint to increase stability. The PCKRF pipeline can be integrated with existing popular 6D pose estimation methods, such as the full flow bidirectional fusion network, to further improve their pose estimation accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that our method exhibits superior stability compared to existing approaches when optimizing initial poses with relatively high precision. Notably, the results indicate that our method effectively complements most existing pose estimation techniques, leading to improved performance in most cases. Furthermore, our method achieves promising results even in challenging scenarios involving textureless and symmetrical objects. Our source code is available at https://github.com/zhanhz/KRF.</p>

<p>Abstract: Masked Image Modeling (MIM) is a new self-supervised vision pre-training paradigm using a Vision Transformer (ViT). Previous works can be pixel-based or token-based, using original pixels or discrete visual tokens from parametric tokenizer models, respectively. Our proposed centroid-based approach, CCViT, leverages k-means clustering to obtain centroids for image modeling without supervised training of the tokenizer model, which only takes seconds to create. This non-parametric centroid tokenizer only takes seconds to create and is faster for token inference. The centroids can represent both patch pixels and index tokens with the property of local invariance. Specifically, we adopt patch masking and centroid replacing strategies to construct corrupted inputs, and two stacked encoder blocks to predict corrupted patch tokens and reconstruct original patch pixels. Experiments show that our CCViT achieves 84.4% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K classification with ViT-B and 86.0% with ViT-L. We also transfer our pre-trained model to other downstream tasks. Our approach achieves competitive results with recent baselines without external supervision and distillation training from other models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Venkat Margapuri, Prapti Thapaliya, Mitchell Neilsen</p>
<p>Abstract: High-throughput phenotyping (HTP) of seeds, also known as seed phenotyping, is the comprehensive assessment of complex seed traits such as growth, development, tolerance, resistance, ecology, yield, and the measurement of parameters that form more complex traits. One of the key aspects of seed phenotyping is cereal yield estimation that the seed production industry relies upon to conduct their business. While mechanized seed kernel counters are available in the market currently, they are often priced high and sometimes outside the range of small scale seed production firms' affordability. The development of object tracking neural network models such as You Only Look Once (YOLO) enables computer scientists to design algorithms that can estimate cereal yield inexpensively. The key bottleneck with neural network models is that they require a plethora of labelled training data before they can be put to task. We demonstrate that the use of synthetic imagery serves as a feasible substitute to train neural networks for object tracking that includes the tasks of object classification and detection. Furthermore, we propose a seed kernel counter that uses a low-cost mechanical hopper, trained YOLOv8 neural network model, and object tracking algorithms on StrongSORT and ByteTrack to estimate cereal yield from videos. The experiment yields a seed kernel count with an accuracy of 95.2\% and 93.2\% for Soy and Wheat respectively using the StrongSORT algorithm, and an accuray of 96.8\% and 92.4\% for Soy and Wheat respectively using the ByteTrack algorithm.</p>

<p>Abstract: Advanced text-to-image models such as DALL-E 2 and Midjourney possess the capacity to generate highly realistic images, raising significant concerns regarding the potential proliferation of unsafe content. This includes adult, violent, or deceptive imagery of political figures. Despite claims of rigorous safety mechanisms implemented in these models to restrict the generation of not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content, we successfully devise and exhibit the first prompt attacks on Midjourney, resulting in the production of abundant photorealistic NSFW images. We reveal the fundamental principles of such prompt attacks and suggest strategically substituting high-risk sections within a suspect prompt to evade closed-source safety measures. Our novel framework, SurrogatePrompt, systematically generates attack prompts, utilizing large language models, image-to-text, and image-to-image modules to automate attack prompt creation at scale. Evaluation results disclose an 88% success rate in bypassing Midjourney's proprietary safety filter with our attack prompts, leading to the generation of counterfeit images depicting political figures in violent scenarios. Both subjective and objective assessments validate that the images generated from our attack prompts present considerable safety hazards.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Atif Belal, Akhil Meethal, Francisco Perdigon Romero, Marco Pedersoli, Eric Granger</p>
<p>Abstract: Adapting visual object detectors to operational target domains is a challenging task, commonly achieved using unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods. Recent studies have shown that when the labeled dataset comes from multiple source domains, treating them as separate domains and performing a multi-source domain adaptation (MSDA) improves the accuracy and robustness over blending these source domains and performing a UDA. For adaptation, existing MSDA methods learn domain-invariant and domain-specific parameters (for each source domain). However, unlike single-source UDA methods, learning domain-specific parameters makes them grow significantly in proportion to the number of source domains. This paper proposes a novel MSDA method called Prototype-based Mean Teacher (PMT), which uses class prototypes instead of domain-specific subnets to encode domain-specific information. These prototypes are learned using a contrastive loss, aligning the same categories across domains and separating different categories far apart. Given the use of prototypes, the number of parameters required for our PMT method does not increase significantly with the number of source domains, thus reducing memory issues and possible overfitting. Empirical studies indicate that PMT outperforms state-of-the-art MSDA methods on several challenging object detection datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peijie Qiu, Pan Xiao, Wenhui Zhu, Yalin Wang, Aristeidis Sotiras</p>
<p>Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has been widely used in weakly supervised whole slide image (WSI) classification. Typical MIL methods include a feature embedding part, which embeds the instances into features via a pre-trained feature extractor, and an MIL aggregator that combines instance embeddings into predictions. Most efforts have typically focused on improving these parts. This involves refining the feature embeddings through self-supervised pre-training as well as modeling the correlations between instances separately.
  In this paper, we proposed a sparsely coding MIL (SC-MIL) method that addresses those two aspects at the same time by leveraging sparse dictionary learning. The sparse dictionary learning captures the similarities of instances by expressing them as sparse linear combinations of atoms in an over-complete dictionary. In addition, imposing sparsity improves instance feature embeddings by suppressing irrelevant instances while retaining the most relevant ones. To make the conventional sparse coding algorithm compatible with deep learning, we unrolled it into a sparsely coded module leveraging deep unrolling. The proposed SC module can be incorporated into any existing MIL framework in a plug-and-play manner with an acceptable computational cost. The experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrated that the proposed SC module could substantially boost the performance of state-of-the-art MIL methods.

We present TriDeNT, a novel self-supervised method for utilising privileged data that is not available during inference to improve performance. We demonstrate the efficacy of this method for a range of different paired data including immunohistochemistry, spatial transcriptomics and expert nuclei annotations. In all settings, TriDeNT outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in downstream tasks, with observed improvements of up to 101%. Furthermore, we provide qualitative and quantitative measurements of the features learned by these models and how they differ from baselines. TriDeNT offers a novel method to distil knowledge from scarce or costly data during training, to create significantly better models for routine inputs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zixuan Gong, Qi Zhang, Guangyin Bao, Lei Zhu, Ke Liu, Liang Hu, Duoqian Miao, Yu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The limited data availability and the low signal-to-noise ratio of fMRI signals lead to the challenging task of fMRI-to-image retrieval. State-of-the-art MindEye remarkably improves fMRI-to-image retrieval performance by leveraging a large model, i.e., a 996M MLP Backbone per subject, to align fMRI embeddings to the final hidden layer of CLIP's Vision Transformer (ViT). However, significant individual variations exist among subjects, even under identical experimental setups, mandating the training of large subject-specific models. The substantial parameters pose significant challenges in deploying fMRI decoding on practical devices. To this end, we propose Lite-Mind, a lightweight, efficient, and robust brain representation learning paradigm based on Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), which efficiently aligns fMRI voxels to fine-grained information of CLIP. We elaborately design a DFT backbone with Spectrum Compression and Frequency Projector modules to learn informative and robust voxel embeddings. Our experiments demonstrate that Lite-Mind achieves an impressive 94.6% fMRI-to-image retrieval accuracy on the NSD dataset for Subject 1, with 98.7% fewer parameters than MindEye.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Keqiang Sun, Dor Litvak, Yunzhi Zhang, Hongsheng Li, Jiajun Wu, Shangzhe Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a new method for learning a generative model of articulated 3D animal motions from raw, unlabeled online videos. Unlike existing approaches for 3D motion synthesis, our model requires no pose annotations or parametric shape models for training; it learns purely from a collection of unlabeled web video clips, leveraging semantic correspondences distilled from self-supervised image features. At the core of our method is a video Photo-Geometric Auto-Encoding framework that decomposes each training video clip into a set of explicit geometric and photometric representations, including a rest-pose 3D shape, an articulated pose sequence, and texture, with the objective of re-rendering the input video via a differentiable renderer. This decomposition allows us to learn a generative model over the underlying articulated pose sequences akin to a Variational Auto-Encoding (VAE) formulation, but without requiring any external pose annotations. At inference time, we can generate new motion sequences by sampling from the learned motion VAE, and create plausible 4D animations of an animal automatically within seconds given a single input image.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kibum Kim, Kanghoon Yoon, Yeonjun In, Jinyoung Moon, Donghyun Kim, Chanyoung Park</p>
<p>Abstract: Scene graph generation (SGG) models have suffered from inherent problems regarding the benchmark datasets such as the long-tailed predicate distribution and missing annotation problems. In this work, we aim to alleviate the long-tailed problem of SGG by utilizing unannotated triplets. To this end, we introduce a Self-Training framework for SGG (ST-SGG) that assigns pseudo-labels for unannotated triplets based on which the SGG models are trained. While there has been significant progress in self-training for image recognition, designing a self-training framework for the SGG task is more challenging due to its inherent nature such as the semantic ambiguity and the long-tailed distribution of predicate classes. Hence, we propose a novel pseudo-labeling technique for SGG, called Class-specific Adaptive Thresholding with Momentum (CATM), which is a model-agnostic framework that can be applied to any existing SGG models. Furthermore, we devise a graph structure learner (GSL) that is beneficial when adopting our proposed self-training framework to the state-of-the-art message-passing neural network (MPNN)-based SGG models. Our extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of ST-SGG on various SGG models, particularly in enhancing the performance on fine-grained predicate classes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ragav Sachdeva, Andrew Zisserman</p>
<p>Abstract: In the past few decades, Japanese comics, commonly referred to as Manga, have transcended both cultural and linguistic boundaries to become a true worldwide sensation. Yet, the inherent reliance on visual cues and illustration within manga renders it largely inaccessible to individuals with visual impairments. In this work, we seek to address this substantial barrier, with the aim of ensuring that manga can be appreciated and actively engaged by everyone. Specifically, we tackle the problem of diarisation i.e. generating a transcription of who said what and when, in a fully automatic way.
  To this end, we make the following contributions: (1) we present a unified model, Magi, that is able to (a) detect panels, text boxes and character boxes, (b) cluster characters by identity (without knowing the number of clusters apriori), and (c) associate dialogues to their speakers; (2) we propose a novel approach that is able to sort the detected text boxes in their reading order and generate a dialogue transcript; (3) we annotate an evaluation benchmark for this task using publicly available [English] manga pages. The code, evaluation datasets and the pre-trained model can be found at: https://github.com/ragavsachdeva/magi.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yijun Yang, Zhaohu Xing, Lequan Yu, Chunwang Huang, Huazhu Fu, Lei Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical video segmentation gains increasing attention in clinical practice due to the redundant dynamic references in video frames. However, traditional convolutional neural networks have a limited receptive field and transformer-based networks are mediocre in constructing long-term dependency from the perspective of computational complexity. This bottleneck poses a significant challenge when processing longer sequences in medical video analysis tasks using available devices with limited memory. Recently, state space models (SSMs), famous by Mamba, have exhibited impressive achievements in efficient long sequence modeling, which develops deep neural networks by expanding the receptive field on many vision tasks significantly. Unfortunately, vanilla SSMs failed to simultaneously capture causal temporal cues and preserve non-casual spatial information. To this end, this paper presents a Video Vision Mamba-based framework, dubbed as Vivim, for medical video segmentation tasks. Our Vivim can effectively compress the long-term spatiotemporal representation into sequences at varying scales with our designed Temporal Mamba Block. We also introduce an improved boundary-aware affine constraint across frames to enhance the discriminative ability of Vivim on ambiguous lesions. Extensive experiments on thyroid segmentation, breast lesion segmentation in ultrasound videos, and polyp segmentation in colonoscopy videos demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our Vivim, superior to existing methods. The code is available at: https://github.com/scott-yjyang/Vivim. The dataset will be released once accepted.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shipeng Zhu, Pengfei Fang, Chenjie Zhu, Zuoyan Zhao, Qiang Xu, Hui Xue</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-world text can be damaged by corrosion issues caused by environmental or human factors, which hinder the preservation of the complete styles of texts, e.g., texture and structure. These corrosion issues, such as graffiti signs and incomplete signatures, bring difficulties in understanding the texts, thereby posing significant challenges to downstream applications, e.g., scene text recognition and signature identification. Notably, current inpainting techniques often fail to adequately address this problem and have difficulties restoring accurate text images along with reasonable and consistent styles. Formulating this as an open problem of text image inpainting, this paper aims to build a benchmark to facilitate its study. In doing so, we establish two specific text inpainting datasets which contain scene text images and handwritten text images, respectively. Each of them includes images revamped by real-life and synthetic datasets, featuring pairs of original images, corrupted images, and other assistant information. On top of the datasets, we further develop a novel neural framework, Global Structure-guided Diffusion Model (GSDM), as a potential solution. Leveraging the global structure of the text as a prior, the proposed GSDM develops an efficient diffusion model to recover clean texts. The efficacy of our approach is demonstrated by thorough empirical study, including a substantial boost in both recognition accuracy and image quality. These findings not only highlight the effectiveness of our method but also underscore its potential to enhance the broader field of text image understanding and processing.

<p>Abstract: We evaluate different Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) techniques for reconstructing (3D) plants in varied environments, from indoor settings to outdoor fields. Traditional techniques often struggle to capture the complex details of plants, which is crucial for botanical and agricultural understanding. We evaluate three scenarios with increasing complexity and compare the results with the point cloud obtained using LiDAR as ground truth data. In the most realistic field scenario, the NeRF models achieve a 74.65% F1 score with 30 minutes of training on the GPU, highlighting the efficiency and accuracy of NeRFs in challenging environments. These findings not only demonstrate the potential of NeRF in detailed and realistic 3D plant modeling but also suggest practical approaches for enhancing the speed and efficiency of the 3D reconstruction process.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maurits Bleeker, Mariya Hendriksen, Andrew Yates, Maarten de Rijke</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) mainly rely on contrastive training to learn general-purpose representations of images and captions. We focus on the situation when one image is associated with several captions, each caption containing both information shared among all captions and unique information per caption about the scene depicted in the image. In such cases, it is unclear whether contrastive losses are sufficient for learning task-optimal representations that contain all the information provided by the captions or whether the contrastive learning setup encourages the learning of a simple shortcut that minimizes contrastive loss. We introduce synthetic shortcuts for vision-language: a training and evaluation framework where we inject synthetic shortcuts into image-text data. We show that contrastive VLMs trained from scratch or fine-tuned with data containing these synthetic shortcuts mainly learn features that represent the shortcut. Hence, contrastive losses are not sufficient to learn task-optimal representations, i.e., representations that contain all task-relevant information shared between the image and associated captions. We examine two methods to reduce shortcut learning in our training and evaluation framework: (i) latent target decoding and (ii) implicit feature modification. We show empirically that both methods improve performance on the evaluation task, but only partly reduce shortcut learning when training and evaluating with our shortcut learning framework. Hence, we show the difficulty and challenge of our shortcut learning framework for contrastive vision-language representation learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Atif Belal, Akhil Meethal, Francisco Perdigon Romero, Marco Pedersoli, Eric Granger</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain adaptation methods for object detection (OD) strive to mitigate the impact of distribution shifts by promoting feature alignment across source and target domains. Multi-source domain adaptation (MSDA) allows leveraging multiple annotated source datasets and unlabeled target data to improve the accuracy and robustness of the detection model. Most state-of-the-art MSDA methods for OD perform feature alignment in a class-agnostic manner. This is challenging since the objects have unique modal information due to variations in object appearance across domains. A recent prototype-based approach proposed a class-wise alignment, yet it suffers from error accumulation due to noisy pseudo-labels that can negatively affect adaptation with imbalanced data. To overcome these limitations, we propose an attention-based class-conditioned alignment method for MSDA that aligns instances of each object category across domains. In particular, an attention module coupled with an adversarial domain classifier allows learning domain-invariant and class-specific instance representations. Experimental results on multiple benchmarking MSDA datasets indicate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and is robust to class imbalance using a conceptually simple class-conditioning method.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jing Hao, Yonghui Zhu, Lei He, Moyun Liu, James Kit Hon Tsoi, Kuo Feng Hung</p>
<p>Abstract: Tooth segmentation is a pivotal step in modern digital dentistry, essential for applications across orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning. Despite its importance, this process is fraught with challenges due to the high noise and low contrast inherent in 2D and 3D tooth data. Both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers has shown promise in medical image segmentation, yet each method has limitations in handling long-range dependencies and computational complexity. To address this issue, this paper introduces T-Mamba, integrating frequency-based features and shared bi-positional encoding into vision mamba to address limitations in efficient global feature modeling. Besides, we design a gate selection unit to integrate two features in spatial domain and one feature in frequency domain adaptively. T-Mamba is the first work to introduce frequency-based features into vision mamba, and its flexibility allows it to process both 2D and 3D tooth data without the need for separate modules. Also, the TED3, a large-scale public tooth 2D dental X-ray dataset, has been presented in this paper. Extensive experiments demonstrate that T-Mamba achieves new SOTA results on a public tooth CBCT dataset and outperforms previous SOTA methods on TED3 dataset.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Heitor Rapela Medeiros, Masih Aminbeidokhti, Fidel Guerrero Pena, David Latortue, Eric Granger, Marco Pedersoli</p>
<p>Abstract: A common practice in deep learning involves training large neural networks on massive datasets to achieve high accuracy across various domains and tasks. While this approach works well in many application areas, it often fails drastically when processing data from a new modality with a significant distribution shift from the data used to pre-train the model. This paper focuses on adapting a large object detection model trained on RGB images to new data extracted from IR images with a substantial modality shift. We propose Modality Translator (ModTr) as an alternative to the common approach of fine-tuning a large model to the new modality. ModTr adapts the IR input image with a small transformation network trained to directly minimize the detection loss. The original RGB model can then work on the translated inputs without any further changes or fine-tuning to its parameters. Experimental results on translating from IR to RGB images on two well-known datasets show that our simple approach provides detectors that perform comparably or better than standard fine-tuning, without forgetting the knowledge of the original model. This opens the door to a more flexible and efficient service-based detection pipeline, where a unique and unaltered server, such as an RGB detector, runs constantly while being queried by different modalities, such as IR with the corresponding translations model.

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have shown remarkable proficiency in editing 2D images based on text prompts. However, extending these techniques to edit scenes in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) is complex, as editing individual 2D frames can result in inconsistencies across multiple views. Our crucial insight is that a NeRF scene's geometry can serve as a bridge to integrate these 2D edits. Utilizing this geometry, we employ a depth-conditioned ControlNet to enhance the coherence of each 2D image modification. Moreover, we introduce an inpainting approach that leverages the depth information of NeRF scenes to distribute 2D edits across different images, ensuring robustness against errors and resampling challenges. Our results reveal that this methodology achieves more consistent, lifelike, and detailed edits than existing leading methods for text-driven NeRF scene editing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mariella Dreissig, Simon Ruehle, Florian Piewak, Joschka Boedecker</p>
<p>Abstract: Safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving require robust 3D environment perception algorithms capable of handling diverse and ambiguous surroundings. The predictive performance of classification models is heavily influenced by the dataset and the prior knowledge provided by the annotated labels. While labels guide the learning process, they often fail to capture the inherent relationships between classes that are naturally understood by humans. We propose a training strategy for a 3D LiDAR semantic segmentation model that learns structural relationships between classes through abstraction. This is achieved by implicitly modeling these relationships using a learning rule for hierarchical multi-label classification (HMC). Our detailed analysis demonstrates that this training strategy not only improves the model's confidence calibration but also retains additional information useful for downstream tasks such as fusion, prediction, and planning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Whole brain parcellation requires inferring hundreds of segmentation labels in large image volumes and thus presents significant practical challenges for deep learning approaches. We introduce label merge-and-split, a method that first greatly reduces the effective number of labels required for learning-based whole brain parcellation and then recovers original labels. Using a greedy graph colouring algorithm, our method automatically groups and merges multiple spatially separate labels prior to model training and inference. The merged labels may be semantically unrelated. A deep learning model is trained to predict merged labels. At inference time, original labels are restored using atlas-based influence regions. In our experiments, the proposed approach reduces the number of labels by up to 68% while achieving segmentation accuracy comparable to the baseline method without label merging and splitting. Moreover, model training and inference times as well as GPU memory requirements were reduced significantly. The proposed method can be applied to all semantic segmentation tasks with a large number of spatially separate classes within an atlas-based prior.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuanyuan Liu, Yuxuan Huang, Shuyang Liu, Yibing Zhan, Zijing Chen, Zhe Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: In Video-based Facial Expression Recognition (V-FER), models are typically trained on closed-set datasets with a fixed number of known classes. However, these models struggle with unknown classes common in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a challenging Open-set Video-based Facial Expression Recognition (OV-FER) task, aiming to identify both known and new, unseen facial expressions. While existing approaches use large-scale vision-language models like CLIP to identify unseen classes, we argue that these methods may not adequately capture the subtle human expressions needed for OV-FER. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Human Expression-Sensitive Prompting (HESP) mechanism to significantly enhance CLIP's ability to model video-based facial expression details effectively. Our proposed HESP comprises three components: 1) a textual prompting module with learnable prompts to enhance CLIP's textual representation of both known and unknown emotions, 2) a visual prompting module that encodes temporal emotional information from video frames using expression-sensitive attention, equipping CLIP with a new visual modeling ability to extract emotion-rich information, and 3) an open-set multi-task learning scheme that promotes interaction between the textual and visual modules, improving the understanding of novel human emotions in video sequences. Extensive experiments conducted on four OV-FER task settings demonstrate that HESP can significantly boost CLIP's performance (a relative improvement of 17.93% on AUROC and 106.18% on OSCR) and outperform other state-of-the-art open-set video understanding methods by a large margin.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lingbo Huang, Yushi Chen, Xin He</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, deep learning models have achieved excellent performance in hyperspectral image (HSI) classification. Among the many deep models, Transformer has gradually attracted interest for its excellence in modeling the long-range dependencies of spatial-spectral features in HSI. However, Transformer has the problem of quadratic computational complexity due to the self-attention mechanism, which is heavier than other models and thus has limited adoption in HSI processing. Fortunately, the recently emerging state space model-based Mamba shows great computational efficiency while achieving the modeling power of Transformers. Therefore, in this paper, we make a preliminary attempt to apply the Mamba to HSI classification, leading to the proposed spectral-spatial Mamba (SS-Mamba). Specifically, the proposed SS-Mamba mainly consists of spectral-spatial token generation module and several stacked spectral-spatial Mamba blocks. Firstly, the token generation module converts any given HSI cube to spatial and spectral tokens as sequences. And then these tokens are sent to stacked spectral-spatial mamba blocks (SS-MB). Each SS-MB block consists of two basic mamba blocks and a spectral-spatial feature enhancement module. The spatial and spectral tokens are processed separately by the two basic mamba blocks, respectively. Besides, the feature enhancement module modulates spatial and spectral tokens using HSI sample's center region information. In this way, the spectral and spatial tokens cooperate with each other and achieve information fusion within each block. The experimental results conducted on widely used HSI datasets reveal that the proposed model achieves competitive results compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The Mamba-based method opens a new window for HSI classification.</p>

<p>Abstract: Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) plays a pivotal role in cardiology for diagnostic and interventional procedures. However, using it effectively requires extensive training due to the intricate nature of image acquisition and interpretation. To enhance the efficiency of novice sonographers and reduce variability in scan acquisitions, we propose a novel ultrasound (US) navigation assistance method based on contrastive learning as goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL). We augment the previous framework using a novel contrastive patient batching method (CPB) and a data-augmented contrastive loss, both of which we demonstrate are essential to ensure generalization to anatomical variations across patients. The proposed framework enables navigation to both standard diagnostic as well as intricate interventional views with a single model. Our method was developed with a large dataset of 789 patients and obtained an average error of 6.56 mm in position and 9.36 degrees in angle on a testing dataset of 140 patients, which is competitive or superior to models trained on individual views. Furthermore, we quantitatively validate our method's ability to navigate to interventional views such as the Left Atrial Appendage (LAA) view used in LAA closure. Our approach holds promise in providing valuable guidance during transesophageal ultrasound examinations, contributing to the advancement of skill acquisition for cardiac ultrasound practitioners.</p>

Using a pre-trained VAE and VICReg for the downstream task of writer verification we observed a relative improvement in accuracy of 6.7% and 9% over ResNet-18 supervised baseline with 10% writer labels.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianan Jiang, Hao Tang, Zhilin Jiang, Weiren Yu, Di Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-Grained Sketch-Based Image Retrieval (FG-SBIR) aims to minimize the distance between sketches and corresponding images in the embedding space. However, scalability is hindered by the growing complexity of solutions, mainly due to the abstract nature of fine-grained sketches. In this paper, we propose an effective approach to narrow the gap between the two domains. It mainly facilitates unified mutual information sharing both intra- and inter-samples, rather than treating them as a single feature alignment problem between modalities. Specifically, our approach includes: (i) Employing dual weight-sharing networks to optimize alignment within the sketch and image domain, which also effectively mitigates model learning saturation issues. (ii) Introducing an objective optimization function based on contrastive loss to enhance the model's ability to align features in both intra- and inter-samples. (iii) Presenting a self-supervised Multi-Scale Token Recycling (MSTR) Module featured by recycling discarded patch tokens in multi-scale features, further enhancing representation capability and retrieval performance. Our framework achieves excellent results on CNN- and ViT-based backbones. Extensive experiments demonstrate its superiority over existing methods. We also introduce Cloths-V1, the first professional fashion sketch-image dataset, utilized to validate our method and will be beneficial for other applications</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunshan Qi, Lin Zhu, Yifan Zhao, Nan Bao, Jia Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) achieves impressive 3D representation learning and novel view synthesis results with high-quality multi-view images as input. However, motion blur in images often occurs in low-light and high-speed motion scenes, which significantly degrades the reconstruction quality of NeRF. Previous deblurring NeRF methods struggle to estimate pose and lighting changes during the exposure time, making them unable to accurately model the motion blur. The bio-inspired event camera measuring intensity changes with high temporal resolution makes up this information deficiency. In this paper, we propose Event-driven Bundle Adjustment for Deblurring Neural Radiance Fields (EBAD-NeRF) to jointly optimize the learnable poses and NeRF parameters by leveraging the hybrid event-RGB data. An intensity-change-metric event loss and a photo-metric blur loss are introduced to strengthen the explicit modeling of camera motion blur. Experiments on both synthetic and real-captured data demonstrate that EBAD-NeRF can obtain accurate camera trajectory during the exposure time and learn a sharper 3D representations compared to prior works.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, with the rise of web videos, managing and understanding large-scale video datasets has become increasingly important. Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have emerged in recent years due to their strong video understanding capabilities. However, training and inference processes for VideoLLMs demand vast amounts of data, presenting significant challenges to data management, particularly regarding efficiency, robustness, and effectiveness. In this work, we present KeyVideoLLM, a text-video frame similarity-based keyframe selection method designed to manage VideoLLM data efficiently, robustly, and effectively. Specifically, KeyVideoLLM achieves a remarkable data compression rate of up to 60.9 times, substantially lowering disk space requirements, which proves its high efficiency. Additionally, it maintains a 100% selection success rate across all video formats and scales, enhances processing speed by up to 200 times compared to existing keyframe selection methods, and does not require hyperparameter tuning. Beyond its outstanding efficiency and robustness, KeyVideoLLM further improves model performance in video question-answering tasks during both training and inference stages. Notably, it consistently achieved the state-of-the-art (SoTA) experimental results on diverse datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muyang Qiu, Jian Zhang, Lei Qi, Qian Yu, Yinghuan Shi, Yang Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the recent success of domain generalization in medical image segmentation, voxel-wise annotation for all source domains remains a huge burden. Semi-supervised domain generalization has been proposed very recently to combat this challenge by leveraging limited labeled data along with abundant unlabeled data collected from multiple medical institutions, depending on precisely harnessing unlabeled data while improving generalization simultaneously. In this work, we observe that domain shifts between medical institutions cause disparate feature statistics, which significantly deteriorates pseudo-label quality due to an unexpected normalization process. Nevertheless, this phenomenon could be exploited to facilitate unseen domain generalization. Therefore, we propose 1) multiple statistics-individual branches to mitigate the impact of domain shifts for reliable pseudo-labels and 2) one statistics-aggregated branch for domain-invariant feature learning. Furthermore, to simulate unseen domains with statistics difference, we approach this from two aspects, i.e., a perturbation with histogram matching at image level and a random batch normalization selection strategy at feature level, producing diverse statistics to expand the training distribution. Evaluation results on three medical image datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared with recent SOTA methods. The code is available at https://github.com/qiumuyang/SIAB.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahao Zhang, Frederic Z. Zhang, Cristian Rodriguez, Yizhak Ben-Shabat, Anoop Cherian, Stephen Gould</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the challenging problem of simultaneously localizing a sequence of queries in the form of instructional diagrams in a video. This requires understanding not only the individual queries but also their interrelationships. However, most existing methods focus on grounding one query at a time, ignoring the inherent structures among queries such as the general mutual exclusiveness and the temporal order. Consequently, the predicted timespans of different step diagrams may overlap considerably or violate the temporal order, thus harming the accuracy. In this paper, we tackle this issue by simultaneously grounding a sequence of step diagrams. Specifically, we propose composite queries, constructed by exhaustively pairing up the visual content features of the step diagrams and a fixed number of learnable positional embeddings. Our insight is that self-attention among composite queries carrying different content features suppress each other to reduce timespan overlaps in predictions, while the cross-attention corrects the temporal misalignment via content and position joint guidance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the IAW dataset for grounding step diagrams and the YouCook2 benchmark for grounding natural language queries, significantly outperforming existing methods while simultaneously grounding multiple queries.</p>

<p>Abstract: Systems for multimodal emotion recognition (ER) are commonly trained to extract features from different modalities (e.g., visual, audio, and textual) that are combined to predict individual basic emotions. However, compound emotions often occur in real-world scenarios, and the uncertainty of recognizing such complex emotions over diverse modalities is challenging for feature-based models As an alternative, emerging multimodal large language models (LLMs) like BERT and LLaMA rely on explicit non-verbal cues that may be translated from different non-textual modalities (e.g., audio and visual) into text. Textualization of modalities augments data with emotional cues to help the LLM encode the interconnections between all modalities in a shared text space. In such text-based models, prior knowledge of ER tasks is leveraged to textualize relevant nonverbal cues such as audio tone from vocal expressions, and action unit intensity from facial expressions. Since the pre-trained weights are publicly available for many LLMs, training on large-scale datasets is unnecessary, allowing fine-tuning for downstream tasks such as compound ER (CER). This paper compares the potential of text- and feature-based approaches for compound multimodal ER in videos. Experiments were conducted on the challenging C-EXPR-DB dataset in the wild for CER, and contrasted with results on the MELD dataset for basic ER. Our results indicate that multimodal textualization provides lower accuracy than feature-based models on C-EXPR-DB, where text transcripts are captured in the wild. However, higher accuracy can be achieved when the video data has rich transcripts. Our code is available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Yan, Zixiang Wang, Zhengjia Xu, Zhuoyue Wang, Zhizhong Wu, Ranran Lyu</p>
<p>Abstract: Super-resolution reconstruction techniques entail the utilization of software algorithms to transform one or more sets of low-resolution images captured from the same scene into high-resolution images. In recent years, considerable advancement has been observed in the domain of single-image super-resolution algorithms, particularly those based on deep learning techniques. Nevertheless, the extraction of image features and nonlinear mapping methods in the reconstruction process remain challenging for existing algorithms. These issues result in the network architecture being unable to effectively utilize the diverse range of information at different levels. The loss of high-frequency details is significant, and the final reconstructed image features are overly smooth, with a lack of fine texture details. This negatively impacts the subjective visual quality of the image. The objective is to recover high-quality, high-resolution images from low-resolution images. In this work, an enhanced deep convolutional neural network model is employed, comprising multiple convolutional layers, each of which is configured with specific filters and activation functions to effectively capture the diverse features of the image. Furthermore, a residual learning strategy is employed to accelerate training and enhance the convergence of the network, while sub-pixel convolutional layers are utilized to refine the high-frequency details and textures of the image. The experimental analysis demonstrates the superior performance of the proposed model on multiple public datasets when compared with the traditional bicubic interpolation method and several other learning-based super-resolution methods. Furthermore, it proves the model's efficacy in maintaining image edges and textures.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14506">On Pre-training of Multimodal Language Models Customized for Chart Understanding</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Wan-Cyuan Fan, Yen-Chun Chen, Mengchen Liu, Lu Yuan, Leonid Sigal</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies customizing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for domain-specific tasks have yielded promising results, especially in the field of scientific chart comprehension. These studies generally utilize visual instruction tuning with specialized datasets to enhance question and answer (QA) accuracy within the chart domain. However, they often neglect the fundamental discrepancy between natural image-caption pre-training data and digital chart image-QA data, particularly in the models' capacity to extract underlying numeric values from charts. This paper tackles this oversight by exploring the training processes necessary to improve MLLMs' comprehension of charts. We present three key findings: (1) Incorporating raw data values in alignment pre-training markedly improves comprehension of chart data. (2) Replacing images with their textual representation randomly during end-to-end fine-tuning transfer the language reasoning capability to chart interpretation skills. (3) Requiring the model to first extract the underlying chart data and then answer the question in the fine-tuning can further improve the accuracy. Consequently, we introduce CHOPINLLM, an MLLM tailored for in-depth chart comprehension. CHOPINLLM effectively interprets various types of charts, including unannotated ones, while maintaining robust reasoning abilities. Furthermore, we establish a new benchmark to evaluate MLLMs' understanding of different chart types across various comprehension levels. Experimental results show that CHOPINLLM exhibits strong performance in understanding both annotated and unannotated charts across a wide range of types.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Josiah Couch, Rima Arnaout, Ramy Arnaout</p>
<p>Abstract: In deep learning, achieving high performance on image classification tasks requires diverse training sets. However, the current best practice$\unicode{x2013}$maximizing dataset size and class balance$\unicode{x2013}$does not guarantee dataset diversity. We hypothesized that, for a given model architecture, model performance can be improved by maximizing diversity more directly. To test this hypothesis, we introduce a comprehensive framework of diversity measures from ecology that generalizes familiar quantities like Shannon entropy by accounting for similarities among images. (Size and class balance emerge as special cases.) Analyzing thousands of subsets from seven medical datasets showed that the best correlates of performance were not size or class balance but $A$$\unicode{x2013}$"big alpha"$\unicode{x2013}$a set of generalized entropy measures interpreted as the effective number of image-class pairs in the dataset, after accounting for image similarities. One of these, $A_0$, explained 67% of the variance in balanced accuracy, vs. 54% for class balance and just 39% for size. The best pair of measures was size-plus-$A_1$ (79%), which outperformed size-plus-class-balance (74%). Subsets with the largest $A_0$ performed up to 16% better than those with the largest size (median improvement, 8%). We propose maximizing $A$ as a way to improve deep learning performance in medical imaging.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniele Rege Cambrin, Isaac Corley, Paolo Garza, Peyman Najafirad</p>
<p>Abstract: Earthquakes are commonly estimated using physical seismic stations, however, due to the installation requirements and costs of these stations, global coverage quickly becomes impractical. An efficient and lower-cost alternative is to develop machine learning models to globally monitor earth observation data to pinpoint regions impacted by these natural disasters. However, due to the small amount of historically recorded earthquakes, this becomes a low-data regime problem requiring algorithmic improvements to achieve peak performance when learning to regress earthquake magnitude. In this paper, we propose to pose the estimation of earthquake magnitudes as a metric-learning problem, training models to not only estimate earthquake magnitude from Sentinel-1 satellite imagery but to additionally rank pairwise samples. Our experiments show at max a 30%+ improvement in MAE over prior regression-only based methods, particularly transformer-based architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianxiao Zhang, Wenju Xu, Bo Luo, Guanghui Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The Vision Transformer (ViT) leverages the Transformer's encoder to capture global information by dividing images into patches and achieves superior performance across various computer vision tasks. However, the self-attention mechanism of ViT captures the global context from the outset, overlooking the inherent relationships between neighboring pixels in images or videos. Transformers mainly focus on global information while ignoring the fine-grained local details. Consequently, ViT lacks inductive bias during image or video dataset training. In contrast, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), with their reliance on local filters, possess an inherent inductive bias, making them more efficient and quicker to converge than ViT with less data. In this paper, we present a lightweight Depth-Wise Convolution module as a shortcut in ViT models, bypassing entire Transformer blocks to ensure the models capture both local and global information with minimal overhead. Additionally, we introduce two architecture variants, allowing the Depth-Wise Convolution modules to be applied to multiple Transformer blocks for parameter savings, and incorporating independent parallel Depth-Wise Convolution modules with different kernels to enhance the acquisition of local information. The proposed approach significantly boosts the performance of ViT models on image classification, object detection and instance segmentation by a large margin, especially on small datasets, as evaluated on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet and ImageNet for image classification, and COCO for object detection and instance segmentation.

Specifically, we leverage our strand representation to fit and decompose hair geometry textures into low- to high-frequency hair structures. These decomposed textures are later parameterized with different generative models, emulating common stages in the hair modeling process. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the architecture design of \textsc{Perm}, and finally deploy the trained model as a generic prior to solve task-agnostic problems, further showcasing its flexibility and superiority in tasks such as 3D hair parameterization, hairstyle interpolation, single-view hair reconstruction, and hair-conditioned image generation.

<p>Abstract: Spatial omics has transformed our understanding of tissue architecture by preserving spatial context of gene expression patterns. Simultaneously, advances in imaging AI have enabled extraction of morphological features describing the tissue. The intersection of spatial omics and imaging AI presents opportunities for a more holistic understanding. In this review we introduce a framework for categorizing spatial omics-morphology combination methods, focusing on how morphological features can be translated or integrated into spatial omics analyses. By translation we mean finding morphological features that spatially correlate with gene expression patterns with the purpose of predicting gene expression. Such features can be used to generate super-resolution gene expression maps or infer genetic information from clinical H&E-stained samples. By integration we mean finding morphological features that spatially complement gene expression patterns with the purpose of enriching information. Such features can be used to define spatial domains, especially where gene expression has preceded morphological changes and where morphology remains after gene expression. We discuss learning strategies and directions for further development of the field.</p>

Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) have recently emerged due to their robust vision-understanding capabilities. However, training these models requires vast amounts of data, posing challenges to efficiency, effectiveness, data quality, and privacy. In this paper, we introduce SynthVLM, a novel data synthesis pipeline for VLLMs. Unlike existing methods that generate captions from images, SynthVLM employs advanced diffusion models and high-quality captions to automatically generate and select high-resolution images from captions, creating precisely aligned image-text pairs. Leveraging these pairs, we achieve state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance on various vision question answering tasks, maintaining high alignment quality and preserving advanced language abilities. Moreover, SynthVLM surpasses traditional GPT-4 Vision-based caption generation methods in performance while significantly reducing computational overhead. Crucially, our method's reliance on purely generated data ensures the preservation of privacy, achieving SoTA performance with just 100k data points (only 18% of the official dataset size).</p>

<p>Abstract: It is helpful in preventing colorectal cancer to detect and treat polyps in the gastrointestinal tract early. However, there have been few studies to date on designing polyp image classification networks that balance efficiency and accuracy. This challenge is mainly attributed to the fact that polyps are similar to other pathologies and have complex features influenced by texture, color, and morphology. In this paper, we propose a novel network DFE-IANet based on both spectral transformation and feature interaction. Firstly, to extract detailed features and multi-scale features, the features are transformed by the multi-scale frequency domain feature extraction (MSFD) block to extract texture details at the fine-grained level in the frequency domain. Secondly, the multi-scale interaction attention (MSIA) block is designed to enhance the network's capability of extracting critical features. This block introduces multi-scale features into self-attention, aiming to adaptively guide the network to concentrate on vital regions. Finally, with a compact parameter of only 4M, DFE-IANet outperforms the latest and classical networks in terms of efficiency. Furthermore, DFE-IANet achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on the challenging Kvasir dataset, demonstrating a remarkable Top-1 accuracy of 93.94%. This outstanding accuracy surpasses ViT by 8.94%, ResNet50 by 1.69%, and VMamba by 1.88%. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/PURSUETHESUN/DFE-IANet.</p>

<p>Abstract: The segmentation of ultra-high resolution images poses challenges such as loss of spatial information or computational inefficiency. In this work, a novel approach that combines encoder-decoder architectures with domain decomposition strategies to address these challenges is proposed. Specifically, a domain decomposition-based U-Net (DDU-Net) architecture is introduced, which partitions input images into non-overlapping patches that can be processed independently on separate devices. A communication network is added to facilitate inter-patch information exchange to enhance the understanding of spatial context. Experimental validation is performed on a synthetic dataset that is designed to measure the effectiveness of the communication network. Then, the performance is tested on the DeepGlobe land cover classification dataset as a real-world benchmark data set. The results demonstrate that the approach, which includes inter-patch communication for images divided into $16\times16$ non-overlapping subimages, achieves a $2-3\,\%$ higher intersection over union (IoU) score compared to the same network without inter-patch communication. The performance of the network which includes communication is equivalent to that of a baseline U-Net trained on the full image, showing that our model provides an effective solution for segmenting ultra-high-resolution images while preserving spatial context.

<p>Abstract: Simulating high-resolution detector responses is a computationally intensive process that has long been challenging in Particle Physics. Despite the ability of generative models to streamline it, full ultra-high-granularity detector simulation still proves to be difficult as it contains correlated and fine-grained information. To overcome these limitations, we propose Intra-Event Aware Generative Adversarial Network (IEA-GAN). IEA-GAN presents a Relational Reasoning Module that approximates an event in detector simulation, generating contextualized high-resolution full detector responses with a proper relational inductive bias. IEA-GAN also introduces a Self-Supervised intra-event aware loss and Uniformity loss, significantly enhancing sample fidelity and diversity. We demonstrate IEA-GAN's application in generating sensor-dependent images for the ultra-high-granularity Pixel Vertex Detector (PXD), with more than 7.5 M information channels at the Belle II Experiment. Applications of this work span from Foundation Models for high-granularity detector simulation, such as at the HL-LHC (High Luminosity LHC), to simulation-based inference and fine-grained density estimation. To our knowledge, IEA-GAN is the first algorithm for faithful ultra-high-granularity full detector simulation with event-based reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingjie Li, Quanshi Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this technical note, we aim to explain a deep neural network (DNN) by quantifying the encoded interactions between input variables, which reflects the DNN's inference logic. Specifically, we first rethink the definition of interactions, and then formally define faithfulness and conciseness for interaction-based explanation. To this end, we propose two kinds of interactions, i.e., the AND interaction and the OR interaction. For faithfulness, we prove the uniqueness of the AND (OR) interaction in quantifying the effect of the AND (OR) relationship between input variables. Besides, based on AND-OR interactions, we design techniques to boost the conciseness of the explanation, while not hurting the faithfulness. In this way, the inference logic of a DNN can be faithfully and concisely explained by a set of symbolic concepts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fangyijie Wang, Gu\'enol\'e Silvestre, Kathleen M. Curran</p>
<p>Abstract: Fetal head segmentation is a crucial step in measuring the fetal head circumference (HC) during gestation, an important biometric in obstetrics for monitoring fetal growth. However, manual biometry generation is time-consuming and results in inconsistent accuracy. To address this issue, convolutional neural network (CNN) models have been utilized to improve the efficiency of medical biometry. But training a CNN network from scratch is a challenging task, we proposed a Transfer Learning (TL) method. Our approach involves fine-tuning (FT) a U-Net network with a lightweight MobileNet as the encoder to perform segmentation on a set of fetal head ultrasound (US) images with limited effort. This method addresses the challenges associated with training a CNN network from scratch. It suggests that our proposed FT strategy yields segmentation performance that is comparable when trained with a reduced number of parameters by 85.8%. And our proposed FT strategy outperforms other strategies with smaller trainable parameter sizes below 4.4 million. Thus, we contend that it can serve as a dependable FT approach for reducing the size of models in medical image analysis. Our key findings highlight the importance of the balance between model performance and size in developing Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications by TL methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bijie Bai, Xilin Yang, Tianyi Gan, Jingxi Li, Deniz Mengu, Mona Jarrahi, Aydogan Ozcan</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffractive deep neural networks (D2NNs) are composed of successive transmissive layers optimized using supervised deep learning to all-optically implement various computational tasks between an input and output field-of-view (FOV). Here, we present a pyramid-structured diffractive optical network design (which we term P-D2NN), optimized specifically for unidirectional image magnification and demagnification. In this design, the diffractive layers are pyramidally scaled in alignment with the direction of the image magnification or demagnification. This P-D2NN design creates high-fidelity magnified or demagnified images in only one direction, while inhibiting the image formation in the opposite direction - achieving the desired unidirectional imaging operation using a much smaller number of diffractive degrees of freedom within the optical processor volume. Furthermore, P-D2NN design maintains its unidirectional image magnification/demagnification functionality across a large band of illumination wavelengths despite being trained with a single wavelength. We also designed a wavelength-multiplexed P-D2NN, where a unidirectional magnifier and a unidirectional demagnifier operate simultaneously in opposite directions, at two distinct illumination wavelengths. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by cascading multiple unidirectional P-D2NN modules, we can achieve higher magnification factors. The efficacy of the P-D2NN architecture was also validated experimentally using terahertz illumination, successfully matching our numerical simulations. P-D2NN offers a physics-inspired strategy for designing task-specific visual processors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shezheng Song, Shan Zhao, Chengyu Wang, Tianwei Yan, Shasha Li, Xiaoguang Mao, Meng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Entity Linking (MEL) aims at linking ambiguous mentions with multimodal information to entity in Knowledge Graph (KG) such as Wikipedia, which plays a key role in many applications. However, existing methods suffer from shortcomings, including modality impurity such as noise in raw image and ambiguous textual entity representation, which puts obstacles to MEL. We formulate multimodal entity linking as a neural text matching problem where each multimodal information (text and image) is treated as a query, and the model learns the mapping from each query to the relevant entity from candidate entities. This paper introduces a dual-way enhanced (DWE) framework for MEL: (1) our model refines queries with multimodal data and addresses semantic gaps using cross-modal enhancers between text and image information. Besides, DWE innovatively leverages fine-grained image attributes, including facial characteristic and scene feature, to enhance and refine visual features. (2)By using Wikipedia descriptions, DWE enriches entity semantics and obtains more comprehensive textual representation, which reduces between textual representation and the entities in KG. Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, indicating the superiority of our model.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hamed Hooshangnejad, Xue Feng, Gaofeng Huang, Rui Zhang, Katelyn Kelly, Quan Chen, Kai Ding</p>
<p>Abstract: Lung cancer is a devastating disease with the highest mortality rate among cancer types. Over 60% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, which accounts for 87% of diagnoses, require radiation therapy. Rapid treatment initiation significantly increases the patient's survival rate and reduces the mortality rate. Accurate tumor segmentation is a critical step in the diagnosis and treatment of NSCLC. Manual segmentation is time and labor-consuming and causes delays in treatment initiation. Although many lung nodule detection methods, including deep learning-based models, have been proposed, there is still a long-standing problem of high false positives (FPs) with most of these methods. Here, we developed an electronic health record (EHR) guided lung tumor auto-segmentation called EXACT-Net (EHR-enhanced eXACtitude in Tumor segmentation), where the extracted information from EHRs using a pre-trained large language model (LLM), was used to remove the FPs and keep the TP nodules only. The auto-segmentation model was trained on NSCLC patients' computed tomography (CT), and the pre-trained LLM was used with the zero-shot learning approach. Our approach resulted in a 250% boost in successful nodule detection using the data from ten NSCLC patients treated in our institution.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bin Huang, Changchen Zhao, Zimeng Liu, Shenda Hong, Baochang Zhang, Hao Lu, Zhijun Liu, Wenjin Wang, Hui Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Good health and well-being is among key issues in the United Nations 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. The rising prevalence of large-scale infectious diseases and the accelerated aging of the global population are driving the transformation of healthcare technologies. In this context, establishing large-scale public health datasets, developing medical models, and creating decision-making systems with a human-centric approach are of strategic significance. Recently, by leveraging the extraordinary number of accessible cameras, groundbreaking advancements have emerged in AI methods for physiological signal monitoring and disease diagnosis using camera sensors. These approaches, requiring no specialized medical equipment, offer convenient manners of collecting large-scale medical data in response to public health events. Therefore, we outline a prospective framework and heuristic vision for a camera-based public health (CBPH) framework utilizing visual physiological monitoring technology. The CBPH can be considered as a convenient and universal framework for public health, advancing the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, particularly in promoting the universality, sustainability, and equity of healthcare in low- and middle-income countries or regions. Furthermore, CBPH provides a comprehensive solution for building a large-scale and human-centric medical database, and a multi-task large medical model for public health and medical scientific discoveries. It has a significant potential to revolutionize personal monitoring technologies, digital medicine, telemedicine, and primary health care in public health. Therefore, it can be deemed that the outcomes of this paper will contribute to the establishment of a sustainable and fair framework for public health, which serves as a crucial bridge for advancing scientific discoveries in the realm of AI for medicine (AI4Medicine).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ayush Roy, Payel Pramanik, Sohom Ghosal, Daria Valenkova, Dmitrii Kaplun, Ram Sarkar</p>
<p>Abstract: Breast cancer is a major global health concern. Pathologists face challenges in analyzing complex features from pathological images, which is a time-consuming and labor-intensive task. Therefore, efficient computer-based diagnostic tools are needed for early detection and treatment planning. This paper presents a modified version of MultiResU-Net for histopathology image segmentation, which is selected as the backbone for its ability to analyze and segment complex features at multiple scales and ensure effective feature flow via skip connections. The modified version also utilizes the Gaussian distribution-based Attention Module (GdAM) to incorporate histopathology-relevant text information in a Gaussian distribution. The sampled features from the Gaussian text feature-guided distribution highlight specific spatial regions based on prior knowledge. Finally, using the Controlled Dense Residual Block (CDRB) on skip connections of MultiResU-Net, the information is transferred from the encoder layers to the decoder layers in a controlled manner using a scaling parameter derived from the extracted spatial features. We validate our approach on two diverse breast cancer histopathology image datasets: TNBC and MonuSeg, demonstrating superior segmentation performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14055">Quantum Hamiltonian Embedding of Images for Data Reuploading Classifiers</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Peiyong Wang, Casey R. Myers, Lloyd C. L. Hollenberg, Udaya Parampalli</p>
<p>Abstract: When applying quantum computing to machine learning tasks, one of the first considerations is the design of the quantum machine learning model itself. Conventionally, the design of quantum machine learning algorithms relies on the ``quantisation" of classical learning algorithms, such as using quantum linear algebra to implement important subroutines of classical algorithms, if not the entire algorithm, seeking to achieve quantum advantage through possible run-time accelerations brought by quantum computing. However, recent research has started questioning whether quantum advantage via speedup is the right goal for quantum machine learning [1]. Research also has been undertaken to exploit properties that are unique to quantum systems, such as quantum contextuality, to better design quantum machine learning models [2]. In this paper, we take an alternative approach by incorporating the heuristics and empirical evidences from the design of classical deep learning algorithms to the design of quantum neural networks. We first construct a model based on the data reuploading circuit [3] with the quantum Hamiltonian data embedding unitary [4]. Through numerical experiments on images datasets, including the famous MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets, we demonstrate that our model outperforms the quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN)[5] by a large margin (up to over 40% on MNIST test set). Based on the model design process and numerical results, we then laid out six principles for designing quantum machine learning models, especially quantum neural networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kanghyun Choi, Hye Yoon Lee, Dain Kwon, SunJong Park, Kyuyeun Kim, Noseong Park, Jinho Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Data-free quantization (DFQ) is a technique that creates a lightweight network from its full-precision counterpart without the original training data, often through a synthetic dataset. Although several DFQ methods have been proposed for vision transformer (ViT) architectures, they fail to achieve efficacy in low-bit settings. Examining the existing methods, we identify that their synthetic data produce misaligned attention maps, while those of the real samples are highly aligned. From the observation of aligned attention, we find that aligning attention maps of synthetic data helps to improve the overall performance of quantized ViTs. Motivated by this finding, we devise MimiQ, a novel DFQ method designed for ViTs that focuses on inter-head attention similarity. First, we generate synthetic data by aligning head-wise attention responses in relation to spatial query patches. Then, we apply head-wise structural attention distillation to align the attention maps of the quantized network to those of the full-precision teacher. The experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms baselines, setting a new state-of-the-art performance for data-free ViT quantization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Tariqul Islam, Jason W. Fleischer</p>
<p>Abstract: The success of machine learning algorithms heavily relies on the quality of samples and the accuracy of their corresponding labels. However, building and maintaining large, high-quality datasets is an enormous task. This is especially true for biomedical data and for meta-sets that are compiled from smaller ones, as variations in image quality, labeling, reports, and archiving can lead to errors, inconsistencies, and repeated samples. Here, we show that the uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) algorithm can find these anomalies essentially by forming independent clusters that are distinct from the main (good) data but similar to other points with the same error type. As a representative example, we apply UMAP to discover outliers in the publicly available ChestX-ray14, CheXpert, and MURA datasets. While the results are archival and retrospective and focus on radiological images, the graph-based methods work for any data type and will prove equally beneficial for curation at the time of dataset creation.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21740">Contrastive Factor Analysis</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhibin Duan, Tiansheng Wen, Yifei Wang, Chen Zhu, Bo Chen, Mingyuan Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Factor analysis, often regarded as a Bayesian variant of matrix factorization, offers superior capabilities in capturing uncertainty, modeling complex dependencies, and ensuring robustness. As the deep learning era arrives, factor analysis is receiving less and less attention due to their limited expressive ability. On the contrary, contrastive learning has emerged as a potent technique with demonstrated efficacy in unsupervised representational learning. While the two methods are different paradigms, recent theoretical analysis has revealed the mathematical equivalence between contrastive learning and matrix factorization, providing a potential possibility for factor analysis combined with contrastive learning. Motivated by the interconnectedness of contrastive learning, matrix factorization, and factor analysis, this paper introduces a novel Contrastive Factor Analysis framework, aiming to leverage factor analysis's advantageous properties within the realm of contrastive learning. To further leverage the interpretability properties of non-negative factor analysis, which can learn disentangled representations, contrastive factor analysis is extended to a non-negative version. Finally, extensive experimental validation showcases the efficacy of the proposed contrastive (non-negative) factor analysis methodology across multiple key properties, including expressiveness, robustness, interpretability, and accurate uncertainty estimation.</p>
