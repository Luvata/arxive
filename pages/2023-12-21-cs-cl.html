<p>In this work we introduce Labrador, a pre-trained Transformer model for
laboratory data. Labrador and BERT were pre-trained on a corpus of 100 million
lab test results from electronic health records (EHRs) and evaluated on various
downstream outcome prediction tasks. Both models demonstrate mastery of the
pre-training task but neither consistently outperform XGBoost on downstream
supervised tasks. Our ablation studies reveal that transfer learning shows
limited effectiveness for BERT and achieves marginal success with Labrador. We
explore the reasons for the failure of transfer learning and suggest that the
data generating process underlying each patient cannot be characterized
sufficiently using labs alone, among other factors. We encourage future work to
focus on joint modeling of multiple EHR data categories and to include
tree-based baselines in their evaluations.

<p>Affective computing is a field of study that focuses on developing systems
and technologies that can understand, interpret, and respond to human emotions.
Speech Emotion Recognition (SER), in particular, has got a lot of attention
from researchers in the recent past. However, in many cases, the publicly
available datasets, used for training and evaluation, are scarce and imbalanced
across the emotion labels. In this work, we focused on building a balanced
corpus from these publicly available datasets by combining these datasets as
well as employing various speech data augmentation techniques. Furthermore, we
experimented with different architectures for speech emotion recognition. Our
best system, a multi-modal speech, and text-based model, provides a performance
of UA(Unweighed Accuracy) + WA (Weighed Accuracy) of 157.57 compared to the
baseline algorithm performance of 119.66

<p>Text classification is an important topic in the field of natural language
processing. It has been preliminarily applied in information retrieval, digital
library, automatic abstracting, text filtering, word semantic discrimination
and many other fields. The aim of this research is to use a variety of
algorithms to test the ability to identify offensive posts and evaluate their
performance against a variety of assessment methods. The motivation for this
project is to reduce the harm of these languages to human censors by automating
the screening of offending posts. The field is a new one, and despite much
interest in the past two years, there has been no focus on the object of the
offence. Through the experiment of this project, it should inspire future
research on identification methods as well as identification content.

<p>Instruction fine-tuning, involving the refinement of pre-trained LLMs using
datasets accompanied by natural instructions, is a powerful approach. However,
its effectiveness is hindered by the redundancy and deficiencies in
LLM-generated instruction datasets. In this paper, we introduce a highly
effective and versatile paradigm for selecting diverse and high-quality
instruction-following data from fine-tuning datasets. We first employ the
dataset enhancement and expansion to augment the dataset with more diverse and
high-quality data, then we apply variety compression and quality compression
sequentially to curate the desired dataset. Our experimental results showcase
that, even with a limited quantity of high-quality instruction data, LLMs
consistently maintain robust performance across both natural language
understanding tasks and code generation tasks. Notably, they outperform models
trained on significantly larger instruction datasets in certain instances.

<p>We propose a Reinforcement-Learning-based system that would automatically
prescribe a hypothetical patient medications that may help the patient with
their mental-health-related speech disfluency, and adjust the medication and
the dosages in response to data from the patient. We demonstrate the components
of the system: a module that detects and evaluates speech disfluency on a large
dataset we built, and a Reinforcement Learning algorithm that automatically
finds good combinations of medications. To support the two modules, we collect
data on the effect of psychiatric medications for speech disfluency from the
literature, and build a plausible patient simulation system. We demonstrate
that the Reinforcement Learning system is, under some circumstances, able to
converge to a good medication regime. We collect and label a dataset of people
with possible speech disfluency and demonstrate our methods using that dataset.
Our work is a proof of concept: we show that there is promise in the idea of
using automatic data collection to address disfluency.

<p>We present ComplexityNet, a streamlined language model designed for assessing
task complexity. This model predicts the likelihood of accurate output by
various language models, each with different capabilities. Our initial
application of ComplexityNet involves the Mostly Basic Python Problems (MBPP)
dataset. We pioneered the creation of the first set of labels to define task
complexity. ComplexityNet achieved a notable 79% accuracy in determining task
complexity, a significant improvement over the 34% accuracy of the original,
non fine-tuned model. Furthermore, ComplexityNet effectively reduces
computational resource usage by 90% compared to using the highest complexity
model, while maintaining a high code generation accuracy of 86.7%. This study
demonstrates that fine-tuning smaller models to categorize tasks based on their
complexity can lead to a more balanced trade-off between accuracy and
efficiency in the use of Large Language Models. Our findings suggest a
promising direction for optimizing LLM applications, especially in
resource-constrained environments.

<p>Large language models (LLMs) are central to modern natural language
processing, delivering exceptional performance in various tasks. However, their
intensive computational and memory requirements present challenges, especially
for devices with limited DRAM capacity. This paper tackles the challenge of
efficiently running LLMs that exceed the available DRAM capacity by storing the
model parameters on flash memory but bringing them on demand to DRAM. Our
method involves constructing an inference cost model that harmonizes with the
flash memory behavior, guiding us to optimize in two critical areas: reducing
the volume of data transferred from flash and reading data in larger, more
contiguous chunks. Within this flash memory-informed framework, we introduce
two principal techniques. First, "windowing'" strategically reduces data
transfer by reusing previously activated neurons, and second, "row-column
bundling", tailored to the sequential data access strengths of flash memory,
increases the size of data chunks read from flash memory. These methods
collectively enable running models up to twice the size of the available DRAM,
with a 4-5x and 20-25x increase in inference speed compared to naive loading
approaches in CPU and GPU, respectively. Our integration of sparsity awareness,
context-adaptive loading, and a hardware-oriented design paves the way for
effective inference of LLMs on devices with limited memory.

<p>This research delves into the intricate landscape of Musculoskeletal Disorder
(MSD) risk factors, employing a novel fusion of Natural Language Processing
(NLP) techniques and mode-based ranking methodologies. The primary objective is
to advance the comprehension of MSD risk factors, their classification, and
their relative severity, facilitating more targeted preventive and management
interventions. The study utilizes eight diverse models, integrating pre-trained
transformers, cosine similarity, and various distance metrics to classify risk
factors into personal, biomechanical, workplace, psychological, and
organizational classes. Key findings reveal that the BERT model with cosine
similarity attains an overall accuracy of 28\%, while the sentence transformer,
coupled with Euclidean, Bray-Curtis, and Minkowski distances, achieves a
flawless accuracy score of 100\%. In tandem with the classification efforts,
the research employs a mode-based ranking approach on survey data to discern
the severity hierarchy of MSD risk factors. Intriguingly, the rankings align
precisely with the previous literature, reaffirming the consistency and
reliability of the approach. ``Working posture" emerges as the most severe risk
factor, emphasizing the critical role of proper posture in preventing MSDs. The
collective perceptions of survey participants underscore the significance of
factors like ``Job insecurity," ``Effort reward imbalance," and ``Poor employee
facility" in contributing to MSD risks. The convergence of rankings provides
actionable insights for organizations aiming to reduce the prevalence of MSDs.
The study concludes with implications for targeted interventions,
recommendations for improving workplace conditions, and avenues for future
research.

<p>User modeling (UM) aims to discover patterns or learn representations from
user data about the characteristics of a specific user, such as profile,
preference, and personality. The user models enable personalization and
suspiciousness detection in many online applications such as recommendation,
education, and healthcare. Two common types of user data are text and graph, as
the data usually contain a large amount of user-generated content (UGC) and
online interactions. The research of text and graph mining is developing
rapidly, contributing many notable solutions in the past two decades. Recently,
large language models (LLMs) have shown superior performance on generating,
understanding, and even reasoning over text data. The approaches of user
modeling have been equipped with LLMs and soon become outstanding. This article
summarizes existing research about how and why LLMs are great tools of modeling
and understanding UGC. Then it reviews a few categories of large language
models for user modeling (LLM-UM) approaches that integrate the LLMs with text
and graph-based methods in different ways. Then it introduces specific LLM-UM
techniques for a variety of UM applications. Finally, it presents remaining
challenges and future directions in the LLM-UM research. We maintain the

<p>With the Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3.5 (GPT-3.5) exhibiting
remarkable reasoning and comprehension abilities in Natural Language Processing
(NLP), most Question Answering (QA) research has primarily centered around
general QA tasks based on GPT, neglecting the specific challenges posed by
Complex Table QA. In this paper, we propose to incorporate GPT-3.5 to address
such challenges, in which complex tables are reconstructed into tuples and
specific prompt designs are employed for dialogues. Specifically, we encode
each cell's hierarchical structure, position information, and content as a
tuple. By enhancing the prompt template with an explanatory description of the
meaning of each tuple and the logical reasoning process of the task, we
effectively improve the hierarchical structure awareness capability of GPT-3.5
to better parse the complex tables. Extensive experiments and results on
Complex Table QA datasets, i.e., the open-domain dataset HiTAB and the aviation
domain dataset AIT-QA show that our approach significantly outperforms previous
work on both datasets, leading to state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

<p>Warning: this paper includes model outputs showing offensive content. Recent
large-scale Visual-Language Generative Models (VLGMs) have achieved
unprecedented improvement in multimodal image/text generation. However, these
models might also generate toxic content, e.g., offensive text and pornography
images, raising significant ethical risks. Despite exhaustive studies on toxic
degeneration of language models, this problem remains largely unexplored within
the context of visual-language generation. This work delves into the propensity
for toxicity generation and susceptibility to toxic data across various VLGMs.
For this purpose, we built ToViLaG, a dataset comprising 32K
co-toxic/mono-toxic text-image pairs and 1K innocuous but evocative text that
tends to stimulate toxicity. Furthermore, we propose WInToRe, a novel toxicity
metric tailored to visual-language generation, which theoretically reflects
different aspects of toxicity considering both input and output. On such a
basis, we benchmarked the toxicity of a diverse spectrum of VLGMs and
discovered that some models do more evil than expected while some are more
vulnerable to infection, underscoring the necessity of VLGMs detoxification.
Therefore, we develop an innovative bottleneck-based detoxification method. Our
method could reduce toxicity while maintaining comparable generation quality,
providing a promising initial solution to this line of research.

<p>This paper introduces a novel approach for topic modeling utilizing latent
codebooks from Vector-Quantized Variational Auto-Encoder~(VQ-VAE), discretely
encapsulating the rich information of the pre-trained embeddings such as the
pre-trained language model. From the novel interpretation of the latent
codebooks and embeddings as conceptual bag-of-words, we propose a new
generative topic model called Topic-VQ-VAE~(TVQ-VAE) which inversely generates
the original documents related to the respective latent codebook. The TVQ-VAE
can visualize the topics with various generative distributions including the
traditional BoW distribution and the autoregressive image generation. Our
experimental results on document analysis and image generation demonstrate that
TVQ-VAE effectively captures the topic context which reveals the underlying
structures of the dataset and supports flexible forms of document generation.

<p>Current approaches to evaluating large language models (LLMs) with
pre-existing Knowledge Graphs (KG) mostly ignore the structure of the KG and
make arbitrary choices of which part of the graph to evaluate. In this paper,
we introduce KGLens, a method to evaluate LLMs by generating natural language
questions from a KG in a structure aware manner so that we can characterize its
performance on a more aggregated level. KGLens uses a parameterized KG, where
each edge is augmented with a beta distribution that guides how to sample edges
from the KG for QA testing. As the evaluation proceeds, different edges of the
parameterized KG are sampled and assessed appropriately, converging to a more
global picture of the performance of the LLMs on the KG as a whole. In our
experiments, we construct three domain-specific KGs for knowledge assessment,
comprising over 19,000 edges, 700 relations, and 21,000 entities. The results
demonstrate that KGLens can not only assess overall performance but also
provide topic, temporal, and relation analyses of LLMs. This showcases the
adaptability and customizability of KGLens, emphasizing its ability to focus
the evaluation based on specific criteria.

<p>In the era of modern healthcare, swiftly generating medical question
summaries is crucial for informed and timely patient care. Despite the
increasing complexity and volume of medical data, existing studies have focused
solely on text-based summarization, neglecting the integration of visual
information. Recognizing the untapped potential of combining textual queries
with visual representations of medical conditions, we introduce the Multimodal
Medical Question Summarization (MMQS) Dataset. This dataset, a major
contribution to our work, pairs medical queries with visual aids, facilitating
a richer and more nuanced understanding of patient needs. We also propose a
framework, utilizing the power of Contrastive Language Image Pretraining(CLIP)
and Large Language Models(LLMs), consisting of four modules that identify
medical disorders, generate relevant context, filter medical concepts, and
craft visually aware summaries. Our comprehensive framework harnesses the power
of CLIP, a multimodal foundation model, and various general-purpose LLMs,
comprising four main modules: the medical disorder identification module, the
relevant context generation module, the context filtration module for
distilling relevant medical concepts and knowledge, and finally, a
general-purpose LLM to generate visually aware medical question summaries.
Leveraging our MMQS dataset, we showcase how visual cues from images enhance
the generation of medically nuanced summaries. This multimodal approach not
only enhances the decision-making process in healthcare but also fosters a more
nuanced understanding of patient queries, laying the groundwork for future
research in personalized and responsive medical care

<p>In the dynamic and rapidly evolving world of social media, detecting
anomalous users has become a crucial task to address malicious activities such
as misinformation and cyberbullying. As the increasing number of anomalous
users improves the ability to mimic normal users and evade detection, existing
methods only focusing on bot detection are ineffective in terms of capturing
subtle distinctions between users. To address these challenges, we proposed
SeGA, preference-aware self-contrastive learning for anomalous user detection,
which leverages heterogeneous entities and their relations in the Twittersphere
to detect anomalous users with different malicious strategies. SeGA utilizes
the knowledge of large language models to summarize user preferences via posts.
In addition, integrating user preferences with prompts as pseudo-labels for
preference-aware self-contrastive learning enables the model to learn
multifaceted aspects for describing the behaviors of users. Extensive
experiments on the proposed TwBNT benchmark demonstrate that SeGA significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods (+3.5\% ~ 27.6\%) and empirically
validate the effectiveness of the model design and pre-training strategies. Our

<p>Understanding and accurately explaining compatibility relationships between
fashion items is a challenging problem in the burgeoning domain of AI-driven
outfit recommendations. Present models, while making strides in this area,
still occasionally fall short, offering explanations that can be elementary and
repetitive. This work aims to address these shortcomings by introducing the
Pair Fashion Explanation (PFE) dataset, a unique resource that has been curated
to illuminate these compatibility relationships. Furthermore, we propose an
innovative two-stage pipeline model that leverages this dataset. This
fine-tuning allows the model to generate explanations that convey the
compatibility relationships between items. Our experiments showcase the model's
potential in crafting descriptions that are knowledgeable, aligned with
ground-truth matching correlations, and that produce understandable and

<p>Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs) have become integral in modern image
rendering applications due to their infinite scalability in resolution,
versatile usability, and editing capabilities. SVGs are particularly popular in
the fields of web development and graphic design. Existing approaches for SVG
modeling using deep learning often struggle with generating complex SVGs and
are restricted to simpler ones that require extensive processing and
simplification. This paper introduces StarVector, a multimodal SVG generation
model that effectively integrates Code Generation Large Language Models
(CodeLLMs) and vision models. Our approach utilizes a CLIP image encoder to
extract visual representations from pixel-based images, which are then
transformed into visual tokens via an adapter module. These visual tokens are
pre-pended to the SVG token embeddings, and the sequence is modeled by the
StarCoder model using next-token prediction, effectively learning to align the
visual and code tokens. This enables StarVector to generate unrestricted SVGs
that accurately represent pixel images. To evaluate StarVector's performance,
we present SVG-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating SVG methods
across multiple datasets and relevant metrics. Within this benchmark, we
introduce novel datasets including SVG-Stack, a large-scale dataset of
real-world SVG examples, and use it to pre-train StarVector as a large
foundation model for SVGs. Our results demonstrate significant enhancements in
visual quality and complexity handling over current methods, marking a notable
advancement in SVG generation technology. Code and models:

<p>The most successful multi-domain text classification (MDTC) approaches employ
the shared-private paradigm to facilitate the enhancement of domain-invariant
features through domain-specific attributes. Additionally, they employ
adversarial training to align marginal feature distributions. Nevertheless,
these methodologies encounter two primary challenges: (1) Neglecting
class-aware information during adversarial alignment poses a risk of
misalignment; (2) The limited availability of labeled data across multiple
domains fails to ensure adequate discriminative capacity for the model. To
tackle these issues, we propose a method called Regularized Conditional
Alignment (RCA) to align the joint distributions of domains and classes, thus
matching features within the same category and amplifying the discriminative
qualities of acquired features. Moreover, we employ entropy minimization and
virtual adversarial training to constrain the uncertainty of predictions
pertaining to unlabeled data and enhance the model's robustness. Empirical
results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our RCA approach outperforms
state-of-the-art MDTC techniques.

<p>In this report, we explore the ability of language model agents to acquire
resources, create copies of themselves, and adapt to novel challenges they
encounter in the wild. We refer to this cluster of capabilities as "autonomous
replication and adaptation" or ARA. We believe that systems capable of ARA
could have wide-reaching and hard-to-anticipate consequences, and that
measuring and forecasting ARA may be useful for informing measures around
security, monitoring, and alignment. Additionally, once a system is capable of
ARA, placing bounds on a system's capabilities may become significantly more
difficult.
</p>
<p>We construct four simple example agents that combine language models with
tools that allow them to take actions in the world. We then evaluate these
agents on 12 tasks relevant to ARA. We find that these language model agents
can only complete the easiest tasks from this list, although they make some
progress on the more challenging tasks. Unfortunately, these evaluations are
not adequate to rule out the possibility that near-future agents will be
capable of ARA. In particular, we do not think that these evaluations provide
good assurance that the ``next generation'' of language models (e.g. 100x
effective compute scaleup on existing models) will not yield agents capable of
ARA, unless intermediate evaluations are performed during pretraining.
Relatedly, we expect that fine-tuning of the existing models could produce
substantially more competent agents, even if the fine-tuning is not directly
targeted at ARA.

<p>LLM chains enable complex tasks by decomposing work into a sequence of
sub-tasks. Crowdsourcing workflows similarly decompose complex tasks into
smaller tasks for human crowdworkers. Chains address LLM errors analogously to
the way crowdsourcing workflows address human error. To characterize
opportunities for LLM chaining, we survey 107 papers across the crowdsourcing
and chaining literature to construct a design space for chain development. The
design space connects an LLM designer's objectives to strategies they can use
to achieve those objectives, and tactics to implement each strategy. To explore
how techniques from crowdsourcing may apply to chaining, we adapt crowdsourcing
workflows to implement LLM chains across three case studies: creating a
taxonomy, shortening text, and writing a short story. From the design space and
our case studies, we identify which techniques transfer from crowdsourcing to
LLM chaining and raise implications for future research and development.

logic; if their relative success in these problems reflects general logical
capabilities; and which layers contribute the most to the task. First, we show
for several encoder-only LMs that they can be trained, to a reasonable degree,
to determine logical validity on various datasets. Next, by cross-probing
fine-tuned models on these datasets, we show that LMs have difficulty in
transferring their putative logical reasoning ability, which suggests that they
may have learned dataset-specific features, instead of a general capability.
Finally, we conduct a layerwise probing experiment, which shows that the
hypothesis classification task is mostly solved through higher layers.

<p>A large body of NLP research has documented the ways gender biases manifest
and amplify within large language models (LLMs), though this research has
predominantly operated within a gender binary-centric context. A growing body
of work has identified the harmful limitations of this gender-exclusive
framing; many LLMs cannot correctly and consistently refer to persons outside
the gender binary, especially if they use neopronouns. While data scarcity has
been identified as a possible culprit, the precise mechanisms through which it
influences LLM misgendering remain underexplored. Our work addresses this gap
by studying data scarcity's role in subword tokenization and, consequently, the
formation of LLM word representations. We uncover how the Byte-Pair Encoding
(BPE) tokenizer, a backbone for many popular LLMs, contributes to neopronoun
misgendering through out-of-vocabulary behavior. We introduce pronoun
tokenization parity (PTP), a novel approach to reduce LLM neopronoun
misgendering by preserving a token's functional structure. We evaluate PTP's
efficacy using pronoun consistency-based metrics and a novel syntax-based
metric. Through several controlled experiments, finetuning LLMs with PTP
improves neopronoun consistency from 14.5% to 58.4%, highlighting the
significant role tokenization plays in LLM pronoun consistency.

<p>Despite progress in automated fact-checking, most systems require a
significant amount of labeled training data, which is expensive. In this paper,
we propose a novel zero-shot method, which instead of operating directly on the
claim and evidence sentences, decomposes them into semantic triples augmented
using external knowledge graphs, and uses large language models trained for
natural language inference. This allows it to generalize to adversarial
datasets and domains that supervised models require specific training data for.
Our empirical results show that our approach outperforms previous zero-shot
approaches on FEVER, FEVER-Symmetric, FEVER 2.0, and Climate-FEVER, while being
comparable or better than supervised models on the adversarial and the
out-of-domain datasets.

<p>In recent years, there has been a growing interest in exploring dialogues
with more complex goals, such as negotiation, persuasion, and emotional
support, which go beyond traditional service-focused dialogue systems. Apart
from the requirement for much more sophisticated strategic reasoning and
communication skills, a significant challenge of these tasks lies in the
difficulty of objectively measuring the achievement of their goals in a
quantifiable way, making it difficult for existing research to directly
optimize the dialogue procedure towards them. In our work, we emphasize the
multifaceted nature of complex dialogue goals and argue that it is more
feasible to accomplish them by comprehensively considering and jointly
promoting their different aspects. To this end, we propose a novel dialogue
framework, Cooper, which coordinates multiple specialized agents, each
dedicated to a specific dialogue goal aspect separately, to approach the
complex objective. Through this divide-and-conquer manner, we make complex
dialogue goals more approachable and elicit greater intelligence via the
collaboration of individual agents. Experiments on persuasion and emotional
support dialogues demonstrate the superiority of our method over a set of
competitive baselines.

<p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown great success in various Natural
Language Processing (NLP) tasks, whist they still need updates after deployment
to fix errors or keep pace with the changing knowledge in the world.
Researchers formulate such problem as Model Editing and have developed various
editors focusing on different axes of editing properties. However, current
editors can hardly support all properties and rely on heavy computational
resources. In this paper, we propose a plug-in Model Editing method based on
neuron-indexed dynamic LoRA (MELO), which alters the behavior of language
models by dynamically activating certain LoRA blocks according to the index
built in an inner vector database. Our method satisfies various editing
properties with high efficiency and can be easily integrated into multiple LLM
backbones. Experimental results show that our proposed MELO achieves
state-of-the-art editing performance on three sequential editing tasks
(document classification, question answering and hallucination correction),
while requires the least trainable parameters and computational cost.

<h1><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11803">Designing Guiding Principles for NLP for Healthcare: A Case Study of Maternal Health. (arXiv:2312.11803v1 [cs.CL])</a></h1>

<p>Objective: An ethical framework for the use of large language models (LLMs)
is urgently needed to shape how natural language processing (NLP) tools are
used for healthcare applications. Drawing directly from the voices of those
most affected, we propose a set of guiding principles for the use of NLP in
healthcare, with examples based on applications in maternal health.
</p>
<p>Materials and Methods: We led an interactive session centered on an LLM-based
chatbot demonstration during a full-day workshop with 39 participants, and
additionally surveyed 30 healthcare workers and 30 birthing people about their
values, needs, and perceptions of AI and LLMs. We conducted quantitative and
qualitative analyses of the interactive discussions to consolidate our findings
into a set of guiding principles.
</p>
<p>Results: Using the case study of maternal health, we propose nine principles
for ethical use of LLMs, grouped into three categories: (i) contextual
significance, (ii) measurements, and (iii) who/what is valued. We describe
rationales underlying these principles and provide practical advice.
</p>
<p>Discussion: Healthcare faces existing challenges including the balance of
power in clinician-patient relationships, systemic health disparities,
historical injustices, and economic constraints. Our principles serve as a
framework for surfacing key considerations when deploying LLMs in medicine, as
well as providing a methodological pattern for other researchers to follow.
</p>
<p>Conclusion: This set of principles can serve as a resource to practitioners
working on maternal health and other healthcare fields to emphasize the
importance of technical nuance, historical context, and inclusive design when
developing LLMs for use in clinical settings.

<p>This report introduces a new family of multimodal models, Gemini, that
exhibit remarkable capabilities across image, audio, video, and text
understanding. The Gemini family consists of Ultra, Pro, and Nano sizes,
suitable for applications ranging from complex reasoning tasks to on-device
memory-constrained use-cases. Evaluation on a broad range of benchmarks shows
that our most-capable Gemini Ultra model advances the state of the art in 30 of
32 of these benchmarks - notably being the first model to achieve human-expert
performance on the well-studied exam benchmark MMLU, and improving the state of
the art in every one of the 20 multimodal benchmarks we examined. We believe
that the new capabilities of Gemini models in cross-modal reasoning and
language understanding will enable a wide variety of use cases and we discuss
our approach toward deploying them responsibly to users.

<p>Recently, ChatGPT or InstructGPT like large language models (LLM) has made a
significant impact in the AI world. These models are incredibly versatile,
capable of performing language tasks on par or even exceeding the capabilities
of human experts. Many works have attempted to reproduce the complex
InstructGPT's RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback) training
pipeline. However, the mainstream distributed RLHF training methods typically
adopt a fixed model placement strategy, referred to as the Flattening strategy.
This strategy treats all four models involved in RLHF as a single entity and
places them on all devices, regardless of their differences. Unfortunately,
this strategy exacerbates the generation bottlenecks in the RLHF training and
degrades the overall training efficiency. To address these issues, we propose
an adaptive model placement framework that offers two flexible model placement
strategies. These strategies allow for the agile allocation of models across
devices in a fine-grained manner. The Interleaving strategy helps reduce memory
redundancy and communication costs during RLHF training. On the other hand, the
Separation strategy improves the throughput of model training by separating the
training and generation stages of the RLHF pipeline. Notably, this framework
seamlessly integrates with other mainstream techniques for acceleration and
enables automatic hyperparameter search. Extensive experiments have
demonstrated that our Interleaving and Separation strategies can achieve
notable improvements up to 11x, compared to the current state-of-the-art (SOTA)
approaches. These experiments encompassed a wide range of training scenarios,
involving models of varying sizes and devices of different scales. The results
highlight the effectiveness and superiority of our approaches in accelerating
the training of distributed RLHF.

<p>Chatbots have become one of the main pathways for the delivery of business
automation tools. Multi-agent systems offer a framework for designing chatbots
at scale, making it easier to support complex conversations that span across
multiple domains as well as enabling developers to maintain and expand their
capabilities incrementally over time. However, multi-agent systems complicate
the natural language understanding (NLU) of user intents, especially when they
rely on decentralized NLU models: some utterances (termed single intent) may
invoke a single agent while others (termed multi-intent) may explicitly invoke
multiple agents. Without correctly parsing multi-intent inputs, decentralized
NLU approaches will not achieve high prediction accuracy. In this paper, we
propose an efficient parsing and orchestration pipeline algorithm to service
multi-intent utterances from the user in the context of a multi-agent system.
Our proposed approach achieved comparable performance to competitive deep
learning models on three different datasets while being up to 48 times faster.

principles are still unclear. In this paper, we reveal the transition of loss
landscape in the downstream domain from random initialization to pre-trained
initialization, that is, from low-amplitude oscillation to high-amplitude
oscillation. The parameter gradients exhibit a property akin to sparsity, where
a small fraction of components dominate the total gradient norm, for instance,
1% of the components account for 99% of the gradient. This property ensures
that the pre-trained model can easily find a flat minimizer which guarantees
the model's ability to generalize even with a low number of trainable
parameters. Based on this, we propose a gradient-based sparse fine-tuning
algorithm, named Sparse Increment Fine-Tuning (SIFT), and validate its
effectiveness on a range of tasks including the GLUE Benchmark and
Instruction-tuning. The code is accessible at https://github.com/song-wx/SIFT/.

<p>In Korean ancient documents, there is no spacing or punctuation, and they are
written in classical Chinese characters. This makes it challenging for modern
individuals and translation models to accurately interpret and translate them.
While China has models predicting punctuation and spacing, applying them
directly to Korean texts is problematic due to data differences. Therefore, we
developed the first models which predict punctuation and spacing for Korean
historical texts and evaluated their performance. Our punctuation restoration
model achieved an F1 score of 0.84, and Spacing model achieved a score of 0.96.
It has the advantage of enabling inference on low-performance GPUs with less
VRAM while maintaining quite high accuracy.

<p>Early Exiting is one of the most popular methods to achieve efficient
inference. Current early exiting methods adopt the (weighted) sum of the cross
entropy loss of all internal classifiers during training, imposing all these
classifiers to predict all instances correctly. However, during inference, as
long as one internal classifier predicts an instance correctly, it can
accelerate without losing accuracy. Thus, there is a notable gap between
training and inference. We propose ConsistentEE, an early exiting method that
is consistent in training and inference. ConsistentEE formulates the early
exiting process as a reinforcement learning problem. A policy network is added
to decide whether an instance should exit or continue. The training objective
of ConsistentEE only require each instance to be predicted correctly by one
internal classifier. Additionally, we introduce the concept Memorize Layer to
measure the hardness of an instance. We incorporate memorized layer into reward
function design, which allows ``easy'' instances to focus more on acceleration
while ``hard'' instances to focus more on accuracy. Experimental results show
that our method outperforms other baselines on various natural language
understanding and generation tasks.

<p>This paper presents novel techniques for enhancing the performance of
knowledge tracing (KT) models by focusing on the crucial factor of question and
concept difficulty level. Despite the acknowledged significance of difficulty,
previous KT research has yet to exploit its potential for model optimization
and has struggled to predict difficulty from unseen data. To address these
problems, we propose a difficulty-centered contrastive learning method for KT
models and a Large Language Model (LLM)-based framework for difficulty
prediction. These innovative methods seek to improve the performance of KT
models and provide accurate difficulty estimates for unseen data. Our ablation
study demonstrates the efficacy of these techniques by demonstrating enhanced
KT model performance. Nonetheless, the complex relationship between language
and difficulty merits further investigation.

<p>The recent outbreak of the MPox virus has resulted in a tremendous increase
in the usage of Twitter. Prior works in this area of research have primarily
focused on the sentiment analysis and content analysis of these Tweets, and the
few works that have focused on topic modeling have multiple limitations. This
paper aims to address this research gap and makes two scientific contributions
to this field. First, it presents the results of performing Topic Modeling on
601,432 Tweets about the 2022 Mpox outbreak that were posted on Twitter between
7 May 2022 and 3 March 2023. The results indicate that the conversations on
Twitter related to Mpox during this time range may be broadly categorized into
four distinct themes - Views and Perspectives about Mpox, Updates on Cases and
Investigations about Mpox, Mpox and the LGBTQIA+ Community, and Mpox and
COVID-19. Second, the paper presents the findings from the analysis of these
Tweets. The results show that the theme that was most popular on Twitter (in
terms of the number of Tweets posted) during this time range was Views and
Perspectives about Mpox. This was followed by the theme of Mpox and the
LGBTQIA+ Community, which was followed by the themes of Mpox and COVID-19 and
Updates on Cases and Investigations about Mpox, respectively. Finally, a

<p>One of the key issues in Mandarin Chinese text-to-speech (TTS) systems is
polyphone disambiguation when doing grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion. In
this paper, we introduce a novel method to solve the problem as a generation
task. Following the trending research of large language models (LLM) and prompt
learning, the proposed method consists of three modules. Retrieval module
incorporates external knowledge which is a multi-level semantic dictionary of
Chinese polyphonic characters to format the sentence into a prompt. Generation
module adopts the decoder-only Transformer architecture to induce the target
text. Postprocess module corrects the generated text into a valid result if
needed. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the existing
methods on a public dataset called CPP. We also empirically study the impacts
of different templates of the prompt, different sizes of training data, and
whether to incorporate external knowledge.

<p>Multi-hop Knowledge Base Question Answering(KBQA) aims to find the answer
entity in a knowledge graph (KG), which requires multiple steps of reasoning.
Existing retrieval-based approaches solve this task by concentrating on the
specific relation at different hops and predicting the intermediate entity
within the reasoning path. During the reasoning process of these methods, the
representation of relations are fixed but the initial relation representation
may not be optimal. We claim they fail to utilize information from head-tail
entities and the semantic connection between relations to enhance the current
relation representation, which undermines the ability to capture information of
relations in KGs. To address this issue, we construct a \textbf{dual relation
graph} where each node denotes a relation in the original KG (\textbf{primal
entity graph}) and edges are constructed between relations sharing same head or
tail entities. Then we iteratively do primal entity graph reasoning, dual
relation graph information propagation, and interaction between these two
graphs. In this way, the interaction between entity and relation is enhanced,
and we derive better entity and relation representations. Experiments on two
public datasets, WebQSP and CWQ, show that our approach achieves a significant
performance gain over the prior state-of-the-art. Our code is available on

<p>Conversational Speech Synthesis (CSS) aims to accurately express an utterance
with the appropriate prosody and emotional inflection within a conversational
setting. While recognising the significance of CSS task, the prior studies have
not thoroughly investigated the emotional expressiveness problems due to the
scarcity of emotional conversational datasets and the difficulty of stateful
emotion modeling. In this paper, we propose a novel emotional CSS model, termed
ECSS, that includes two main components: 1) to enhance emotion understanding,
we introduce a heterogeneous graph-based emotional context modeling mechanism,
which takes the multi-source dialogue history as input to model the dialogue
context and learn the emotion cues from the context; 2) to achieve emotion
rendering, we employ a contrastive learning-based emotion renderer module to
infer the accurate emotion style for the target utterance. To address the issue
of data scarcity, we meticulously create emotional labels in terms of category
and intensity, and annotate additional emotional information on the existing
conversational dataset (DailyTalk). Both objective and subjective evaluations
suggest that our model outperforms the baseline models in understanding and
rendering emotions. These evaluations also underscore the importance of
comprehensive emotional annotations. Code and audio samples can be found at:

<p>Agent-based modeling and simulation has evolved as a powerful tool for
modeling complex systems, offering insights into emergent behaviors and
interactions among diverse agents. Integrating large language models into
agent-based modeling and simulation presents a promising avenue for enhancing
simulation capabilities. This paper surveys the landscape of utilizing large
language models in agent-based modeling and simulation, examining their
challenges and promising future directions. In this survey, since this is an
interdisciplinary field, we first introduce the background of agent-based
modeling and simulation and large language model-empowered agents. We then
discuss the motivation for applying large language models to agent-based
simulation and systematically analyze the challenges in environment perception,
human alignment, action generation, and evaluation. Most importantly, we
provide a comprehensive overview of the recent works of large language
model-empowered agent-based modeling and simulation in multiple scenarios,
which can be divided into four domains: cyber, physical, social, and hybrid,
covering simulation of both real-world and virtual environments. Finally, since

<p>Network Pruning is a promising way to address the huge computing resource
demands of the deployment and inference of Large Language Models (LLMs).
Retraining-free is important for LLMs' pruning methods. However, almost all of
the existing retraining-free pruning approaches for LLMs focus on unstructured
pruning, which requires specific hardware support for acceleration. In this
paper, we propose a novel retraining-free structured pruning framework for
LLMs, named FLAP (FLuctuation-based Adaptive Structured Pruning). It is
hardware-friendly by effectively reducing storage and enhancing inference
speed. For effective structured pruning of LLMs, we highlight three critical
elements that demand the utmost attention: formulating structured importance
metrics, adaptively searching the global compressed model, and implementing
compensation mechanisms to mitigate performance loss. First, FLAP determines
whether the output feature map is easily recoverable when a column of weight is
removed, based on the fluctuation pruning metric. Then it standardizes the
importance scores to adaptively determine the global compressed model
structure. At last, FLAP adds additional bias terms to recover the output
feature maps using the baseline values. We thoroughly evaluate our approach on
a variety of language benchmarks. Without any retraining, our method
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, including LLM-Pruner
and the extension of Wanda in structured pruning. The code is released at

<p>Climate change presents significant challenges to the global community, and
it is imperative to raise widespread awareness of the climate crisis and
educate users about low-carbon living. Artificial intelligence, particularly
large language models (LLMs), have emerged as powerful tools in mitigating the
climate crisis, leveraging their extensive knowledge, broad user base, and
natural language interaction capabilities. However, despite the growing body of
research on climate change, there is a lack of comprehensive assessments of
climate crisis knowledge within LLMs. This paper aims to resolve this gap by
proposing an automatic evaluation framework. We employ a hybrid approach to
data acquisition that combines data synthesis and manual collection to compile
a diverse set of questions related to the climate crisis. These questions cover
various aspects of climate change, including its causes, impacts, mitigation
strategies, and adaptation measures. We then evaluate the model knowledge
through prompt engineering based on the collected questions and generated
answers. We propose a set of comprehensive metrics to evaluate the climate
crisis knowledge, incorporating indicators from 10 different perspectives.
Experimental results show that our method is effective in evaluating the
knowledge of LLMs regarding the climate crisis. We evaluate several
state-of-the-art LLMs and find that their knowledge falls short in terms of
timeliness.

<p>Mind-map generation aims to process a document into a hierarchical structure
to show its central idea and branches. Such a manner is more conducive to
understanding the logic and semantics of the document than plain text.
Recently, a state-of-the-art method encodes the sentences of a document
sequentially and converts them to a relation graph via sequence-to-graph.
Though this method is efficient to generate mind-maps in parallel, its
mechanism focuses more on sequential features while hardly capturing structural
information. Moreover, it's difficult to model long-range semantic relations.
In this work, we propose a coreference-guided mind-map generation network
(CMGN) to incorporate external structure knowledge. Specifically, we construct
a coreference graph based on the coreference semantic relationship to introduce
the graph structure information. Then we employ a coreference graph encoder to
mine the potential governing relations between sentences. In order to exclude
noise and better utilize the information of the coreference graph, we adopt a
graph enhancement module in a contrastive learning manner. Experimental results
demonstrate that our model outperforms all the existing methods. The case study
further proves that our model can more accurately and concisely reveal the
structure and semantics of a document. Code and data are available at

<p>Actively inferring user preferences, for example by asking good questions, is
important for any human-facing decision-making system. Active inference allows
such systems to adapt and personalize themselves to nuanced individual
preferences. To enable this ability for instruction-tuned large language models
(LLMs), one may prompt them to ask users questions to infer their preferences,
transforming the language models into more robust, interactive systems.
However, out of the box, these models are not efficient at extracting
preferences: the questions they generate are not informative, requiring a high
number of user interactions and impeding the usability of the downstream
system. In this work, we introduce an inference-time algorithm that helps LLMs
quickly infer preferences by using more informative questions. Our algorithm
uses a probabilistic model whose conditional distributions are defined by
prompting an LLM, and returns questions that optimize expected entropy and
expected model change. Results in a simplified interactive web shopping setting
with real product items show that an LLM equipped with our entropy reduction
algorithm outperforms baselines with the same underlying LLM on task
performance while using fewer user interactions.

<p>Few-shot Relation Extraction (FSRE) aims to extract relational facts from a

FSRE by employing Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) within the framework of
supervised contrastive learning, which considers both instances and label

motivated by the insight that the diverse viewpoints conveyed through
instance-label pairs capture incomplete yet complementary intrinsic textual
semantics. Specifically, our framework involves a symmetrical contrastive
objective that encompasses both sentence-anchored and label-anchored
contrastive losses. By combining these two losses, the model establishes a
robust and uniform representation space. This space effectively captures the
reciprocal alignment of feature distributions among instances and relational
facts, simultaneously enhancing the maximization of mutual information across
diverse perspectives within the same relation. Experimental results demonstrate
that our framework achieves significant performance enhancements compared to
baseline models in downstream FSRE tasks. Furthermore, our approach exhibits
superior adaptability to handle the challenges of domain shift and zero-shot
relation extraction. Our code is available online at

<p>This research introduces an innovative evaluation method for the
"founder-idea" fit in early-stage startups, utilizing advanced large language
model techniques to assess founders' profiles against their startup ideas to
enhance decision-making. Embeddings, self-play, tree-of-thought, and
critique-based refinement techniques show early promising results that each
idea's success patterns are unique and they should be evaluated based on the

<p>In text generation, a large language model (LM) makes a choice of each new
word based only on the former selection of its context using the softmax
function. Nevertheless, the link statistics information of concurrent words
based on a scene-specific corpus is valuable in choosing the next word, which
can help to ensure the topic of the generated text to be aligned with the
current task. To fully explore the co-occurrence information,we propose a
graphmax function for task-specific text generation. Using the graph-based
regularization, graphmax enables the final word choice to be determined by both
the global knowledge from the LM and the local knowledge from the
scene-specific corpus. The traditional softmax function is regularized with a
graph total variation (GTV) term, which incorporates the local knowledge into
the LM and encourages the model to consider the statistical relationships
between words in a scene-specific corpus. The proposed graphmax is versatile
and can be readily plugged into any large pre-trained LM for text generation
and machine translation. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the
new GTV-based regularization can improve performances in various natural
language processing tasks in comparison with existing methods. Moreover,
through human experiments, we observe that participants can easily distinguish
the text generated by graphmax or softmax.

<p>The Emotion Cause Extraction (ECE)} task aims to identify clauses which
contain emotion-evoking information for a particular emotion expressed in text.
We observe that a widely-used ECE dataset exhibits a bias that the majority of
annotated cause clauses are either directly before their associated emotion
clauses or are the emotion clauses themselves. Existing models for ECE tend to
explore such relative position information and suffer from the dataset bias. To
investigate the degree of reliance of existing ECE models on clause relative
positions, we propose a novel strategy to generate adversarial examples in
which the relative position information is no longer the indicative feature of
cause clauses. We test the performance of existing models on such adversarial
examples and observe a significant performance drop. To address the dataset
bias, we propose a novel graph-based method to explicitly model the emotion
triggering paths by leveraging the commonsense knowledge to enhance the
semantic dependencies between a candidate clause and an emotion clause.
Experimental results show that our proposed approach performs on par with the
existing state-of-the-art methods on the original ECE dataset, and is more
robust against adversarial attacks compared to existing models.

<p>Human beings use compositionality to generalise from past experiences to
novel experiences. We assume a separation of our experiences into fundamental
atomic components that can be recombined in novel ways to support our ability
to engage with novel experiences. We frame this as the ability to learn to
generalise compositionally, and we will refer to behaviours making use of this
ability as compositional learning behaviours (CLBs). A central problem to
learning CLBs is the resolution of a binding problem (BP). While it is another
feat of intelligence that human beings perform with ease, it is not the case
for state-of-the-art artificial agents. Thus, in order to build artificial
agents able to collaborate with human beings, we propose to develop a novel
benchmark to investigate agents' abilities to exhibit CLBs by solving a
domain-agnostic version of the BP. We take inspiration from the language
emergence and grounding framework of referential games and propose a
meta-learning extension of referential games, entitled Meta-Referential Games,
and use this framework to build our benchmark, the Symbolic Behaviour Benchmark
(S2B). We provide baseline results and error analysis showing that our
benchmark is a compelling challenge that we hope will spur the research
community towards developing more capable artificial agents.

<p>Token uniformity is commonly observed in transformer-based models, in which
different tokens share a large proportion of similar information after going
through stacked multiple self-attention layers in a transformer. In this paper,
we propose to use the distribution of singular values of outputs of each
transformer layer to characterise the phenomenon of token uniformity and
empirically illustrate that a less skewed singular value distribution can
alleviate the `token uniformity' problem. Base on our observations, we define
several desirable properties of singular value distributions and propose a
novel transformation function for updating the singular values. We show that
apart from alleviating token uniformity, the transformation function should
preserve the local neighbourhood structure in the original embedding space. Our
proposed singular value transformation function is applied to a range of
transformer-based language models such as BERT, ALBERT, RoBERTa and DistilBERT,
and improved performance is observed in semantic textual similarity evaluation
and a range of GLUE tasks. Our source code is available at

<p>Language tasks involving character-level manipulations (e.g., spelling
corrections, arithmetic operations, word games) are challenging for models
operating on subword units. To address this, we develop a causal intervention
framework to learn robust and interpretable character representations inside
subword-based language models. Our method treats each character as a typed
variable in a causal model and learns such causal structures by adapting the
interchange intervention training method of Geiger et al. (2021). We
additionally introduce a suite of character-level tasks that systematically
vary in their dependence on meaning and sequence-level context. While
character-level models still perform best on purely form-based tasks like
string reversal, our method outperforms character-level models on more complex
tasks that blend form, meaning, and context, such as spelling correction in
context and word search games. Compared with standard subword-based models, our
approach also significantly improves robustness on unseen token sequences and
leads to human-interpretable internal representations of characters.

<p>Word embedding has become ubiquitous and is widely used in various text
mining and natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as information
retrieval, semantic analysis, and machine translation, among many others.
Unfortunately, it is prohibitively expensive to train the word embedding in a
relatively large corpus. We propose a graph-based word embedding algorithm,
called Word-Graph2vec, which converts the large corpus into a word
co-occurrence graph, then takes the word sequence samples from this graph by
randomly traveling and trains the word embedding on this sampling corpus in the
end. We posit that because of the stable vocabulary, relative idioms, and fixed
expressions in English, the size and density of the word co-occurrence graph
change slightly with the increase in the training corpus. So that
Word-Graph2vec has stable runtime on the large scale data set, and its
performance advantage becomes more and more obvious with the growth of the
training corpus. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets show
that the proposed algorithm outperforms traditional Skip-Gram by four-five
times in terms of efficiency, while the error generated by the random walk
sampling is small.

<p>In recent years, advancements in large language models have been remarkable,
with models such as ChatGPT demonstrating exceptional proficiency in diverse
linguistic tasks. The pre-training of large models with billions of parameters,
poses a formidable challenge, primarily due to the scarcity of datasets of a
commensurate scale for effective training. Nevertheless, innovative strategies
have emerged, including methods to fine-tune these pre-trained models using
fewer parameters set, as evidenced by models like MiniGPT-4 and LLaVA. Despite
their potential in various domains, these models remain limited in their
understanding of artistic imagery. They have yet to fully grasp the intricate
nuances of art images or to provide an objective articulation of the emotions
they evoke, in a manner akin to human perception. This work introduces
ArtGPT-4, a pioneering large vision-language model tailored to address the
deficiencies of contemporary models in artistic comprehension. ArtGPT-4
underwent training on image-text pairs utilizing a Tesla A100 device in a mere
2 hours, with a dataset comprising approximately 0.52M entries. Impressively,
the model can render images with an artistic-understanding and convey the
emotions they inspire, mirroring human interpretation. Additionally, this work
presents a unique dataset designed to evaluate the efficacy of vision-language
models. In subsequent evaluations, ArtGPT-4 not only achieved state-of-the-art
performance on the ArtEmis and ArtEmis-v2.0 datasets but also exceeded the
established benchmarks introduced in This study, lagging behind professional
artists' descriptions by a negligible 0.15 points on a 6-point scale. The code

<p>In-context learning (ICL) emerges as a promising capability of large language
models (LLMs) by providing them with demonstration examples to perform diverse
tasks. However, the underlying mechanism of how LLMs learn from the provided
context remains under-explored. In this paper, we investigate the working
mechanism of ICL through an information flow lens. Our findings reveal that
label words in the demonstration examples function as anchors: (1) semantic
information aggregates into label word representations during the shallow
computation layers' processing; (2) the consolidated information in label words
serves as a reference for LLMs' final predictions. Based on these insights, we
introduce an anchor re-weighting method to improve ICL performance, a
demonstration compression technique to expedite inference, and an analysis
framework for diagnosing ICL errors in GPT2-XL. The promising applications of
our findings again validate the uncovered ICL working mechanism and pave the
way for future studies.

<p>Controllable text generation is a challenging and meaningful field in natural
language generation (NLG). Especially, poetry generation is a typical one with
well-defined and strict conditions for text generation which is an ideal
playground for the assessment of current methodologies. While prior works
succeeded in controlling either semantic or metrical aspects of poetry
generation, simultaneously addressing both remains a challenge. In this paper,
we pioneer the use of the Diffusion model for generating sonnets and Chinese
SongCi poetry to tackle such challenges. In terms of semantics, our
PoetryDiffusion model, built upon the Diffusion model, generates entire
sentences or poetry by comprehensively considering the entirety of sentence
information. This approach enhances semantic expression, distinguishing it from
autoregressive and large language models (LLMs). For metrical control, the
separation feature of diffusion generation and its constraint control module
enable us to flexibly incorporate a novel metrical controller to manipulate and
evaluate metrics (format and rhythm). The denoising process in PoetryDiffusion
allows for gradual enhancement of semantics and flexible integration of the
metrical controller which can calculate and impose penalties on states that
stray significantly from the target control distribution. Experimental results
on two datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms existing models in
automatic evaluation of semantic, metrical, and overall performance as well as
human evaluation.

<p>Software engineering is a domain characterized by intricate decision-making
processes, often relying on nuanced intuition and consultation. Recent
advancements in deep learning have started to revolutionize software
engineering practices through elaborate designs implemented at various stages
of software development. In this paper, we present an innovative paradigm that
leverages large language models (LLMs) throughout the entire software
development process, streamlining and unifying key processes through natural
language communication, thereby eliminating the need for specialized models at
each phase. At the core of this paradigm lies ChatDev, a virtual chat-powered
software development company that mirrors the established waterfall model,
meticulously dividing the development process into four distinct chronological
stages: designing, coding, testing, and documenting. Each stage engages a team
of "software agents", such as programmers, code reviewers, and test engineers,
fostering collaborative dialogue and facilitating a seamless workflow. The chat
chain acts as a facilitator, breaking down each stage into atomic subtasks.
This enables dual roles, allowing for proposing and validating solutions
through context-aware communication, leading to efficient resolution of
specific subtasks. The instrumental analysis of ChatDev highlights its
remarkable efficacy in software generation, enabling the completion of the
entire software development process in under seven minutes at a cost of less
than one dollar. It not only identifies and alleviates potential
vulnerabilities but also rectifies potential hallucinations while maintaining
commendable efficiency and cost-effectiveness. The potential of ChatDev unveils
fresh possibilities for integrating LLMs into the realm of software
development. Our code is available at https://github.com/OpenBMB/ChatDev.

<p>Length extrapolation has attracted considerable attention recently since it
allows transformers to be tested on longer sequences than those used in
training. Previous research has shown that this property can be attained by
using carefully designed Relative Positional Encodings (RPEs). While these
methods perform well on a variety of corpora, the conditions for length
extrapolation have yet to be investigated. This paper attempts to determine
what types of RPEs allow for length extrapolation through a thorough
mathematical and empirical analysis. We discover that a transformer is certain
to possess this property as long as the series that corresponds to the RPE's
exponential converges. Two practices are derived from the conditions and
examined in language modeling tasks on a variety of corpora. As a bonus from
the conditions, we derive a new Theoretical Receptive Field (TRF) to measure
the receptive field of RPEs without taking any training steps. Extensive
experiments are conducted on the Wikitext-103, Books, Github, and WikiBook
datasets to demonstrate the viability of our discovered conditions. We also
compare TRF to Empirical Receptive Field (ERF) across different models, showing
consistently matched trends on the aforementioned datasets. The code is

<p>We present SeaEval, a benchmark for multilingual foundation models. In
addition to characterizing how these models understand and reason with natural
language, we also investigate how well they comprehend cultural practices,
nuances, and values. Alongside standard accuracy metrics, we investigate the
brittleness of foundation models in the dimensions of semantics and
multilinguality. Our analyses span both open-sourced and closed models, leading
to empirical results across classic NLP tasks, reasoning, and cultural
comprehension. Key findings indicate (1) Most models exhibit varied behavior
when given paraphrased instructions. (2) Many models still suffer from exposure
bias (e.g., positional bias, majority label bias). (3) For questions rooted in
factual, scientific, and commonsense knowledge, consistent responses are
expected across multilingual queries that are semantically equivalent. Yet,
most models surprisingly demonstrate inconsistent performance on these queries.
(4) Multilingually-trained models have not attained "balanced multilingual"
capabilities. Our endeavors underscore the need for more generalizable semantic
representations and enhanced multilingual contextualization. SeaEval can serve
as a launchpad for more thorough investigations and evaluations for
multilingual and multicultural scenarios.

<p>Sentence Representation Learning (SRL) is a fundamental task in Natural
Language Processing (NLP), with the Contrastive Learning of Sentence Embeddings
(CSE) being the mainstream technique due to its superior performance. An
intriguing phenomenon in CSE is the significant performance gap between
supervised and unsupervised methods, with their only difference lying in the
training data. Previous works attribute this performance gap to differences in
two representation properties (alignment and uniformity). However, since
alignment and uniformity only measure the results, they fail to answer "What
aspects of the training data contribute to the performance gap?" and "How can
the performance gap be narrowed?", In this paper, we conduct empirical
experiments to answer these "What" and "How" questions. We first answer the
"What" question by thoroughly comparing the behavior of supervised and
unsupervised CSE during their respective training processes. From the
comparison, we identify the similarity pattern as a key factor to the
performance gap, and introduce a metric, called Relative Fitting Difficulty
(RFD), to measure the complexity of the similarity pattern. Then, based on the
insights gained from the "What" question, we tackle the "How" question by
increasing the pattern complexity of the training data. We achieve this by
leveraging the In-Context Learning (ICL) capability of the Large Language Model
(LLM) to generate data that simulates complex patterns. By utilizing the
hierarchical patterns in the LLM-generated data, we effectively narrow the gap
between supervised and unsupervised CSE. We release our codes and appendix at

framework relies on text interaction and the Unity game engine. By
incorporating techniques for scene understanding, task planning,
self-debugging, and memory management, LLMR outperforms the standard GPT-4 by
4x in average error rate. We demonstrate LLMR's cross-platform interoperability
with several example worlds, and evaluate it on a variety of creation and
modification tasks to show that it can produce and edit diverse objects, tools,

<p>Traditional evaluation metrics like ROUGE compare lexical overlap between the
reference and generated summaries without taking argumentative structure into
account, which is important for legal summaries. In this paper, we propose a
novel legal summarization evaluation framework that utilizes GPT-4 to generate
a set of question-answer pairs that cover main points and information in the
reference summary. GPT-4 is then used to generate answers based on the
generated summary for the questions from the reference summary. Finally, GPT-4
grades the answers from the reference summary and the generated summary. We
examined the correlation between GPT-4 grading with human grading. The results
suggest that this question-answering approach with GPT-4 can be a useful tool
for gauging the quality of the summary.

<p>With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), there is a
pressing need for a comprehensive evaluation suite to assess their capabilities
and limitations. Existing LLM leaderboards often reference scores reported in
other papers without consistent settings and prompts, which may inadvertently
encourage cherry-picking favored settings and prompts for better results. In
this work, we introduce GPT-Fathom, an open-source and reproducible LLM
evaluation suite built on top of OpenAI Evals. We systematically evaluate 10+
leading LLMs as well as OpenAI's legacy models on 20+ curated benchmarks across
7 capability categories, all under aligned settings. Our retrospective study on
OpenAI's earlier models offers valuable insights into the evolutionary path
from GPT-3 to GPT-4. Currently, the community is eager to know how GPT-3
progressively improves to GPT-4, including technical details like whether
adding code data improves LLM's reasoning capability, which aspects of LLM
capability can be improved by SFT and RLHF, how much is the alignment tax, etc.
Our analysis sheds light on many of these questions, aiming to improve the

<p>Studying language models (LMs) in terms of well-understood formalisms allows
us to precisely characterize their abilities and limitations. Previous work has
investigated the representational capacity of recurrent neural network (RNN)
LMs in terms of their capacity to recognize unweighted formal languages.
However, LMs do not describe unweighted formal languages -- rather, they define
\emph{probability distributions} over strings. In this work, we study what
classes of such probability distributions RNN LMs can represent, which allows
us to make more direct statements about their capabilities. We show that simple
RNNs are equivalent to a subclass of probabilistic finite-state automata, and
can thus model a strict subset of probability distributions expressible by
finite-state models. Furthermore, we study the space complexity of representing
finite-state LMs with RNNs. We show that, to represent an arbitrary
deterministic finite-state LM with $N$ states over an alphabet $\alphabet$, an
RNN requires $\Omega\left(N |\Sigma|\right)$ neurons. These results present a
first step towards characterizing the classes of distributions RNN LMs can
represent and thus help us understand their capabilities and limitations.

<p>Multimodal language generation, which leverages the synergy of language and
vision, is a rapidly expanding field. However, existing vision-language models
face challenges in tasks that require complex linguistic understanding. To
address this issue, we introduce Visual-Language models as Importance Sampling
weights (VLIS), a novel framework that combines the visual conditioning
capability of vision-language models with the language understanding of
unimodal text-only language models without further training. It extracts
pointwise mutual information of each image and text from a visual-language
model and uses the value as an importance sampling weight to adjust the token
likelihood from a text-only model. VLIS improves vision-language models on
diverse tasks, including commonsense understanding (WHOOPS, OK-VQA, and
ScienceQA) and complex text generation (Concadia, Image Paragraph Captioning,
and ROCStories). Our results suggest that VLIS represents a promising new

<p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have advanced graph structure understanding via
recursive information exchange and aggregation among graph nodes. To improve
model robustness, self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising
approach for data augmentation. However, existing methods for generating
pre-trained graph embeddings often rely on fine-tuning with specific downstream
task labels, which limits their usability in scenarios where labeled data is
scarce or unavailable. To address this, our research focuses on advancing the
generalization capabilities of graph models in challenging zero-shot learning
scenarios. Inspired by the success of large language models (LLMs), we aim to
develop a graph-oriented LLM that can achieve high generalization across
diverse downstream datasets and tasks, even without any information available
from the downstream graph data. In this work, we present the GraphGPT framework
that aligns LLMs with graph structural knowledge with a graph instruction
tuning paradigm. Our framework incorporates a text-graph grounding component to
establish a connection between textual information and graph structures.
Additionally, we propose a dual-stage instruction tuning paradigm, accompanied
by a lightweight graph-text alignment projector. This paradigm explores
self-supervised graph structural signals and task-specific graph instructions,
to guide LLMs in understanding complex graph structures and improving their
adaptability across different downstream tasks. Our framework is evaluated on
supervised and zero-shot graph learning tasks, demonstrating superior
generalization and outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

<p>In this paper, we explore FP8 low-bit data formats for efficient training of
large language models (LLMs). Our key insight is that most variables, such as
gradients and optimizer states, in LLM training can employ low-precision data
formats without compromising model accuracy and requiring no changes to
hyper-parameters. Specifically, we propose a new FP8 automatic mixed-precision
framework for training LLMs. This framework offers three levels of FP8
utilization to streamline mixed-precision and distributed parallel training for
LLMs. It gradually incorporates 8-bit gradients, optimizer states, and
distributed learning in an incremental manner. Experiment results show that,
during the training of GPT-175B model on H100 GPU platform, our FP8
mixed-precision training framework not only achieved a remarkable 39% reduction
in real memory usage but also ran 75% faster than the widely adopted BF16
framework (i.e., Megatron-LM), surpassing the speed of Nvidia Transformer
Engine by 37%. This largely reduces the training costs for large foundation
models. Furthermore, our FP8 mixed-precision training methodology is generic.
It can be seamlessly applied to other tasks such as LLM instruction tuning and
reinforcement learning with human feedback, offering savings in fine-tuning
expenses. Our FP8 low-precision training framework is open-sourced at

<p><b>Authors:</b>  <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Zhao_J/0/1/0/all/0/1">Jiachen Zhao</a></p>
<p>Recently, large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable progress in
natural language processing. The most representative ability of LLMs is
in-context learning (ICL), which enables LLMs to learn patterns from in-context
exemplars without training. The performance of ICL greatly depends on the
exemplars used. However, how to choose exemplars remains unclear due to the
lack of understanding of how in-context learning works. In this paper, we
present a novel perspective on ICL by conceptualizing it as contextual
retrieval from a model of associative memory. We establish a theoretical
framework of ICL based on Hopfield Networks. Based on our framework, we look
into how in-context exemplars influence the performance of ICL and propose more
efficient active exemplar selection. Our study sheds new light on the mechanism
of ICL by connecting it to memory retrieval, with potential implications for
advancing the understanding of LLMs.

<p>This review paper explores Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which
integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 to handle multimodal data
such as text and vision. MLLMs demonstrate capabilities like generating image
narratives and answering image-based questions, bridging the gap towards
real-world human-computer interactions and hinting at a potential pathway to
artificial general intelligence. However, MLLMs still face challenges in
processing the semantic gap in multimodality, which may lead to erroneous
generation, posing potential risks to society. Choosing the appropriate
modality alignment method is crucial, as improper methods might require more
parameters with limited performance improvement. This paper aims to explore
modality alignment methods for LLMs and their existing capabilities.
Implementing modality alignment allows LLMs to address environmental issues and
enhance accessibility. The study surveys existing modal alignment methods in
MLLMs into four groups: (1) Multimodal Converters that change data into
something LLMs can understand; (2) Multimodal Perceivers to improve how LLMs
perceive different types of data; (3) Tools Assistance for changing data into
one common format, usually text; and (4) Data-Driven methods that teach LLMs to
understand specific types of data in a dataset. This field is still in a phase
of exploration and experimentation, and we will organize and update various
existing research methods for multimodal information alignment.

<p>Objective: Most existing fine-tuned biomedical large language models (LLMs)
focus on enhancing performance in monolingual biomedical question answering and
conversation tasks. To investigate the effectiveness of the fine-tuned LLMs on
diverse biomedical NLP tasks in different languages, We present Taiyi, a
bilingual fine-tuned LLM for diverse biomedical tasks. Materials and Methods:
We first curated a comprehensive collection of 140 existing biomedical text
mining datasets (102 English and 38 Chinese datasets) across over 10 task
types. Subsequently, a two-stage strategy is proposed for supervised
fine-tuning to optimize the model performance across varied tasks. Results:
Experimental results on 13 test sets covering named entity recognition,
relation extraction, text classification, question answering tasks demonstrate
that Taiyi achieves superior performance compared to general LLMs. The case
study involving additional biomedical NLP tasks further shows Taiyi's
considerable potential for bilingual biomedical multi-tasking. Conclusion:
Leveraging rich high-quality biomedical corpora and developing effective
fine-tuning strategies can significantly improve the performance of LLMs within
the biomedical domain. Taiyi shows the bilingual multi-tasking capability
through supervised fine-tuning. However, those tasks such as information
extraction that are not generation tasks in nature remain challenging for
LLM-based generative approaches, and they still underperform the conventional
discriminative approaches of smaller language models.

<p>Foundation models, specifically Large Language Models (LLM's), have lately
gained wide-spread attention and adoption. Reinforcement Learning with Human
Feedback (RLHF) involves training a reward model to capture desired behaviors,
which is then used to align LLM's. These reward models are additionally used at
inference-time to estimate LLM responses' adherence to those desired behaviors.
However, there is little work measuring how robust these reward models are to
distribution shifts. In this work, we evaluate how reward model performance -
measured via accuracy and calibration (i.e. alignment between accuracy and
confidence) - is affected by distribution shift. We show novel calibration
patterns and accuracy drops due to OOD prompts and responses, and that the
reward model is more sensitive to shifts in responses than prompts.
Additionally, we adapt an OOD detection technique commonly used in
classification to the reward model setting to detect these distribution shifts
in prompts and responses.

<p>We introduce MMMU: a new benchmark designed to evaluate multimodal models on
massive multi-discipline tasks demanding college-level subject knowledge and
deliberate reasoning. MMMU includes 11.5K meticulously collected multimodal
questions from college exams, quizzes, and textbooks, covering six core
disciplines: Art &amp; Design, Business, Science, Health &amp; Medicine, Humanities &amp;
Social Science, and Tech &amp; Engineering. These questions span 30 subjects and
183 subfields, comprising 30 highly heterogeneous image types, such as charts,
diagrams, maps, tables, music sheets, and chemical structures. Unlike existing
benchmarks, MMMU focuses on advanced perception and reasoning with
domain-specific knowledge, challenging models to perform tasks akin to those
faced by experts. The evaluation of 14 open-source LMMs as well as the
proprietary GPT-4V(ision) and Gemini highlights the substantial challenges
posed by MMMU. Even the advanced GPT-4V and Gemini Ultra only achieve
accuracies of 56% and 59% respectively, indicating significant room for
improvement. We believe MMMU will stimulate the community to build
next-generation multimodal foundation models towards expert artificial general
intelligence.

<p>Data augmentation via back-translation is common when pretraining
Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) models, even though the generated
instructions are noisy. But: does that noise matter? We find that nonsensical
or irrelevant language instructions during pretraining can have little effect
on downstream performance for both HAMT and VLN-BERT on R2R, and is still
better than only using clean, human data. To underscore these results, we
concoct an efficient augmentation method, Unigram + Object, which generates
nonsensical instructions that nonetheless improve downstream performance. Our
findings suggest that what matters for VLN R2R pretraining is the quantity of
visual trajectories, not the quality of instructions.

<p>Entity alignment (EA) seeks identical entities in different knowledge graphs,
which is a long-standing task in the database research. Recent work leverages
deep learning to embed entities in vector space and align them via nearest
neighbor search. Although embedding-based EA has gained marked success in
recent years, it lacks explanations for alignment decisions. In this paper, we
present the first framework that can generate explanations for understanding
and repairing embedding-based EA results. Given an EA pair produced by an
embedding model, we first compare its neighbor entities and relations to build
a matching subgraph as a local explanation. We then construct an alignment
dependency graph to understand the pair from an abstract perspective. Finally,
we repair the pair by resolving three types of alignment conflicts based on
dependency graphs. Experiments on a variety of EA datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness, generalization, and robustness of our framework in explaining
and repairing embedding-based EA results.

<p>Aligning large language models(LLMs) with human is a critical step in
effectively utilizing their pre-trained capabilities across a wide array of
language tasks. Current instruction tuning practices often rely on expanding
dataset size without a clear strategy for ensuring data quality, which can
inadvertently introduce noise and degrade model performance. To address this
challenge, we introduce Nuggets, a novel and efficient methodology that employs
one shot learning to select high-quality instruction data from expansive
datasets. Nuggets assesses the potential of individual instruction examples to
act as effective one shot examples, thereby identifying those that can
significantly enhance diverse task performance. Nuggets utilizes a scoring
system based on the impact of candidate examples on the perplexity of a diverse
anchor set, facilitating the selection of the most beneficial data for
instruction tuning. Through rigorous testing on two benchmarks, including
MT-Bench and Alpaca-Eval, we demonstrate that instruction tuning with the top
1% of Nuggets-curated examples substantially outperforms conventional methods
that use the full dataset. These findings advocate for a data selection
paradigm that prioritizes quality, offering a more efficient pathway to align
LLMs with humans.

<p>Despite commendable achievements made by existing work, prevailing multimodal
sarcasm detection studies rely more on textual content over visual information.
It unavoidably induces spurious correlations between textual words and labels,
thereby significantly hindering the models' generalization capability. To
address this problem, we define the task of out-of-distribution (OOD)
multimodal sarcasm detection, which aims to evaluate models' generalizability
when the word distribution is different in training and testing settings.
Moreover, we propose a novel debiasing multimodal sarcasm detection framework
with contrastive learning, which aims to mitigate the harmful effect of biased
textual factors for robust OOD generalization. In particular, we first design
counterfactual data augmentation to construct the positive samples with
dissimilar word biases and negative samples with similar word biases.
Subsequently, we devise an adapted debiasing contrastive learning mechanism to
empower the model to learn robust task-relevant features and alleviate the
adverse effect of biased words. Extensive experiments show the superiority of
the proposed framework.

<p>The Split and Rephrase task, which consists in splitting complex sentences
into a sequence of shorter grammatical sentences, while preserving the original
meaning, can facilitate the processing of complex texts for humans and machines
alike. In this work, we describe an approach based on large language models,
which improves over the state of the art by large margins on all the major
metrics for the task, on publicly available datasets. We also describe results
from two human evaluations that further establish the significant improvements
obtained with large language models and the viability of the approach. We
evaluate different strategies, including fine-tuning pretrained language models
of varying parameter size, and applying both zero-shot and few-shot in-context
learning on instruction-tuned language models. Although the latter were
markedly outperformed by fine-tuned models, they still achieved promising
results overall. Our results thus demonstrate the strong potential of different

<p>Emotion significantly impacts our daily behaviors and interactions. While
recent generative AI models, such as large language models, have shown
impressive performance in various tasks, it remains unclear whether they truly
comprehend emotions. This paper aims to address this gap by incorporating
psychological theories to gain a holistic understanding of emotions in
generative AI models. Specifically, we propose three approaches: 1)
EmotionPrompt to enhance AI model performance, 2) EmotionAttack to impair AI
model performance, and 3) EmotionDecode to explain the effects of emotional
stimuli, both benign and malignant. Through extensive experiments involving
language and multi-modal models on semantic understanding, logical reasoning,
and generation tasks, we demonstrate that both textual and visual EmotionPrompt
can boost the performance of AI models while EmotionAttack can hinder it.
Additionally, EmotionDecode reveals that AI models can comprehend emotional
stimuli akin to the mechanism of dopamine in the human brain. Our work heralds
a novel avenue for exploring psychology to enhance our understanding of

<p>Although LLMs continue to iterate and improve, most open-source models still
have a context window of no more than 4k, limiting their ability to handle
long-context problems. Most existing open-source models for long-context chat
still lack satisfactory accuracy. To address this issue, I approach it from the
perspective of training data and theoretically prove that training the
capability to handle long contexts requires "effective" rather than "long"
data. Based on this, I propose using the "original text paraphrase" task, and
successfully extend the context window of the existing model to 32k by a
low-cost and effective method, achieving extremely high accuracy in
multi-document-QA and surpassing all existing open-source models of the same
scale. The model and training data have been open-sourced on
HuggingFace(https://huggingface.co/yuyijiong/Qwen-14b-chat-yarn-32k) and
WiseModel(https://wisemodel.cn/models/yuyijiong/Qwen-14b-chat-yarn-32k).

<p>Despite significant advancements in multi-label text classification, the
ability of existing models to generalize to novel and seldom-encountered
complex concepts, which are compositions of elementary ones, remains
underexplored. This research addresses this gap. By creating unique data splits
across three benchmarks, we assess the compositional generalization ability of
existing multi-label text classification models. Our results show that these
models often fail to generalize to compositional concepts encountered
infrequently during training, leading to inferior performance on tests with
these new combinations. To address this, we introduce a data augmentation
method that leverages two innovative text generation models designed to enhance
the classification models' capacity for compositional generalization. Our
experiments show that this data augmentation approach significantly improves
the compositional generalization capabilities of classification models on our
benchmarks, with both generation models surpassing other text generation
baselines.
