<p><b>Authors:</b> Alberto S\'anchez P\'erez, Alaa Boukhary, Paolo Papotti, Luis Castej\'on Lozano, Adam Elwood</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating insightful and actionable information from databases is critical in data analysis. This paper introduces a novel approach using Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically generate textual insights. Given a multi-table database as input, our method leverages LLMs to produce concise, text-based insights that reflect interesting patterns in the tables. Our framework includes a Hypothesis Generator to formulate domain-relevant questions, a Query Agent to answer such questions by generating SQL queries against a database, and a Summarization module to verbalize the insights. The insights are evaluated for both correctness and subjective insightfulness using a hybrid model of human judgment and automated metrics. Experimental results on public and enterprise databases demonstrate that our approach generates more insightful insights than other approaches while maintaining correctness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Micol Spitale, Srikar Babu, Serhan Cakmak, Jiaee Cheong, Hatice Gunes</p>
<p>Abstract: One of the primary goals of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) research is to develop robots that can interpret human behavior and adapt their responses accordingly. Adaptive learning models, such as continual and reinforcement learning, play a crucial role in improving robots' ability to interact effectively in real-world settings. However, these models face significant challenges due to the limited availability of real-world data, particularly in sensitive domains like healthcare and well-being. This data scarcity can hinder a robot's ability to adapt to new situations. To address these challenges, causality provides a structured framework for understanding and modeling the underlying relationships between actions, events, and outcomes. By moving beyond mere pattern recognition, causality enables robots to make more explainable and generalizable decisions. This paper presents an exploratory causality-based analysis through a case study of an adaptive robotic coach delivering positive psychology exercises over four weeks in a workplace setting. The robotic coach autonomously adapts to multimodal human behaviors, such as facial valence and speech duration. By conducting both macro- and micro-level causal analyses, this study aims to gain deeper insights into how adaptability can enhance well-being during interactions. Ultimately, this research seeks to advance our understanding of how causality can help overcome challenges in HRI, particularly in real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alberto Coffrini, Mohammad Amin Zadenoori, Paolo Barsocchi, Francesco Furfari, Antonino Crivello, Alessio Ferrari</p>
<p>Abstract: Indoor navigation presents unique challenges due to complex layouts, lack of GPS signals, and accessibility concerns. Existing solutions often struggle with real-time adaptability and user-specific needs. In this work, we explore the potential of a Large Language Model (LLM), i.e., ChatGPT, to generate natural, context-aware navigation instructions from indoor map images. We design and evaluate test cases across different real-world environments, analyzing the effectiveness of LLMs in interpreting spatial layouts, handling user constraints, and planning efficient routes. Our findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs for supporting personalized indoor navigation, with an average of 52% correct indications and a maximum of 62%. The results do not appear to depend on the complexity of the layout or the complexity of the expected path, but rather on the number of points of interest and the abundance of visual information, which negatively affect the performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gabriele D'Acunto, Claudio Battiloro</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in artificial intelligence reveal the limits of purely predictive systems and call for a shift toward causal and collaborative reasoning. Drawing inspiration from the revolution of Grothendieck in mathematics, we introduce the relativity of causal knowledge, which posits structural causal models (SCMs) are inherently imperfect, subjective representations embedded within networks of relationships. By leveraging category theory, we arrange SCMs into a functor category and show that their observational and interventional probability measures naturally form convex structures. This result allows us to encode non-intervened SCMs with convex spaces of probability measures. Next, using sheaf theory, we construct the network sheaf and cosheaf of causal knowledge. These structures enable the transfer of causal knowledge across the network while incorporating interventional consistency and the perspective of the subjects, ultimately leading to the formal, mathematical definition of relative causal knowledge.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyunmin Cheong, Adrian Butscher</p>
<p>Abstract: The current work presents an ontology developed for physics-based simulation in engineering design, called Physics-based Simulation Ontology (PSO). The purpose of the ontology is to assist in modelling the physical phenomenon of interest in a veridical manner, while capturing the necessary and reusable information for physics-based simulation solvers. The development involved extending an existing upper ontology, Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), to define lower-level terms of PSO. PSO has two parts: PSO-Physics, which consists of terms and relations used to model physical phenomena based on the perspective of classical mechanics involving partial differential equations, and PSO-Sim, which consists of terms used to represent the information artefacts that are about the physical phenomena modelled with PSO-Physics. The former terms are used to model the physical phenomenon of interest independent of solver-specific interpretations, which can be reused across different solvers, while the latter terms are used to instantiate solver-specific input data. A case study involving two simulation solvers was conducted to demonstrate this capability of PSO. Discussion around the benefits and limitations of using BFO for the current work is also provided, which should be valuable for any future work that extends an existing upper ontology to develop ontologies for engineering applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianliang Xu, Eva Maxfield Brown, Dustin Dwyer, Sabina Tomkins</p>
<p>Abstract: Local governments around the world are making consequential decisions on behalf of their constituents, and these constituents are responding with requests, advice, and assessments of their officials at public meetings. So many small meetings cannot be covered by traditional newsrooms at scale. We propose PUBLICSPEAK, a probabilistic framework which can utilize meeting structure, domain knowledge, and linguistic information to discover public remarks in local government meetings. We then use our approach to inspect the issues raised by constituents in 7 cities across the United States. We evaluate our approach on a novel dataset of local government meetings and find that PUBLICSPEAK improves over state-of-the-art by 10% on average, and by up to 40%.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11790">Visualizing Thought: Conceptual Diagrams Enable Robust Planning in LMMs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Nasim Borazjanizadeh, Roei Herzig, Eduard Oks, Trevor Darrell, Rogerio Feris, Leonid Karlinsky</p>
<p>Abstract: Human reasoning relies on constructing and manipulating mental models-simplified internal representations of situations that we use to understand and solve problems. Conceptual diagrams (for example, sketches drawn by humans to aid reasoning) externalize these mental models, abstracting irrelevant details to efficiently capture relational and spatial information. In contrast, Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) predominantly reason through textual representations, limiting their effectiveness in complex multi-step combinatorial and planning tasks. In this paper, we propose a zero-shot fully automatic framework that enables LMMs to reason through multiple chains of self-generated intermediate conceptual diagrams, significantly enhancing their combinatorial planning capabilities. Our approach does not require any human initialization beyond a natural language description of the task. It integrates both textual and diagrammatic reasoning within an optimized graph-of-thought inference framework, enhanced by beam search and depth-wise backtracking. Evaluated on multiple challenging PDDL planning domains, our method substantially improves GPT-4o's performance (for example, from 35.5% to 90.2% in Blocksworld). On more difficult planning domains with solution depths up to 40, our approach outperforms even the o1-preview reasoning model (for example, over 13% improvement in Parking). These results highlight the value of conceptual diagrams as a complementary reasoning medium in LMMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Antonio Lorenzin, Fabio Zanasi</p>
<p>Abstract: Moralisation and Triangulation are transformations allowing to switch between different ways of factoring a probability distribution into a graphical model. Moralisation allows to view a Bayesian network (a directed model) as a Markov network (an undirected model), whereas triangulation works in the opposite direction. We present a categorical framework where these transformations are modelled as functors between a category of Bayesian networks and one of Markov networks. The two kinds of network (the objects of these categories) are themselves represented as functors, from a `syntax' domain to a `semantics' codomain. Notably, moralisation and triangulation are definable inductively on such syntax, and operate as a form of functor pre-composition. This approach introduces a modular, algebraic perspective in the theory of probabilistic graphical models.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11832">Safety Mirage: How Spurious Correlations Undermine VLM Safety Fine-tuning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiwei Chen, Yuguang Yao, Yihua Zhang, Bingquan Shen, Gaowen Liu, Sijia Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent vision-language models (VLMs) have made remarkable strides in generative modeling with multimodal inputs, particularly text and images. However, their susceptibility to generating harmful content when exposed to unsafe queries raises critical safety concerns. While current alignment strategies primarily rely on supervised safety fine-tuning with curated datasets, we identify a fundamental limitation we call the "safety mirage" where supervised fine-tuning inadvertently reinforces spurious correlations between superficial textual patterns and safety responses, rather than fostering deep, intrinsic mitigation of harm. We show that these spurious correlations leave fine-tuned VLMs vulnerable even to a simple one-word modification-based attack, where substituting a single word in text queries with a spurious correlation-inducing alternative can effectively bypass safeguards. Additionally, these correlations contribute to the over prudence, causing fine-tuned VLMs to refuse benign queries unnecessarily. To address this issue, we show machine unlearning (MU) as a powerful alternative to supervised safety fine-tuning as it avoids biased feature-label mappings and directly removes harmful knowledge from VLMs while preserving their general capabilities. Extensive evaluations across safety benchmarks show that under one-word attacks, MU-based alignment reduces the attack success rate by up to 60.17% and cuts unnecessary rejections by over 84.20%.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11870">Counterfactual Realizability</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Arvind Raghavan, Elias Bareinboim</p>
<p>Abstract: It is commonly believed that, in a real-world environment, samples can only be drawn from observational and interventional distributions, corresponding to Layers 1 and 2 of the Pearl Causal Hierarchy. Layer 3, representing counterfactual distributions, is believed to be inaccessible by definition. However, Bareinboim, Forney, and Pearl (2015) introduced a procedure that allows an agent to sample directly from a counterfactual distribution, leaving open the question of what other counterfactual quantities can be estimated directly via physical experimentation. We resolve this by introducing a formal definition of realizability, the ability to draw samples from a distribution, and then developing a complete algorithm to determine whether an arbitrary counterfactual distribution is realizable given fundamental physical constraints, such as the inability to go back in time and subject the same unit to a different experimental condition. We illustrate the implications of this new framework for counterfactual data collection using motivating examples from causal fairness and causal reinforcement learning. While the baseline approach in these motivating settings typically follows an interventional or observational strategy, we show that a counterfactual strategy provably dominates both.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bowen Baker, Joost Huizinga, Leo Gao, Zehao Dou, Melody Y. Guan, Aleksander Madry, Wojciech Zaremba, Jakub Pachocki, David Farhi</p>
<p>Abstract: Mitigating reward hacking--where AI systems misbehave due to flaws or misspecifications in their learning objectives--remains a key challenge in constructing capable and aligned models. We show that we can monitor a frontier reasoning model, such as OpenAI o3-mini, for reward hacking in agentic coding environments by using another LLM that observes the model's chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. CoT monitoring can be far more effective than monitoring agent actions and outputs alone, and we further found that a LLM weaker than o3-mini, namely GPT-4o, can effectively monitor a stronger model. Because CoT monitors can be effective at detecting exploits, it is natural to ask whether those exploits can be suppressed by incorporating a CoT monitor directly into the agent's training objective. While we show that integrating CoT monitors into the reinforcement learning reward can indeed produce more capable and more aligned agents in the low optimization regime, we find that with too much optimization, agents learn obfuscated reward hacking, hiding their intent within the CoT while still exhibiting a significant rate of reward hacking. Because it is difficult to tell when CoTs have become obfuscated, it may be necessary to pay a monitorability tax by not applying strong optimization pressures directly to the chain-of-thought, ensuring that CoTs remain monitorable and useful for detecting misaligned behavior.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Edward Y. Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent LLM-based agent frameworks have demonstrated impressive capabilities in task delegation and workflow orchestration, but face significant challenges in maintaining context awareness and ensuring planning consistency. This paper presents SagaLLM, a structured multi-agent framework that addresses four fundamental limitations in current LLM approaches: inadequate self-validation, context narrowing, lacking transaction properties, and insufficient inter-agent coordination. By implementing specialized context management agents and validation protocols, SagaLLM preserves critical constraints and state information throughout complex planning processes, enabling robust and consistent decision-making even during disruptions. We evaluate our approach using selected problems from the REALM benchmark, focusing on sequential and reactive planning scenarios that challenge both context retention and adaptive reasoning. Our experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs, Claude 3.7, DeepSeek R1, GPT-4o, and GPT-o1, demonstrate that while these models exhibit impressive reasoning capabilities, they struggle with maintaining global constraint awareness during complex planning tasks, particularly when adapting to unexpected changes. In contrast, the distributed cognitive architecture of SagaLLM shows significant improvements in planning consistency, constraint enforcement, and adaptation to disruptions in various scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matteo Cercola, Nicola Gatti, Pedro Huertas Leyva, Benedetto Carambia, Simone Formentin</p>
<p>Abstract: Effective traffic incident management is essential for ensuring safety, minimizing congestion, and reducing response times in emergency situations. Traditional highway incident management relies heavily on radio room operators, who must make rapid, informed decisions in high-stakes environments. This paper proposes an innovative solution to support and enhance these decisions by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into a decision-support system for traffic incident management. We introduce two approaches: (1) an LLM + Optimization hybrid that leverages both the flexibility of natural language interaction and the robustness of optimization techniques, and (2) a Full LLM approach that autonomously generates decisions using only LLM capabilities. We tested our solutions using historical event data from Autostrade per l'Italia. Experimental results indicate that while both approaches show promise, the LLM + Optimization solution demonstrates superior reliability, making it particularly suited to critical applications where consistency and accuracy are paramount. This research highlights the potential for LLMs to transform highway incident management by enabling accessible, data-driven decision-making support.</p>

Today, in the era of AI, this title of the fatherhood of logic has a renewed significance. Behind it lies his original idea that human reasoning could be studied as a process and that perhaps there exist universal systems of reasoning that underly all human reasoning irrespective of the content of what we are reasoning about. In this article, we look into Aristotle's work on human thought, his work on reasoning itself but also on how it relates to science and human endeavor more generally, from a modern perspective of Artificial Intelligence and ask if this can help enlighten our understanding of AI and Science more generally.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Idan Lev-Yehudi, Michael Novitsky, Moran Barenboim, Ron Benchetrit, Vadim Indelman</p>
<p>Abstract: Solving Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) in continuous state, action and observation spaces is key for autonomous planning in many real-world mobility and robotics applications. Current approaches are mostly sample based, and cannot hope to reach near-optimal solutions in reasonable time. We propose two complementary theoretical contributions. First, we formulate a novel Multiple Importance Sampling (MIS) tree for value estimation, that allows to share value information between sibling action branches. The novel MIS tree supports action updates during search time, such as gradient-based updates. Second, we propose a novel methodology to compute value gradients with online sampling based on transition likelihoods. It is applicable to MDPs, and we extend it to POMDPs via particle beliefs with the application of the propagated belief trick. The gradient estimator is computed in practice using the MIS tree with efficient Monte Carlo sampling. These two parts are combined into a new planning algorithm Action Gradient Monte Carlo Tree Search (AGMCTS). We demonstrate in a simulated environment its applicability, advantages over continuous online POMDP solvers that rely solely on sampling, and we discuss further implications.</p>

<p>Abstract: We developed and validated TRisk, a Transformer-based AI model predicting 36-month mortality in heart failure patients by analysing temporal patient journeys from UK electronic health records (EHR). Our study included 403,534 heart failure patients (ages 40-90) from 1,418 English general practices, with 1,063 practices for model derivation and 355 for external validation. TRisk was compared against the MAGGIC-EHR model across various patient subgroups. With median follow-up of 9 months, TRisk achieved a concordance index of 0.845 (95% confidence interval: [0.841, 0.849]), significantly outperforming MAGGIC-EHR's 0.728 (0.723, 0.733) for predicting 36-month all-cause mortality. TRisk showed more consistent performance across sex, age, and baseline characteristics, suggesting less bias. We successfully adapted TRisk to US hospital data through transfer learning, achieving a C-index of 0.802 (0.789, 0.816) with 21,767 patients. Explainability analyses revealed TRisk captured established risk factors while identifying underappreciated predictors like cancers and hepatic failure that were important across both cohorts. Notably, cancers maintained strong prognostic value even a decade after diagnosis. TRisk demonstrated well-calibrated mortality prediction across both healthcare systems. Our findings highlight the value of tracking longitudinal health profiles and revealed risk factors not included in previous expert-driven models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianzhu Yao, Kevin Wang, Ryan Hsieh, Haisu Zhou, Tianqing Zou, Zerui Cheng, Zhangyang Wang, Pramod Viswanath</p>
<p>Abstract: Reasoning and strategic behavior in \emph{social interactions} is a hallmark of intelligence. This form of reasoning is significantly more sophisticated than isolated planning or reasoning tasks in static settings (e.g., math problem solving). In this paper, we present \textit{Strategic Planning, Interaction, and Negotiation} (\textbf{SPIN-Bench}), a new multi-domain evaluation designed to measure the intelligence of \emph{strategic planning} and \emph{social reasoning}. While many existing benchmarks focus on narrow planning or single-agent reasoning, SPIN-Bench combines classical PDDL tasks, competitive board games, cooperative card games, and multi-agent negotiation scenarios in one unified framework. The framework includes both a benchmark as well as an arena to simulate and evaluate the variety of social settings to test reasoning and strategic behavior of AI agents. We formulate the benchmark SPIN-Bench by systematically varying action spaces, state complexity, and the number of interacting agents to simulate a variety of social settings where success depends on not only methodical and step-wise decision making, but also \emph{conceptual inference} of other (adversarial or cooperative) participants. Our experiments reveal that while contemporary LLMs handle \emph{basic fact retrieval} and \emph{short-range planning} reasonably well, they encounter significant performance bottlenecks in tasks requiring \emph{deep multi-hop reasoning} over large state spaces and \emph{socially adept} coordination under uncertainty. We envision SPIN-Bench as a catalyst for future research on robust multi-agent planning, social reasoning, and human--AI teaming.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> In-Chang Baek, Sung-Hyun Kim, Seo-yung Lee, Dong-Hyun Lee, Kyung-Joong Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent research has highlighted the significance of natural language in enhancing the controllability of generative models. While various efforts have been made to leverage natural language for content generation, research on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents utilizing text-based instructions for procedural content generation remains limited. In this paper, we propose IPCGRL, an instruction-based procedural content generation method via reinforcement learning, which incorporates a sentence embedding model. IPCGRL fine-tunes task-specific embedding representations to effectively compress game-level conditions. We evaluate IPCGRL in a two-dimensional level generation task and compare its performance with a general-purpose embedding method. The results indicate that IPCGRL achieves up to a 21.4% improvement in controllability and a 17.2% improvement in generalizability for unseen instructions. Furthermore, the proposed method extends the modality of conditional input, enabling a more flexible and expressive interaction framework for procedural content generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingzhu Wu, Jianan Jiang, Xinglin Li, Hanhui Deng, Di Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Collaboration can amalgamate diverse ideas, styles, and visual elements, fostering creativity and innovation among different designers. In collaborative design, sketches play a pivotal role as a means of expressing design creativity. However, designers often tend to not openly share these meticulously crafted sketches. This phenomenon of data island in the design area hinders its digital transformation under the third wave of AI. In this paper, we introduce a Federated Generative Artificial Intelligence Clothing system, namely FedGAI, employing federated learning to aid in sketch design. FedGAI is committed to establishing an ecosystem wherein designers can exchange sketch styles among themselves. Through FedGAI, designers can generate sketches that incorporate various designers' styles from their peers, drawing inspiration from collaboration without the need for data disclosure or upload. Extensive performance evaluations indicate that our FedGAI system can produce multi-styled sketches of comparable quality to human-designed ones while significantly enhancing efficiency compared to hand-drawn sketches.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12434">A Survey on the Optimization of Large Language Model-based Agents</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shangheng Du, Jiabao Zhao, Jinxin Shi, Zhentao Xie, Xin Jiang, Yanhong Bai, Liang He</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-based agents have been widely adopted in various fields, becoming essential for autonomous decision-making and interactive tasks. However, current work typically relies on prompt design or fine-tuning strategies applied to vanilla LLMs, which often leads to limited effectiveness or suboptimal performance in complex agent-related environments. Although LLM optimization techniques can improve model performance across many general tasks, they lack specialized optimization towards critical agent functionalities such as long-term planning, dynamic environmental interaction, and complex decision-making. Although numerous recent studies have explored various strategies to optimize LLM-based agents for complex agent tasks, a systematic review summarizing and comparing these methods from a holistic perspective is still lacking. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of LLM-based agent optimization approaches, categorizing them into parameter-driven and parameter-free methods. We first focus on parameter-driven optimization, covering fine-tuning-based optimization, reinforcement learning-based optimization, and hybrid strategies, analyzing key aspects such as trajectory data construction, fine-tuning techniques, reward function design, and optimization algorithms. Additionally, we briefly discuss parameter-free strategies that optimize agent behavior through prompt engineering and external knowledge retrieval. Finally, we summarize the datasets and benchmarks used for evaluation and tuning, review key applications of LLM-based agents, and discuss major challenges and promising future directions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaopan Xu, Pengfei Zhou, Jiaxin Ai, Wangbo Zhao, Kai Wang, Xiaojiang Peng, Wenqi Shao, Hongxun Yao, Kaipeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Reasoning is an essential capacity for large language models (LLMs) to address complex tasks, where the identification of process errors is vital for improving this ability. Recently, process-level reward models (PRMs) were proposed to provide step-wise rewards that facilitate reinforcement learning and data production during training and guide LLMs toward correct steps during inference, thereby improving reasoning accuracy. However, existing benchmarks of PRMs are text-based and focus on error detection, neglecting other scenarios like reasoning search. To address this gap, we introduce MPBench, a comprehensive, multi-task, multimodal benchmark designed to systematically assess the effectiveness of PRMs in diverse scenarios. MPBench employs three evaluation paradigms, each targeting a specific role of PRMs in the reasoning process: (1) Step Correctness, which assesses the correctness of each intermediate reasoning step; (2) Answer Aggregation, which aggregates multiple solutions and selects the best one; and (3) Reasoning Process Search, which guides the search for optimal reasoning steps during inference. Through these paradigms, MPBench makes comprehensive evaluations and provides insights into the development of multimodal PRMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leonardo Rosa Amado, Adriano Vogel, Dalvan Griebler, Gabriel Paludo Licks, Eric Simon, Felipe Meneguzzi</p>
<p>Abstract: Data pipeline frameworks provide abstractions for implementing sequences of data-intensive transformation operators, automating the deployment and execution of such transformations in a cluster. Deploying a data pipeline, however, requires computing resources to be allocated in a data center, ideally minimizing the overhead for communicating data and executing operators in the pipeline while considering each operator's execution requirements. In this paper, we model the problem of optimal data pipeline deployment as planning with action costs, where we propose heuristics aiming to minimize total execution time. Experimental results indicate that the heuristics can outperform the baseline deployment and that a heuristic based on connections outperforms other strategies.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12637">Understanding Driver Cognition and Decision-Making Behaviors in High-Risk Scenarios: A Drift Diffusion Perspective</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Heye Huang, Zheng Li, Hao Cheng, Haoran Wang, Junkai Jiang, Xiaopeng Li, Arkady Zgonnikov</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring safe interactions between autonomous vehicles (AVs) and human drivers in mixed traffic systems remains a major challenge, particularly in complex, high-risk scenarios. This paper presents a cognition-decision framework that integrates individual variability and commonalities in driver behavior to quantify risk cognition and model dynamic decision-making. First, a risk sensitivity model based on a multivariate Gaussian distribution is developed to characterize individual differences in risk cognition. Then, a cognitive decision-making model based on the drift diffusion model (DDM) is introduced to capture common decision-making mechanisms in high-risk environments. The DDM dynamically adjusts decision thresholds by integrating initial bias, drift rate, and boundary parameters, adapting to variations in speed, relative distance, and risk sensitivity to reflect diverse driving styles and risk preferences. By simulating high-risk scenarios with lateral, longitudinal, and multidimensional risk sources in a driving simulator, the proposed model accurately predicts cognitive responses and decision behaviors during emergency maneuvers. Specifically, by incorporating driver-specific risk sensitivity, the model enables dynamic adjustments of key DDM parameters, allowing for personalized decision-making representations in diverse scenarios. Comparative analysis with IDM, Gipps, and MOBIL demonstrates that DDM more precisely captures human cognitive processes and adaptive decision-making in high-risk scenarios. These findings provide a theoretical basis for modeling human driving behavior and offer critical insights for enhancing AV-human interaction in real-world traffic environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yoo Yeon Sung, Hannah Kim, Dan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: AI practitioners increasingly use large language model (LLM) agents in compound AI systems to solve complex reasoning tasks, these agent executions often fail to meet human standards, leading to errors that compromise the system's overall performance. Addressing these failures through human intervention is challenging due to the agents' opaque reasoning processes, misalignment with human expectations, the complexity of agent dependencies, and the high cost of manual inspection. This paper thus introduces a human-centered evaluation framework for Verifying LLM Agent failures (VeriLA), which systematically assesses agent failures to reduce human effort and make these agent failures interpretable to humans. The framework first defines clear expectations of each agent by curating human-designed agent criteria. Then, it develops a human-aligned agent verifier module, trained with human gold standards, to assess each agent's execution output. This approach enables granular evaluation of each agent's performance by revealing failures from a human standard, offering clear guidelines for revision, and reducing human cognitive load. Our case study results show that VeriLA is both interpretable and efficient in helping practitioners interact more effectively with the system. By upholding accountability in human-agent collaboration, VeriLA paves the way for more trustworthy and human-aligned compound AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luca Collini, Andrew Hennessee, Ramesh Karri, Siddharth Garg</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI o3-mini and DeepSeek-R1 use enhanced reasoning through Chain-of-Thought (CoT). Their potential in hardware design, which relies on expert-driven iterative optimization, remains unexplored. This paper investigates whether reasoning LLMs can address challenges in High-Level Synthesis (HLS) design space exploration and optimization. During HLS, engineers manually define pragmas/directives to balance performance and resource constraints. We propose an LLM-based optimization agentic framework that automatically restructures code, inserts pragmas, and identifies optimal design points via feedback from HLs tools and access to integer-linear programming (ILP) solvers. Experiments compare reasoning models against conventional LLMs on benchmarks using success rate, efficiency, and design quality (area/latency) metrics, and provide the first-ever glimpse into the CoTs produced by a powerful open-source reasoning model like DeepSeek-R1.</p>

<p>Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) gain autonomous capabilities, their coordination in multi-agent settings becomes increasingly important. However, they often struggle with cooperation, leading to suboptimal outcomes. Inspired by Axelrod's Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) tournaments, we explore how personality traits influence LLM cooperation. Using representation engineering, we steer Big Five traits (e.g., Agreeableness, Conscientiousness) in LLMs and analyze their impact on IPD decision-making. Our results show that higher Agreeableness and Conscientiousness improve cooperation but increase susceptibility to exploitation, highlighting both the potential and limitations of personality-based steering for aligning AI agents.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12761">Analyzing sequential activity and travel decisions with interpretable deep inverse reinforcement learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuebing Liang, Shenhao Wang, Jiangbo Yu, Zhan Zhao, Jinhua Zhao, Sandy Pentland</p>
<p>Abstract: Travel demand modeling has shifted from aggregated trip-based models to behavior-oriented activity-based models because daily trips are essentially driven by human activities. To analyze the sequential activity-travel decisions, deep inverse reinforcement learning (DIRL) has proven effective in learning the decision mechanisms by approximating a reward function to represent preferences and a policy function to replicate observed behavior using deep neural networks (DNNs). However, most existing research has focused on using DIRL to enhance only prediction accuracy, with limited exploration into interpreting the underlying decision mechanisms guiding sequential decision-making. To address this gap, we introduce an interpretable DIRL framework for analyzing activity-travel decision processes, bridging the gap between data-driven machine learning and theory-driven behavioral models. Our proposed framework adapts an adversarial IRL approach to infer the reward and policy functions of activity-travel behavior. The policy function is interpreted through a surrogate interpretable model based on choice probabilities from the policy function, while the reward function is interpreted by deriving both short-term rewards and long-term returns for various activity-travel patterns. Our analysis of real-world travel survey data reveals promising results in two key areas: (i) behavioral pattern insights from the policy function, highlighting critical factors in decision-making and variations among socio-demographic groups, and (ii) behavioral preference insights from the reward function, indicating the utility individuals gain from specific activity sequences.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lin-Han Jia, Wen-Chao Hu, Jie-Jing Shao, Lan-Zhe Guo, Yu-Feng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The current Neuro-Symbolic (NeSy) Learning paradigm suffers from an over-reliance on labeled data. If we completely disregard labels, it leads to less symbol information, a larger solution space, and more shortcuts-issues that current Nesy systems cannot resolve. This paper introduces a novel learning paradigm, Verification Learning (VL), which addresses this challenge by transforming the label-based reasoning process in Nesy into a label-free verification process. VL achieves excellent learning results solely by relying on unlabeled data and a function that verifies whether the current predictions conform to the rules. We formalize this problem as a Constraint Optimization Problem (COP) and propose a Dynamic combinatorial Sorting (DCS) algorithm that accelerates the solution by reducing verification attempts, effectively lowering computational costs to the level of a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP). To further enhance performance, we introduce a prior alignment method to address potential shortcuts. Our theoretical analysis points out which tasks in Nesy systems can be completed without labels and explains why rules can replace infinite labels, such as in addition, for some tasks, while for others, like Sudoku, the rules have no effect. We validate the proposed framework through several fully unsupervised tasks including addition, sort, match, and chess, each showing significant performance and efficiency improvements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingyi Zhang, Jiaxing Huang, Huanjin Yao, Shunyu Liu, Xikun Zhang, Shijian Lu, Dacheng Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies generally enhance MLLMs' reasoning capabilities via supervised fine-tuning on high-quality chain-of-thought reasoning data, which often leads models to merely imitate successful reasoning paths without understanding what the wrong reasoning paths are. In this work, we aim to enhance the MLLMs' reasoning ability beyond passively imitating positive reasoning paths. To this end, we design Step-wise Group Relative Policy Optimization (StepGRPO), a new online reinforcement learning framework that enables MLLMs to self-improve reasoning ability via simple, effective and dense step-wise rewarding. Specifically, StepGRPO introduces two novel rule-based reasoning rewards: Step-wise Reasoning Accuracy Reward (StepRAR) and Step-wise Reasoning Validity Reward (StepRVR). StepRAR rewards the reasoning paths that contain necessary intermediate reasoning steps via a soft key-step matching technique, while StepRAR rewards reasoning paths that follow a well-structured and logically consistent reasoning process through a reasoning completeness and logic evaluation strategy. With the proposed StepGRPO, we introduce R1-VL, a series of MLLMs with outstanding capabilities in step-by-step reasoning. Extensive experiments over 8 benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study investigates the ability of perceptron-type neurons in language models to perform intra-neuronal attention; that is, to identify different homogeneous categorical segments within the synthetic thought category they encode, based on a segmentation of specific activation zones for the tokens to which they are particularly responsive. The objective of this work is therefore to determine to what extent formal neurons can establish a homomorphic relationship between activation-based and categorical segmentations. The results suggest the existence of such a relationship, albeit tenuous, only at the level of tokens with very high activation levels. This intra-neuronal attention subsequently enables categorical restructuring processes at the level of neurons in the following layer, thereby contributing to the progressive formation of high-level categorical abstractions.</p>

Unlike traditional methods, IRT accounts for item difficulty, improving ideological bias estimation. We fine-tune two LLM families (Meta-LLaMa 3.2-1B-Instruct and Chat- GPT 3.5) to represent distinct ideological positions and introduce a two-stage approach: (1) modeling response avoidance and (2) estimating perceived bias in answered responses. Our results show that off-the-shelf LLMs often avoid ideological engagement rather than exhibit bias, challenging prior claims of partisanship. This empirically validated framework enhances AI alignment research and promotes fairer AI governance.</p>

Here, the collaboration between the AI models also led to improved results, demonstrating the versatility and robustness of this method. By harnessing this dual-AI framework, this approach stands as a pioneering method for enhancing experimental accuracy and efficiency in materials research, with applications extending beyond CRESt to broader scientific experimentation and analysis.</p>

<p>Abstract: Games have played a pivotal role in advancing artificial intelligence, with AI agents using sophisticated techniques to compete. Despite the success of neural network based game AIs, their performance often requires significant computational resources. In this paper, we present Rapfi, an efficient Gomoku agent that outperforms CNN-based agents in limited computation environments. Rapfi leverages a compact neural network with a pattern-based codebook distilled from CNNs, and an incremental update scheme that minimizes computation when input changes are minor. This new network uses computation that is orders of magnitude less to reach a similar accuracy of much larger neural networks such as Resnet. Thanks to our incremental update scheme, depth-first search methods such as the alpha-beta search can be significantly accelerated. With a carefully tuned evaluation and search, Rapfi reached strength surpassing Katagomo, the strongest open-source Gomoku AI based on AlphaZero's algorithm, under limited computational resources where accelerators like GPUs are absent. Rapfi ranked first among 520 Gomoku agents on Botzone and won the championship in GomoCup 2024.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Corina Catarau-Cotutiu, Esther Mondragon, Eduardo Alonso</p>
<p>Abstract: The ability of artificial intelligence agents to make optimal decisions and generalise them to different domains and tasks is compromised in complex scenarios. One way to address this issue has focused on learning efficient representations of the world and on how the actions of agents affect them, such as disentangled representations that exploit symmetries. Whereas such representations are procedurally efficient, they are based on the compression of low-level state-action transitions, which lack structural richness. To address this problem, we propose to enrich the agent's ontology and extend the traditional conceptualisation of trajectories to provide a more nuanced view of task execution. Structurally Enriched Trajectories (SETs) extend the encoding of sequences of states and their transitions by incorporating hierarchical relations between objects, interactions and affordances. SETs are built as multi-level graphs, providing a detailed representation of the agent dynamics and a transferable functional abstraction of the task. SETs are integrated into an architecture, Structurally Enriched Trajectory Learning and Encoding (SETLE), that employs a heterogeneous graph-based memory structure of multi-level relational dependencies essential for generalisation. Using reinforcement learning as a data generation tool, we demonstrate that SETLE can support downstream tasks, enabling agents to recognise task-relevant structural patterns across diverse environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhen Chen, Zhihao Peng, Xusheng Liang, Cheng Wang, Peigan Liang, Linsheng Zeng, Minjie Ju, Yixuan Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Inpatient pathways demand complex clinical decision-making based on comprehensive patient information, posing critical challenges for clinicians. Despite advancements in large language models (LLMs) in medical applications, limited research focused on artificial intelligence (AI) inpatient pathways systems, due to the lack of large-scale inpatient datasets. Moreover, existing medical benchmarks typically concentrated on medical question-answering and examinations, ignoring the multifaceted nature of clinical decision-making in inpatient settings. To address these gaps, we first developed the Inpatient Pathway Decision Support (IPDS) benchmark from the MIMIC-IV database, encompassing 51,274 cases across nine triage departments and 17 major disease categories alongside 16 standardized treatment options. Then, we proposed the Multi-Agent Inpatient Pathways (MAP) framework to accomplish inpatient pathways with three clinical agents, including a triage agent managing the patient admission, a diagnosis agent serving as the primary decision maker at the department, and a treatment agent providing treatment plans. Additionally, our MAP framework includes a chief agent overseeing the inpatient pathways to guide and promote these three clinician agents. Extensive experiments showed our MAP improved the diagnosis accuracy by 25.10% compared to the state-of-the-art LLM HuatuoGPT2-13B. It is worth noting that our MAP demonstrated significant clinical compliance, outperforming three board-certified clinicians by 10%-12%, establishing a foundation for inpatient pathways systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Allahkaram Shafiei, Hozefa Jesawada, Karl Friston, Giovanni Russo</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite their groundbreaking performance, state-of-the-art autonomous agents can misbehave when training and environmental conditions become inconsistent, with minor mismatches leading to undesirable behaviors or even catastrophic failures. Robustness towards these training/environment ambiguities is a core requirement for intelligent agents and its fulfillment is a long-standing challenge when deploying agents in the real world. Here, departing from mainstream views seeking robustness through training, we introduce DR-FREE, a free energy model that installs this core property by design. It directly wires robustness into the agent decision-making mechanisms via free energy minimization. By combining a robust extension of the free energy principle with a novel resolution engine, DR-FREE returns a policy that is optimal-yet-robust against ambiguity. Moreover, for the first time, it reveals the mechanistic role of ambiguity on optimal decisions and requisite Bayesian belief updating. We evaluate DR-FREE on an experimental testbed involving real rovers navigating an ambiguous environment filled with obstacles. Across all the experiments, DR-FREE enables robots to successfully navigate towards their goal even when, in contrast, standard free energy minimizing agents that do not use DR-FREE fail. In short, DR-FREE can tackle scenarios that elude previous methods: this milestone may inspire both deployment in multi-agent settings and, at a perhaps deeper level, the quest for a biologically plausible explanation of how natural agents - with little or no training - survive in capricious environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seyoung Song</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a novel large language model (LLM)-driven agent framework, which iteratively refines queries and filters contextual evidence by leveraging dynamically evolving knowledge. A defining feature of the system is its decoupling of external sources from an internal knowledge cache that is progressively updated to guide both query generation and evidence selection. This design mitigates bias-reinforcement loops and enables dynamic, trackable search exploration paths, thereby optimizing the trade-off between exploring diverse information and maintaining accuracy through autonomous agent decision-making. Our approach is evaluated on a broad range of open-domain question answering benchmarks, including multi-step tasks that mirror real-world scenarios where integrating information from multiple sources is critical, especially given the vulnerabilities of LLMs that lack explicit reasoning or planning capabilities. The results show that the proposed system not only outperforms single-step baselines regardless of task difficulty but also, compared to conventional iterative retrieval methods, demonstrates pronounced advantages in complex tasks through precise evidence-based reasoning and enhanced efficiency. The proposed system supports both competitive and collaborative sharing of updated context, enabling multi-agent extension. The benefits of multi-agent configurations become especially prominent as task difficulty increases. The number of convergence steps scales with task difficulty, suggesting cost-effective scalability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wan Ju Kang, Eunki Kim, Na Min An, Sangryul Kim, Haemin Choi, Ki Hoon Kwak, James Thorne</p>
<p>Abstract: Often, the needs and visual abilities differ between the annotator group and the end user group. Generating detailed diagram descriptions for blind and low-vision (BLV) users is one such challenging domain. Sighted annotators could describe visuals with ease, but existing studies have shown that direct generations by them are costly, bias-prone, and somewhat lacking by BLV standards. In this study, we ask sighted individuals to assess -- rather than produce -- diagram descriptions generated by vision-language models (VLM) that have been guided with latent supervision via a multi-pass inference. The sighted assessments prove effective and useful to professional educators who are themselves BLV and teach visually impaired learners. We release Sightation, a collection of diagram description datasets spanning 5k diagrams and 137k samples for completion, preference, retrieval, question answering, and reasoning training purposes and demonstrate their fine-tuning potential in various downstream tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cheoljoon Jeong, Xubo Yue, Seokhyun Chung</p>
<p>Abstract: Many failure mechanisms of machinery are closely related to the behavior of condition monitoring (CM) signals. To achieve a cost-effective preventive maintenance strategy, accurate remaining useful life (RUL) prediction based on the signals is of paramount importance. However, the CM signals are often recorded at different factories and production lines, with limited amounts of data. Unfortunately, these datasets have rarely been shared between the sites due to data confidentiality and ownership issues, a lack of computing and storage power, and high communication costs associated with data transfer between sites and a data center. Another challenge in real applications is that the CM signals are often not explicitly specified \textit{a priori}, meaning that existing methods, which often usually a parametric form, may not be applicable. To address these challenges, we propose a new prognostic framework for RUL prediction using the joint modeling of nonlinear degradation signals and time-to-failure data within a federated learning scheme. The proposed method constructs a nonparametric degradation model using a federated multi-output Gaussian process and then employs a federated survival model to predict failure times and probabilities for in-service machinery. The superiority of the proposed method over other alternatives is demonstrated through comprehensive simulation studies and a case study using turbofan engine degradation signal data that include run-to-failure events.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced sentiment analysis capabilities. However, the trade-offs between model performance, efficiency, and explainability of some latest models remain underexplored. This study presents the first comprehensive evaluation of the DeepSeek-R1 series of models, reasoning open-source LLMs, for sentiment analysis, comparing them against OpenAI's GPT-4 and GPT-4-mini. We systematically analyze their performance under few-shot prompting conditions, scaling up to 50-shot configurations to assess in-context learning effectiveness. Our experiments reveal that DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates competitive accuracy, particularly in multi-class sentiment tasks, while offering enhanced interpretability through its detailed reasoning process. Additionally, we highlight the impact of increasing few-shot examples on model performance and discuss key trade-offs between explainability and computational efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ming Gao, Ruichen Qiu, Zeng Hui Chang, Kanjian Zhang, Haikun Wei, Hong Cai Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: In the domain of analog circuit design, the retrieval of circuit diagrams has drawn a great interest, primarily due to its vital role in the consultation of legacy designs and the detection of design plagiarism. Existing image retrieval techniques are adept at handling natural images, which converts images into feature vectors and retrieval similar images according to the closeness of these vectors. Nonetheless, these approaches exhibit limitations when applied to the more specialized and intricate domain of circuit diagrams. This paper presents a novel approach to circuit diagram retrieval by employing a graph representation of circuit diagrams, effectively reformulating the retrieval task as a graph retrieval problem. The proposed methodology consists of two principal components: a circuit diagram recognition algorithm designed to extract the circuit components and topological structure of the circuit using proposed GAM-YOLO model and a 2-step connected domain filtering algorithm, and a hierarchical retrieval strategy based on graph similarity and different graph representation methods for analog circuits. Our methodology pioneers the utilization of graph representation in the retrieval of circuit diagrams, incorporating topological features that are commonly overlooked by standard image retrieval methods. The results of our experiments substantiate the efficacy of our approach in retrieving circuit diagrams across of different types.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhishek Moitra, Arkapravo Ghosh, Shrey Agarwal, Aporva Amarnath, Karthik Swaminathan, Priyadarshini Panda</p>
<p>Abstract: The computational and memory challenges of large language models (LLMs) have sparked several optimization approaches towards their efficient implementation. While prior LLM-targeted quantization, and prior works on sparse acceleration have significantly mitigated the memory and computation bottleneck, they do so assuming high power platforms such as GPUs and server-class FPGAs with large off-chip memory bandwidths and employ a generalized matrix multiplication (GEMM) execution of all the layers in the decoder. In such a GEMM-based execution, data is fetched from an off-chip memory, computed and stored back. However, at reduced off-chip memory capacities, as is the case with low-power edge devices, this implementation strategy significantly increases the attention computation latency owing to the repeated storage and fetch of large intermediate tokens to and from the off-chip memory. Moreover, fetching the weight matrices from a bandwidth constrained memory further aggravates the memory bottleneck problem. To this end, we introduce MEADOW, a framework that significantly reduces the off-chip memory access for LLMs with a novel token-parallel head-sequential (TPHS) dataflow. Additionally, MEADOW applies weight packing that performs loss-less decomposition of large weight matrices to their unique elements thereby, reducing the enormous weight fetch latency. MEADOW demonstrates 1.5x and 2.5x lower decode and prefill latency, respectively, compared to a GEMM-based LLM implementation on the low power Xilinx ZCU102 FPGA platform that consumes less than 10W. Additionally, MEADOW achieves an end-to-end latency improvement of over 40%, compared to prior LLM optimization works.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Suruchi Kumari, Deepak Narayan Gadde, Aman Kumar</p>
<p>Abstract: The escalating complexity of System-on-Chip (SoC) designs has created a bottleneck in verification, with traditional techniques struggling to achieve complete coverage. Existing techniques, such as Constrained Random Verification (CRV) and coverage-driven methodologies, rely on time-consuming and redundant simulation regression, leading to higher verification costs and longer time-to-market due to the manual effort required to adjust constraints and drive the stimuli to achieve coverage objectives. To address this challenge, we propose a novel methodology that leverages supervised Machine Learning (ML) to optimize simulation regressions, resulting in reduced simulation run-time and the number of test simulations required to achieve target coverage goals. We also investigate and compare the effectiveness of various supervised learning algorithms from scikit-learn. Our results demonstrate that these algorithms can achieve at least 99% coverage regain with significantly reduced simulation cycles. We utilize Python Universal Verification Methodology (PyUVM) over SystemVerilog-Universal Verification Methodology (SV-UVM) for testbench creation, enabling simpler constructs using Python and facilitating the reuse of existing ML libraries. Our methodology is applied to three diverse designs, and our results show that it can significantly reduce verification costs, manual efforts, and time-to-market, while enhancing verification productivity and completeness, by automating the testbench update process and achieving target coverage goals.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunqi Shi, Siyuan Xu, Shixiong Kai, Xi Lin, Ke Xue, Mingxuan Yuan, Chao Qian</p>
<p>Abstract: Timing optimization during the global placement of integrated circuits has been a significant focus for decades, yet it remains a complex, unresolved issue. Recent analytical methods typically use pin-level timing information to adjust net weights, which is fast and simple but neglects the path-based nature of the timing graph. The existing path-based methods, however, cannot balance the accuracy and efficiency due to the exponential growth of number of critical paths. In this work, we propose a GPU-accelerated timing-driven global placement framework, integrating accurate path-level information into the efficient DREAMPlace infrastructure. It optimizes the fine-grained pin-to-pin attraction objective and is facilitated by efficient critical path extraction. We also design a quadratic distance loss function specifically to align with the RC timing model. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the current leading timing-driven placers, achieving an average improvement of 40.5% in total negative slack (TNS) and 8.3% in worst negative slack (WNS), as well as an improvement in half-perimeter wirelength (HPWL).</p>

<p>Abstract: Patient mobility monitoring in intensive care is critical for ensuring timely interventions and improving clinical outcomes. While accelerometry-based sensor data are widely adopted in training artificial intelligence models to estimate patient mobility, existing approaches face two key limitations highlighted in clinical practice: (1) modeling the long-term accelerometer data is challenging due to the high dimensionality, variability, and noise, and (2) the absence of efficient and robust methods for long-term mobility assessment. To overcome these challenges, we introduce MELON, a novel multimodal framework designed to predict 12-hour mobility status in the critical care setting. MELON leverages the power of a dual-branch network architecture, combining the strengths of spectrogram-based visual representations and sequential accelerometer statistical features. MELON effectively captures global and fine-grained mobility patterns by integrating a pre-trained image encoder for rich frequency-domain feature extraction and a Mixture-of-Experts encoder for sequence modeling. We trained and evaluated the MELON model on the multimodal dataset of 126 patients recruited from nine Intensive Care Units at the University of Florida Health Shands Hospital main campus in Gainesville, Florida. Experiments showed that MELON outperforms conventional approaches for 12-hour mobility status estimation with an overall area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.82 (95\%, confidence interval 0.78-0.86). Notably, our experiments also revealed that accelerometer data collected from the wrist provides robust predictive performance compared with data from the ankle, suggesting a single-sensor solution that can reduce patient burden and lower deployment costs...</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> E Harshith Kumar Yadav, Rahul Narava,  Anshika, Shashi Shekher Jha</p>
<p>Abstract: Managing equal charge levels in active cell balancing while charging a Li-ion battery is challenging. An imbalance in charge levels affects the state of health of the battery, along with the concerns of thermal runaway and fire hazards. Traditional methods focus on safety assurance as a trade-off between safety and charging time. Others deal with battery-specific conditions to ensure safety, therefore losing on the generalization of the control strategies over various configurations of batteries. In this work, we propose a method to learn safe battery charging actions by using a safety-layer as an add-on over a Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent. The safety layer perturbs the agent's action to prevent the battery from encountering unsafe or dangerous states. Further, our Deep RL framework focuses on learning a generalized policy that can be effectively employed with varying configurations of batteries. Our experimental results demonstrate that the safety-layer based action perturbation incurs fewer safety violations by avoiding unsafe states along with learning a robust policy for several battery configurations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fabian Galis, Darian Onchis</p>
<p>Abstract: In the context of unsupervised learning, effective clustering plays a vital role in revealing patterns and insights from unlabeled data. However, the success of clustering algorithms often depends on the relevance and contribution of features, which can differ between various datasets. This paper explores feature weighting for clustering and presents new weighting strategies, including methods based on SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), a technique commonly used for providing explainability in various supervised machine learning tasks. By taking advantage of SHAP values in a way other than just to gain explainability, we use them to weight features and ultimately improve the clustering process itself in unsupervised scenarios.
  Our empirical evaluations across five benchmark datasets and clustering methods demonstrate that feature weighting based on SHAP can enhance unsupervised clustering quality, achieving up to a 22.69\% improvement over other weighting methods (from 0.586 to 0.719 in terms of the Adjusted Rand Index). Additionally, these situations where the weighted data boosts the results are highlighted and thoroughly explored, offering insight for practical applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jessica Hullman, Yifan Wu, Dawei Xie, Ziyang Guo, Andrew Gelman</p>
<p>Abstract: Methods to quantify uncertainty in predictions from arbitrary models are in demand in high-stakes domains like medicine and finance. Conformal prediction has emerged as a popular method for producing a set of predictions with specified average coverage, in place of a single prediction and confidence value. However, the value of conformal prediction sets to assist human decisions remains elusive due to the murky relationship between coverage guarantees and decision makers' goals and strategies. How should we think about conformal prediction sets as a form of decision support? Under what conditions do we expect the support they provide to be superior versus inferior to that of alternative presentations of predictive uncertainty? We outline a decision theoretic framework for evaluating predictive uncertainty as informative signals, then contrast what can be said within this framework about idealized use of calibrated probabilities versus conformal prediction sets. Informed by prior empirical results and theories of human decisions under uncertainty, we formalize a set of possible strategies by which a decision maker might use a prediction set. We identify ways in which conformal prediction sets and posthoc predictive uncertainty quantification more broadly are in tension with common goals and needs in human-AI decision making. We give recommendations for future research in predictive uncertainty quantification to support human decision makers.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding consumer preferences is essential to product design and predicting market response to these new products. Choice-based conjoint analysis is widely used to model user preferences using their choices in surveys. However, traditional conjoint estimation techniques assume simple linear models. This assumption may lead to limited predictability and inaccurate estimation of product attribute contributions, especially on data that has underlying non-linear relationships. In this work, we employ representation learning to efficiently alleviate this issue. We propose ConjointNet, which is composed of two novel neural architectures, to predict user preferences. We demonstrate that the proposed ConjointNet models outperform traditional conjoint estimate techniques on two preference datasets by over 5%, and offer insights into non-linear feature interactions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ehsan Latif, Xiaoming Zhai</p>
<p>Abstract: Data privacy remains a critical concern in educational research, necessitating Institutional Review Board (IRB) certification and stringent data handling protocols to ensure compliance with ethical standards. Traditional approaches rely on anonymization and controlled data-sharing mechanisms to facilitate research while mitigating privacy risks. However, these methods still involve direct access to raw student data, posing potential vulnerabilities and being time-consuming. This study proposes a federated learning (FL) framework for automatic scoring in educational assessments, eliminating the need to share raw data. Our approach leverages client-side model training, where student responses are processed locally on edge devices, and only optimized model parameters are shared with a central aggregation server. To effectively aggregate heterogeneous model updates, we introduce an adaptive weighted averaging strategy, which dynamically adjusts weight contributions based on client-specific learning characteristics. This method ensures robust model convergence while preserving privacy. We evaluate our framework using assessment data from nine middle schools, comparing the accuracy of federated learning-based scoring models with traditionally trained centralized models. A statistical significance test (paired t-test, $t(8) = 2.29, p = 0.051$) confirms that the accuracy difference between the two approaches is not statistically significant, demonstrating that federated learning achieves comparable performance while safeguarding student data. Furthermore, our method significantly reduces data collection, processing, and deployment overhead, accelerating the adoption of AI-driven educational assessments in a privacy-compliant manner.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyunwoo Park, Baekryun Seong, Sang-Ki Ko</p>
<p>Abstract: In cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), the permutation problem where the state space grows exponentially with the number of agents reduces sample efficiency. Additionally, many existing architectures struggle with scalability, relying on a fixed structure tied to a specific number of agents, limiting their applicability to environments with a variable number of entities. While approaches such as graph neural networks (GNNs) and self-attention mechanisms have progressed in addressing these challenges, they have significant limitations as dense GNNs and self-attention mechanisms incur high computational costs. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel agent network and a non-linear mixing network that ensure permutation-equivariance and scalability, allowing them to generalize to environments with various numbers of agents. Our agent network significantly reduces computational complexity, and our scalable hypernetwork enables efficient weight generation for non-linear mixing. Additionally, we introduce curriculum learning to improve training efficiency. Experiments on SMACv2 and Google Research Football (GRF) demonstrate that our approach achieves superior learning performance compared to existing methods. By addressing both permutation-invariance and scalability in MARL, our work provides a more efficient and adaptable framework for cooperative MARL.

<p>Abstract: Container terminals, pivotal nodes in the network of empty container movement, hold significant potential for enhancing operational efficiency within terminal depots through effective collaboration between transporters and terminal operators. This collaboration is crucial for achieving optimization, leading to streamlined operations and reduced congestion, thereby benefiting both parties. Consequently, there is a pressing need to develop the most suitable forecasting approaches to address this challenge. This study focuses on developing and evaluating a data-driven approach for forecasting empty container availability at container terminal depots within a Vehicle Booking System (VBS) framework. It addresses the gap in research concerning optimizing empty container dwell time and aims to enhance operational efficiencies in container terminal operations. Four forecasting models-Naive, ARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM-are comprehensively analyzed for their predictive capabilities, with LSTM emerging as the top performer due to its ability to capture complex time series patterns. The research underscores the significance of selecting appropriate forecasting techniques tailored to the specific requirements of container terminal operations, contributing to improved operational planning and management in maritime logistics.</p>

<p>Abstract: Prognostic and Health Management (PHM) are crucial ways to avoid unnecessary maintenance for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and improve system reliability. Predicting the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) is one of the most challenging tasks for PHM. Existing methods require prior knowledge about the system, contrived assumptions, or temporal mining to model the life cycles of machine equipment/devices, resulting in diminished accuracy and limited applicability in real-world scenarios. This paper proposes a Bi-directional Adversarial network with Covariate Encoding for machine Remaining Useful Life (BACE-RUL) prediction, which only adopts sensor measurements from the current life cycle to predict RUL rather than relying on previous consecutive cycle recordings. The current sensor measurements of mechanical devices are encoded to a conditional space to better understand the implicit inner mechanical status. The predictor is trained as a conditional generative network with the encoded sensor measurements as its conditions. Various experiments on several real-world datasets, including the turbofan aircraft engine dataset and the dataset collected from degradation experiments of Li-Ion battery cells, show that the proposed model is a general framework and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p>

This is a major limitation since there could be features that are specifically useful for a particular class while irrelevant for other classes, and full explanation of the relationship at class level therefore cannot be determined. While the inclusion of such features for all classes could cause improved predictive ability for the relevant class, the same features could be problematic for other classes. In this paper, we examine this issue and also develop a class-level feature selection method called the Feature Weighted Growing Self-Organising Map (FWGSOM). The proposed method carries out feature analysis at class level which enhances its ability to identify relevant features for each class. Results from experiments indicate that our method performs better than other methods, gives explainable results at class level, and has a low computational footprint when compared to other methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in automating tasks and driving innovation across diverse educational applications. In this survey, we provide a systematic review of state-of-the-art research on LLM agents in education, categorizing them into two broad classes: (1) \emph{Pedagogical Agents}, which focus on automating complex pedagogical tasks to support both teachers and students; and (2) \emph{Domain-Specific Educational Agents}, which are tailored for specialized fields such as science education, language learning, and professional development. We comprehensively examine the technological advancements underlying these LLM agents, including key datasets, benchmarks, and algorithmic frameworks that drive their effectiveness. Furthermore, we discuss critical challenges such as privacy, bias and fairness concerns, hallucination mitigation, and integration with existing educational ecosystems. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive technological overview of LLM agents for education, fostering further research and collaboration to enhance their impact for the greater good of learners and educators alike.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiseong Park, Hanjin Kim, Seojin Kim, Jueun Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph pooling, which compresses a whole graph into a smaller coarsened graph, is an essential component of graph representation learning. To efficiently compress a given graph, graph pooling methods often drop their nodes with attention-based scoring with the task loss. However, this often results in simply removing nodes with lower degrees without consideration of their feature-level relevance to the given task. To fix this problem, we propose a Multi-View Pruning(MVP), a graph pruning method based on a multi-view framework and reconstruction loss. Given a graph, MVP first constructs multiple graphs for different views either by utilizing the predefined modalities or by randomly partitioning the input features, to consider the importance of each node in diverse perspectives. Then, it learns the score for each node by considering both the reconstruction and the task loss. MVP can be incorporated with any hierarchical pooling framework to score the nodes. We validate MVP on multiple benchmark datasets by coupling it with two graph pooling methods, and show that it significantly improves the performance of the base graph pooling method, outperforming all baselines. Further analysis shows that both the encoding of multiple views and the consideration of reconstruction loss are the key to the success of MVP, and that it indeed identifies nodes that are less important according to domain knowledge.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zirui Yuan, Siqi Lai, Hao Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Traffic Signal Control (TSC) plays a critical role in urban traffic management by optimizing traffic flow and mitigating congestion. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as promising tools for TSC due to their exceptional problem-solving and generalization capabilities, existing approaches fail to address the essential need for inter-agent coordination, limiting their effectiveness in achieving network-wide optimization. To bridge this gap, we propose CoLLMLight, a cooperative LLM agent framework for TSC. Specifically, we first construct a structured spatiotemporal graph to capture real-time traffic dynamics and spatial relationships among neighboring intersections, enabling the LLM to reason about complex traffic interactions. Moreover, we introduce a complexity-aware reasoning mechanism that dynamically adapts reasoning depth based on real-time traffic conditions, ensuring optimal computational efficiency without sacrificing decision quality. Besides, we propose a fine-tuning strategy that leverages iterative simulation-driven data collection and environmental feedback to build a lightweight LLM tailored for cooperative TSC. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that CoLLMLight outperforms state-of-the-art methods in diverse traffic scenarios, showcasing its effectiveness, scalability, and robustness.</p>

<p>Abstract: Biological signals, such as electroencephalograms (EEGs) and electrocardiograms (ECGs), play a pivotal role in numerous clinical practices, such as diagnosing brain and cardiac arrhythmic diseases. Existing methods for biosignal classification rely on Attention-based frameworks with dense Feed Forward layers, which lead to inefficient learning, high computational overhead, and suboptimal performance. In this work, we introduce BioMamba, a Spectro-Temporal Embedding strategy applied to the Bidirectional Mamba framework with Sparse Feed Forward layers to enable effective learning of biosignal sequences. By integrating these three key components, BioMamba effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BioMamba significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods with marked improvement in classification performance. The advantages of the proposed BioMamba include (1) Reliability: BioMamba consistently delivers robust results, confirmed across six evaluation metrics. (2) Efficiency: We assess both model and training efficiency, the BioMamba demonstrates computational effectiveness by reducing model size and resource consumption compared to existing approaches. (3) Generality: With the capacity to effectively classify a diverse set of tasks, BioMamba demonstrates adaptability and effectiveness across various domains and applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Moreno D'Inc\`a, Elia Peruzzo, Xingqian Xu, Humphrey Shi, Nicu Sebe, Massimiliano Mancini</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) often inherit the biases and unsafe associations present within their large-scale training dataset. While recent approaches mitigate unsafe behaviors, their evaluation focuses on how safe the model is on unsafe inputs, ignoring potential shortcomings on safe ones. In this paper, we first revise safety evaluation by introducing SafeGround, a new set of metrics that evaluate safety at different levels of granularity. With this metric, we uncover a surprising issue of training-based methods: they make the model less safe on safe inputs. From this finding, we take a different direction and explore whether it is possible to make a model safer without training, introducing Unsafe Weights Manipulation (UWM). UWM uses a calibration set of safe and unsafe instances to compare activations between safe and unsafe content, identifying the most important parameters for processing the latter. Their values are then manipulated via negation. Experiments show that UWM achieves the best tradeoff between safety and knowledge preservation, consistently improving VLMs on unsafe queries while outperforming even training-based state-of-the-art methods on safe ones.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bangzheng Li, Fei Wang, Wenxuan Zhou, Nan Xu, Ben Zhou, Sheng Zhang, Hoifung Poon, Muhao Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) leverage aligned visual encoders to transform images into visual tokens, allowing them to be processed similarly to text by the backbone large language model (LLM). This unified input paradigm enables VLMs to excel in vision-language tasks such as visual question answering (VQA). To improve fine-grained visual reasoning, recent advancements in vision-language modeling introduce image cropping techniques that feed all encoded sub-images into the model. However, this approach significantly increases the number of visual tokens, leading to inefficiency and potential distractions for the LLM. To address the generalization challenges of image representation in VLMs, we propose a lightweight, universal framework that seamlessly integrates with existing VLMs to enhance their ability to process finegrained details. Our method leverages textual semantics to identify key visual areas, improving VQA performance without requiring any retraining of the VLM. Additionally, it incorporates textual signals into the visual encoding process, enhancing both efficiency and effectiveness. The proposed method, SEMCLIP, strengthens the visual understanding of a 7B VLM, LLaVA-1.5 by 3.3% on average across 7 benchmarks, and particularly by 5.3% on the challenging detailed understanding benchmark V*.</p>

<p>Abstract: In agricultural management, precise Ground Truth (GT) data is crucial for accurate Machine Learning (ML) based crop classification. Yet, issues like crop mislabeling and incorrect land identification are common. We propose a multi-level GT cleaning framework while utilizing multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data to address these issues. Specifically, this framework utilizes generating embeddings for farmland, clustering similar crop profiles, and identification of outliers indicating GT errors. We validated clusters with False Colour Composite (FCC) checks and used distance-based metrics to scale and automate this verification process. The importance of cleaning the GT data became apparent when the models were trained on the clean and unclean data. For instance, when we trained a Random Forest model with the clean GT data, we achieved upto 70\% absolute percentage points higher for the F1 score metric. This approach advances crop classification methodologies, with potential for applications towards improving loan underwriting and agricultural decision-making.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tuomas Jalonen, Mohammad Al-Sa'd, Serkan Kiranyaz, Moncef Gabbouj</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural networks require massive amounts of annotated data to train intelligent solutions. Acquiring many labeled data in industrial applications is often difficult; therefore, semi-supervised approaches are preferred. We propose a new semi-supervised co-training method, which combines time and time-frequency (TF) machine learning models to improve performance and reliability. The developed framework collaboratively co-trains fast time-domain models by utilizing high-performing TF techniques without increasing the inference complexity. Besides, it operates in cloud-edge networks and offers holistic support for many applications covering edge-real-time monitoring and cloud-based updates and corrections. Experimental results on bearing fault diagnosis verify the superiority of our technique compared to a competing self-training method. The results from two case studies show that our method outperforms self-training for different noise levels and amounts of available data with accuracy gains reaching from 10.6% to 33.9%. They demonstrate that fusing time-domain and TF-based models offers opportunities for developing high-performance industrial solutions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander Weers, Alexander H. Berger, Laurin Lux, Peter Sch\"uffler, Daniel Rueckert, Johannes C. Paetzold</p>
<p>Abstract: The histopathological classification of whole-slide images (WSIs) is a fundamental task in digital pathology; yet it requires extensive time and expertise from specialists. While deep learning methods show promising results, they typically process WSIs by dividing them into artificial patches, which inherently prevents a network from learning from the entire image context, disregards natural tissue structures and compromises interpretability. Our method overcomes this limitation through a novel graph-based framework that constructs WSI graph representations. The WSI-graph efficiently captures essential histopathological information in a compact form. We build tissue representations (nodes) that follow biological boundaries rather than arbitrary patches all while providing interpretable features for explainability. Through adaptive graph coarsening guided by learned embeddings, we progressively merge regions while maintaining discriminative local features and enabling efficient global information exchange. In our method's final step, we solve the diagnostic task through a graph attention network. We empirically demonstrate strong performance on multiple challenging tasks such as cancer stage classification and survival prediction, while also identifying predictive factors using Integrated Gradients.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jutika Borah, Hidam Kumarjit Singh</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate and reliable image classification is crucial in radiology, where diagnostic decisions significantly impact patient outcomes. Conventional deep learning models tend to produce overconfident predictions despite underlying uncertainties, potentially leading to misdiagnoses. Attention mechanisms have emerged as powerful tools in deep learning, enabling models to focus on relevant parts of the input data. Combined with feature fusion, they can be effective in addressing uncertainty challenges. Cross-attention has become increasingly important in medical image analysis for capturing dependencies across features and modalities. This paper proposes a novel dual cross-attention fusion model for medical image analysis by addressing key challenges in feature integration and interpretability. Our approach introduces a bidirectional cross-attention mechanism with refined channel and spatial attention that dynamically fuses feature maps from EfficientNetB4 and ResNet34 leveraging multi-network contextual dependencies. The refined features through channel and spatial attention highlights discriminative patterns crucial for accurate classification. The proposed model achieved AUC of 99.75%, 100%, 99.93% and 98.69% and AUPR of 99.81%, 100%, 99.97%, and 96.36% on Covid-19, Tuberculosis, Pneumonia Chest X-ray images and Retinal OCT images respectively. The entropy values and several high uncertain samples give an interpretable visualization from the model enhancing transparency. By combining multi-scale feature extraction, bidirectional attention and uncertainty estimation, our proposed model strongly impacts medical image analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jieming Bian, Lei Wang, Letian Zhang, Jie Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) in federated settings enables privacy-preserving adaptation but suffers from cross-client interference due to model aggregation. Existing federated LoRA fine-tuning methods, primarily based on FedAvg, struggle with data heterogeneity, leading to harmful cross-client interference and suboptimal personalization. In this work, we propose \textbf{FedALT}, a novel personalized federated LoRA fine-tuning algorithm that fundamentally departs from FedAvg. Instead of using an aggregated model to initialize local training, each client continues training its individual LoRA while incorporating shared knowledge through a separate Rest-of-the-World (RoTW) LoRA component. To effectively balance local adaptation and global information, FedALT introduces an adaptive mixer that dynamically learns input-specific weightings between the individual and RoTW LoRA components using the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) principle. Through extensive experiments on NLP benchmarks, we demonstrate that FedALT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art personalized federated LoRA fine-tuning methods, achieving superior local adaptation without sacrificing computational efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bhiman Kumar Baghel, Scott M. Jordan, Zheyuan Ryan Shi, Xiang Lorraine Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are used in various downstream language tasks, making it crucial to keep their knowledge up-to-date, but both retraining and fine-tuning the model can be costly. Model editing offers an efficient and effective alternative by a single update to only a key subset of model parameters. While being efficient, these methods are not perfect. Sometimes knowledge edits are unsuccessful, i.e., UnderEdit, or the edit contaminated neighboring knowledge that should remain unchanged, i.e., OverEdit. To address these limitations, we propose iterative model editing, based on our hypothesis that a single parameter update is often insufficient, to mitigate UnderEdit, and neighbor-assisted model editing, which incorporates neighboring knowledge during editing to minimize OverEdit. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our methods effectively reduce UnderEdit up to 38 percentage points and OverEdit up to 6 percentage points across multiple model editing algorithms, LLMs, and benchmark datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Musical expressivity and coherence are indispensable in music composition and performance, while often neglected in modern AI generative models. In this work, we introduce a listening-based data-processing technique that captures the expressivity in musical performance. This technique derived from Weber's law reflects the human perceptual truth of listening and preserves musical subtlety and expressivity in the training input. To facilitate musical coherence, we model the output interdependencies among multiple arguments in the music data such as pitch, duration, velocity, etc. in the neural networks based on the probabilistic chain rule. In practice, we decompose the multi-output sequential model into single-output submodels and condition previously sampled outputs on the subsequent submodels to induce conditional distributions. Finally, to select eligible sequences from all generations, a tentative measure based on the output entropy was proposed. The entropy sequence is set as a criterion to select predictable and stable generations, which is further studied under the context of informational aesthetic measures to quantify musical pleasure and information gain along the music tendency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Merve Tekgurler</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable adaptability in performing various tasks, including machine translation (MT), without explicit training. Models such as OpenAI's GPT-4 and Google's Gemini are frequently evaluated on translation benchmarks and utilized as translation tools due to their high performance. This paper examines Gemini's performance in translating an 18th-century Ottoman Turkish manuscript, Prisoner of the Infidels: The Memoirs of Osman Agha of Timisoara, into English. The manuscript recounts the experiences of Osman Agha, an Ottoman subject who spent 11 years as a prisoner of war in Austria, and includes his accounts of warfare and violence. Our analysis reveals that Gemini's safety mechanisms flagged between 14 and 23 percent of the manuscript as harmful, resulting in untranslated passages. These safety settings, while effective in mitigating potential harm, hinder the model's ability to provide complete and accurate translations of historical texts. Through real historical examples, this study highlights the inherent challenges and limitations of current LLM safety implementations in the handling of sensitive and context-rich materials. These real-world instances underscore potential failures of LLMs in contemporary translation scenarios, where accurate and comprehensive translations are crucial-for example, translating the accounts of modern victims of war for legal proceedings or humanitarian documentation.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this study, we characterize GPU failures in Delta, the current large-scale AI system with over 600 petaflops of peak compute throughput. The system comprises GPU and non-GPU nodes with modern AI accelerators, such as NVIDIA A40, A100, and H100 GPUs. The study uses two and a half years of data on GPU errors. We evaluate the resilience of GPU hardware components to determine the vulnerability of different GPU components to failure and their impact on the GPU and node availability. We measure the key propagation paths in GPU hardware, GPU interconnect (NVLink), and GPU memory. Finally, we evaluate the impact of the observed GPU errors on user jobs. Our key findings are: (i) Contrary to common beliefs, GPU memory is over 30x more reliable than GPU hardware in terms of MTBE (mean time between errors). (ii) The newly introduced GSP (GPU System Processor) is the most vulnerable GPU hardware component. (iii) NVLink errors did not always lead to user job failure, and we attribute it to the underlying error detection and retry mechanisms employed. (iv) We show multiple examples of hardware errors originating from one of the key GPU hardware components, leading to application failure. (v) We project the impact of GPU node availability on larger scales with emulation and find that significant overprovisioning between 5-20% would be necessary to handle GPU failures. If GPU availability were improved to 99.9%, the overprovisioning would be reduced by 4x.</p>

<p>Abstract: Text-to-image synthesis has witnessed remarkable advancements in recent years. Many attempts have been made to adopt text-to-image models to support multiple tasks. However, existing approaches typically require resource-intensive re-training or additional parameters to accommodate for the new tasks, which makes the model inefficient for on-device deployment. We propose Multi-Task Upcycling (MTU), a simple yet effective recipe that extends the capabilities of a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model to support a variety of image-to-image generation tasks. MTU replaces Feed-Forward Network (FFN) layers in the diffusion model with smaller FFNs, referred to as experts, and combines them with a dynamic routing mechanism. To the best of our knowledge, MTU is the first multi-task diffusion modeling approach that seamlessly blends multi-tasking with on-device compatibility, by mitigating the issue of parameter inflation. We show that the performance of MTU is on par with the single-task fine-tuned diffusion models across several tasks including image editing, super-resolution, and inpainting, while maintaining similar latency and computational load (GFLOPs) as the single-task fine-tuned models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eduard Tulchinskii, Daria Voronkova, Ilya Trofimov, Evgeny Burnaev, Serguei Barannikov</p>
<p>Abstract: Topological methods for comparing weighted graphs are valuable in various learning tasks but often suffer from computational inefficiency on large datasets. We introduce RTD-Lite, a scalable algorithm that efficiently compares topological features, specifically connectivity or cluster structures at arbitrary scales, of two weighted graphs with one-to-one correspondence between vertices. Using minimal spanning trees in auxiliary graphs, RTD-Lite captures topological discrepancies with $O(n^2)$ time and memory complexity. This efficiency enables its application in tasks like dimensionality reduction and neural network training. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that RTD-Lite effectively identifies topological differences while significantly reducing computation time compared to existing methods. Moreover, integrating RTD-Lite into neural network training as a loss function component enhances the preservation of topological structures in learned representations.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Khonzoda Umarova, Talia Wise, Zhuoer Lyu, Mina Lee, Qian Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Writing about a subject enriches writers' understanding of that subject. This cognitive benefit of writing -- known as constructive learning -- is essential to how students learn in various disciplines. However, does this benefit persist when students write with generative AI writing assistants? Prior research suggests the answer varies based on the type of AI, e.g., auto-complete systems tend to hinder ideation, while assistants that pose Socratic questions facilitate it. This paper adds an additional perspective. Through a case study, we demonstrate that the impact of genAI on students' idea development depends not only on the AI but also on the students and, crucially, their interactions in between. Students who proactively explored ideas gained new ideas from writing, regardless of whether they used auto-complete or Socratic AI assistants. Those who engaged in prolonged, mindless copyediting developed few ideas even with a Socratic AI. These findings suggest opportunities in designing AI writing assistants, not merely by creating more thought-provoking AI, but also by fostering more thought-provoking writer-AI interactions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mikel Rodriguez, Raluca Ada Popa, Four Flynn, Lihao Liang, Allan Dafoe, Anna Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: As frontier models become more capable, the community has attempted to evaluate their ability to enable cyberattacks. Performing a comprehensive evaluation and prioritizing defenses are crucial tasks in preparing for AGI safely. However, current cyber evaluation efforts are ad-hoc, with no systematic reasoning about the various phases of attacks, and do not provide a steer on how to use targeted defenses. In this work, we propose a novel approach to AI cyber capability evaluation that (1) examines the end-to-end attack chain, (2) helps to identify gaps in the evaluation of AI threats, and (3) helps defenders prioritize targeted mitigations and conduct AI-enabled adversary emulation to support red teaming. To achieve these goals, we propose adapting existing cyberattack chain frameworks to AI systems. We analyze over 12,000 instances of real-world attempts to use AI in cyberattacks catalogued by Google's Threat Intelligence Group. Using this analysis, we curate a representative collection of seven cyberattack chain archetypes and conduct a bottleneck analysis to identify areas of potential AI-driven cost disruption. Our evaluation benchmark consists of 50 new challenges spanning different phases of cyberattacks. Based on this, we devise targeted cybersecurity model evaluations, report on the potential for AI to amplify offensive cyber capabilities across specific attack phases, and conclude with recommendations on prioritizing defenses. In all, we consider this to be the most comprehensive AI cyber risk evaluation framework published so far.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peihong Yu, Amisha Bhaskar, Anukriti Singh, Zahiruddin Mahammad, Pratap Tokekar</p>
<p>Abstract: Training robotic manipulation policies traditionally requires numerous demonstrations and/or environmental rollouts. While recent Imitation Learning (IL) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods have reduced the number of required demonstrations, they still rely on expert knowledge to collect high-quality data, limiting scalability and accessibility. We propose Sketch-to-Skill, a novel framework that leverages human-drawn 2D sketch trajectories to bootstrap and guide RL for robotic manipulation. Our approach extends beyond previous sketch-based methods, which were primarily focused on imitation learning or policy conditioning, limited to specific trained tasks. Sketch-to-Skill employs a Sketch-to-3D Trajectory Generator that translates 2D sketches into 3D trajectories, which are then used to autonomously collect initial demonstrations. We utilize these sketch-generated demonstrations in two ways: to pre-train an initial policy through behavior cloning and to refine this policy through RL with guided exploration. Experimental results demonstrate that Sketch-to-Skill achieves ~96% of the performance of the baseline model that leverages teleoperated demonstration data, while exceeding the performance of a pure reinforcement learning policy by ~170%, only from sketch inputs. This makes robotic manipulation learning more accessible and potentially broadens its applications across various domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kun Su, Krishna Sayana, Hubert Pham, James Pine, Yuri Vasilevski, Raghavendra Vasudeva, Marialena Kyriakidi, Liam Hebert, Ambarish Jash, Anushya Subbiah, Sukhdeep Sodhi</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel dataset REGEN (Reviews Enhanced with GEnerative Narratives), designed to benchmark the conversational capabilities of recommender Large Language Models (LLMs), addressing the limitations of existing datasets that primarily focus on sequential item prediction. REGEN extends the Amazon Product Reviews dataset by inpainting two key natural language features: (1) user critiques, representing user "steering" queries that lead to the selection of a subsequent item, and (2) narratives, rich textual outputs associated with each recommended item taking into account prior context. The narratives include product endorsements, purchase explanations, and summaries of user preferences.
  Further, we establish an end-to-end modeling benchmark for the task of conversational recommendation, where models are trained to generate both recommendations and corresponding narratives conditioned on user history (items and critiques). For this joint task, we introduce a modeling framework LUMEN (LLM-based Unified Multi-task Model with Critiques, Recommendations, and Narratives) which uses an LLM as a backbone for critiquing, retrieval and generation. We also evaluate the dataset's quality using standard auto-rating techniques and benchmark it by training both traditional and LLM-based recommender models. Our results demonstrate that incorporating critiques enhances recommendation quality by enabling the recommender to learn language understanding and integrate it with recommendation signals. Furthermore, LLMs trained on our dataset effectively generate both recommendations and contextual narratives, achieving performance comparable to state-of-the-art recommenders and language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yun Tang, Udhaya Chandhar Srinivasan, Benjamin James Scott, Obumneme Umealor, Dennis Kevogo, Weisi Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: With the advent of 6G, Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architectures are evolving to support intelligent, adaptive, and automated network orchestration. This paper proposes a novel Edge AI and Network Service Orchestration framework that leverages Large Language Model (LLM) agents deployed as O-RAN rApps. The proposed LLM-agent-powered system enables interactive and intuitive orchestration by translating the user's use case description into deployable AI services and corresponding network configurations. The LLM agent automates multiple tasks, including AI model selection from repositories (e.g., Hugging Face), service deployment, network adaptation, and real-time monitoring via xApps. We implement a prototype using open-source O-RAN projects (OpenAirInterface and FlexRIC) to demonstrate the feasibility and functionality of our framework. Our demonstration showcases the end-to-end flow of AI service orchestration, from user interaction to network adaptation, ensuring Quality of Service (QoS) compliance. This work highlights the potential of integrating LLM-driven automation into 6G O-RAN ecosystems, paving the way for more accessible and efficient edge AI ecosystems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wonwoong Cho, Yan-Ying Chen, Matthew Klenk, David I. Inouye, Yanxia Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) Diffusion Models have achieved remarkable performance in generating high quality images. However, enabling precise control of continuous attributes, especially multiple attributes simultaneously, in a new domain (e.g., numeric values like eye openness or car width) with text-only guidance remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce the Attribute (Att) Adapter, a novel plug-and-play module designed to enable fine-grained, multi-attributes control in pretrained diffusion models. Our approach learns a single control adapter from a set of sample images that can be unpaired and contain multiple visual attributes. The Att-Adapter leverages the decoupled cross attention module to naturally harmonize the multiple domain attributes with text conditioning. We further introduce Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) to the Att-Adapter to mitigate overfitting, matching the diverse nature of the visual world. Evaluations on two public datasets show that Att-Adapter outperforms all LoRA-based baselines in controlling continuous attributes. Additionally, our method enables a broader control range and also improves disentanglement across multiple attributes, surpassing StyleGAN-based techniques. Notably, Att-Adapter is flexible, requiring no paired synthetic data for training, and is easily scalable to multiple attributes within a single model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Melvin Mokhtari</p>
<p>Abstract: Digital twins (DTs) are redefining healthcare by paving the way for more personalized, proactive, and intelligent medical interventions. As the shift toward personalized care intensifies, there is a growing need for an individual's virtual replica that delivers the right treatment at the optimal time and in the most effective manner. The emerging concept of a Human Digital Twin (HDT) holds the potential to revolutionize the traditional healthcare system much like digital twins have transformed manufacturing and aviation. An HDT mirrors the physical entity of a human body through a dynamic virtual model that continuously reflects changes in molecular, physiological, emotional, and lifestyle factors. This digital representation not only supports remote monitoring, diagnosis, and prescription but also facilitates surgery, rehabilitation, and overall personalized care, thereby relieving pressure on conventional healthcare frameworks. Despite its promising advantages, there are considerable research challenges to overcome as HDT technology evolves. In this study, I will initially delineate the distinctions between traditional digital twins and HDTs, followed by an exploration of the networking architecture integral to their operation--from data acquisition and communication to computation, management, and decision-making--thereby offering insights into how these innovations may reshape the modern healthcare industry.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid expansion of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in digital platforms used by youth has created significant challenges related to privacy, autonomy, and data protection. While AI-driven personalization offers enhanced user experiences, it often operates without clear ethical boundaries, leaving young users vulnerable to data exploitation and algorithmic biases. This paper presents a call to action for ethical AI governance, advocating for a structured framework that ensures youth-centred privacy protections, transparent data practices, and regulatory oversight. We outline key areas requiring urgent intervention, including algorithmic transparency, privacy education, parental data-sharing ethics, and accountability measures. Through this approach, we seek to empower youth with greater control over their digital identities and propose actionable strategies for policymakers, AI developers, and educators to build a fairer and more accountable AI ecosystem.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thivya Thogesan, Anupiya Nugaliyadde, Kok Wai Wong</p>
<p>Abstract: Interpretability remains a key difficulty in sentiment analysis with Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in high-stakes applications where it is crucial to comprehend the rationale behind forecasts. This research addressed this by introducing a technique that applies SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) by breaking down LLMs into components such as embedding layer,encoder,decoder and attention layer to provide a layer-by-layer knowledge of sentiment prediction. The approach offers a clearer overview of how model interpret and categorise sentiment by breaking down LLMs into these parts. The method is evaluated using the Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST-2) dataset, which shows how different sentences affect different layers. The effectiveness of layer-wise SHAP analysis in clarifying sentiment-specific token attributions is demonstrated by experimental evaluations, which provide a notable enhancement over current whole-model explainability techniques. These results highlight how the suggested approach could improve the reliability and transparency of LLM-based sentiment analysis in crucial applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ankur Barthwal, Molly Campbell, Ajay Kumar Shrestha</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in digital ecosystems has reshaped privacy dynamics, particularly for young digital citizens navigating data-driven environments. This study explores evolving privacy concerns across three key stakeholder groups, digital citizens (ages 16-19), parents, educators, and AI professionals, and assesses differences in data ownership, trust, transparency, parental mediation, education, and risk-benefit perceptions. Employing a grounded theory methodology, this research synthesizes insights from 482 participants through structured surveys, qualitative interviews, and focus groups. The findings reveal distinct privacy expectations- Young users emphasize autonomy and digital freedom, while parents and educators advocate for regulatory oversight and AI literacy programs. AI professionals, in contrast, prioritize the balance between ethical system design and technological efficiency. The data further highlights gaps in AI literacy and transparency, emphasizing the need for comprehensive, stakeholder-driven privacy frameworks that accommodate diverse user needs. Using comparative thematic analysis, this study identifies key tensions in privacy governance and develops the novel Privacy-Ethics Alignment in AI (PEA-AI) model, which structures privacy decision-making as a dynamic negotiation between stakeholders. By systematically analyzing themes such as transparency, user control, risk perception, and parental mediation, this research provides a scalable, adaptive foundation for AI governance, ensuring that privacy protections evolve alongside emerging AI technologies and youth-centric digital interactions.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11954">Goal-Oriented Source Coding using LDPC Codes for Compressed-Domain Image Classification</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahcen Aliouat, Elsa Dupraz</p>
<p>Abstract: In the emerging field of goal-oriented communications, the focus has shifted from reconstructing data to directly performing specific learning tasks, such as classification, segmentation, or pattern recognition, on the received coded data. In the commonly studied scenario of classification from compressed images, a key objective is to enable learning directly on entropy-coded data, thereby bypassing the computationally intensive step of data reconstruction. Conventional entropy-coding methods, such as Huffman and Arithmetic coding, are effective for compression but disrupt the data structure, making them less suitable for direct learning without decoding. This paper investigates the use of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes -- originally designed for channel coding -- as an alternative entropy-coding approach. It is hypothesized that the structured nature of LDPC codes can be leveraged more effectively by deep learning models for tasks like classification. At the receiver side, gated recurrent unit (GRU) models are trained to perform image classification directly on LDPC-coded data. Experiments on datasets like MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR show that LDPC codes outperform Huffman and Arithmetic coding in classification tasks, while requiring significantly smaller learning models. Furthermore, the paper analyzes why LDPC codes preserve data structure more effectively than traditional entropy-coding techniques and explores the impact of key code parameters on classification performance. These results suggest that LDPC-based entropy coding offers an optimal balance between learning efficiency and model complexity, eliminating the need for prior decoding.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce CHOrD, a novel framework for scalable synthesis of 3D indoor scenes, designed to create house-scale, collision-free, and hierarchically structured indoor digital twins. In contrast to existing methods that directly synthesize the scene layout as a scene graph or object list, CHOrD incorporates a 2D image-based intermediate layout representation, enabling effective prevention of collision artifacts by successfully capturing them as out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios during generation. Furthermore, unlike existing methods, CHOrD is capable of generating scene layouts that adhere to complex floor plans with multi-modal controls, enabling the creation of coherent, house-wide layouts robust to both geometric and semantic variations in room structures. Additionally, we propose a novel dataset with expanded coverage of household items and room configurations, as well as significantly improved data quality. CHOrD demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on both the 3D-FRONT and our proposed datasets, delivering photorealistic, spatially coherent indoor scene synthesis adaptable to arbitrary floor plan variations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Badr Souani, Ezekiel Soremekun, Mike Papadakis, Setsuko Yokoyama, Sudipta Chattopadhyay, Yves Le Traon</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) may portray discrimination towards certain individuals, especially those characterized by multiple attributes (aka intersectional bias). Discovering intersectional bias in LLMs is challenging, as it involves complex inputs on multiple attributes (e.g. race and gender). To address this challenge, we propose HInter, a test technique that synergistically combines mutation analysis, dependency parsing and metamorphic oracles to automatically detect intersectional bias in LLMs. HInter generates test inputs by systematically mutating sentences using multiple mutations, validates inputs via a dependency invariant and detects biases by checking the LLM response on the original and mutated sentences. We evaluate HInter using six LLM architectures and 18 LLM models (GPT3.5, Llama2, BERT, etc) and find that 14.61% of the inputs generated by HInter expose intersectional bias. Results also show that our dependency invariant reduces false positives (incorrect test inputs) by an order of magnitude. Finally, we observed that 16.62% of intersectional bias errors are hidden, meaning that their corresponding atomic cases do not trigger biases. Overall, this work emphasize the importance of testing LLMs for intersectional bias.</p>

<p>Abstract: Advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have increased the performance of different natural language understanding as well as generation tasks. Although LLMs have breached the state-of-the-art performance in various tasks, they often reflect different forms of bias present in the training data. In the light of this perceived limitation, we provide a unified evaluation of benchmarks using a set of representative LLMs that cover different forms of biases starting from physical characteristics to socio-economic categories. Moreover, we propose five prompting approaches to carry out the bias detection task across different aspects of bias. Further, we formulate three research questions to gain valuable insight in detecting biases in LLMs using different approaches and evaluation metrics across benchmarks. The results indicate that each of the selected LLMs suffer from one or the other form of bias with the LLaMA3.1-8B model being the least biased. Finally, we conclude the paper with the identification of key challenges and possible future directions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dharani Chandra</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing through their state of art reasoning capabilities. This paper explores the convergence of LLM reasoning techniques and feature generation for machine learning tasks. We examine four key reasoning approaches: Chain of Thought, Tree of Thoughts, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, and Thought Space Exploration. Our analysis reveals how these approaches can be used to identify effective feature generation rules without having to manually specify search spaces. The paper categorizes LLM-based feature generation methods across various domains including finance, healthcare, and text analytics. LLMs can extract key information from clinical notes and radiology reports in healthcare, by enabling more efficient data utilization. In finance, LLMs facilitate text generation, summarization, and entity extraction from complex documents. We analyze evaluation methodologies for assessing feature quality and downstream performance, with particular attention to OCTree's decision tree reasoning approach that provides language-based feedback for iterative improvements. Current challenges include hallucination, computational efficiency, and domain adaptation. As of March 2025, emerging approaches include inference-time compute scaling, reinforcement learning, and supervised fine-tuning with model distillation. Future directions point toward multimodal feature generation, self-improving systems, and neuro-symbolic approaches. This paper provides a detailed overview of an emerging field that promises to automate and enhance feature engineering through language model reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shun Zou, Yi Zou, Mingya Zhang, Shipeng Luo, Zhihao Chen, Guangwei Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, Transformer has witnessed significant progress in food recognition. However, most existing approaches still face two critical challenges in lightweight food recognition: (1) the quadratic complexity and redundant feature representation from interactions with irrelevant tokens; (2) static feature recognition and single-scale representation, which overlook the unstructured, non-fixed nature of food images and the need for multi-scale features. To address these, we propose an adaptive and efficient sparse Transformer architecture (Fraesormer) with two core designs: Adaptive Top-k Sparse Partial Attention (ATK-SPA) and Hierarchical Scale-Sensitive Feature Gating Network (HSSFGN). ATK-SPA uses a learnable Gated Dynamic Top-K Operator (GDTKO) to retain critical attention scores, filtering low query-key matches that hinder feature aggregation. It also introduces a partial channel mechanism to reduce redundancy and promote expert information flow, enabling local-global collaborative modeling. HSSFGN employs gating mechanism to achieve multi-scale feature representation, enhancing contextual semantic information. Extensive experiments show that Fraesormer outperforms state-of-the-art methods. code is available at https://zs1314.github.io/Fraesormer.</p>

<p>Abstract: Tabular data synthesis using diffusion models has gained significant attention for its potential to balance data utility and privacy. However, existing privacy evaluations often rely on heuristic metrics or weak membership inference attacks (MIA), leaving privacy risks inadequately assessed. In this work, we conduct a rigorous MIA study on diffusion-based tabular synthesis, revealing that state-of-the-art attacks designed for image models fail in this setting. We identify noise initialization as a key factor influencing attack efficacy and propose a machine-learning-driven approach that leverages loss features across different noises and time steps. Our method, implemented with a lightweight MLP, effectively learns membership signals, eliminating the need for manual optimization. Experimental results from the MIDST Challenge @ SaTML 2025 demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, securing first place across all tracks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhe Jin, Tat-Seng Chua</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models (DM) have garnered widespread adoption due to their capability in generating high-fidelity outputs and accessibility to anyone able to put imagination into words. However, DMs are often predisposed to generate unappealing outputs, much like the random images on the internet they were trained on. Existing approaches to address this are founded on the implicit premise that visual aesthetics is universal, which is limiting. Aesthetics in the T2I context should be about personalization and we propose the novel task of aesthetics alignment which seeks to align user-specified aesthetics with the T2I generation output. Inspired by how artworks provide an invaluable perspective to approach aesthetics, we codify visual aesthetics using the compositional framework artists employ, known as the Principles of Art (PoA). To facilitate this study, we introduce CompArt, a large-scale compositional art dataset building on top of WikiArt with PoA analysis annotated by a capable Multimodal LLM. Leveraging the expressive power of LLMs and training a lightweight and transferrable adapter, we demonstrate that T2I DMs can effectively offer 10 compositional controls through user-specified PoA conditions. Additionally, we design an appropriate evaluation framework to assess the efficacy of our approach.</p>

<p>Abstract: Variance-dependent regret bounds for linear contextual bandits, which improve upon the classical $\tilde{O}(d\sqrt{K})$ regret bound to $\tilde{O}(d\sqrt{\sum_{k=1}^K\sigma_k^2})$, where $d$ is the context dimension, $K$ is the number of rounds, and $\sigma^2_k$ is the noise variance in round $k$, has been widely studied in recent years. However, most existing works focus on the regret upper bounds instead of lower bounds. To our knowledge, the only lower bound is from Jia et al. (2024), which proved that for any eluder dimension $d_{\textbf{elu}}$ and total variance budget $\Lambda$, there exists an instance with $\sum_{k=1}^K\sigma_k^2\leq \Lambda$ for which any algorithm incurs a variance-dependent lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{d_{\textbf{elu}}\Lambda})$. However, this lower bound has a $\sqrt{d}$ gap with existing upper bounds. Moreover, it only considers a fixed total variance budget $\Lambda$ and does not apply to a general variance sequence $\{\sigma_1^2,\ldots,\sigma_K^2\}$. In this paper, to overcome the limitations of Jia et al. (2024), we consider the general variance sequence under two settings. For a prefixed sequence, where the entire variance sequence is revealed to the learner at the beginning of the learning process, we establish a variance-dependent lower bound of $\Omega(d \sqrt{\sum_{k=1}^K\sigma_k^2 }/\log K)$ for linear contextual bandits. For an adaptive sequence, where an adversary can generate the variance $\sigma_k^2$ in each round $k$ based on historical observations, we show that when the adversary must generate $\sigma_k^2$ before observing the decision set $\mathcal{D}_k$, a similar lower bound of $\Omega(d\sqrt{ \sum_{k=1}^K\sigma_k^2} /\log^6(dK))$ holds. In both settings, our results match the upper bounds of the SAVE algorithm (Zhao et al., 2023) up to logarithmic factors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Enes Erdogan, Eren Erdal Aksoy, Sanem Sariel</p>
<p>Abstract: Recognition of human manipulation actions in real-time is essential for safe and effective human-robot interaction and collaboration. The challenge lies in developing a model that is both lightweight enough for real-time execution and capable of generalization. While some existing methods in the literature can run in real-time, they struggle with temporal scalability, i.e., they fail to adapt to long-duration manipulations effectively. To address this, leveraging the generalizable scene graph representations, we propose a new Factorized Graph Sequence Encoder network that not only runs in real-time but also scales effectively in the temporal dimension, thanks to its factorized encoder architecture. Additionally, we introduce Hand Pooling operation, a simple pooling operation for more focused extraction of the graph-level embeddings. Our model outperforms the previous state-of-the-art real-time approach, achieving a 14.3\% and 5.6\% improvement in F1-macro score on the KIT Bimanual Action (Bimacs) Dataset and Collaborative Action (CoAx) Dataset, respectively. Moreover, we conduct an extensive ablation study to validate our network design choices. Finally, we compare our model with its architecturally similar RGB-based model on the Bimacs dataset and show the limitations of this model in contrast to ours on such an object-centric manipulation dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hang Ni, Jindong Han, Nengjun Zhu, Hao Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD) plays a vital role in various data mining applications such as e-commerce fraud prevention and malicious user detection. Recently, Graph Neural Network (GNN) based approach has demonstrated great effectiveness in GAD by first encoding graph data into low-dimensional representations and then identifying anomalies under the guidance of supervised or unsupervised signals. However, existing GNN-based approaches implicitly follow the homophily principle (i.e., the "like attracts like" phenomenon) and fail to learn discriminative embedding for anomalies that connect vast normal nodes. Moreover, such approaches identify anomalies in a unified global perspective but overlook diversified abnormal patterns conditioned on local graph context, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome the aforementioned limitations, in this paper, we propose a Multi-hypersphere Heterophilic Graph Learning (MHetGL) framework for unsupervised GAD. Specifically, we first devise a Heterophilic Graph Encoding (HGE) module to learn distinguishable representations for potential anomalies by purifying and augmenting their neighborhood in a fully unsupervised manner. Then, we propose a Multi-Hypersphere Learning (MHL) module to enhance the detection capability for context-dependent anomalies by jointly incorporating critical patterns from both global and local perspectives. Extensive experiments on ten real-world datasets show that MHetGL outperforms 14 baselines. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/KennyNH/MHetGL.</p>

<p>Abstract: In many safety-critical engineering domains, hazard analysis techniques are an essential part of requirement elicitation. Of the methods proposed for this task, STPA (System-Theoretic Process Analysis) represents a relatively recent development in the field. The completion, management, and traceability of this hazard analysis technique present a time-consuming challenge to the requirements and safety engineers involved. In this paper, we introduce a free, open-source software framework to build STPA models with several automated workflows powered by large language models (LLMs). In past works, LLMs have been successfully integrated into a myriad of workflows across various fields. Here, we demonstrate that LLMs can be used to complete tasks associated with STPA with a high degree of accuracy, saving the time and effort of the human engineers involved. We experimentally validate our method on real-world STPA models built by requirement engineers and researchers.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhao Zhou, Yuxin Tian, Jindi Lv, Mingjia Shi, Yuanxi Li, Qing Ye, Shuhao Zhang, Jiancheng Lv</p>
<p>Abstract: In the realm of high-frequency data streams, achieving real-time learning within varying memory constraints is paramount. This paper presents Ferret, a comprehensive framework designed to enhance online accuracy of Online Continual Learning (OCL) algorithms while dynamically adapting to varying memory budgets. Ferret employs a fine-grained pipeline parallelism strategy combined with an iterative gradient compensation algorithm, ensuring seamless handling of high-frequency data with minimal latency, and effectively counteracting the challenge of stale gradients in parallel training. To adapt to varying memory budgets, its automated model partitioning and pipeline planning optimizes performance regardless of memory limitations. Extensive experiments across 20 benchmarks and 5 integrated OCL algorithms show Ferret's remarkable efficiency, achieving up to 3.7$\times$ lower memory overhead to reach the same online accuracy compared to competing methods. Furthermore, Ferret consistently outperforms these methods across diverse memory budgets, underscoring its superior adaptability. These findings position Ferret as a premier solution for efficient and adaptive OCL framework in real-time environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenhao Lin, Chenyang Zhao, Shiwei Wang, Longtian Wang, Chao Shen, Zhengyu Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Backdoor attacks typically place a specific trigger on certain training data, such that the model makes prediction errors on inputs with that trigger during inference. Despite the core role of the trigger, existing studies have commonly believed a perfect match between training-inference triggers is optimal. In this paper, for the first time, we systematically explore the training-inference trigger relation, particularly focusing on their mismatch, based on a Training-Inference Trigger Intensity Manipulation (TITIM) workflow. TITIM specifically investigates the training-inference trigger intensity, such as the size or the opacity of a trigger, and reveals new insights into trigger generalization and overfitting.
  These new insights challenge the above common belief by demonstrating that the training-inference trigger mismatch can facilitate attacks in two practical scenarios, posing more significant security threats than previously thought. First, when the inference trigger is fixed, using training triggers with mixed intensities leads to stronger attacks than using any single intensity. For example, on CIFAR-10 with ResNet-18, mixing training triggers with 1.0 and 0.1 opacities improves the worst-case attack success rate (ASR) (over different testing opacities) of the best single-opacity attack from 10.61\% to 92.77\%. Second, intentionally using certain mismatched training-inference triggers can improve the attack stealthiness, i.e., better bypassing defenses. For example, compared to the training/inference intensity of 1.0/1.0, using 1.0/0.7 decreases the area under the curve (AUC) of the Scale-Up defense from 0.96 to 0.62, while maintaining a high attack ASR (99.65\% vs. 91.62\%). The above new insights are validated to be generalizable across different backdoor attacks, models, datasets, tasks, and (digital/physical) domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhayy Ud Din, Waseem Akram, Ahsan B Bakht, Yihao Dong, Irfan Hussain</p>
<p>Abstract: Unmanned Surface Vessels (USVs) are essential for various maritime operations. USV mission planning approach offers autonomous solutions for monitoring, surveillance, and logistics. Existing approaches, which are based on static methods, struggle to adapt to dynamic environments, leading to suboptimal performance, higher costs, and increased risk of failure. This paper introduces a novel mission planning framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, to address these challenges. LLMs are proficient at understanding natural language commands, executing symbolic reasoning, and flexibly adjusting to changing situations. Our approach integrates LLMs into maritime mission planning to bridge the gap between high-level human instructions and executable plans, allowing real-time adaptation to environmental changes and unforeseen obstacles. In addition, feedback from low-level controllers is utilized to refine symbolic mission plans, ensuring robustness and adaptability. This framework improves the robustness and effectiveness of USV operations by integrating the power of symbolic planning with the reasoning abilities of LLMs. In addition, it simplifies the mission specification, allowing operators to focus on high-level objectives without requiring complex programming. The simulation results validate the proposed approach, demonstrating its ability to optimize mission execution while seamlessly adapting to dynamic maritime conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengrong Yue, Shaobin Zhuang, Kunchang Li, Yanbo Ding, Yali Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the recent advancement in video stylization, most existing methods struggle to render any video with complex transitions, based on an open style description of user query. To fill this gap, we introduce a generic multi-agent system for video stylization, V-Stylist, by a novel collaboration and reflection paradigm of multi-modal large language models. Specifically, our V-Stylist is a systematical workflow with three key roles: (1) Video Parser decomposes the input video into a number of shots and generates their text prompts of key shot content. Via a concise video-to-shot prompting paradigm, it allows our V-Stylist to effectively handle videos with complex transitions. (2) Style Parser identifies the style in the user query and progressively search the matched style model from a style tree. Via a robust tree-of-thought searching paradigm, it allows our V-Stylist to precisely specify vague style preference in the open user query. (3) Style Artist leverages the matched model to render all the video shots into the required style. Via a novel multi-round self-reflection paradigm, it allows our V-Stylist to adaptively adjust detail control, according to the style requirement. With such a distinct design of mimicking human professionals, our V-Stylist achieves a major breakthrough over the primary challenges for effective and automatic video stylization. Moreover,we further construct a new benchmark Text-driven Video Stylization Benchmark (TVSBench), which fills the gap to assess stylization of complex videos on open user queries. Extensive experiments show that, V-Stylist achieves the state-of-the-art, e.g.,V-Stylist surpasses FRESCO and ControlVideo by 6.05% and 4.51% respectively in overall average metrics, marking a significant advance in video stylization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicola Milano, Michela Ponticorvo, Davide Marocco</p>
<p>Abstract: In this article we explore the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in assessing the content validity of psychometric instruments, focusing on the Big Five Questionnaire (BFQ) and Big Five Inventory (BFI). Content validity, a cornerstone of test construction, ensures that psychological measures adequately cover their intended constructs. Using both human expert evaluations and advanced LLMs, we compared the accuracy of semantic item-construct alignment. Graduate psychology students employed the Content Validity Ratio (CVR) to rate test items, forming the human baseline. In parallel, state-of-the-art LLMs, including multilingual and fine-tuned models, analyzed item embeddings to predict construct mappings. The results reveal distinct strengths and limitations of human and AI approaches. Human validators excelled in aligning the behaviorally rich BFQ items, while LLMs performed better with the linguistically concise BFI items. Training strategies significantly influenced LLM performance, with models tailored for lexical relationships outperforming general-purpose LLMs. Here we highlights the complementary potential of hybrid validation systems that integrate human expertise and AI precision. The findings underscore the transformative role of LLMs in psychological assessment, paving the way for scalable, objective, and robust test development methodologies.</p>

<p>Abstract: Covariates provide valuable information on external factors that influence time series and are critical in many real-world time series forecasting tasks. For example, in retail, covariates may indicate promotions or peak dates such as holiday seasons that heavily influence demand forecasts. Recent advances in pretraining large language model architectures for time series forecasting have led to highly accurate forecasters. However, the majority of these models do not readily use covariates as they are often specific to a certain task or domain. This paper introduces a new method to incorporate covariates into pretrained time series forecasting models. Our proposed approach incorporates covariate information into pretrained forecasting models through modular blocks that inject past and future covariate information, without necessarily modifying the pretrained model in consideration. In order to evaluate our approach, we introduce a benchmark composed of 32 different synthetic datasets with varying dynamics to evaluate the effectivity of forecasting models with covariates. Extensive evaluations on both synthetic and real datasets show that our approach effectively incorporates covariate information into pretrained models, outperforming existing baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: The latest research on Large Language Models (LLMs) has demonstrated significant advancement in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). However, despite this progress, there is still a lack of reliability in these models. This is due to the stochastic architecture of LLMs, which presents a challenge for users attempting to ascertain the reliability of a model's response. These responses may cause serious harm in high-risk environments or expensive failures in industrial contexts. Therefore, we introduce the framework REpeated Clustering of Scores Improving the Precision (RECSIP) which focuses on improving the precision of LLMs by asking multiple models in parallel, scoring and clustering their responses to ensure a higher reliability on the response. The evaluation of our reference implementation recsip on the benchmark MMLU-Pro using the models GPT-4o, Claude and Gemini shows an overall increase of 5.8 per cent points compared to the best used model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xue Jiang, Xiulian Peng, Yuan Zhang, Yan Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Current large speech language models are mainly based on semantic tokens from discretization of self-supervised learned representations and acoustic tokens from a neural codec, following a semantic-modeling and acoustic-synthesis paradigm. However, semantic tokens discard paralinguistic attributes of speakers that is important for natural spoken communication, while prompt-based acoustic synthesis from semantic tokens has limits in recovering paralinguistic details and suffers from robustness issues, especially when there are domain gaps between the prompt and the target. This paper unifies two types of tokens and proposes the UniCodec, a universal speech token learning that encapsulates all semantics of speech, including linguistic and paralinguistic information, into a compact and semantically-disentangled unified token. Such a unified token can not only benefit speech language models in understanding with paralinguistic hints but also help speech generation with high-quality output. A low-bitrate neural codec is leveraged to learn such disentangled discrete representations at global and local scales, with knowledge distilled from self-supervised learned features. Extensive evaluations on multilingual datasets demonstrate its effectiveness in generating natural, expressive and long-term consistent output quality with paralinguistic attributes well preserved in several speech processing tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have permitted the development of language-guided multi-robot systems, which allow robots to execute tasks based on natural language instructions. However, achieving effective coordination in distributed multi-agent environments remains challenging due to (1) misalignment between instructions and task requirements and (2) inconsistency in robot behaviors when they independently interpret ambiguous instructions. To address these challenges, we propose Instruction-Conditioned Coordinator (ICCO), a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework designed to enhance coordination in language-guided multi-robot systems. ICCO consists of a Coordinator agent and multiple Local Agents, where the Coordinator generates Task-Aligned and Consistent Instructions (TACI) by integrating language instructions with environmental states, ensuring task alignment and behavioral consistency. The Coordinator and Local Agents are jointly trained to optimize a reward function that balances task efficiency and instruction following. A Consistency Enhancement Term is added to the learning objective to maximize mutual information between instructions and robot behaviors, further improving coordination. Simulation and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of ICCO in achieving language-guided task-aligned multi-robot control.

<p>Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) have shown success in complex reasoning tasks for large language models (LLMs). However, their application to machine translation (MT) remains underexplored due to the lack of systematic methodologies and evaluation benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{MT-RewardTree}, a comprehensive framework for constructing, evaluating, and deploying process reward models in MT. Unlike traditional vanilla preference pair construction, we propose a novel method for automatically generating token-level preference pairs using approximate Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), which mitigates the prohibitive cost of human annotation for fine-grained steps. Then, we establish the first MT-specific reward model benchmark and provide a systematic comparison of different reward modeling architectures, revealing that token-level supervision effectively captures fine-grained preferences. Experimental results demonstrate that our MT-PRM-Qwen-2.5-3B achieves state-of-the-art performance in both token-level and sequence-level evaluation given the same input prefix. Furthermore, we showcase practical applications where PRMs enable test-time alignment for LLMs without additional alignment training and significantly improve performance in hypothesis ensembling.

<p>Abstract: Isolation Forest (iForest) is an unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm designed to effectively detect anomalies under the assumption that anomalies are ``few and different." Various studies have aimed to enhance iForest, but the resulting algorithms often exhibited significant performance disparities across datasets. Additionally, the challenge of isolating rare and widely distributed anomalies persisted in research focused on improving splits. To address these challenges, we introduce Robust iForest (RiForest). RiForest leverages both existing features and random hyperplanes obtained through soft sparse random projection to identify superior split features for anomaly detection, independent of datasets. It utilizes the underutilized valley emphasis method for optimal split point determination and incorporates sparsity randomization in soft sparse random projection for enhanced anomaly detection robustness. Across 24 benchmark datasets, experiments demonstrate RiForest's consistent outperformance of existing algorithms in anomaly detection, emphasizing stability and robustness to noise variables.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tobia Poppi, Tejaswi Kasarla, Pascal Mettes, Lorenzo Baraldi, Rita Cucchiara</p>
<p>Abstract: Addressing the retrieval of unsafe content from vision-language models such as CLIP is an important step towards real-world integration. Current efforts have relied on unlearning techniques that try to erase the model's knowledge of unsafe concepts. While effective in reducing unwanted outputs, unlearning limits the model's capacity to discern between safe and unsafe content. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that shifts from unlearning to an awareness paradigm by leveraging the inherent hierarchical properties of the hyperbolic space. We propose to encode safe and unsafe content as an entailment hierarchy, where both are placed in different regions of hyperbolic space. Our HySAC, Hyperbolic Safety-Aware CLIP, employs entailment loss functions to model the hierarchical and asymmetrical relations between safe and unsafe image-text pairs. This modelling, ineffective in standard vision-language models due to their reliance on Euclidean embeddings, endows the model with awareness of unsafe content, enabling it to serve as both a multimodal unsafe classifier and a flexible content retriever, with the option to dynamically redirect unsafe queries toward safer alternatives or retain the original output. Extensive experiments show that our approach not only enhances safety recognition but also establishes a more adaptable and interpretable framework for content moderation in vision-language models.

<p>Abstract: Recent works in cross-modal understanding and generation, notably through models like CLAP (Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining) and CAVP (Contrastive Audio-Visual Pretraining), have significantly enhanced the alignment of text, video, and audio embeddings via a single contrastive loss. However, these methods often overlook the bidirectional interactions and inherent noises present in each modality, which can crucially impact the quality and efficacy of cross-modal integration. To address this limitation, we introduce DiffGAP, a novel approach incorporating a lightweight generative module within the contrastive space. Specifically, our DiffGAP employs a bidirectional diffusion process tailored to bridge the cross-modal gap more effectively. This involves a denoising process on text and video embeddings conditioned on audio embeddings and vice versa, thus facilitating a more nuanced and robust cross-modal interaction. Our experimental results on VGGSound and AudioCaps datasets demonstrate that DiffGAP significantly improves performance in video/text-audio generation and retrieval tasks, confirming its effectiveness in enhancing cross-modal understanding and generation capabilities.</p>

<p>Abstract: Clinically acquired brain MRIs and radiology reports are valuable but underutilized resources due to the challenges of manual analysis and data heterogeneity. We developed fine-tuned language models (LMs) to classify brain MRI reports as normal (reports with limited pathology) or abnormal, fine-tuning BERT, BioBERT, ClinicalBERT, and RadBERT on 44,661 reports. We also explored the reasoning capabilities of a leading LM, Gemini 1.5-Pro, for normal report categorization. Automated image processing and modeling generated brain growth charts from LM-classified normal scans, comparing them to human-derived charts. Fine-tuned LMs achieved high classification performance (F1-Score >97%), with unbalanced training mitigating class imbalance. Performance was robust on out-of-distribution data, with full text outperforming summary (impression) sections. Gemini 1.5-Pro showed a promising categorization performance, especially with clinical inference. LM-derived brain growth charts were nearly identical to human-annotated charts (r = 0.99, p < 2.2e-16). Our LMs offer scalable analysis of radiology reports, enabling automated classification of brain MRIs in large datasets. One application is automated generation of brain growth charts for benchmarking quantitative image features. Further research is needed to address data heterogeneity and optimize LM reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tingting Wang, Jiaxin Su, Haobing Liu, Ruobing Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Node classification in graphs aims to predict the categories of unlabeled nodes by utilizing a small set of labeled nodes. However, weighted graphs often contain noisy edges and anomalous edge weights, which can distort fine-grained relationships between nodes and hinder accurate classification. We propose the Edge Weight-aware Graph Structure Learning (EWGSL) method, which combines weight learning and graph structure learning to address these issues. EWGSL improves node classification by redefining attention coefficients in graph attention networks to incorporate node features and edge weights. It also applies graph structure learning to sparsify attention coefficients and uses a modified InfoNCE loss function to enhance performance by adapting to denoised graph weights. Extensive experimental results show that EWGSL has an average Micro-F1 improvement of 17.8% compared with the best baseline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Milan Pape\v{z}, Martin Rektoris, V\'aclav \v{S}m\'idl, Tom\'a\v{s} Pevn\'y</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep generative models (DGMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable success in capturing complex probability distributions over graphs. Although their excellent performance is attributed to powerful and scalable deep neural networks, it is, at the same time, exactly the presence of these highly non-linear transformations that makes DGMs intractable. Indeed, despite representing probability distributions, intractable DGMs deny probabilistic foundations by their inability to answer even the most basic inference queries without approximations or design choices specific to a very narrow range of queries. To address this limitation, we propose probabilistic graph circuits (PGCs), a framework of tractable DGMs that provide exact and efficient probabilistic inference over (arbitrary parts of) graphs. Nonetheless, achieving both exactness and efficiency is challenging in the permutation-invariant setting of graphs. We design PGCs that are inherently invariant and satisfy these two requirements, yet at the cost of low expressive power. Therefore, we investigate two alternative strategies to achieve the invariance: the first sacrifices the efficiency, and the second sacrifices the exactness. We demonstrate that ignoring the permutation invariance can have severe consequences in anomaly detection, and that the latter approach is competitive with, and sometimes better than, existing intractable DGMs in the context of molecular graph generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nir Ailon, Akhiad Bercovich, Omri Weinstein</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a cheaper alternative bilinear operator to matrix-multiplication in deep neural networks (DNNs). Unlike many stubborn attempts to accelerate MatMuls in DNN inference, this operator is supported by capabilities of existing GPU hardware, most notably NVIDIA TensorCores. To our knowledge, this is the first GPU-native acceleration technique which \emph{does not decrease} (in fact, increases) the number of trainable parameters of the network, mitigating the accuracy-loss of compression-based techniques. Hence, this operator is at the same time more expressive than MatMul, yet requires substantially \emph{fewer} FLOPs to evaluate. We term this new operator \emph{Strassen-Tile} (STL).
  The main idea behind STL$(X,W)$ is a \emph{local} change-of-basis (learnable encoder) on weights and activation \emph{tiles}, after which we perform batched \emph{elementwise} products between tiles, and a final decoding transformation (inspired by algebraic pipelines from fast matrix and polynomial multiplication).
  We compare STL against two benchmarks. The first one is SoTA T2T-ViT on Imagenet-1K. Here we show that replacing \emph{all} linear layers with STL and training from scratch, results in factor x2.7 reduction in FLOPs with a 0.5 \emph{accuracy improvement}. Our second speed-accuracy comparison benchmark for pretrained LLMs is the most practical GPU-acceleration technique, \twofour structured Sparsity. Finetuning TinyLlama \cite{tinyllama24} with STL layers on the Slim Pajama dataset, achieves similar accuracy to 2:4, with x2.2 FLOP speedup compared to x1.7 of the latter.
  Finally, we discuss a group-theoretic approach for discovering \emph{universal} encoders for STL, which could lead to fast \emph{black-box} acceleration via approximate matrix-multiplication (AMM).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Natinael Solomon Neggatu, Jeremie Houssineau, Giovanni Montana</p>
<p>Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) looks at learning how to optimally solve tasks using a fixed dataset of interactions from the environment. Many off-policy algorithms developed for online learning struggle in the offline setting as they tend to over-estimate the behaviour of out of distributions actions. Existing offline RL algorithms adapt off-policy algorithms, employing techniques such as constraining the policy or modifying the value function to achieve good performance on individual datasets but struggle to adapt to different tasks or datasets of different qualities without tuning hyper-parameters. We introduce a policy switching technique that dynamically combines the behaviour of a pure off-policy RL agent, for improving behaviour, and a behavioural cloning (BC) agent, for staying close to the data. We achieve this by using a combination of epistemic uncertainty, quantified by our RL model, and a metric for aleatoric uncertainty extracted from the dataset. We show empirically that our policy switching technique can outperform not only the individual algorithms used in the switching process but also compete with state-of-the-art methods on numerous benchmarks. Our use of epistemic uncertainty for policy switching also allows us to naturally extend our method to the domain of offline to online fine-tuning allowing our model to adapt quickly and safely from online data, either matching or exceeding the performance of current methods that typically require additional modification or hyper-parameter fine-tuning.</p>

<p>Abstract: The fast development of large language models (LLMs) and popularization of cloud computing have led to increasing concerns on privacy safeguarding and data security of cross-cloud model deployment and training as the key challenges. We present a new framework for addressing these issues along with enabling privacy preserving collaboration on training between distributed clouds based on federated learning. Our mechanism encompasses cutting-edge cryptographic primitives, dynamic model aggregation techniques, and cross-cloud data harmonization solutions to enhance security, efficiency, and scalability to the traditional federated learning paradigm. Furthermore, we proposed a hybrid aggregation scheme to mitigate the threat of Data Leakage and to optimize the aggregation of model updates, thus achieving substantial enhancement on the model effectiveness and stability. Experimental results demonstrate that the training efficiency, privacy protection, and model accuracy of the proposed model compare favorably to those of the traditional federated learning method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihong Jin, Ze Yang, Xinhe Xu, Yihan Zhang, Shuyang Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their large-scale experimentation in cloud-computing spaces, the challenge of guaranteeing their security and efficiency in a failure scenario has become a main issue. To ensure the reliability and availability of large-scale language models in cloud computing scenarios, such as frequent resource failures, network problems, and computational overheads, this study proposes a novel adaptive fault tolerance mechanism. It builds upon known fault-tolerant mechanisms, such as checkpointing, redundancy, and state transposition, introducing dynamic resource allocation and prediction of failure based on real-time performance metrics. The hybrid model integrates data driven deep learning-based anomaly detection technique underlining the contribution of cloud orchestration middleware for predictive prevention of system failures. Additionally, the model integrates adaptive checkpointing and recovery strategies that dynamically adapt according to load and system state to minimize the influence on the performance of the model and minimize downtime. The experimental results demonstrate that the designed model considerably enhances the fault tolerance in large-scale cloud surroundings, and decreases the system downtime by $\mathbf{30\%}$, and has a better modeling availability than the classical fault tolerance mechanism.</p>

<p>Abstract: The availability of large language models and open-vocabulary object perception methods enables more flexibility for domestic service robots. The large variability of domestic tasks can be addressed without implementing each task individually by providing the robot with a task description along with appropriate environment information. In this work, we propose LIAM - an end-to-end model that predicts action transcripts based on language, image, action, and map inputs. Language and image inputs are encoded with a CLIP backbone, for which we designed two pre-training tasks to fine-tune its weights and pre-align the latent spaces. We evaluate our method on the ALFRED dataset, a simulator-generated benchmark for domestic tasks. Our results demonstrate the importance of pre-aligning embedding spaces from different modalities and the efficacy of incorporating semantic maps.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soufiane Bacha, Huansheng Ning, Belarbi Mostefa, Doreen Sebastian Sarwatt, Sahraoui Dhelim</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate illness diagnosis is vital for effective treatment and patient safety. Machine learning models are widely used for cancer diagnosis based on historical medical data. However, data imbalance remains a major challenge, leading to hindering classifier performance and reliability. The SMOTEBoost method addresses this issue by generating synthetic data to balance the dataset, but it may overlook crucial overlapping regions near the decision boundary and can produce noisy samples. This paper proposes RE-SMOTEBoost, an enhanced version of SMOTEBoost, designed to overcome these limitations. Firstly, RE-SMOTEBoost focuses on generating synthetic samples in overlapping regions to better capture the decision boundary using roulette wheel selection. Secondly, it incorporates a filtering mechanism based on information entropy to reduce noise, and borderline cases and improve the quality of generated data. Thirdly, we introduce a double regularization penalty to control the synthetic samples proximity to the decision boundary and avoid class overlap. These enhancements enable higher-quality oversampling of the minority class, resulting in a more balanced and effective training dataset. The proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques when evaluated on imbalanced datasets. Compared to the top-performing sampling algorithms, RE-SMOTEBoost demonstrates a notable improvement of 3.22\% in accuracy and a variance reduction of 88.8\%. These results indicate that the proposed model offers a solid solution for medical settings, effectively overcoming data scarcity and severe imbalance caused by limited samples, data collection difficulties, and privacy constraints.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mumuksh Tayal, Manan Tayal, Ravi Prakash</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring safe and generalizable control remains a fundamental challenge in robotics, particularly when deploying imitation learning in dynamic environments. Traditional behavior cloning (BC) struggles to generalize beyond its training distribution, as it lacks an understanding of the safety critical reasoning behind expert demonstrations. To address this limitation, we propose GenOSIL, a novel imitation learning framework that explicitly incorporates environment parameters into policy learning via a structured latent representation. Unlike conventional methods that treat the environment as a black box, GenOSIL employs a variational autoencoder (VAE) to encode measurable safety parameters such as obstacle position, velocity, and geometry into a latent space that captures intrinsic correlations between expert behavior and environmental constraints. This enables the policy to infer the rationale behind expert trajectories rather than merely replicating them. We validate our approach on two robotic platforms an autonomous ground vehicle and a Franka Emika Panda manipulator demonstrating superior safety and goal reaching performance compared to baseline methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdelrahman Elewah, Khalid Elgazzar</p>
<p>Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) has enabled diverse devices to communicate over the Internet, yet the fragmentation of IoT systems limits seamless data sharing and coordinated management. We have recently introduced SensorsConnect, a unified framework to enable seamless content and sensor data sharing in collaborative IoT systems, inspired by how the World Wide Web (WWW) enabled a shared and accessible space for information among humans. This paper presents the IoT Agentic Search Engine (IoT-ASE), a real-time search engine tailored for IoT environments. IoT-ASE leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to address the challenge of searching vast, real-time IoT data, enabling it to handle complex queries and deliver accurate, contextually relevant results. We implemented a use-case scenario in Toronto to demonstrate how IoT-ASE can improve service quality recommendations by leveraging real-time IoT data. Our evaluation shows that IoT-ASE achieves a 92\% accuracy in retrieving intent-based services and produces responses that are concise, relevant, and context-aware, outperforming generalized responses from systems like Gemini. These findings highlight the potential IoT-ASE to make real-time IoT data accessible and support effective, real-time decision-making.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liying Han, Gaofeng Dong, Xiaomin Ouyang, Lance Kaplan, Federico Cerutti, Mani Srivastava</p>
<p>Abstract: Complex events (CEs) play a crucial role in CPS-IoT applications, enabling high-level decision-making in domains such as smart monitoring and autonomous systems. However, most existing models focus on short-span perception tasks, lacking the long-term reasoning required for CE detection. CEs consist of sequences of short-time atomic events (AEs) governed by spatiotemporal dependencies. Detecting them is difficult due to long, noisy sensor data and the challenge of filtering out irrelevant AEs while capturing meaningful patterns. This work explores CE detection as a case study for CPS-IoT foundation models capable of long-term reasoning. We evaluate three approaches: (1) leveraging large language models (LLMs), (2) employing various neural architectures that learn CE rules from data, and (3) adopting a neurosymbolic approach that integrates neural models with symbolic engines embedding human knowledge. Our results show that the state-space model, Mamba, which belongs to the second category, outperforms all methods in accuracy and generalization to longer, unseen sensor traces. These findings suggest that state-space models could be a strong backbone for CPS-IoT foundation models for long-span reasoning tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vaneet Aggarwal, Shweta Jain, Subham Pokhriyal, Christopher John Quinn</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we study bi-criteria optimization for combinatorial multi-armed bandits (CMAB) with bandit feedback. We propose a general framework that transforms discrete bi-criteria offline approximation algorithms into online algorithms with sublinear regret and cumulative constraint violation (CCV) guarantees. Our framework requires the offline algorithm to provide an $(\alpha, \beta)$-bi-criteria approximation ratio with $\delta$-resilience and utilize $\texttt{N}$ oracle calls to evaluate the objective and constraint functions. We prove that the proposed framework achieves sub-linear regret and CCV, with both bounds scaling as ${O}\left(\delta^{2/3} \texttt{N}^{1/3}T^{2/3}\log^{1/3}(T)\right)$. Crucially, the framework treats the offline algorithm with $\delta$-resilience as a black box, enabling flexible integration of existing approximation algorithms into the CMAB setting. To demonstrate its versatility, we apply our framework to several combinatorial problems, including submodular cover, submodular cost covering, and fair submodular maximization. These applications highlight the framework's broad utility in adapting offline guarantees to online bi-criteria optimization under bandit feedback.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Da Wu, Zhanliang Wang, Quan Nguyen, Kai Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Background: Several studies show that large language models (LLMs) struggle with phenotype-driven gene prioritization for rare diseases. These studies typically use Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms to prompt foundation models like GPT and LLaMA to predict candidate genes. However, in real-world settings, foundation models are not optimized for domain-specific tasks like clinical diagnosis, yet inputs are unstructured clinical notes rather than standardized terms. How LLMs can be instructed to predict candidate genes or disease diagnosis from unstructured clinical notes remains a major challenge. Methods: We introduce RAG-driven CoT and CoT-driven RAG, two methods that combine Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to analyze clinical notes. A five-question CoT protocol mimics expert reasoning, while RAG retrieves data from sources like HPO and OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man). We evaluated these approaches on rare disease datasets, including 5,980 Phenopacket-derived notes, 255 literature-based narratives, and 220 in-house clinical notes from Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia. Results: We found that recent foundations models, including Llama 3.3-70B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B, outperformed earlier versions such as Llama 2 and GPT-3.5. We also showed that RAG-driven CoT and CoT-driven RAG both outperform foundation models in candidate gene prioritization from clinical notes; in particular, both methods with DeepSeek backbone resulted in a top-10 gene accuracy of over 40% on Phenopacket-derived clinical notes. RAG-driven CoT works better for high-quality notes, where early retrieval can anchor the subsequent reasoning steps in domain-specific evidence, while CoT-driven RAG has advantage when processing lengthy and noisy notes.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present both the Lucie Training Dataset and the Lucie-7B foundation model. The Lucie Training Dataset is a multilingual collection of textual corpora centered around French and designed to offset anglo-centric biases found in many datasets for large language model pretraining. Its French data is pulled not only from traditional web sources, but also from French cultural heritage documents, filling an important gap in modern datasets. Beyond French, which makes up the largest share of the data, we added documents to support several other European languages, including English, Spanish, German, and Italian. Apart from its value as a resource for French language and culture, an important feature of this dataset is that it prioritizes data rights by minimizing copyrighted material. In addition, building on the philosophy of past open projects, it is redistributed in the form used for training and its processing is described on Hugging Face and GitHub. The Lucie-7B foundation model is trained on equal amounts of data in French and English -- roughly 33% each -- in an effort to better represent cultural aspects of French-speaking communities. We also describe two instruction fine-tuned models, Lucie-7B-Instruct-v1.1 and Lucie-7B-Instruct-human-data, which we release as demonstrations of Lucie-7B in use. These models achieve promising results compared to state-of-the-art models, demonstrating that an open approach prioritizing data rights can still deliver strong performance. We see these models as an initial step toward developing more performant, aligned models in the near future. Model weights for Lucie-7B and the Lucie instruct models, along with intermediate checkpoints for the former, are published on Hugging Face, while model training and data preparation code is available on GitHub. This makes Lucie-7B one of the first OSI compliant language models according to the new OSI definition.</p>

<p>Abstract: Novel view synthesis has long been a practical but challenging task, although the introduction of numerous methods to solve this problem, even combining advanced representations like 3D Gaussian Splatting, they still struggle to recover high-quality results and often consume too much storage memory and training time. In this paper we propose Swift4D, a divide-and-conquer 3D Gaussian Splatting method that can handle static and dynamic primitives separately, achieving a good trade-off between rendering quality and efficiency, motivated by the fact that most of the scene is the static primitive and does not require additional dynamic properties. Concretely, we focus on modeling dynamic transformations only for the dynamic primitives which benefits both efficiency and quality. We first employ a learnable decomposition strategy to separate the primitives, which relies on an additional parameter to classify primitives as static or dynamic. For the dynamic primitives, we employ a compact multi-resolution 4D Hash mapper to transform these primitives from canonical space into deformation space at each timestamp, and then mix the static and dynamic primitives to produce the final output. This divide-and-conquer method facilitates efficient training and reduces storage redundancy. Our method not only achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality while being 20X faster in training than previous SOTA methods with a minimum storage requirement of only 30MB on real-world datasets.

<p>Abstract: Automated data extraction from research texts has been steadily improving, with the emergence of large language models (LLMs) accelerating progress even further. Extracting data from plots in research papers, however, has been such a complex task that it has predominantly been confined to manual data extraction. We show that current multimodal large language models, with proper instructions and engineered workflows, are capable of accurately extracting data from plots. This capability is inherent to the pretrained models and can be achieved with a chain-of-thought sequence of zero-shot engineered prompts we call PlotExtract, without the need to fine-tune. We demonstrate PlotExtract here and assess its performance on synthetic and published plots. We consider only plots with two axes in this analysis. For plots identified as extractable, PlotExtract finds points with over 90% precision (and around 90% recall) and errors in x and y position of around 5% or lower. These results prove that multimodal LLMs are a viable path for high-throughput data extraction for plots and in many circumstances can replace the current manual methods of data extraction.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose a novel dual-loop system that synergistically combines responsive neurostimulation (RNS) implants with artificial intelligence-driven wearable devices for treating post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and enabling naturalistic brain research. In PTSD Therapy Mode, an implanted closed-loop neural device monitors amygdala activity and provides on-demand stimulation upon detecting pathological theta oscillations, while an ensemble of wearables (smart glasses, smartwatches, smartphones) uses multimodal large language model (LLM) analysis of sensory data to detect environmental or physiological PTSD triggers and deliver timely audiovisual interventions. Logged events from both the neural and wearable loops are analyzed to personalize trigger detection and progressively transition patients to non-invasive interventions. In Neuroscience Research Mode, the same platform is adapted for real-world brain activity capture. Wearable-LLM systems recognize naturalistic events (social interactions, emotional situations, compulsive behaviors, decision making) and signal implanted RNS devices (via wireless triggers) to record synchronized intracranial data during these moments. This approach builds on recent advances in mobile intracranial EEG recording and closed-loop neuromodulation in humans (BRAIN Initiative, 2023) (Mobbs et al., 2021). We discuss how our interdisciplinary system could revolutionize PTSD therapy and cognitive neuroscience by enabling 24/7 monitoring, context-aware intervention, and rich data collection outside traditional labs. The vision is a future where AI-enhanced devices continuously collaborate with the human brain, offering therapeutic support and deep insights into neural function, with the resulting real-world context rich neural data, in turn, accelerating the development of more biologically-grounded and human-centric AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhe Wang, Yanjun Qi</p>
<p>Abstract: Gradient optimization-based adversarial attack methods automate the learning of adversarial triggers to generate jailbreak prompts or leak system prompts. In this work, we take a closer look at the optimization objective of adversarial trigger learning and propose ATLA: Adversarial Trigger Learning with Augmented objectives. ATLA improves the negative log-likelihood loss used by previous studies into a weighted loss formulation that encourages the learned adversarial triggers to optimize more towards response format tokens. This enables ATLA to learn an adversarial trigger from just one query-response pair and the learned trigger generalizes well to other similar queries. We further design a variation to augment trigger optimization with an auxiliary loss that suppresses evasive responses. We showcase how to use ATLA to learn adversarial suffixes jailbreaking LLMs and to extract hidden system prompts. Empirically we demonstrate that ATLA consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques, achieving nearly 100% success in attacking while requiring 80% fewer queries. ATLA learned jailbreak suffixes demonstrate high generalization to unseen queries and transfer well to new LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhongyuan Wang, Richong Zhang, Zhijie Nie</p>
<p>Abstract: Advanced table question answering (TableQA) methods prompt large language models (LLMs) to generate answer text, SQL query, Python code, or custom operations, which impressively improve the complex reasoning problems in the TableQA task. However, these methods lack the versatility to cope with specific question types or table structures. In contrast, the Spreadsheet Formula, the widely-used and well-defined operation language for tabular data, has not been thoroughly explored to solve TableQA. In this paper, we first attempt to use Formula as the logical form for solving complex reasoning on the tables with different structures. Specifically, we construct a large Formula-annotated TableQA dataset \texttt{FromulaQA} from existing datasets. In addition, we propose \texttt{TabAF}, a general table answering framework to solve multiple types of tasks over multiple types of tables simultaneously. Unlike existing methods, \texttt{TabAF} decodes answers and Formulas with a single LLM backbone, demonstrating great versatility and generalization. \texttt{TabAF} based on Llama3.1-70B achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the WikiTableQuestion, HiTab and TabFact.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aditi Godbole</p>
<p>Abstract: In today's business landscape, organizations need to find the right balance between using their customers' data ethically to power AI solutions and being compliant regarding data privacy and data usage regulations. In this paper, we discuss synthetic data as a possible solution to this dilemma. Synthetic data is simulated data that mimics the real data. We explore how organizations in heavily regulated industries, such as financial institutions or healthcare organizations, can leverage synthetic data to build robust AI solutions while staying compliant. We demonstrate that synthetic data offers two significant advantages by allowing AI models to learn from more diverse data and by helping organizations stay compliant against data privacy laws with the use of synthetic data instead of customer information. We discuss case studies to show how synthetic data can be effectively used in the finance and healthcare sector while discussing the challenges of using synthetic data and some ethical questions it raises. Our research finds that synthetic data could be a game-changer for AI in regulated industries. The potential can be realized when industry, academia, and regulators collaborate to build solutions. We aim to initiate discussions on the use of synthetic data to build ethical, responsible, and effective AI systems in regulated enterprise industries.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Byung Hyun Lee, Sungjin Lim, Se Young Chun</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning based concept erasing has demonstrated promising results in preventing generation of harmful contents from text-to-image diffusion models by removing target concepts while preserving remaining concepts. To maintain the generation capability of diffusion models after concept erasure, it is necessary to remove only the image region containing the target concept when it locally appears in an image, leaving other regions intact. However, prior arts often compromise fidelity of the other image regions in order to erase the localized target concept appearing in a specific area, thereby reducing the overall performance of image generation. To address these limitations, we first introduce a framework called localized concept erasure, which allows for the deletion of only the specific area containing the target concept in the image while preserving the other regions. As a solution for the localized concept erasure, we propose a training-free approach, dubbed Gated Low-rank adaptation for Concept Erasure (GLoCE), that injects a lightweight module into the diffusion model. GLoCE consists of low-rank matrices and a simple gate, determined only by several generation steps for concepts without training. By directly applying GLoCE to image embeddings and designing the gate to activate only for target concepts, GLoCE can selectively remove only the region of the target concepts, even when target and remaining concepts coexist within an image. Extensive experiments demonstrated GLoCE not only improves the image fidelity to text prompts after erasing the localized target concepts, but also outperforms prior arts in efficacy, specificity, and robustness by large margin and can be extended to mass concept erasure.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhi Chen, Wei Ma, Lingxiao Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: AI-driven software development has rapidly advanced with the emergence of software development agents that leverage large language models (LLMs) to tackle complex, repository-level software engineering tasks. These agents go beyond just generation of final code; they engage in multi-step reasoning, utilize various tools for code modification and debugging, and interact with execution environments to diagnose and iteratively resolve issues. However, most existing evaluations focus primarily on static analyses of final code outputs, yielding limited insights into the agents' dynamic problem-solving processes. To fill this gap, we conduct an in-depth empirical study on 3,977 solving-phase trajectories and 3,931 testing-phase logs from 8 top-ranked agents evaluated on 500 GitHub issues in the SWE-Bench benchmark. Our exploratory analysis shows that Python execution errors during the issue resolution phase correlate with lower resolution rates and increased reasoning overheads. We have identified the most prevalent errors -- such as ModuleNotFoundError and TypeError -- and highlighted particularly challenging errors like OSError and database-related issues (e.g., IntegrityError) that demand significantly more debugging effort. Furthermore, we have discovered 3 bugs in the SWE-Bench platform that affect benchmark fairness and accuracy; these issues have been reported to and confirmed by the maintainers. To promote transparency and foster future research, we publicly share our datasets and analysis scripts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Binggwong Leung, Worasuchad Haomachai, Joachim Winther Pedersen, Sebastian Risi, Poramate Manoonpong</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial neural networks can be used to solve a variety of robotic tasks. However, they risk failing catastrophically when faced with out-of-distribution (OOD) situations. Several approaches have employed a type of synaptic plasticity known as Hebbian learning that can dynamically adjust weights based on local neural activities. Research has shown that synaptic plasticity can make policies more robust and help them adapt to unforeseen changes in the environment. However, networks augmented with Hebbian learning can lead to weight divergence, resulting in network instability. Furthermore, such Hebbian networks have not yet been applied to solve legged locomotion in complex real robots with many degrees of freedom. In this work, we improve the Hebbian network with a weight normalization mechanism for preventing weight divergence, analyze the principal components of the Hebbian's weights, and perform a thorough evaluation of network performance in locomotion control for real 18-DOF dung beetle-like and 16-DOF gecko-like robots. We find that the Hebbian-based plastic network can execute zero-shot sim-to-real adaptation locomotion and generalize to unseen conditions, such as uneven terrain and morphological damage.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bocheng Wang, Chusheng Zeng, Mulin Chen, Xuelong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep multi-view clustering incorporating graph learning has presented tremendous potential. Most methods encounter costly square time consumption w.r.t. data size. Theoretically, anchor-based graph learning can alleviate this limitation, but related deep models mainly rely on manual discretization approaches to select anchors, which indicates that 1) the anchors are fixed during model training and 2) they may deviate from the true cluster distribution. Consequently, the unreliable anchors may corrupt clustering results. In this paper, we propose the Deep Multi-view Anchor Clustering (DMAC) model that performs clustering in linear time. Concretely, the initial anchors are intervened by the positive-incentive noise sampled from Gaussian distribution, such that they can be optimized with a newly designed anchor learning loss, which promotes a clear relationship between samples and anchors. Afterwards, anchor graph convolution is devised to model the cluster structure formed by the anchors, and the mutual information maximization loss is built to provide cross-view clustering guidance. In this way, the learned anchors can better represent clusters. With the optimal anchors, the full sample graph is calculated to derive a discriminative embedding for clustering. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate the superior performance and efficiency of DMAC compared to state-of-the-art competitors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianle Li, Yongming Rao, Winston Hu, Yu Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Encoder-free multimodal large language models(MLLMs) eliminate the need for a well-trained vision encoder by directly processing image tokens before the language model. While this approach reduces computational overhead and model complexity, it often requires large amounts of training data to effectively capture the visual knowledge typically encoded by vision models like CLIP. The absence of a vision encoder implies that the model is likely to rely on substantial data to learn the necessary visual-semantic alignments. In this work, we present BREEN, a data-efficient encoder-free multimodal architecture that mitigates this issue. BREEN leverages a learnable query and image experts to achieve comparable performance with significantly less training data. The learnable query, positioned between image and text tokens, is supervised by the output of a pretrained CLIP model to distill visual knowledge, bridging the gap between visual and textual modalities. Additionally, the image expert processes image tokens and learnable queries independently, improving efficiency and reducing interference with the LLM's textual capabilities. BREEN achieves comparable performance to prior encoder-free state-of-the-art models like Mono-InternVL, using only 13 million text-image pairs in training about one percent of the data required by existing methods. Our work highlights a promising direction for data-efficient encoder-free multimodal learning, offering an alternative to traditional encoder-based approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Li Yicong</p>
<p>Abstract: After a decade of prosperity, the development of video understanding has reached a critical juncture, where the sole reliance on massive data and complex architectures is no longer a one-size-fits-all solution to all situations. The presence of ubiquitous data imbalance hampers DNNs from effectively learning the underlying causal mechanisms, leading to significant performance drops when encountering distribution shifts, such as long-tail imbalances and perturbed imbalances. This realization has prompted researchers to seek alternative methodologies to capture causal patterns in video data. To tackle these challenges and increase the robustness of DNNs, causal modeling emerged as a principle to discover the true causal patterns behind the observed correlations. This thesis focuses on the domain of semantic video understanding and explores the potential of causal modeling to advance two fundamental tasks: Video Relation Detection (VidVRD) and Video Question Answering (VideoQA).</p>

<p>Abstract: Sign language recognition involves modeling complex multichannel information, such as hand shapes and movements while relying on sufficient sign language-specific data. However, sign languages are often under-resourced, posing a significant challenge for research and development in this field. To address this gap, we introduce ISLR101, the first publicly available Iranian Sign Language dataset for isolated sign language recognition. This comprehensive dataset includes 4,614 videos covering 101 distinct signs, recorded by 10 different signers (3 deaf individuals, 2 sign language interpreters, and 5 L2 learners) against varied backgrounds, with a resolution of 800x600 pixels and a frame rate of 25 frames per second. It also includes skeleton pose information extracted using OpenPose. We establish both a visual appearance-based and a skeleton-based framework as baseline models, thoroughly training and evaluating them on ISLR101. These models achieve 97.01% and 94.02% accuracy on the test set, respectively. Additionally, we publish the train, validation, and test splits to facilitate fair comparisons.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyu Liang, Dongrui Cai, Chenyuan Zhang, Zheng Liang, Chen Liang, Bo Zheng, Shi Qiu, Jin Wang, Hongzhi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Model selection has been raised as an essential problem in the area of time series anomaly detection (TSAD), because there is no single best TSAD model for the highly heterogeneous time series in real-world applications. However, despite the success of existing model selection solutions that train a classification model (especially neural network, NN) using historical data as a selector to predict the correct TSAD model for each series, the NN-based selector learning methods used by existing solutions do not make full use of the knowledge in the historical data and require iterating over all training samples, which limits the accuracy and training speed of the selector. To address these limitations, we propose KDSelector, a novel knowledge-enhanced and data-efficient framework for learning the NN-based TSAD model selector, of which three key components are specifically designed to integrate available knowledge into the selector and dynamically prune less important and redundant samples during the learning. We develop a TSAD model selection system with KDSelector as the internal, to demonstrate how users improve the accuracy and training speed of their selectors by using KDSelector as a plug-and-play module.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiakang Chen, Selim F. Yilmaz, Di You, Pier Luigi Dragotti, Deniz G\"und\"uz</p>
<p>Abstract: Joint source-channel coding systems based on deep neural networks (DeepJSCC) have recently demonstrated remarkable performance in wireless image transmission. Existing methods primarily focus on minimizing distortion between the transmitted image and the reconstructed version at the receiver, often overlooking perceptual quality. This can lead to severe perceptual degradation when transmitting images under extreme conditions, such as low bandwidth compression ratios (BCRs) and low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). In this work, we propose SING, a novel two-stage JSCC framework that formulates the recovery of high-quality source images from corrupted reconstructions as an inverse problem. Depending on the availability of information about the DeepJSCC encoder/decoder and the channel at the receiver, SING can either approximate the stochastic degradation as a linear transformation, or leverage invertible neural networks (INNs) for precise modeling. Both approaches enable the seamless integration of diffusion models into the reconstruction process, enhancing perceptual quality. Experimental results demonstrate that SING outperforms DeepJSCC and other approaches, delivering superior perceptual quality even under extremely challenging conditions, including scenarios with significant distribution mismatches between the training and test data.</p>

<p>Abstract: The application of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in remote sensing (RS) has demonstrated significant potential in traditional tasks such as scene classification, object detection, and image captioning. However, current models, which excel in Referring Expression Comprehension (REC), struggle with tasks involving complex instructions (e.g., exists multiple conditions) or pixel-level operations like segmentation and change detection. In this white paper, we provide a comprehensive hierarchical summary of vision-language tasks in RS, categorized by the varying levels of cognitive capability required. We introduce the Remote Sensing Vision-Language Task Set (RSVLTS), which includes Open-Vocabulary Tasks (OVT), Referring Expression Tasks (RET), and Described Object Tasks (DOT) with increased difficulty, and Visual Question Answering (VQA) aloneside. Moreover, we propose a novel unified data representation using a set-of-points approach for RSVLTS, along with a condition parser and a self-augmentation strategy based on cyclic referring. These features are integrated into the GeoRSMLLM model, and this enhanced model is designed to handle a broad range of tasks of RSVLTS, paving the way for a more generalized solution for vision-language tasks in geoscience and remote sensing.</p>

<p>Abstract: Malicious users attempt to replicate commercial models functionally at low cost by training a clone model with query responses. It is challenging to timely prevent such model-stealing attacks to achieve strong protection and maintain utility. In this paper, we propose a novel non-parametric detector called Account-aware Distribution Discrepancy (ADD) to recognize queries from malicious users by leveraging account-wise local dependency. We formulate each class as a Multivariate Normal distribution (MVN) in the feature space and measure the malicious score as the sum of weighted class-wise distribution discrepancy. The ADD detector is combined with random-based prediction poisoning to yield a plug-and-play defense module named D-ADD for image classification models. Results of extensive experimental studies show that D-ADD achieves strong defense against different types of attacks with little interference in serving benign users for both soft and hard-label settings.</p>

Effective facilitation is crucial to support the consensus building process and enable efficient group decision making. However, the effectiveness of facilitation is often constrained by human factors such as limited experience and scalability. In this research, we propose a Parallel Thinking-based Facilitation Agent (PTFA) that facilitates online, text-based consensus building processes. The PTFA automatically collects textual posts and leverages large language models (LLMs) to perform all of the six distinct roles of the well-established Six Thinking Hats technique in parallel thinking. To illustrate the potential of PTFA, a pilot study was carried out and PTFA's ability in idea generation, emotional probing, and deeper analysis of ideas was demonstrated. Furthermore, a comprehensive dataset that contains not only the conversational content among the participants but also between the participants and the agent is constructed for future study.</p>

<p>Abstract: Rhythm is a fundamental aspect of human behaviour, present from infancy and deeply embedded in cultural practices. Rhythm anticipation is a spontaneous cognitive process that typically occurs before the onset of actual beats. While most research in both neuroscience and artificial intelligence has focused on metronome-based rhythm tasks, studies investigating the perception of complex musical rhythm patterns remain limited. To address this gap, we propose a hierarchical oscillator-based model to better understand the perception of complex musical rhythms in biological systems. The model consists of two types of coupled neurons that generate oscillations, with different layers tuned to respond to distinct perception levels. We evaluate the model using several representative rhythm patterns spanning the upper, middle, and lower bounds of human musical perception. Our findings demonstrate that, while maintaining a high degree of synchronization accuracy, the model exhibits human-like rhythmic behaviours. Additionally, the beta band neuronal activity in the model mirrors patterns observed in the human brain, further validating the biological plausibility of the approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyang Zhou, Haowen Lin, Somesh Jha, Mihai Christodorescu, Kirill Levchenko, Varun Chandrasekaran</p>
<p>Abstract: Translating software written in legacy languages to modern languages, such as C to Rust, has significant benefits in improving memory safety while maintaining high performance. However, manual translation is cumbersome, error-prone, and produces unidiomatic code. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promise in producing idiomatic translations, but offer no correctness guarantees as they lack the ability to capture all the semantics differences between the source and target languages. To resolve this issue, we propose SACTOR, an LLM-driven C-to-Rust zero-shot translation tool using a two-step translation methodology: an "unidiomatic" step to translate C into Rust while preserving semantics, and an "idiomatic" step to refine the code to follow Rust's semantic standards. SACTOR utilizes information provided by static analysis of the source C program to address challenges such as pointer semantics and dependency resolution. To validate the correctness of the translated result from each step, we use end-to-end testing via the foreign function interface to embed our translated code segment into the original code. We evaluate the translation of 200 programs from two datasets and two case studies, comparing the performance of GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.0 Flash, Llama 3.3 70B and DeepSeek-R1 in SACTOR. Our results demonstrate that SACTOR achieves high correctness and improved idiomaticity, with the best-performing model (DeepSeek-R1) reaching 93% and (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, DeepSeek-R1) reaching 84% correctness (on each dataset, respectively), while producing more natural and Rust-compliant translations compared to existing methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in explainable AI methods. We want not only to make accurate predictions using sophisticated neural networks but also to understand what the model's decision is based on. One of the fundamental levels of interpretability is to provide counterfactual examples explaining the rationale behind the decision and identifying which features, and to what extent, must be modified to alter the model's outcome. To address these requirements, we introduce HyConEx, a classification model based on deep hypernetworks specifically designed for tabular data. Owing to its unique architecture, HyConEx not only provides class predictions but also delivers local interpretations for individual data samples in the form of counterfactual examples that steer a given sample toward an alternative class. While many explainable methods generated counterfactuals for external models, there have been no interpretable classifiers simultaneously producing counterfactual samples so far. HyConEx achieves competitive performance on several metrics assessing classification accuracy and fulfilling the criteria of a proper counterfactual attack. This makes HyConEx a distinctive deep learning model, which combines predictions and explainers as an all-in-one neural network. The code is available at https://github.com/gmum/HyConEx.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fanbin Lu, Zhisheng Zhong, Ziqin Wei, Shu Liu, Chi-Wing Fu, Jiaya Jia</p>
<p>Abstract: Developing AI agents to autonomously manipulate graphical user interfaces is a long challenging task. Recent advances in data scaling law inspire us to train computer-use agents with a scaled instruction set, yet using behavior cloning to train agents still requires immense high-quality trajectories. To meet the scalability need, we designed STEVE, a step verification pipeline for computer-use agent training. First, we establish a large instruction set for computer-use agents and collect trajectory data with some suboptimal agents. GPT-4o is used to verify the correctness of each step in the trajectories based on the screens before and after the action execution, assigning each step with a binary label. Last, we adopt the Kahneman and Tversky Optimization to optimize the agent from the binary stepwise labels. Extensive experiments manifest that our agent outperforms supervised finetuning by leveraging both positive and negative actions within a trajectory. Also, STEVE enables us to train a 7B vision-language model as a computer-use agent, achieving leading performance in the challenging live desktop environment WinAgentArena with great efficiency at a reduced cost.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander Koebler, Ralf Gross, Florian Buettner, Ingo Thon</p>
<p>Abstract: Flexible industrial production systems will play a central role in the future of manufacturing due to higher product individualization and customization. A key component in such systems is the robotic grasping of known or unknown objects in random positions. Real-world applications often come with challenges that might not be considered in grasping solutions tested in simulation or lab settings. Partial occlusion of the target object is the most prominent. Examples of occlusion can be supporting structures in the camera's field of view, sensor imprecision, or parts occluding each other due to the production process. In all these cases, the resulting lack of information leads to shortcomings in calculating grasping points. In this paper, we present an algorithm to reconstruct the missing information. Our inpainting solution facilitates the real-world utilization of robust object matching approaches for grasping point calculation. We demonstrate the benefit of our solution by enabling an existing grasping system embedded in a real-world industrial application to handle occlusions in the input. With our solution, we drastically decrease the number of objects discarded by the process.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sarvesh Baskar, Tanmay Tulsidas Verelakar, Srinivasan Parthasarathy, Manas Gaur</p>
<p>Abstract: In multi-turn dialogues, large language models (LLM) face a critical challenge of ensuring coherence while adapting to user-specific information. This study introduces the persona knowledge gap, the discrepancy between a model's internal understanding and the knowledge required for coherent, personalized conversations. While prior research has recognized these gaps, computational methods for their identification and resolution remain underexplored. We propose Conversation Preference Elicitation and Recommendation (CPER), a novel framework that dynamically detects and resolves persona knowledge gaps using intrinsic uncertainty quantification and feedback-driven refinement. CPER consists of three key modules: a Contextual Understanding Module for preference extraction, a Dynamic Feedback Module for measuring uncertainty and refining persona alignment, and a Persona-Driven Response Generation module for adapting responses based on accumulated user context. We evaluate CPER on two real-world datasets: CCPE-M for preferential movie recommendations and ESConv for mental health support. Using A/B testing, human evaluators preferred CPER's responses 42% more often than baseline models in CCPE-M and 27% more often in ESConv. A qualitative human evaluation confirms that CPER's responses are preferred for maintaining contextual relevance and coherence, particularly in longer (12+ turn) conversations.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present Deblur-SLAM, a robust RGB SLAM pipeline designed to recover sharp reconstructions from motion-blurred inputs. The proposed method bridges the strengths of both frame-to-frame and frame-to-model approaches to model sub-frame camera trajectories that lead to high-fidelity reconstructions in motion-blurred settings. Moreover, our pipeline incorporates techniques such as online loop closure and global bundle adjustment to achieve a dense and precise global trajectory. We model the physical image formation process of motion-blurred images and minimize the error between the observed blurry images and rendered blurry images obtained by averaging sharp virtual sub-frame images. Additionally, by utilizing a monocular depth estimator alongside the online deformation of Gaussians, we ensure precise mapping and enhanced image deblurring. The proposed SLAM pipeline integrates all these components to improve the results. We achieve state-of-the-art results for sharp map estimation and sub-frame trajectory recovery both on synthetic and real-world blurry input data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dipesh Tamboli, Souradip Chakraborty, Aditya Malusare, Biplab Banerjee, Amrit Singh Bedi, Vaneet Aggarwal</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have made remarkable advancements, yet aligning them with diverse preferences remains a persistent challenge. Current methods often optimize single metrics or depend on narrowly curated datasets, leading to overfitting and limited generalization across key visual quality metrics. We present BalancedDPO, a novel extension of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) that addresses these limitations by simultaneously aligning T2I diffusion models with multiple metrics, including human preference, CLIP score, and aesthetic quality. Our key novelty lies in aggregating consensus labels from diverse metrics in the preference distribution space as compared to existing reward mixing approaches, enabling robust and scalable multi-metric alignment while maintaining the simplicity of the standard DPO pipeline that we refer to as BalancedDPO. Our evaluations on the Pick-a-Pic, PartiPrompt and HPD datasets show that BalancedDPO achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming existing approaches across all major metrics. BalancedDPO improves the average win rates by 15%, 7.1%, and 10.3% on Pick-a-pic, PartiPrompt and HPD, respectively, from the DiffusionDPO.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b>  Harshit</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) development has become increasingly centralized, limiting participation to well-resourced organizations. This paper introduces MoECollab, a novel framework leveraging Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture to enable distributed, collaborative LLM development. By decomposing monolithic models into specialized expert modules coordinated by a trainable gating network, our framework allows diverse contributors to participate regardless of computational resources. We provide a complete technical implementation with mathematical foundations for expert dynamics, gating mechanisms, and integration strategies. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves accuracy improvements of 3-7% over baseline models while reducing computational requirements by 34%. Expert specialization yields significant domain-specific gains, with improvements from 51% to 88% F1 score in general classification and from 23% to 44% accuracy in news categorization. We formalize the routing entropy optimization problem and demonstrate how proper regularization techniques lead to 14% higher expert utilization rates. These results validate MoECollab as an effective approach for democratizing LLM development through architecturally-supported collaboration.</p>

<p>Abstract: High-resolution tissue imaging is often compromised by sample-induced optical aberrations that degrade resolution and contrast. While wavefront sensor-based adaptive optics (AO) can measure these aberrations, such hardware solutions are typically complex, expensive to implement, and slow when serially mapping spatially varying aberrations across large fields of view. Here, we introduce AOViFT (Adaptive Optical Vision Fourier Transformer) -- a machine learning-based aberration sensing framework built around a 3D multistage Vision Transformer that operates on Fourier domain embeddings. AOViFT infers aberrations and restores diffraction-limited performance in puncta-labeled specimens with substantially reduced computational cost, training time, and memory footprint compared to conventional architectures or real-space networks. We validated AOViFT on live gene-edited zebrafish embryos, demonstrating its ability to correct spatially varying aberrations using either a deformable mirror or post-acquisition deconvolution. By eliminating the need for the guide star and wavefront sensing hardware and simplifying the experimental workflow, AOViFT lowers technical barriers for high-resolution volumetric microscopy across diverse biological samples.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dan Halperin, Niklas Eisl</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous driving is a safety-critical application, and it is therefore a top priority that the accompanying assistance systems are able to provide precise information about the surrounding environment of the vehicle. Tasks such as 3D Object Detection deliver an insufficiently detailed understanding of the surrounding scene because they only predict a bounding box for foreground objects. In contrast, 3D Semantic Segmentation provides richer and denser information about the environment by assigning a label to each individual point, which is of paramount importance for autonomous driving tasks, such as navigation or lane changes. To inspire future research, in this review paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art methods in the field of Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation for autonomous driving. We categorize the approaches into projection-based, 3D-based and hybrid methods. Moreover, we discuss the most important and commonly used datasets for this task and also emphasize the importance of synthetic data to support research when real-world data is limited. We further present the results of the different methods and compare them with respect to their segmentation accuracy and efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rashid Mushkani, Hugo Berard, Shin Koseki</p>
<p>Abstract: Cities are not monolithic; they are arenas of negotiation among groups that hold varying needs, values, and experiences. Conventional methods of urban assessment -- from standardized surveys to AI-driven evaluations -- frequently rely on a single consensus metric (e.g., an average measure of inclusivity or safety). Although such aggregations simplify design decisions, they risk obscuring the distinct perspectives of marginalized populations. In this paper, we present findings from a community-centered study in Montreal involving 35 residents with diverse demographic and social identities, particularly wheelchair users, seniors, and LGBTQIA2+ individuals. Using rating and ranking tasks on 20 urban sites, we observe that disagreements are systematic rather than random, reflecting structural inequalities, differing cultural values, and personal experiences of safety and accessibility.
  Based on these empirical insights, we propose negotiative alignment, an AI framework that treats disagreement as an essential input to be preserved, analyzed, and addressed. Negotiative alignment builds on pluralistic models by dynamically updating stakeholder preferences through multi-agent negotiation mechanisms, ensuring no single perspective is marginalized. We outline how this framework can be integrated into urban analytics -- and other decision-making contexts -- to retain minority viewpoints, adapt to changing stakeholder concerns, and enhance fairness and accountability. The study demonstrates that preserving and engaging with disagreement, rather than striving for an artificial consensus, can produce more equitable and responsive AI-driven outcomes in urban design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anthony Lamelas, Harrison Muchnic</p>
<p>Abstract: This study explores the impact of scaling semantic categories on the image classification performance of vision transformers (ViTs). In this specific case, the CLIP server provided by Jina AI is used for experimentation. The research hypothesizes that as the number of ground truth and artificially introduced semantically equivalent categories increases, the labeling accuracy of ViTs improves until a theoretical maximum or limit is reached. A wide variety of image datasets were chosen to test this hypothesis. These datasets were processed through a custom function in Python designed to evaluate the model's accuracy, with adjustments being made to account for format differences between datasets. By exponentially introducing new redundant categories, the experiment assessed accuracy trends until they plateaued, decreased, or fluctuated inconsistently. The findings show that while semantic scaling initially increases model performance, the benefits diminish or reverse after surpassing a critical threshold, providing insight into the limitations and possible optimization of category labeling strategies for ViTs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vrushank Ahire, Kunal Shah, Mudasir Nazir Khan, Nikhil Pakhale, Lownish Rai Sookha, M. A. Ganaie, Abhinav Dhall</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces MAVEN (Multi-modal Attention for Valence-Arousal Emotion Network), a novel architecture for dynamic emotion recognition through dimensional modeling of affect. The model uniquely integrates visual, audio, and textual modalities via a bi-directional cross-modal attention mechanism with six distinct attention pathways, enabling comprehensive interactions between all modality pairs. Our proposed approach employs modality-specific encoders to extract rich feature representations from synchronized video frames, audio segments, and transcripts. The architecture's novelty lies in its cross-modal enhancement strategy, where each modality representation is refined through weighted attention from other modalities, followed by self-attention refinement through modality-specific encoders. Rather than directly predicting valence-arousal values, MAVEN predicts emotions in a polar coordinate form, aligning with psychological models of the emotion circumplex. Experimental evaluation on the Aff-Wild2 dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach, with performance measured using Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC). The multi-stage architecture demonstrates superior ability to capture the complex, nuanced nature of emotional expressions in conversational videos, advancing the state-of-the-art (SOTA) in continuous emotion recognition in-the-wild.

<p>Abstract: Continual learning is crucial for creating AI agents that can learn and improve themselves autonomously. A primary challenge in continual learning is to learn new tasks without losing previously learned knowledge. Current continual learning methods primarily focus on enabling a neural network with mechanisms that mitigate forgetting effects. Inspired by the two distinct systems in the human brain, System 1 and System 2, we propose a Neuro-Symbolic Brain-Inspired Continual Learning (NeSyBiCL) framework that incorporates two subsystems to solve continual learning: A neural network model responsible for quickly adapting to the most recent task, together with a symbolic reasoner responsible for retaining previously acquired knowledge from previous tasks. Moreover, we design an integration mechanism between these components to facilitate knowledge transfer from the symbolic reasoner to the neural network. We also introduce two compositional continual learning benchmarks and demonstrate that NeSyBiCL is effective and leads to superior performance compared to continual learning methods that merely rely on neural architectures to address forgetting.</p>

<p>Abstract: Coronaviruses transmit COVID-19, a rapidly spreading disease. A Coronavirus infection (COVID-19) was first discovered in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and spread rapidly throughout the planet in exactly some months. because of this, the virus can cause severe symptoms and even death, especially within the elderly and in people with medical conditions. The virus causes acute respiratory infections in humans. the primary case was diagnosed in China in 2019 and the pandemic started in 2020. Since the quantity of cases of COVID-19 is increasing daily, there are only a limited number of test kits available in hospitals. So, to stop COVID-19 from spreading among people, an automatic diagnosis system must be implemented. during this study, three pre-trained neural networks supported convolutional neural networks (VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50) are proposed for detecting Coronavirus pneumonia infected patients through X-rays and computerized tomography (CT). By using cross-validation, we've got implemented binary classifications with two classes (COVID-19, Normal (healthy)). Taking into consideration the results obtained, the pre-trained ResNet50 model provides the simplest classification performance (97.77% accuracy, 100% sensitivity, 93.33% specificity, 98.00% F1-score) among the opposite three used models over 6259 images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Mark Chen, Shell Xu Hu, Wayne Luk, Timothy Hospedales, Hongxiang Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a promising approach for multi-task learning (MTL), offering a data-efficient alternative to conventional fine-tuning. However, with the rapid development of the open-source AI ecosystem and the increasing availability of fine-tuned foundation models, existing model merging methods face two key limitations: (i) They are primarily designed for in-house fine-tuned models, making them less adaptable to diverse model sources with partially unknown model and task information, (ii) They struggle to scale effectively when merging numerous model checkpoints. To address these challenges, we formulate model merging as a constrained optimization problem and introduce a novel approach: Frank-Wolfe Merging (FW-Merging). Inspired by Frank-Wolfe optimization, our approach iteratively selects the most relevant model in the pool to minimize a linear approximation of the objective function and then executes a local merging similar to the Frank-Wolfe update. The objective function is designed to capture the desired behavior of the target-merged model, while the fine-tuned candidate models define the constraint set. More importantly, FW-Merging serves as an orthogonal technique for existing merging methods, seamlessly integrating with them to further enhance accuracy performance. Our experiments show that FW-Merging scales across diverse model sources, remaining stable with 16 irrelevant models and improving by 15.3% with 16 relevant models on 20 CV tasks, while maintaining constant memory overhead, unlike the linear overhead of data-informed merging methods. Compared with the state-of-the-art approaches, FW-Merging surpasses the data-free merging method by 32.8% and outperforms the data-informed Adamerging by 8.39% when merging 20 ViT models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyuan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: In industrial X-ray Computed Tomography (CT), the need for rapid in-line inspection is critical. Sparse-angle tomography plays a significant role in this by reducing the required number of projections, thereby accelerating processing and conserving resources. Most existing methods aim to balance reconstruction quality and scanning time, typically relying on fixed scan durations. Adaptive adjustment of the number of angles is essential; for instance, more angles may be required for objects with complex geometries or noisier projections. The concept of optimal stopping, which dynamically adjusts this balance according to varying industrial needs, remains underutilized. Building on our previous work, we integrate optimal stopping into sequential Optimal Experimental Design (OED). We propose a novel method for computing the policy gradient within the Actor-Critic framework, enabling the development of adaptive policies for informative angle selection and scan termination. Additionally, we investigated the gap between simulation and real-world applications in the context of the developed learning-based method. Our trained model, developed using synthetic data, demonstrates reliable performance when applied to real-world data. This approach enhances the flexibility of CT operations and expands the applicability of sparse-angle tomography in industrial settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability research faces a gap between analyzing simple circuits in toy tasks and discovering features in large models. To bridge this gap, we propose text-to-SQL generation as an ideal task to study, as it combines the formal structure of toy tasks with real-world complexity. We introduce TinySQL, a synthetic dataset progressing from basic to advanced SQL operations, and train models ranging from 33M to 1B parameters to establish a comprehensive testbed for interpretability. We apply multiple complementary interpretability techniques, including edge attribution patching and sparse autoencoders, to identify minimal circuits and components supporting SQL generation. Our analysis reveals both the potential and limitations of current interpretability methods, showing how circuits can vary even across similar queries. Lastly, we demonstrate how mechanistic interpretability can identify flawed heuristics in models and improve synthetic dataset design. Our work provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating and advancing interpretability techniques while establishing clear boundaries for their reliable application.</p>

<p>Abstract: Unsupervised sentence embedding representation has become a hot research topic in natural language processing. As a tensor, sentence embedding has two critical properties: direction and norm. Existing works have been limited to constraining only the orientation of the samples' representations while ignoring the features of their module lengths. To address this issue, we propose a new training objective that optimizes the training of unsupervised contrastive learning by constraining the module length features between positive samples. We combine the training objective of Tensor's Norm Constraints with ensemble learning to propose a new Sentence Embedding representation framework, TNCSE. We evaluate seven semantic text similarity tasks, and the results show that TNCSE and derived models are the current state-of-the-art approach; in addition, we conduct extensive zero-shot evaluations, and the results show that TNCSE outperforms other baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmad M. Nagib, Hatem Abou-Zeid, Hossam S. Hassanein</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based slicing policies have shown significant success in simulated environments but face challenges in physical systems such as open radio access networks (O-RANs) due to simulation-to-reality gaps. These policies often lack safety guarantees to ensure compliance with service level agreements (SLAs), such as the strict latency requirements of immersive applications. As a result, a deployed DRL slicing agent may make resource allocation (RA) decisions that degrade system performance, particularly in previously unseen scenarios. Real-world immersive applications require maintaining SLA constraints throughout deployment to prevent risky DRL exploration. In this paper, we propose SafeSlice to address both the cumulative (trajectory-wise) and instantaneous (state-wise) latency constraints of O-RAN slices. We incorporate the cumulative constraints by designing a sigmoid-based risk-sensitive reward function that reflects the slices' latency requirements. Moreover, we build a supervised learning cost model as part of a safety layer that projects the slicing agent's RA actions to the nearest safe actions, fulfilling instantaneous constraints. We conduct an exhaustive experiment that supports multiple services, including real virtual reality (VR) gaming traffic, to investigate the performance of SafeSlice under extreme and changing deployment conditions. SafeSlice achieves reductions of up to 83.23% in average cumulative latency, 93.24% in instantaneous latency violations, and 22.13% in resource consumption compared to the baselines. The results also indicate SafeSlice's robustness to changing the threshold configurations of latency constraints, a vital deployment scenario that will be realized by the O-RAN paradigm to empower mobile network operators (MNOs).</p>

<p>Abstract: The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) and LLM-powered agents in multi-user settings underscores the need for reliable, usable methods to accommodate diverse preferences and resolve conflicting directives. Drawing on conflict resolution theory, we introduce a user-centered workflow for multi-user personalization comprising three stages: Reflection, Analysis, and Feedback. We then present MAP -- a \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{A}gent system for multi-user \textbf{P}ersonalization -- to operationalize this workflow. By delegating subtasks to specialized agents, MAP (1) retrieves and reflects on relevant user information, while enhancing reliability through agent-to-agent interactions, (2) provides detailed analysis for improved transparency and usability, and (3) integrates user feedback to iteratively refine results. Our user study findings (n=12) highlight MAP's effectiveness and usability for conflict resolution while emphasizing the importance of user involvement in resolution verification and failure management. This work highlights the potential of multi-agent systems to implement user-centered, multi-user personalization workflows and concludes by offering insights for personalization in multi-user contexts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sung-Yeon Park, Can Cui, Yunsheng Ma, Ahmadreza Moradipari, Rohit Gupta, Kyungtae Han, Ziran Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across various domains; however, their ability to comprehend driving scenes remains less proven. The complexity of driving scenarios, which includes multi-view information, poses significant challenges for existing MLLMs. In this paper, we introduce NuPlanQA-Eval, a multi-view, multi-modal evaluation benchmark for driving scene understanding. To further support generalization to multi-view driving scenarios, we also propose NuPlanQA-1M, a large-scale dataset comprising 1M real-world visual question-answering (VQA) pairs. For context-aware analysis of traffic scenes, we categorize our dataset into nine subtasks across three core skills: Road Environment Perception, Spatial Relations Recognition, and Ego-Centric Reasoning. Furthermore, we present BEV-LLM, integrating Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) features from multi-view images into MLLMs. Our evaluation results reveal key challenges that existing MLLMs face in driving scene-specific perception and spatial reasoning from ego-centric perspectives. In contrast, BEV-LLM demonstrates remarkable adaptability to this domain, outperforming other models in six of the nine subtasks. These findings highlight how BEV integration enhances multi-view MLLMs while also identifying key areas that require further refinement for effective adaptation to driving scenes. To facilitate further research, we publicly release NuPlanQA at https://github.com/sungyeonparkk/NuPlanQA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gul Sheeraz, Qun Chen, Liu Feiyu, Zhou Fengjin MD</p>
<p>Abstract: Breast cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Early detection is crucial for improving patient outcomes, yet the diagnostic process is often complex and prone to inconsistencies among pathologists. Computer-aided diagnostic approaches have significantly enhanced breast cancer detection, particularly in binary classification (benign vs. malignant). However, these methods face challenges in multiclass classification, leading to frequent mispredictions. In this work, we propose a novel adaptive learning approach for multiclass breast cancer classification using H&E-stained histopathology images. First, we introduce a misprediction risk analysis framework that quantifies and ranks the likelihood of an image being mislabeled by a classifier. This framework leverages an interpretable risk model that requires only a small number of labeled samples for training. Next, we present an adaptive learning strategy that fine-tunes classifiers based on the specific characteristics of a given dataset. This approach minimizes misprediction risk, allowing the classifier to adapt effectively to the target workload. We evaluate our proposed solutions on real benchmark datasets, demonstrating that our risk analysis framework more accurately identifies mispredictions compared to existing methods. Furthermore, our adaptive learning approach significantly improves the performance of state-of-the-art deep neural network classifiers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chang Liu, Bavesh Balaji, Saad Hossain, C Thomas, Kwei-Herng Lai, Raviteja Vemulapalli, Alexander Wong, Sirisha Rambhatla</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation for semantic segmentation (DASS) aims to transfer knowledge from a label-rich source domain to a target domain with no labels. Two key approaches in DASS are (1) vision-only approaches using masking or multi-resolution crops, and (2) language-based approaches that use generic class-wise prompts informed by target domain (e.g. "a {snowy} photo of a {class}"). However, the former is susceptible to noisy pseudo-labels that are biased to the source domain. The latter does not fully capture the intricate spatial relationships of objects -- key for dense prediction tasks. To this end, we propose LangDA. LangDA addresses these challenges by, first, learning contextual relationships between objects via VLM-generated scene descriptions (e.g. "a pedestrian is on the sidewalk, and the street is lined with buildings."). Second, LangDA aligns the entire image features with text representation of this context-aware scene caption and learns generalized representations via text. With this, LangDA sets the new state-of-the-art across three DASS benchmarks, outperforming existing methods by 2.6%, 1.4% and 3.9%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhang Jiaxing, Tang Hao</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite significant advances in deep learning for image and video segmentation, existing models continue to face challenges in cross-domain adaptability and generalization. Image and video segmentation are fundamental tasks in computer vision with wide-ranging applications in healthcare, agriculture, industrial inspection, and autonomous driving. With the advent of large-scale foundation models, SAM2 - an improved version of SAM (Segment Anything Model)has been optimized for segmentation tasks, demonstrating enhanced performance in complex scenarios. However, SAM2's adaptability and limitations in specific domains require further investigation. This paper systematically analyzes the application of SAM2 in image and video segmentation and evaluates its performance in various fields. We begin by introducing the foundational concepts of image segmentation, categorizing foundation models, and exploring the technical characteristics of SAM and SAM2. Subsequently, we delve into SAM2's applications in static image and video segmentation, emphasizing its performance in specialized areas such as medical imaging and the challenges of cross-domain adaptability. As part of our research, we reviewed over 200 related papers to provide a comprehensive analysis of the topic. Finally, the paper highlights the strengths and weaknesses of SAM2 in segmentation tasks, identifies the technical challenges it faces, and proposes future development directions. This review provides valuable insights and practical recommendations for optimizing and applying SAM2 in real-world scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaofei Kong, Lei Li, Menghan Dou, Zhaoyun Chen, Yuchun Wu, Guoping Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enables efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained language models via low-rank matrix approximation, which is effective in many scenarios. However, its low-rank representation capacity is constrained in complex tasks or high-rank dependency settings, potentially limiting model adaptability. Addressing the expressive bottleneck of classical low-rank approximation in fine-tuning large language models, this paper proposes a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method based on a Quantum Weighted Tensor Hybrid Network (QWTHN), which leverages Quantum Neural Network (QNN). The study investigates quantum-classical hybrid parameter-efficient fine-tuning in low-rank spaces. QWTHN decomposes pre-trained weights into quantum neural network and tensor network representations, utilizing quantum state superposition and other methods to break through classical rank limitations. Experiments show that the proposed quantum fine-tuning technique for large models approaches or even surpasses the parameter efficiency of LoRA. On the CPsyCounD and R1-Distill-SFT datasets, QWTHN, compared to classical LoRA, reduces training loss by up to 15% while using 76% fewer parameters, and achieves an 8.4% performance improvement on the CPsyCounD test set. This research not only realizes lightweight and efficient adaptation of quantum resources to billion-parameter models but also validates the practical path of quantum hardware driven by large model tasks, laying the first engineering-ready technical foundation for future quantum-enhanced AGI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyu Ma, Ziyang Ding, Zhicong Luo, Chi Chen, Zonghao Guo, Derek F. Wong, Xiaoyi Feng, Maosong Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Human experts excel at fine-grained visual discrimination by leveraging domain knowledge to refine perceptual features, a capability that remains underdeveloped in current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Despite possessing vast expert-level knowledge, MLLMs struggle to integrate reasoning into visual perception, often generating direct responses without deeper analysis. To bridge this gap, we introduce knowledge-intensive visual grounding (KVG), a novel visual grounding task that requires both fine-grained perception and domain-specific knowledge integration. To address the challenges of KVG, we propose DeepPerception, an MLLM enhanced with cognitive visual perception capabilities. Our approach consists of (1) an automated data synthesis pipeline that generates high-quality, knowledge-aligned training samples, and (2) a two-stage training framework combining supervised fine-tuning for cognitive reasoning scaffolding and reinforcement learning to optimize perception-cognition synergy. To benchmark performance, we introduce KVG-Bench a comprehensive dataset spanning 10 domains with 1.3K manually curated test cases. Experimental results demonstrate that DeepPerception significantly outperforms direct fine-tuning, achieving +8.08\% accuracy improvements on KVG-Bench and exhibiting +4.60\% superior cross-domain generalization over baseline approaches. Our findings highlight the importance of integrating cognitive processes into MLLMs for human-like visual perception and open new directions for multimodal reasoning research.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kairong Luo, Haodong Wen, Shengding Hu, Zhenbo Sun, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun, Kaifeng Lyu, Wenguang Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Training large models is both resource-intensive and time-consuming, making it crucial to understand the quantitative relationship between model performance and hyperparameters. In this paper, we present an empirical law that describes how the pretraining loss of large language models evolves under different learning rate schedules, such as constant, cosine, and step decay schedules. Our proposed law takes a multi-power form, combining a power law based on the sum of learning rates and additional power laws to account for a loss reduction effect induced by learning rate decay. We extensively validate this law on various model sizes and architectures, and demonstrate that after fitting on a few learning rate schedules, the law accurately predicts the loss curves for unseen schedules of different shapes and horizons. Moreover, by minimizing the predicted final pretraining loss across learning rate schedules, we are able to find a schedule that outperforms the widely used cosine learning rate schedule. Interestingly, this automatically discovered schedule bears some resemblance to the recently proposed Warmup-Stable-Decay (WSD) schedule (Hu et al, 2024) but achieves a slightly lower final loss. We believe these results could offer valuable insights for understanding the dynamics of pretraining and designing learning rate schedules to improve efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinseok Bae, Jungdam Won, Donggeun Lim, Inwoo Hwang, Young Min Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a versatile latent representation that enables physically simulated character to efficiently utilize motion priors. To build a powerful motion embedding that is shared across multiple tasks, the physics controller should employ rich latent space that is easily explored and capable of generating high-quality motion. We propose integrating continuous and discrete latent representations to build a versatile motion prior that can be adapted to a wide range of challenging control tasks. Specifically, we build a discrete latent model to capture distinctive posterior distribution without collapse, and simultaneously augment the sampled vector with the continuous residuals to generate high-quality, smooth motion without jittering. We further incorporate Residual Vector Quantization, which not only maximizes the capacity of the discrete motion prior, but also efficiently abstracts the action space during the task learning phase. We demonstrate that our agent can produce diverse yet smooth motions simply by traversing the learned motion prior through unconditional motion generation. Furthermore, our model robustly satisfies sparse goal conditions with highly expressive natural motions, including head-mounted device tracking and motion in-betweening at irregular intervals, which could not be achieved with existing latent representations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingyang Song, Xiaoye Qu, Jiawei Zhou, Yu Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved significant progress in combining visual comprehension with language generation. Despite this success, the training data of LVLMs still suffers from Long-Tail (LT) problems, where the data distribution is highly imbalanced. Previous works have mainly focused on traditional VLM architectures, i.e., CLIP or ViT, and specific tasks such as recognition and classification. Nevertheless, the exploration of LVLM (e.g. LLaVA) and more general tasks (e.g. Visual Question Answering and Visual Reasoning) remains under-explored. In this paper, we first conduct an in-depth analysis of the LT issues in LVLMs and identify two core causes: the overrepresentation of head concepts and the underrepresentation of tail concepts. Based on the above observation, we propose an $\textbf{A}$daptive $\textbf{D}$ata $\textbf{R}$efinement Framework ($\textbf{ADR}$), which consists of two stages: $\textbf{D}$ata $\textbf{R}$ebalancing ($\textbf{DR}$) and $\textbf{D}$ata $\textbf{S}$ynthesis ($\textbf{DS}$). In the DR stage, we adaptively rebalance the redundant data based on entity distributions, while in the DS stage, we leverage Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) and scarce images to supplement underrepresented portions. Through comprehensive evaluations across eleven benchmarks, our proposed ADR effectively mitigates the long-tail problem in the training data, improving the average performance of LLaVA 1.5 relatively by 4.36%, without increasing the training data volume.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Binglei Lou, Ruilin Wu, Philip Leong</p>
<p>Abstract: The deployment of deep neural networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained edge devices such as field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) requires a careful balance of latency, power, and resource usage while maintaining high accuracy. Existing Lookup Table (LUT)-based DNNs, including LogicNets, PolyLUT, PolyLUT-Add, and NeuraLUT, exploit native FPGA resources with random sparse connectivity. This paper introduces SparseLUT, a connectivity-centric training technique tailored for LUT-based DNNs. SparseLUT leverages a non-greedy training strategy that prioritizes the pruning of less significant connections and strategically regrows alternative ones, resulting in efficient convergence to the target sparsity. Experimental results show consistent accuracy improvements across benchmarks, including up to a 2.13\% increase on MNIST and a 0.94\% improvement for Jet Substructure Classification compared to random sparsity. This is done without any hardware overhead and achieves state-of-the-art results for LUT-based DNNs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seunggwan Lee, Hwanhee Jung, Byoungsoo Koh, Qixing Huang, Sangho Yoon, Sangpil Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: A fundamental challenge in conditional 3D shape generation is to minimize the information loss and maximize the intention of user input. Existing approaches have predominantly focused on two types of isolated conditional signals, i.e., user sketches and text descriptions, each of which does not offer flexible control of the generated shape. In this paper, we introduce PASTA, the flexible approach that seamlessly integrates a user sketch and a text description for 3D shape generation. The key idea is to use text embeddings from a vision-language model to enrich the semantic representation of sketches. Specifically, these text-derived priors specify the part components of the object, compensating for missing visual cues from ambiguous sketches. In addition, we introduce ISG-Net which employs two types of graph convolutional networks: IndivGCN, which processes fine-grained details, and PartGCN, which aggregates these details into parts and refines the structure of objects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PASTA outperforms existing methods in part-level editing and achieves state-of-the-art results in sketch-to-3D shape generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sumin In, Youngdong Jang, Utae Jeong, MinHyuk Jang, Hyeongcheol Park, Eunbyung Park, Sangpil Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables rapid differentiable rendering for 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis, leading to its widespread commercial use. Consequently, copyright protection via watermarking has become critical. However, because 3DGS relies on millions of Gaussians, which require gigabytes of storage, efficient transfer and storage require compression. Existing 3DGS watermarking methods are vulnerable to quantization-based compression, often resulting in the loss of the embedded watermark. To address this challenge, we propose a novel watermarking method that ensures watermark robustness after model compression while maintaining high rendering quality. In detail, we incorporate a quantization distortion layer that simulates compression during training, preserving the watermark under quantization-based compression. Also, we propose a learnable watermark embedding feature that embeds the watermark into the anchor feature, ensuring structural consistency and seamless integration into the 3D scene. Furthermore, we present a frequency-aware anchor growing mechanism to enhance image quality in high-frequency regions by effectively identifying Guassians within these regions. Experimental results confirm that our method preserves the watermark and maintains superior image quality under high compression, validating it as a promising approach for a secure 3DGS model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haozhe Si, Yuxuan Wan, Minh Do, Deepak Vasisht, Han Zhao, Hendrik F. Hamann</p>
<p>Abstract: Geospatial raster (imagery) data, such as that collected by satellite-based imaging systems at different times and spectral bands, hold immense potential for enabling a wide range of high-impact applications. This potential stems from the rich information that is spatially and temporally contextualized across multiple channels and sensing modalities. Recent work has adapted existing self-supervised learning approaches for such geospatial data. However, they fall short of scalable model architectures, leading to inflexibility and computational inefficiencies when faced with an increasing number of channels and modalities. To address these limitations, we introduce Low-rank Efficient Spatial-Spectral Vision Transformer (LESS ViT) with three key innovations: i) the LESS Attention Block that approximates high-dimensional spatial-spectral attention through Kronecker's product of the low-dimensional spatial and spectral attention components; ii) the Continuous Positional-Channel Embedding Layer that preserves both spatial and spectral continuity and physical characteristics of each patch; and iii) the Perception Field Mask that exploits local spatial dependencies by constraining attention to neighboring patches. To evaluate the proposed innovations, we construct a benchmark, GFM-Bench, which serves as a comprehensive benchmark for such geospatial raster data. We pretrain LESS ViT using a Hyperspectral Masked Autoencoder framework with integrated positional and channel masking strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method surpasses current state-of-the-art multi-modal geospatial foundation models, achieving superior performance with less computation and fewer parameters. The flexibility and extensibility of our framework make it a promising direction for future geospatial data analysis tasks that involve a wide range of modalities and channels.</p>

<p>Abstract: We investigate complex video question answering via chain-of-evidence reasoning -- identifying sequences of temporal spans from multiple relevant parts of the video, together with visual evidence within them. Existing models struggle with multi-step reasoning as they uniformly sample a fixed number of frames, which can miss critical evidence distributed nonuniformly throughout the video. Moreover, they lack the ability to temporally localize such evidence in the broader context of the full video, which is required for answering complex questions. We propose a framework to enhance existing VideoQA datasets with evidence reasoning chains, automatically constructed by searching for optimal intervals of interest in the video with supporting evidence, that maximizes the likelihood of answering a given question. We train our model (VITED) to generate these evidence chains directly, enabling it to both localize evidence windows as well as perform multi-step reasoning across them in long-form video content. We show the value of our evidence-distilled models on a suite of long video QA benchmarks where we outperform state-of-the-art approaches that lack evidence reasoning capabilities.</p>

<p>Abstract: Natural Language to Visualization (NL2VIS) enables users to create visualizations from natural language queries, making data insights more accessible. However, NL2VIS faces challenges in interpreting ambiguous queries, as users often express their visualization needs in imprecise language. To address this challenge, we introduce nvBench 2.0, a new benchmark designed to evaluate NL2VIS systems in scenarios involving ambiguous queries. nvBench 2.0 includes 7,878 natural language queries and 24,076 corresponding visualizations, derived from 780 tables across 153 domains. It is built using a controlled ambiguity-injection pipeline that generates ambiguous queries through a reverse-generation workflow. By starting with unambiguous seed visualizations and selectively injecting ambiguities, the pipeline yields multiple valid interpretations for each query, with each ambiguous query traceable to its corresponding visualization through step-wise reasoning paths. We evaluate various Large Language Models (LLMs) on their ability to perform ambiguous NL2VIS tasks using nvBench 2.0. We also propose Step-NL2VIS, an LLM-based model trained on nvBench 2.0, which enhances performance in ambiguous scenarios through step-wise preference optimization. Our results show that Step-NL2VIS outperforms all baselines, setting a new state-of-the-art for ambiguous NL2VIS tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: A vast amount of instruction tuning data is crucial for the impressive performance of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), but the associated computational costs and data collection demands during supervised fine-tuning make it impractical for most researchers. Federated learning (FL) has the potential to leverage all distributed data and training resources to reduce the overhead of joint training. However, most existing methods assume a fixed number of tasks, while in real-world scenarios, clients continuously encounter new knowledge and often struggle to retain old tasks due to memory constraints. In this work, we introduce the Federated Continual Instruction Tuning (FCIT) benchmark to model this real-world challenge. Our benchmark includes two realistic scenarios, encompassing four different settings and twelve carefully curated instruction tuning datasets. To address the challenges posed by FCIT, we propose dynamic knowledge organization to effectively integrate updates from different tasks during training and subspace selective activation to allocate task-specific output during inference. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly enhances model performance across varying levels of data heterogeneity and catastrophic forgetting. Our source code and dataset will be made publicly available.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate hallucinations, producing outputs that are contextually inaccurate or factually incorrect. We introduce HICD, a novel method designed to induce hallucinations for contrastive decoding to mitigate hallucinations. Unlike existing contrastive decoding methods, HICD selects attention heads crucial to the model's prediction as inducing heads, then induces hallucinations by dispersing attention of these inducing heads and compares the hallucinated outputs with the original outputs to obtain the final result. Our approach significantly improves performance on tasks requiring contextual faithfulness, such as context completion, reading comprehension, and question answering. It also improves factuality in tasks requiring accurate knowledge recall. We demonstrate that our inducing heads selection and attention dispersion method leads to more "contrast-effective" hallucinations for contrastive decoding, outperforming other hallucination-inducing methods. Our findings provide a promising strategy for reducing hallucinations by inducing hallucinations in a controlled manner, enhancing the performance of LLMs in a wide range of tasks.</p>

The approach follows a two-stage process. First, we fine-tune a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to enhance pathology-aware text generation. Second, the fine-tuned VLM generates textual descriptions, using a dual-branch architecture to independently extract visual and textual features. These features are fused via Progressive Robust Multi-Modal Fusion (PRMF) Block for stable training. Experimental results show that the MMLNB model is more accurate than the single modal model. Ablation studies demonstrate the importance of multi-modal fusion, fine-tuning, and the PRMF mechanism. This research creates a scalable AI-driven framework for digital pathology, enhancing reliability and interpretability in NB subtyping classification.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Pu, Chaozhuo Li, Rui Ha, Litian Zhang, Lirong Qiu, Xi Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Defending large language models (LLMs) against jailbreak attacks is crucial for ensuring their safe deployment. Existing defense strategies generally rely on predefined static criteria to differentiate between harmful and benign prompts. However, such rigid rules are incapable of accommodating the inherent complexity and dynamic nature of real jailbreak attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel concept of ``mirror'' to enable dynamic and adaptive defense. A mirror refers to a dynamically generated prompt that mirrors the syntactic structure of the input while ensuring semantic safety. The personalized discrepancies between the input prompts and their corresponding mirrors serve as the guiding principles for defense. A new defense paradigm, MirrorGuard, is further proposed to detect and calibrate risky inputs based on such mirrors. An entropy-based detection metric, Relative Input Uncertainty (RIU), is integrated into MirrorGuard to quantify the discrepancies between input prompts and mirrors. MirrorGuard is evaluated on several popular datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art defense performance while maintaining general effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunqi Shi, Chengrui Gao, Wanqi Ren, Siyuan Xu, Ke Xue, Mingxuan Yuan, Chao Qian, Zhi-Hua Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: This work introduces Open3DBench, an open-source 3D-IC backend implementation benchmark built upon the OpenROAD-flow-scripts framework, enabling comprehensive evaluation of power, performance, area, and thermal metrics. Our proposed flow supports modular integration of 3D partitioning, placement, 3D routing, RC extraction, and thermal simulation, aligning with advanced 3D flows that rely on commercial tools and in-house scripts. We present two foundational 3D placement algorithms: Open3D-Tiling, which emphasizes regular macro placement, and Open3D-DMP, which enhances wirelength optimization through cross-die co-placement with analytical placer DREAMPlace. Experimental results show significant improvements in area (51.19%), wirelength (24.06%), timing (30.84%), and power (5.72%) compared to 2D flows. The results also highlight that better wirelength does not necessarily lead to PPA gain, emphasizing the need of developing PPA-driven methods. Open3DBench offers a standardized, reproducible platform for evaluating 3D EDA methods, effectively bridging the gap between open-source tools and commercial solutions in 3D-IC design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junming Liu, Siyuan Meng, Yanting Gao, Song Mao, Pinlong Cai, Guohang Yan, Yirong Chen, Zilin Bian, Botian Shi, Ding Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) struggles with incomplete knowledge and hallucination artifacts, challenges that textual Knowledge Graphs (KGs) only partially mitigate due to their modality isolation. While Multimodal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs) promise enhanced cross-modal understanding, their practical construction is impeded by semantic narrowness of manual text annotations and inherent noise in visual-semantic entity linkages. In this paper, we propose Vision-align-to-Language integrated Knowledge Graph (VaLiK), a novel approach for constructing MMKGs that enhances LLMs reasoning through cross-modal information supplementation. Specifically, we cascade pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to align image features with text, transforming them into descriptions that encapsulate image-specific information. Furthermore, we developed a cross-modal similarity verification mechanism to quantify semantic consistency, effectively filtering out noise introduced during feature alignment. Even without manually annotated image captions, the refined descriptions alone suffice to construct the MMKG. Compared to conventional MMKGs construction paradigms, our approach achieves substantial storage efficiency gains while maintaining direct entity-to-image linkage capability. Experimental results on multimodal reasoning tasks demonstrate that LLMs augmented with VaLiK outperform previous state-of-the-art models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenqiang Wang, Yijia Zhang, Zikai Zhang, Guanting Huo, Hao Liang, Shijie Cao, Ningyi Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) demonstrate powerful capabilities, deploying them on edge devices has become increasingly crucial, offering advantages in privacy and real-time interaction. QLoRA has emerged as the standard approach for on-device LLMs, leveraging quantized models to reduce memory and computational costs while utilizing LoRA for task-specific adaptability. In this work, we propose ROMA, a QLoRA accelerator with a hybrid storage architecture that uses ROM for quantized base models and SRAM for LoRA weights and KV cache. Our insight is that the quantized base model is stable and converged, making it well-suited for ROM storage. Meanwhile, LoRA modules offer the flexibility to adapt to new data without requiring updates to the base model. To further reduce the area cost of ROM, we introduce a novel B-ROM design and integrate it with the compute unit to form a fused cell for efficient use of chip resources. ROMA can effectively store both a 4-bit 3B and a 2-bit 8B LLaMA model entirely on-chip, achieving a notable generation speed exceeding 20,000 tokens/s without requiring external memory.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Palakorn Achananuparp, Ee-Peng Lim</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatically annotating job data with standardized occupations from taxonomies, known as occupation classification, is crucial for labor market analysis. However, this task is often hindered by data scarcity and the challenges of manual annotations. While large language models (LLMs) hold promise due to their extensive world knowledge and in-context learning capabilities, their effectiveness depends on their knowledge of occupational taxonomies, which remains unclear. In this study, we assess the ability of LLMs to generate precise taxonomic entities from taxonomy, highlighting their limitations. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-stage framework consisting of inference, retrieval, and reranking stages, which integrates taxonomy-guided reasoning examples to enhance performance by aligning outputs with taxonomic knowledge. Evaluations on a large-scale dataset show significant improvements in classification accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate the framework's adaptability for multi-label skill classification. Our results indicate that the framework outperforms existing LLM-based methods, offering a practical and scalable solution for occupation classification and related tasks across LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhan Hou, Koen Hindriks, A. E. Eiben, Kim Baraka</p>
<p>Abstract: Transfer Learning (TL) is a powerful tool that enables robots to transfer learned policies across different environments, tasks, or embodiments. To further facilitate this process, efforts have been made to combine it with Learning from Demonstrations (LfD) for more flexible and efficient policy transfer. However, these approaches are almost exclusively limited to offline demonstrations collected before policy transfer starts, which may suffer from the intrinsic issue of covariance shift brought by LfD and harm the performance of policy transfer. Meanwhile, extensive work in the learning-from-scratch setting has shown that online demonstrations can effectively alleviate covariance shift and lead to better policy performance with improved sample efficiency. This work combines these insights to introduce online demonstrations into a policy transfer setting. We present Policy Transfer with Online Demonstrations, an active LfD algorithm for policy transfer that can optimize the timing and content of queries for online episodic expert demonstrations under a limited demonstration budget. We evaluate our method in eight robotic scenarios, involving policy transfer across diverse environment characteristics, task objectives, and robotic embodiments, with the aim to transfer a trained policy from a source task to a related but different target task. The results show that our method significantly outperforms all baselines in terms of average success rate and sample efficiency, compared to two canonical LfD methods with offline demonstrations and one active LfD method with online demonstrations. Additionally, we conduct preliminary sim-to-real tests of the transferred policy on three transfer scenarios in the real-world environment, demonstrating the policy effectiveness on a real robot manipulator.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in various multi-modal tasks. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in improving the personalization capabilities of VLMs. To better integrate user-provided concepts into VLMs, many methods use positive and negative samples to fine-tune these models. However, the scarcity of user-provided positive samples and the low quality of retrieved negative samples pose challenges for fine-tuning. To reveal the relationship between sample and model performance, we systematically investigate the impact of positive and negative samples (easy and hard) and their diversity on VLM personalization tasks. Based on the detailed analysis, we introduce Concept-as-Tree (CaT), which represents a concept as a tree structure, thereby enabling the data generation of positive and negative samples with varying difficulty and diversity for VLM personalization. With a well-designed data filtering strategy, our CaT framework can ensure the quality of generated data, constituting a powerful pipeline. We perform thorough experiments with various VLM personalization baselines to assess the effectiveness of the pipeline, alleviating the lack of positive samples and the low quality of negative samples. Our results demonstrate that CaT equipped with the proposed data filter significantly enhances the personalization capabilities of VLMs across the MyVLM, Yo'LLaVA, and MC-LLaVA datasets. To our knowledge, this work is the first controllable synthetic data pipeline for VLM personalization.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingguo Lv, Xingbo Dong, Liwen Wang, Jiewen Yang, Lei Zhao, Bin Pu, Zhe Jin, Xuejun Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite domain generalization (DG) has significantly addressed the performance degradation of pre-trained models caused by domain shifts, it often falls short in real-world deployment. Test-time adaptation (TTA), which adjusts a learned model using unlabeled test data, presents a promising solution. However, most existing TTA methods struggle to deliver strong performance in medical image segmentation, primarily because they overlook the crucial prior knowledge inherent to medical images. To address this challenge, we incorporate morphological information and propose a framework based on multi-graph matching. Specifically, we introduce learnable universe embeddings that integrate morphological priors during multi-source training, along with novel unsupervised test-time paradigms for domain adaptation. This approach guarantees cycle-consistency in multi-matching while enabling the model to more effectively capture the invariant priors of unseen data, significantly mitigating the effects of domain shifts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches on two medical image segmentation benchmarks for both multi-source and single-source domain generalization tasks.

<p>Abstract: Despite considerable efforts to enhance the generalization of 3D pose estimators without costly 3D annotations, existing data augmentation methods struggle in real world scenarios with diverse human appearances and complex poses. We propose PoseSyn, a novel data synthesis framework that transforms abundant in the wild 2D pose dataset into diverse 3D pose image pairs. PoseSyn comprises two key components: Error Extraction Module (EEM), which identifies challenging poses from the 2D pose datasets, and Motion Synthesis Module (MSM), which synthesizes motion sequences around the challenging poses. Then, by generating realistic 3D training data via a human animation model aligned with challenging poses and appearances PoseSyn boosts the accuracy of various 3D pose estimators by up to 14% across real world benchmarks including various backgrounds and occlusions, challenging poses, and multi view scenarios. Extensive experiments further confirm that PoseSyn is a scalable and effective approach for improving generalization without relying on expensive 3D annotations, regardless of the pose estimator's model size or design.</p>

<p>Abstract: We study Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with in-context learning for food preparation task planning. In this context, we identify two key challenges: cross-modal distraction and geometric feasibility. Cross-modal distraction occurs when the inclusion of visual input degrades the reasoning performance of a MLLM. Geometric feasibility refers to the ability of MLLMs to ensure that the selected skills are physically executable in the environment. To address these issues, we adapt Chain of Thought (CoT) with Self-Consistency to mitigate reasoning loss from cross-modal distractions and use affordance predictor as skill preconditions to guide MLLM on geometric feasibility. We construct a dataset to evaluate the ability of MLLMs on quantity estimation, reachability analysis, relative positioning and collision avoidance. We conducted a detailed evaluation to identify issues among different baselines and analyze the reasons for improvement, providing insights into each approach. Our method reaches a success rate of 76.7% on the entire dataset, showing a substantial improvement over the CoT baseline at 36.7%.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are acquiring a wider range of capabilities, including understanding and responding in multiple languages. While they undergo safety training to prevent them from answering illegal questions, imbalances in training data and human evaluation resources can make these models more susceptible to attacks in low-resource languages (LRL). This paper proposes a framework to automatically assess the multilingual vulnerabilities of commonly used LLMs. Using our framework, we evaluated six LLMs across eight languages representing varying levels of resource availability. We validated the assessments generated by our automated framework through human evaluation in two languages, demonstrating that the framework's results align with human judgments in most cases. Our findings reveal vulnerabilities in LRL; however, these may pose minimal risk as they often stem from the model's poor performance, resulting in incoherent responses.</p>

<p>Abstract: Performing robotic grasping from a cluttered bin based on human instructions is a challenging task, as it requires understanding both the nuances of free-form language and the spatial relationships between objects. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) trained on web-scale data, such as GPT-4o, have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities across both text and images. But can they truly be used for this task in a zero-shot setting? And what are their limitations? In this paper, we explore these research questions via the free-form language-based robotic grasping task, and propose a novel method, FreeGrasp, leveraging the pre-trained VLMs' world knowledge to reason about human instructions and object spatial arrangements. Our method detects all objects as keypoints and uses these keypoints to annotate marks on images, aiming to facilitate GPT-4o's zero-shot spatial reasoning. This allows our method to determine whether a requested object is directly graspable or if other objects must be grasped and removed first. Since no existing dataset is specifically designed for this task, we introduce a synthetic dataset FreeGraspData by extending the MetaGraspNetV2 dataset with human-annotated instructions and ground-truth grasping sequences. We conduct extensive analyses with both FreeGraspData and real-world validation with a gripper-equipped robotic arm, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in grasp reasoning and execution.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Baohao Liao, Christian Herold, Seyyed Hadi Hashemi, Stefan Vasilev, Shahram Khadivi, Christof Monz</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) scale, model compression is crucial for edge deployment and accessibility. Weight-only quantization reduces model size but suffers from performance degradation at lower bit widths. Moreover, standard finetuning is incompatible with quantized models, and alternative methods often fall short of full finetuning. In this paper, we propose ClusComp, a simple yet effective compression paradigm that clusters weight matrices into codebooks and finetunes them block-by-block. ClusComp (1) achieves superior performance in 2-4 bit quantization, (2) pushes compression to 1-bit while outperforming ultra-low-bit methods with minimal finetuning, and (3) enables efficient finetuning, even surpassing existing quantization-based approaches and rivaling full FP16 finetuning. Notably, ClusComp supports compression and finetuning of 70B LLMs on a single A6000-48GB GPU.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Yin, Guangzong Si, Zilei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Contrastive decoding strategies are widely used to mitigate object hallucinations in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). By reducing over-reliance on language priors, these strategies ensure that generated content remains closely grounded in visual inputs, producing contextually accurate outputs. Since contrastive decoding requires no additional training or external tools, it offers both computational efficiency and versatility, making it highly attractive. However, these methods present two main limitations: (1) bluntly suppressing language priors can compromise coherence and accuracy of generated content, and (2) processing contrastive inputs adds computational load, significantly slowing inference speed. To address these challenges, we propose Visual Amplification Fusion (VAF), a plug-and-play technique that enhances attention to visual signals within the model's middle layers, where modality fusion predominantly occurs. This approach enables more effective capture of visual features, reducing the model's bias toward language modality. Experimental results demonstrate that VAF significantly reduces hallucinations across various MLLMs without affecting inference speed, while maintaining coherence and accuracy in generated outputs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) improve performance on vision-language tasks by integrating visual features from pre-trained vision encoders into large language models (LLMs). However, how MLLMs process and utilize visual information remains unclear. In this paper, a shift in the dominant flow of visual information is uncovered: (1) in shallow layers, strong interactions are observed between image tokens and instruction tokens, where most visual information is injected into instruction tokens to form cross-modal semantic representations; (2) in deeper layers, image tokens primarily interact with each other, aggregating the remaining visual information to optimize semantic representations within visual modality. Based on these insights, we propose Hierarchical Modality-Aware Pruning (HiMAP), a plug-and-play inference acceleration method that dynamically prunes image tokens at specific layers, reducing computational costs by approximately 65% without sacrificing performance. Our findings offer a new understanding of visual information processing in MLLMs and provide a state-of-the-art solution for efficient inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chandan Tankala, Dheeraj M. Nagaraj, Anant Raj</p>
<p>Abstract: Gradient flow in the 2-Wasserstein space is widely used to optimize functionals over probability distributions and is typically implemented using an interacting particle system with $n$ particles. Analyzing these algorithms requires showing (a) that the finite-particle system converges and/or (b) that the resultant empirical distribution of the particles closely approximates the optimal distribution (i.e., propagation of chaos). However, establishing efficient sufficient conditions can be challenging, as the finite particle system may produce heavily dependent random variables.
  In this work, we study the virtual particle stochastic approximation, originally introduced for Stein Variational Gradient Descent. This method can be viewed as a form of stochastic gradient descent in the Wasserstein space and can be implemented efficiently. In popular settings, we demonstrate that our algorithm's output converges to the optimal distribution under conditions similar to those for the infinite particle limit, and it produces i.i.d. samples without the need to explicitly establish propagation of chaos bounds.</p>

<p>Abstract: Simulating the complex interactions between soft tissues and rigid anatomy is critical for applications in surgical training, planning, and robotic-assisted interventions. Traditional Finite Element Method (FEM)-based simulations, while accurate, are computationally expensive and impractical for real-time scenarios. Learning-based approaches have shown promise in accelerating predictions but have fallen short in modeling soft-rigid interactions effectively. We introduce MIXPINN, a physics-informed Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework for mixed-material simulations, explicitly capturing soft-rigid interactions using graph-based augmentations. Our approach integrates Virtual Nodes (VNs) and Virtual Edges (VEs) to enhance rigid body constraint satisfaction while preserving computational efficiency. By leveraging a graph-based representation of biomechanical structures, MIXPINN learns high-fidelity deformations from FEM-generated data and achieves real-time inference with sub-millimeter accuracy. We validate our method in a realistic clinical scenario, demonstrating superior performance compared to baseline GNN models and traditional FEM methods. Our results show that MIXPINN reduces computational cost by an order of magnitude while maintaining high physical accuracy, making it a viable solution for real-time surgical simulation and robotic-assisted procedures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weiyu Guo, Ziyang Chen, Shaoguang Wang, Jianxiang He, Yijie Xu, Jinhui Ye, Ying Sun, Hui Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding long video content is a complex endeavor that often relies on densely sampled frame captions or end-to-end feature selectors, yet these techniques commonly overlook the logical relationships between textual queries and visual elements. In practice, computational constraints necessitate coarse frame subsampling, a challenge analogous to ``finding a needle in a haystack.'' To address this issue, we introduce a semantics-driven search framework that reformulates keyframe selection under the paradigm of Visual Semantic-Logical Search. Specifically, we systematically define four fundamental logical dependencies: 1) spatial co-occurrence, 2) temporal proximity, 3) attribute dependency, and 4) causal order. These relations dynamically update frame sampling distributions through an iterative refinement process, enabling context-aware identification of semantically critical frames tailored to specific query requirements. Our method establishes new SOTA performance on the manually annotated benchmark in key-frame selection metrics. Furthermore, when applied to downstream video question-answering tasks, the proposed approach demonstrates the best performance gains over existing methods on LongVideoBench and Video-MME, validating its effectiveness in bridging the logical gap between textual queries and visual-temporal reasoning. The code will be publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicolas Espinosa-Dice, Sanjiban Choudhury, Wen Sun, Gokul Swamy</p>
<p>Abstract: Interactive imitation learning (IL) is a powerful paradigm for learning to make sequences of decisions from an expert demonstrating how to perform a task. Prior work in efficient imitation learning has focused on the realizable setting, where the expert's policy lies within the learner's policy class (i.e. the learner can perfectly imitate the expert in all states). However, in practice, perfect imitation of the expert is often impossible due to differences in state information and action space expressiveness (e.g. morphological differences between robots and humans.) In this paper, we consider the more general misspecified setting, where no assumptions are made about the expert policy's realizability. We introduce a novel structural condition, reward-agnostic policy completeness, and prove that it is sufficient for interactive IL algorithms to efficiently avoid the quadratically compounding errors that stymie offline approaches like behavioral cloning. We address an additional practical constraint-the case of limited expert data-and propose a principled method for using additional offline data to further improve the sample-efficiency of interactive IL algorithms. Finally, we empirically investigate the optimal reset distribution in efficient IL under misspecification with a suite of continuous control tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wensheng Wang, Ning Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: The acquisition of large-scale and diverse demonstration data are essential for improving robotic imitation learning generalization. However, generating such data for complex manipulations is challenging in real-world settings. We introduce HybridGen, an automated framework that integrates Vision-Language Model (VLM) and hybrid planning. HybridGen uses a two-stage pipeline: first, VLM to parse expert demonstrations, decomposing tasks into expert-dependent (object-centric pose transformations for precise control) and plannable segments (synthesizing diverse trajectories via path planning); second, pose transformations substantially expand the first-stage data. Crucially, HybridGen generates a large volume of training data without requiring specific data formats, making it broadly applicable to a wide range of imitation learning algorithms, a characteristic which we also demonstrate empirically across multiple algorithms. Evaluations across seven tasks and their variants demonstrate that agents trained with HybridGen achieve substantial performance and generalization gains, averaging a 5% improvement over state-of-the-art methods. Notably, in the most challenging task variants, HybridGen achieves significant improvement, reaching a 59.7% average success rate, significantly outperforming Mimicgen's 49.5%. These results demonstrating its effectiveness and practicality.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multi-source information fusion (MSIF) leverages diverse data streams to enhance decision-making, situational awareness, and system resilience. Federated Learning (FL) enables MSIF while preserving privacy but suffers from client drift under high data heterogeneity, leading to performance degradation. Traditional mitigation strategies rely on reference-based gradient adjustments, which can be unstable in partial participation settings. To address this, we propose Gradient Centralized Federated Learning (GC-Fed), a reference-free gradient correction method inspired by Gradient Centralization (GC). We introduce Local GC and Global GC, applying GC during local training and global aggregation, respectively. Our hybrid GC-Fed approach selectively applies GC at the feature extraction layer locally and at the classifier layer globally, improving training stability and model performance. Theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrate that GC-Fed mitigates client drift and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy gains of up to 20% in heterogeneous settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dingning Liu, Cheng Wang, Peng Gao, Renrui Zhang, Xinzhu Ma, Yuan Meng, Zhihui Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities across a variety of tasks, especially when equipped with carefully designed visual prompts. However, existing studies primarily focus on logical reasoning and visual understanding, while the capability of MLLMs to operate effectively in 3D vision remains an ongoing area of exploration. In this paper, we introduce a novel visual prompting method, called 3DAxisPrompt, to elicit the 3D understanding capabilities of MLLMs in real-world scenes. More specifically, our method leverages the 3D coordinate axis and masks generated from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to provide explicit geometric priors to MLLMs and then extend their impressive 2D grounding and reasoning ability to real-world 3D scenarios. Besides, we first provide a thorough investigation of the potential visual prompting formats and conclude our findings to reveal the potential and limits of 3D understanding capabilities in GPT-4o, as a representative of MLLMs. Finally, we build evaluation environments with four datasets, i.e., ScanRefer, ScanNet, FMB, and nuScene datasets, covering various 3D tasks. Based on this, we conduct extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Overall, our study reveals that MLLMs, with the help of 3DAxisPrompt, can effectively perceive an object's 3D position in real-world scenarios. Nevertheless, a single prompt engineering approach does not consistently achieve the best outcomes for all 3D tasks. This study highlights the feasibility of leveraging MLLMs for 3D vision grounding/reasoning with prompt engineering techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiman Bao, Jie Gao, Jinke He, Frans A. Oliehoek, Oded Cats</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficient timing in ride-matching is crucial for improving the performance of ride-hailing and ride-pooling services, as it determines the number of drivers and passengers considered in each matching process. Traditional batched matching methods often use fixed time intervals to accumulate ride requests before assigning matches. While this approach increases the number of available drivers and passengers for matching, it fails to adapt to real-time supply-demand fluctuations, often leading to longer passenger wait times and driver idle periods. To address this limitation, we propose an adaptive ride-matching strategy using deep reinforcement learning (RL) to dynamically determine when to perform matches based on real-time system conditions. Unlike fixed-interval approaches, our method continuously evaluates system states and executes matching at moments that minimize total passenger wait time. Additionally, we incorporate a potential-based reward shaping (PBRS) mechanism to mitigate sparse rewards, accelerating RL training and improving decision quality. Extensive empirical evaluations using a realistic simulator trained on real-world data demonstrate that our approach outperforms fixed-interval matching strategies, significantly reducing passenger waiting times and detour delays, thereby enhancing the overall efficiency of ride-hailing and ride-pooling systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sinan Fan, Liang Xie, Chen Shen, Ge Teng, Xiaosong Yuan, Xiaofeng Zhang, Chenxi Huang, Wenxiao Wang, Xiaofei He, Jieping Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Prompt-tuning (PT) for large language models (LLMs) can facilitate the performance on various conventional NLP tasks with significantly fewer trainable parameters. However, our investigation reveals that PT provides limited improvement and may even degrade the primitive performance of LLMs on complex reasoning tasks. Such a phenomenon suggests that soft prompts can positively impact certain instances while negatively affecting others, particularly during the later phases of reasoning. To address these challenges, We first identify an information accumulation within the soft prompts. Through detailed analysis, we demonstrate that this phenomenon is often accompanied by erroneous information flow patterns in the deeper layers of the model, which ultimately lead to incorrect reasoning outcomes. we propose a novel method called \textbf{D}ynamic \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{C}orruption (DPC) to take better advantage of soft prompts in complex reasoning tasks, which dynamically adjusts the influence of soft prompts based on their impact on the reasoning process. Specifically, DPC consists of two stages: Dynamic Trigger and Dynamic Corruption. First, Dynamic Trigger measures the impact of soft prompts, identifying whether beneficial or detrimental. Then, Dynamic Corruption mitigates the negative effects of soft prompts by selectively masking key tokens that interfere with the reasoning process. We validate the proposed approach through extensive experiments on various LLMs and reasoning tasks, including GSM8K, MATH, and AQuA. Experimental results demonstrate that DPC can consistently enhance the performance of PT, achieving 4\%-8\% accuracy gains compared to vanilla prompt tuning, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach and its potential to enhance complex reasoning in LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marvin Seyfarth, Salman Ul Hassan Dar, Isabelle Ayx, Matthias Alexander Fink, Stefan O. Schoenberg, Hans-Ulrich Kauczor, Sandy Engelhardt</p>
<p>Abstract: Advancements in AI for medical imaging offer significant potential. However, their applications are constrained by the limited availability of data and the reluctance of medical centers to share it due to patient privacy concerns. Generative models present a promising solution by creating synthetic data as a substitute for real patient data. However, medical images are typically high-dimensional, and current state-of-the-art methods are often impractical for computational resource-constrained healthcare environments. These models rely on data sub-sampling, raising doubts about their feasibility and real-world applicability. Furthermore, many of these models are evaluated on quantitative metrics that alone can be misleading in assessing the image quality and clinical meaningfulness of the generated images. To address this, we introduce MedLoRD, a generative diffusion model designed for computational resource-constrained environments. MedLoRD is capable of generating high-dimensional medical volumes with resolutions up to 512$\times$512$\times$256, utilizing GPUs with only 24GB VRAM, which are commonly found in standard desktop workstations. MedLoRD is evaluated across multiple modalities, including Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography and Lung Computed Tomography datasets. Extensive evaluations through radiological evaluation, relative regional volume analysis, adherence to conditional masks, and downstream tasks show that MedLoRD generates high-fidelity images closely adhering to segmentation mask conditions, surpassing the capabilities of current state-of-the-art generative models for medical image synthesis in computational resource-constrained environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jie Huang, Haorui Chen, Jiaxuan Ren, Siran Peng, Liangjian Deng</p>
<p>Abstract: Currently, deep learning-based methods for remote sensing pansharpening have advanced rapidly. However, many existing methods struggle to fully leverage feature heterogeneity and redundancy, thereby limiting their effectiveness. We use the covariance matrix to model the feature heterogeneity and redundancy and propose Correlation-Aware Covariance Weighting (CACW) to adjust them. CACW captures these correlations through the covariance matrix, which is then processed by a nonlinear function to generate weights for adjustment. Building upon CACW, we introduce a general adaptive dual-level weighting mechanism (ADWM) to address these challenges from two key perspectives, enhancing a wide range of existing deep-learning methods. First, Intra-Feature Weighting (IFW) evaluates correlations among channels within each feature to reduce redundancy and enhance unique information. Second, Cross-Feature Weighting (CFW) adjusts contributions across layers based on inter-layer correlations, refining the final output. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of ADWM compared to recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of our approach through generality experiments, redundancy visualization, comparison experiments, key variables and complexity analysis, and ablation studies.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chi Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite significant achievements in improving the instruction-following capabilities of large language models (LLMs), the ability to process multiple potentially entangled or conflicting instructions remains a considerable challenge. Real-world scenarios often require consistency across multiple instructions over time, such as secret privacy, personal preferences, and prioritization, which demand sophisticated abilities to integrate multiple turns and carefully balance competing objectives when instructions intersect or conflict. This work presents a systematic investigation of LLMs' capabilities in handling multiple turns of instructions, covering three levels of difficulty: (1) retrieving information from instructions, (2) tracking and reasoning across turns, and (3) resolving conflicts among instructions. We construct MultiTurnInstruct with around 1.1K high-quality multi-turn conversations through the human-in-the-loop approach and result in nine capability categories, including statics and dynamics, reasoning, and multitasking. Our finding reveals an intriguing trade-off between different capabilities. While GPT models demonstrate superior memorization, they show reduced effectiveness in privacy-protection tasks requiring selective information withholding. Larger models exhibit stronger reasoning capabilities but still struggle with resolving conflicting instructions. Importantly, these performance gaps cannot be attributed solely to information loss, as models demonstrate strong BLEU scores on memorization tasks but their attention mechanisms fail to integrate multiple related instructions effectively. These findings highlight critical areas for improvement in complex real-world tasks involving multi-turn instructions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has overwhelmed healthcare systems, emphasizing the need for AI-driven tools to assist in rapid and accurate patient prognosis. Chest X-ray imaging is a widely available diagnostic tool, but existing methods for prognosis classification lack scalability and efficiency. Objective: This study presents a high-accuracy deep learning model for classifying COVID-19 severity (Mild, Moderate, and Severe) using Chest X-ray images, developed on Microsoft Azure Custom Vision. Methods: Using a dataset of 1,103 confirmed COVID-19 X-ray images from AIforCOVID, we trained and validated a deep learning model leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model was evaluated on an unseen dataset to measure accuracy, precision, and recall. Results: Our model achieved an average accuracy of 97%, with specificity of 99%, sensitivity of 87%, and an F1-score of 93.11%. When classifying COVID-19 severity, the model achieved accuracies of 89.03% (Mild), 95.77% (Moderate), and 81.16% (Severe). These results demonstrate the model's potential for real-world clinical applications, aiding in faster decision-making and improved resource allocation. Conclusion: AI-driven prognosis classification using deep learning can significantly enhance COVID-19 patient management, enabling early intervention and efficient triaging. Our study provides a scalable, high-accuracy AI framework for integrating deep learning into routine clinical workflows. Future work should focus on expanding datasets, external validation, and regulatory compliance to facilitate clinical adoption.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinkai Zou, Yan Liu, Xiongbo Shi, Chen Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: As requirements drift with rapid iterations, agile development becomes the dominant paradigm. Goal-driven Requirements Elicitation (RE) is a pivotal yet challenging task in agile project development due to its heavy tangling with adaptive planning and efficient collaboration. Recently, AI agents have shown promising ability in supporting requirements analysis by saving significant time and effort for stakeholders. However, current research mainly focuses on functional RE, and research works have not been reported bridging the long journey from goal to user stories. Moreover, considering the cost of LLM facilities and the need for data and idea protection, privately hosted small-sized LLM should be further utilized in RE. To address these challenges, we propose Goal2Story, a multi-agent fleet that adopts the Impact Mapping (IM) framework while merely using cost-effective sLLMs for goal-driven RE. Moreover, we introduce a StorySeek dataset that contains over 1,000 user stories (USs) with corresponding goals and project context information, as well as the semi-automatic dataset construction method. For evaluation, we proposed two metrics: Factuality Hit Rate (FHR) to measure consistency between the generated USs with the dataset and Quality And Consistency Evaluation (QuACE) to evaluate the quality of the generated USs. Experimental results demonstrate that Goal2Story outperforms the baseline performance of the Super-Agent adopting powerful LLMs, while also showcasing the performance improvements in key metrics brought by CoT and Agent Profile to Goal2Story, as well as its exploration in identifying latent needs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Patient matching is the process of linking patients to appropriate clinical trials by accurately identifying and matching their medical records with trial eligibility criteria. We propose LLM-Match, a novel framework for patient matching leveraging fine-tuned open-source large language models. Our approach consists of four key components. First, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) module extracts relevant patient context from a vast pool of electronic health records (EHRs). Second, a prompt generation module constructs input prompts by integrating trial eligibility criteria (both inclusion and exclusion criteria), patient context, and system instructions. Third, a fine-tuning module with a classification head optimizes the model parameters using structured prompts and ground-truth labels. Fourth, an evaluation module assesses the fine-tuned model's performance on the testing datasets. We evaluated LLM-Match on four open datasets, n2c2, SIGIR, TREC 2021, and TREC 2022, using open-source models, comparing it against TrialGPT, Zero-Shot, and GPT-4-based closed models.

<p>Abstract: Inference-time optimization scales computation to derive deliberate reasoning steps for effective performance. While previous search-based strategies address the short-sightedness of auto-regressive generation, the vast search space leads to excessive exploration and insufficient exploitation. To strike an efficient balance to derive the optimal step, we frame the decoding strategy as foresight sampling, leveraging simulated future steps to obtain globally optimal step estimation. Built on it, we propose a novel decoding strategy, named $\phi$-Decoding. To provide a precise and expressive estimation of step value, $\phi$-Decoding approximates two distributions via foresight and clustering. Sampling from the joint distribution, the optimal steps can be selected for exploitation. To support adaptive computation allocation, we propose in-width and in-depth pruning strategies, featuring a light-weight solution to achieve inference efficiency. Extensive experiments across seven benchmarks show $\phi$-Decoding outperforms strong baselines in both performance and efficiency. Additional analysis demonstrates its generalization across various LLMs and scalability across a wide range of computing budgets. The code will be released at https://github.com/xufangzhi/phi-Decoding, and the open-source PyPI package is coming soon.</p>

However, when it comes to long context scenarios, the performance of LLMs degrades due to some challenges. To alleviate this phenomenon, there is a number of work proposed recently. In this survey, we first list the challenges of applying pre-trained LLMs to process long contexts. Then systematically review the approaches related to long context and propose our taxonomy categorizing them into four main types: positional encoding, context compression, retrieval augmented, and attention pattern. In addition to the approaches, we focus on the evaluation of long context, organizing relevant data, tasks, and metrics based on existing long context benchmarks. Finally, we summarize unresolved issues in the long context domain and put forward our views on future developments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chi Han, Heng Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: Most written natural languages are composed of sequences of words and sentences. Similar to humans, large language models (LLMs) exhibit flexibility in handling textual positions - a phenomenon we term position generalization. They can understand texts with position perturbations and generalize to longer texts than those encountered during training with the latest techniques. These phenomena suggest that LLMs handle positions tolerantly, but how LLMs computationally process positional relevance remains largely unexplored. This work connects the linguistic phenomenon with LLMs' computational mechanisms. We show how LLMs enforce certain computational mechanisms for the aforementioned tolerance in position perturbations. Despite the complex design of the self-attention mechanism, this work reveals that LLMs learn a counterintuitive disentanglement of attention logits. Their values show a 0.959 linear correlation with an approximation of the arithmetic sum of positional relevance and semantic importance. Furthermore, we identify a prevalent pattern in intermediate features, which we prove theoretically enables this effect. The pattern, which is different from how randomly initialized parameters would behave, suggests that it is a learned behavior rather than a natural result of the model architecture. Based on these findings, we provide computational explanations and criteria for LLMs' position flexibilities. This work takes a pioneering step in linking position generalization with modern LLMs' internal mechanisms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Farnoush Bayatmakou, Reza Taleei, Milad Amir Toutounchian, Arash Mohammadi</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite advancements in Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems, breast cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths among women worldwide. Recent breakthroughs in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have shown significant promise in development of advanced Deep Learning (DL) architectures for breast cancer diagnosis through mammography. In this context, the paper focuses on the integration of AI within a Human-Centric workflow to enhance breast cancer diagnostics. Key challenges are, however, largely overlooked such as reliance on detailed tumor annotations and susceptibility to missing views, particularly during test time. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid, multi-scale and multi-view Swin Transformer-based framework (MSMV-Swin) that enhances diagnostic robustness and accuracy. The proposed MSMV-Swin framework is designed to work as a decision-support tool, helping radiologists analyze multi-view mammograms more effectively. More specifically, the MSMV-Swin framework leverages the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to isolate the breast lobe, reducing background noise and enabling comprehensive feature extraction. The multi-scale nature of the proposed MSMV-Swin framework accounts for tumor-specific regions as well as the spatial characteristics of tissues surrounding the tumor, capturing both localized and contextual information. The integration of contextual and localized data ensures that MSMV-Swin's outputs align with the way radiologists interpret mammograms, fostering better human-AI interaction and trust. A hybrid fusion structure is then designed to ensure robustness against missing views, a common occurrence in clinical practice when only a single mammogram view is available.</p>

<p>Abstract: Context: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is transforming much of software development, yet its application in software architecture is still in its infancy, and no prior study has systematically addressed the topic. Aim: We aim to systematically synthesize the use, rationale, contexts, usability, and future challenges of GenAI in software architecture. Method: We performed a multivocal literature review (MLR), analyzing peer-reviewed and gray literature, identifying current practices, models, adoption contexts, and reported challenges, extracting themes via open coding. Results: Our review identified significant adoption of GenAI for architectural decision support and architectural reconstruction. OpenAI GPT models are predominantly applied, and there is consistent use of techniques such as few-shot prompting and retrieved-augmented generation (RAG). GenAI has been applied mostly to initial stages of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), such as Requirements-to-Architecture and Architecture-to-Code. Monolithic and microservice architectures were the dominant targets. However, rigorous testing of GenAI outputs was typically missing from the studies. Among the most frequent challenges are model precision, hallucinations, ethical aspects, privacy issues, lack of architecture-specific datasets, and the absence of sound evaluation frameworks. Conclusions: GenAI shows significant potential in software design, but several challenges remain on its path to greater adoption. Research efforts should target designing general evaluation methodologies, handling ethics and precision, increasing transparency and explainability, and promoting architecture-specific datasets and benchmarks to bridge the gap between theoretical possibilities and practical use.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marcello Iotti, Paolo Davini, Jost von Hardenberg, Giuseppe Zappa</p>
<p>Abstract: To this day, accurately simulating local-scale precipitation and reliably reproducing its distribution remains a challenging task. The limited horizontal resolution of Global Climate Models is among the primary factors undermining their skill in this context. The physical mechanisms driving the onset and development of precipitation, especially in extreme events, operate at spatio-temporal scales smaller than those numerically resolved, thus struggling to be captured accurately. In order to circumvent this limitation, several downscaling approaches have been developed over the last decades to address the discrepancy between the spatial resolution of models output and the resolution required by local-scale applications. In this paper, we introduce RainScaleGAN, a conditional deep convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for precipitation downscaling. GANs have been effectively used in image super-resolution, an approach highly relevant for downscaling tasks. RainScaleGAN's capabilities are tested in a perfect-model setup, where the spatial resolution of a precipitation dataset is artificially degraded from 0.25$^{\circ}\times$0.25$^{\circ}$ to 2$^{\circ}\times$2$^\circ$, and RainScaleGAN is used to restore it. The developed model outperforms one of the leading precipitation downscaling method found in the literature. RainScaleGAN not only generates a synthetic dataset featuring plausible high-resolution spatial patterns and intensities, but also produces a precipitation distribution with statistics closely mirroring those of the ground-truth dataset. Given that RainScaleGAN's approach is agnostic with respect to the underlying physics, the method has the potential to be applied to other physical variables such as surface winds or temperature.</p>

<p>Abstract: Extracting structured labels from radiology reports has been employed to create vision models to simultaneously detect several types of abnormalities. However, existing works focus mainly on the chest region. Few works have been investigated on abdominal radiology reports due to more complex anatomy and a wider range of pathologies in the abdomen. We propose LEAVS (Large language model Extractor for Abdominal Vision Supervision). This labeler can annotate the certainty of presence and the urgency of seven types of abnormalities for nine abdominal organs on CT radiology reports. To ensure broad coverage, we chose abnormalities that encompass most of the finding types from CT reports. Our approach employs a specialized chain-of-thought prompting strategy for a locally-run LLM using sentence extraction and multiple-choice questions in a tree-based decision system. We demonstrate that the LLM can extract several abnormality types across abdominal organs with an average F1 score of 0.89, significantly outperforming competing labelers and humans. Additionally, we show that extraction of urgency labels achieved performance comparable to human annotations. Finally, we demonstrate that the abnormality labels contain valuable information for training a single vision model that classifies several organs as normal or abnormal. We release our code and structured annotations for a public CT dataset containing over 1,000 CT volumes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sang Truong, Yuheng Tu, Percy Liang, Bo Li, Sanmi Koyejo</p>
<p>Abstract: Comprehensive evaluations of language models (LM) during both development and deployment phases are necessary because these models possess numerous capabilities (e.g., mathematical reasoning, legal support, or medical diagnostic) as well as safety risks (e.g., racial bias, toxicity, or misinformation). The average score across a wide range of benchmarks provides a signal that helps guide the use of these LMs in practice. Currently, holistic evaluations are costly due to the large volume of benchmark questions, making frequent evaluations impractical. A popular attempt to lower the cost is to compute the average score on a subset of the benchmark. This approach, unfortunately, often renders an unreliable measure of LM performance because the average score is often confounded with the difficulty of the questions in the benchmark subset. Item response theory (IRT) was designed to address this challenge, providing a reliable measurement by careful controlling for question difficulty. Unfortunately, question difficulty is expensive to estimate. Facing this challenge, we train a model that predicts question difficulty from its content, enabling a reliable measurement at a fraction of the cost. In addition, we leverage this difficulty predictor to further improve the evaluation efficiency through training a question generator given a difficulty level. This question generator is essential in adaptive testing, where, instead of using a random subset of the benchmark questions, informative questions are adaptively chosen based on the current estimation of LLM performance. Experiments on 22 common natural language benchmarks and 172 LMs show that this approach is more reliable and efficient compared to current common practice.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ying Jiao, Luc De Raedt, Giuseppe Marra</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models have been used to translate natural language questions to SQL queries. Without hard constraints on syntax and database schema, they occasionally produce invalid queries that are not executable. These failures limit the usage of these systems in real-life scenarios. We propose a neurosymbolic framework that imposes SQL syntax and schema constraints with unification-based definite clause grammars and thus guarantees the generation of valid queries. Our framework also builds a bi-directional interface to language models to leverage their natural language understanding abilities. The evaluation results on a subset of SQL grammars show that all our output queries are valid. This work is the first step towards extending language models with unification-based grammars. We demonstrate this extension enhances the validity, execution accuracy, and ground truth alignment of the underlying language model by a large margin.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hai-Long Sun, Zhun Sun, Houwen Peng, Han-Jia Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated enhanced reasoning capabilities, evolving from Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to advanced, product-oriented solutions like OpenAI o1. During our re-implementation of this model, we noticed that in multimodal tasks requiring visual input (e.g., geometry problems), Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) struggle to maintain focus on the visual information, in other words, MLLMs suffer from a gradual decline in attention to visual information as reasoning progresses, causing text-over-relied outputs. To investigate this, we ablate image inputs during long-chain reasoning. Concretely, we truncate the reasoning process midway, then re-complete the reasoning process with the input image removed. We observe only a ~2% accuracy drop on MathVista's test-hard subset, revealing the model's textual outputs dominate the following reasoning process. Motivated by this, we propose Take-along Visual Conditioning (TVC), a strategy that shifts image input to critical reasoning stages and compresses redundant visual tokens via dynamic pruning. This methodology helps the model retain attention to the visual components throughout the reasoning. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on average across five mathematical reasoning benchmarks (+3.4% vs previous sota), demonstrating the effectiveness of TVC in enhancing multimodal reasoning systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengyao Lyu, Yan Li, Huasong Zhong, Wenhao Yang, Hui Chen, Jungong Han, Guiguang Ding, Zhenheng Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: The hypothesis that pretrained large language models (LLMs) necessitate only minimal supervision during the fine-tuning (SFT) stage (Zhou et al., 2024) has been substantiated by recent advancements in data curation and selection research. However, their stability and generalizability are compromised due to the vulnerability to experimental setups and validation protocols, falling short of surpassing random sampling (Diddee & Ippolito, 2024; Xia et al., 2024b). Built upon LLMs, multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs), combined with the sheer token volume and heightened heterogeneity of data sources, amplify both the significance and complexity of data selection.
  To harvest multi-modal instructional data in a robust and efficient manner, we re-define the granularity of the quality metric by decomposing it into 14 vision-language-related capabilities, and introduce multi-modal rich scorers to evaluate the capabilities of each data candidate. To promote diversity, in light of the inherent objective of the alignment stage, we take interaction style as diversity indicator and use a multi-modal rich styler to identify data instruction patterns. In doing so, our multi-modal rich scorers and styler (mmSSR) guarantee that high-scoring information is conveyed to users in diversified forms. Free from embedding-based clustering or greedy sampling, mmSSR efficiently scales to millions of data with varying budget constraints, supports customization for general or specific capability acquisition, and facilitates training-free generalization to new domains for curation. Across 10+ experimental settings, validated by 14 multi-modal benchmarks, we demonstrate consistent improvements over random sampling, baseline strategies and state-of-the-art selection methods, achieving 99.1% of full performance with only 30% of the 2.6M data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qing Zhou, Junyu Gao, Qi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid growth of dataset scales has been a key driver in advancing deep learning research. However, as dataset scale increases, the training process becomes increasingly inefficient due to the presence of low-value samples, including excessive redundant samples, overly challenging samples, and inefficient easy samples that contribute little to model improvement.To address this challenge, we propose Scale Efficient Training (SeTa) for large datasets, a dynamic sample pruning approach that losslessly reduces training time. To remove low-value samples, SeTa first performs random pruning to eliminate redundant samples, then clusters the remaining samples according to their learning difficulty measured by loss. Building upon this clustering, a sliding window strategy is employed to progressively remove both overly challenging and inefficient easy clusters following an easy-to-hard curriculum.We conduct extensive experiments on large-scale synthetic datasets, including ToCa, SS1M, and ST+MJ, each containing over 3 million samples.SeTa reduces training costs by up to 50\% while maintaining or improving performance, with minimal degradation even at 70\% cost reduction. Furthermore, experiments on various scale real datasets across various backbones (CNNs, Transformers, and Mambas) and diverse tasks (instruction tuning, multi-view stereo, geo-localization, composed image retrieval, referring image segmentation) demonstrate the powerful effectiveness and universality of our approach.

<p>Abstract: Scientific research demands sophisticated reasoning over multimodal data, a challenge especially prevalent in biology. Despite recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for AI-assisted research, existing multimodal reasoning benchmarks only target up to college-level difficulty, while research-level benchmarks emphasize lower-level perception, falling short of the complex multimodal reasoning needed for scientific discovery. To bridge this gap, we introduce MicroVQA, a visual-question answering (VQA) benchmark designed to assess three reasoning capabilities vital in research workflows: expert image understanding, hypothesis generation, and experiment proposal. MicroVQA consists of 1,042 multiple-choice questions (MCQs) curated by biology experts across diverse microscopy modalities, ensuring VQA samples represent real scientific practice. In constructing the benchmark, we find that standard MCQ generation methods induce language shortcuts, motivating a new two-stage pipeline: an optimized LLM prompt structures question-answer pairs into MCQs; then, an agent-based `RefineBot' updates them to remove shortcuts. Benchmarking on state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal a peak performance of 53\%; models with smaller LLMs only slightly underperform top models, suggesting that language-based reasoning is less challenging than multimodal reasoning; and tuning with scientific articles enhances performance. Expert analysis of chain-of-thought responses shows that perception errors are the most frequent, followed by knowledge errors and then overgeneralization errors. These insights highlight the challenges in multimodal scientific reasoning, showing MicroVQA is a valuable resource advancing AI-driven biomedical research.

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse tasks, largely driven by well-designed prompts. However, crafting and selecting such prompts often requires considerable human effort, significantly limiting its scalability. To mitigate this, recent studies have explored automated prompt optimization as a promising solution. Despite these efforts, existing methods still face critical challenges in robustness, efficiency, and generalization. To systematically address these challenges, we first conduct an empirical analysis to identify the limitations of current reflection-based prompt optimization paradigm. Building on these insights, we propose 7 innovative approaches inspired by traditional deep learning paradigms for prompt optimization (DLPO), seamlessly integrating these concepts into text-based gradient optimization. Through these advancements, we progressively tackle the aforementioned challenges and validate our methods through extensive experimentation.

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new solution to reward adaptation (RA), the problem where the learning agent adapts to a target reward function based on one or multiple existing behaviors learned a priori under the same domain dynamics but different reward functions. Learning the target behavior from scratch is possible but often inefficient given the available source behaviors. Our work represents a new approach to RA via the manipulation of Q-functions. Assuming that the target reward function is a known function of the source reward functions, our approach to RA computes bounds of the Q function. We introduce an iterative process to tighten the bounds, similar to value iteration. This enables action pruning in the target domain before learning even starts. We refer to such a method as Q-Manipulation (Q-M). We formally prove that our pruning strategy does not affect the optimality of the returned policy while empirically show that it improves the sample complexity. Q-M is evaluated in a variety of synthetic and simulation domains to demonstrate its effectiveness, generalizability, and practicality.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, intelligent decision-making techniques have gradually surpassed human levels in various human-machine competitions, especially in complex multi-agent cooperative task scenarios. Multi-agent cooperative decision-making involves multiple agents working together to complete established tasks and achieve specific objectives. These techniques are widely applicable in real-world scenarios such as autonomous driving, drone navigation, disaster rescue, and simulated military confrontations. This paper begins with a comprehensive survey of the leading simulation environments and platforms used for multi-agent cooperative decision-making. Specifically, we provide an in-depth analysis for these simulation environments from various perspectives, including task formats, reward allocation, and the underlying technologies employed. Subsequently, we provide a comprehensive overview of the mainstream intelligent decision-making approaches, algorithms and models for multi-agent systems (MAS). Theseapproaches can be broadly categorized into five types: rule-based (primarily fuzzy logic), game theory-based, evolutionary algorithms-based, deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)-based, and large language models(LLMs)reasoning-based. Given the significant advantages of MARL andLLMs-baseddecision-making methods over the traditional rule, game theory, and evolutionary algorithms, this paper focuses on these multi-agent methods utilizing MARL and LLMs-based techniques. We provide an in-depth discussion of these approaches, highlighting their methodology taxonomies, advantages, and drawbacks. Further, several prominent research directions in the future and potential challenges of multi-agent cooperative decision-making are also detailed.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shijie Fang, Wenchang Gao, Shivam Goel, Christopher Thierauf, Matthias Scheutz, Jivko Sinapov</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning to manipulate objects efficiently, particularly those involving sustained contact (e.g., pushing, sliding) and articulated parts (e.g., drawers, doors), presents significant challenges. Traditional methods, such as robot-centric reinforcement learning (RL), imitation learning, and hybrid techniques, require massive training and often struggle to generalize across different objects and robot platforms. We propose a novel framework for learning object-centric manipulation policies in force space, decoupling the robot from the object. By directly applying forces to selected regions of the object, our method simplifies the action space, reduces unnecessary exploration, and decreases simulation overhead. This approach, trained in simulation on a small set of representative objects, captures object dynamics -- such as joint configurations -- allowing policies to generalize effectively to new, unseen objects. Decoupling these policies from robot-specific dynamics enables direct transfer to different robotic platforms (e.g., Kinova, Panda, UR5) without retraining. Our evaluations demonstrate that the method significantly outperforms baselines, achieving over an order of magnitude improvement in training efficiency compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, operating in force space enhances policy transferability across diverse robot platforms and object types. We further showcase the applicability of our method in a real-world robotic setting. For supplementary materials and videos, please visit: https://tufts-ai-robotics-group.github.io/FLEX/</p>

<p>Abstract: The synergy between virtual reality (VR) and artificial intelligence (AI), specifically deep learning (DL)-based cybersickness detection models, has ushered in unprecedented advancements in immersive experiences by automatically detecting cybersickness severity and adaptively various mitigation techniques, offering a smooth and comfortable VR experience. While this DL-enabled cybersickness detection method provides promising solutions for enhancing user experiences, it also introduces new risks since these models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks; a small perturbation of the input data that is visually undetectable to human observers can fool the cybersickness detection model and trigger unexpected mitigation, thus disrupting user immersive experiences (UIX) and even posing safety risks. In this paper, we present a new type of VR attack, i.e., a cybersickness attack, which successfully stops the triggering of cybersickness mitigation by fooling DL-based cybersickness detection models and dramatically hinders the UIX. Next, we propose a novel explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)-guided cybersickness attack detection framework to detect such attacks in VR to ensure UIX and a comfortable VR experience. We evaluate the proposed attack and the detection framework using two state-of-the-art open-source VR cybersickness datasets: Simulation 2021 and Gameplay dataset. Finally, to verify the effectiveness of our proposed method, we implement the attack and the XAI-based detection using a testbed with a custom-built VR roller coaster simulation with an HTC Vive Pro Eye headset and perform a user study. Our study shows that such an attack can dramatically hinder the UIX. However, our proposed XAI-guided cybersickness attack detection can successfully detect cybersickness attacks and trigger the proper mitigation, effectively reducing VR cybersickness.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in solving reasoning, math and coding problems with Large Language Models (LLMs) have been enabled by investing substantial computation budgets at inference time. Therefore, inference speed is one of the most critical properties of LLM architectures, and there is a growing need for LLMs that are efficient and fast at inference. Recently, LLMs built on the xLSTM architecture have emerged as a powerful alternative to Transformers, offering linear compute scaling with sequence length and constant memory usage, both highly desirable properties for efficient inference. However, such xLSTM-based LLMs have yet to be scaled to larger models and assessed and compared with respect to inference speed and efficiency. In this work, we introduce xLSTM 7B, a 7-billion-parameter LLM that combines xLSTM's architectural benefits with targeted optimizations for fast and efficient inference. Our experiments demonstrate that xLSTM 7B achieves performance on downstream tasks comparable to other similar-sized LLMs, while providing significantly faster inference speeds and greater efficiency compared to Llama- and Mamba-based LLMs. These results establish xLSTM 7B as the fastest and most efficient 7B LLM, offering a solution for tasks that require large amounts of test-time computation. Our work highlights xLSTM's potential as a foundational architecture for methods building on heavy use of LLM inference. Our model weights, model code and training code are open-source.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas Monninger, Md Zafar Anwar, Stanislaw Antol, Steffen Staab, Sihao Ding</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous driving requires an understanding of the infrastructure elements, such as lanes and crosswalks. To navigate safely, this understanding must be derived from sensor data in real-time and needs to be represented in vectorized form. Learned Bird's-Eye View (BEV) encoders are commonly used to combine a set of camera images from multiple views into one joint latent BEV grid. Traditionally, from this latent space, an intermediate raster map is predicted, providing dense spatial supervision but requiring post-processing into the desired vectorized form. More recent models directly derive infrastructure elements as polylines using vectorized map decoders, providing instance-level information. Our approach, Augmentation Map Network (AugMapNet), proposes latent BEV grid augmentation, a novel technique that significantly enhances the latent BEV representation. AugMapNet combines vector decoding and dense spatial supervision more effectively than existing architectures while remaining as straightforward to integrate and as generic as auxiliary supervision. Experiments on nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate significant improvements in vectorized map prediction performance up to 13.3% over the StreamMapNet baseline on 60m range and greater improvements on larger ranges. We confirm transferability by applying our method to another baseline and find similar improvements. A detailed analysis of the latent BEV grid confirms a more structured latent space of AugMapNet and shows the value of our novel concept beyond pure performance improvement. The code will be released soon.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaowei Li, Lingen Li, Zhaoyang Zhang, Xiaoyu Li, Guangzhi Wang, Hongxiang Li, Xiaodong Cun, Ying Shan, Yuexian Zou</p>
<p>Abstract: Element-level visual manipulation is essential in digital content creation, but current diffusion-based methods lack the precision and flexibility of traditional tools. In this work, we introduce BlobCtrl, a framework that unifies element-level generation and editing using a probabilistic blob-based representation. By employing blobs as visual primitives, our approach effectively decouples and represents spatial location, semantic content, and identity information, enabling precise element-level manipulation. Our key contributions include: 1) a dual-branch diffusion architecture with hierarchical feature fusion for seamless foreground-background integration; 2) a self-supervised training paradigm with tailored data augmentation and score functions; and 3) controllable dropout strategies to balance fidelity and diversity. To support further research, we introduce BlobData for large-scale training and BlobBench for systematic evaluation. Experiments show that BlobCtrl excels in various element-level manipulation tasks while maintaining computational efficiency, offering a practical solution for precise and flexible visual content creation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Giacomo Arcieri, Konstantinos G. Papakonstantinou, Daniel Straub, Eleni Chatzi</p>
<p>Abstract: This work introduces a novel deep learning-based architecture, termed the Deep Belief Markov Model (DBMM), which provides efficient, model-formulation agnostic inference in Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) problems. The POMDP framework allows for modeling and solving sequential decision-making problems under observation uncertainty. In complex, high-dimensional, partially observable environments, existing methods for inference based on exact computations (e.g., via Bayes' theorem) or sampling algorithms do not scale well. Furthermore, ground truth states may not be available for learning the exact transition dynamics. DBMMs extend deep Markov models into the partially observable decision-making framework and allow efficient belief inference entirely based on available observation data via variational inference methods. By leveraging the potency of neural networks, DBMMs can infer and simulate non-linear relationships in the system dynamics and naturally scale to problems with high dimensionality and discrete or continuous variables. In addition, neural network parameters can be dynamically updated efficiently based on data availability. DBMMs can thus be used to infer a belief variable, thus enabling the derivation of POMDP solutions over the belief space. We evaluate the efficacy of the proposed methodology by evaluating the capability of model-formulation agnostic inference of DBMMs in benchmark problems that include discrete and continuous variables.</p>

<p>Abstract: Training manipulation policies for humanoid robots with diverse data enhances their robustness and generalization across tasks and platforms. However, learning solely from robot demonstrations is labor-intensive, requiring expensive tele-operated data collection which is difficult to scale. This paper investigates a more scalable data source, egocentric human demonstrations, to serve as cross-embodiment training data for robot learning. We mitigate the embodiment gap between humanoids and humans from both the data and modeling perspectives. We collect an egocentric task-oriented dataset (PH2D) that is directly aligned with humanoid manipulation demonstrations. We then train a human-humanoid behavior policy, which we term Human Action Transformer (HAT). The state-action space of HAT is unified for both humans and humanoid robots and can be differentiably retargeted to robot actions. Co-trained with smaller-scale robot data, HAT directly models humanoid robots and humans as different embodiments without additional supervision. We show that human data improves both generalization and robustness of HAT with significantly better data collection efficiency. Code and data: https://human-as-robot.github.io/</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ye Liu, Kevin Qinghong Lin, Chang Wen Chen, Mike Zheng Shou</p>
<p>Abstract: Videos, with their unique temporal dimension, demand precise grounded understanding, where answers are directly linked to visual, interpretable evidence. Despite significant breakthroughs in reasoning capabilities within Large Language Models, multi-modal reasoning - especially for videos - remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce VideoMind, a novel video-language agent designed for temporal-grounded video understanding. VideoMind incorporates two key innovations: (i) We identify essential capabilities for video temporal reasoning and develop a role-based agentic workflow, including a planner for coordinating different roles, a grounder for temporal localization, a verifier to assess temporal interval accuracy, and an answerer for question-answering. (ii) To efficiently integrate these diverse roles, we propose a novel Chain-of-LoRA strategy, enabling seamless role-switching via lightweight LoRA adaptors while avoiding the overhead of multiple models, thus balancing efficiency and flexibility. Extensive experiments on 14 public benchmarks demonstrate that our agent achieves state-of-the-art performance on diverse video understanding tasks, including 3 on grounded video question-answering, 6 on video temporal grounding, and 5 on general video question-answering, underscoring its effectiveness in advancing video agent and long-form temporal reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Noah Y. Siegel, Nicolas Heess, Maria Perez-Ortiz, Oana-Maria Camburu</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly capable, ensuring that their self-generated explanations are faithful to their internal decision-making process is critical for safety and oversight. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive counterfactual faithfulness analysis across 62 models from 8 families, encompassing both pretrained and instruction-tuned variants and significantly extending prior studies of counterfactual tests. We introduce phi-CCT, a simplified variant of the Correlational Counterfactual Test, which avoids the need for token probabilities while explaining most of the variance of the original test. Our findings reveal clear scaling trends: larger models are consistently more faithful on our metrics. However, when comparing instruction-tuned and human-imitated explanations, we find that observed differences in faithfulness can often be attributed to explanation verbosity, leading to shifts along the true-positive/false-positive Pareto frontier. While instruction-tuning and prompting can influence this trade-off, we find limited evidence that they fundamentally expand the frontier of explanatory faithfulness beyond what is achievable with pretrained models of comparable size. Our analysis highlights the nuanced relationship between instruction-tuning, verbosity, and the faithful representation of model decision processes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qin Liu, Wenxuan Zhou, Nan Xu, James Y. Huang, Fei Wang, Sheng Zhang, Hoifung Poon, Muhao Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: One critical challenge for large language models (LLMs) for making complex reasoning is their reliance on matching reasoning patterns from training data, instead of proactively selecting the most appropriate cognitive strategy to solve a given task. Existing approaches impose fixed cognitive structures that enhance performance in specific tasks but lack adaptability across diverse scenarios. To address this limitation, we introduce METASCALE, a test-time scaling framework based on meta-thoughts -- adaptive thinking strategies tailored to each task. METASCALE initializes a pool of candidate meta-thoughts, then iteratively selects and evaluates them using a multi-armed bandit algorithm with upper confidence bound selection, guided by a reward model. To further enhance adaptability, a genetic algorithm evolves high-reward meta-thoughts, refining and extending the strategy pool over time. By dynamically proposing and optimizing meta-thoughts at inference time, METASCALE improves both accuracy and generalization across a wide range of tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that MetaScale consistently outperforms standard inference approaches, achieving an 11% performance gain in win rate on Arena-Hard for GPT-4o, surpassing o1-mini by 0.9% under style control. Notably, METASCALE scales more effectively with increasing sampling budgets and produces more structured, expert-level responses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Robbert Reijnen, Igor G. Smit, Hongxiang Zhang, Yaoxin Wu, Zaharah Bukhsh, Yingqian Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Job shop scheduling problems address the routing and sequencing of tasks in a job shop setting. Despite significant interest from operations research and machine learning communities over the years, a comprehensive platform for testing and comparing solution methods has been notably lacking. To fill this gap, we introduce a unified implementation of job shop scheduling problems and their solution methods, addressing the long-standing need for a standardized benchmarking platform in this domain. Our platform supports classic Job Shop (JSP), Flow Shop (FSP), Flexible Job Shop (FJSP), and Assembly Job Shop (AJSP), as well as variants featuring Sequence-Dependent Setup Times (SDST), variants with online arrivals of jobs, and combinations of these problems (e.g., FJSP-SDST and FAJSP). The platfrom provides a wide range of scheduling solution methods, from heuristics, metaheuristics, and exact optimization to deep reinforcement learning. The implementation is available as an open-source GitHub repository, serving as a collaborative hub for researchers, practitioners, and those new to the field. Beyond enabling direct comparisons with existing methods on widely studied benchmark problems, this resource serves as a robust starting point for addressing constrained and complex problem variants. By establishing a comprehensive and unified foundation, this platform is designed to consolidate existing knowledge and to inspire the development of next-generation algorithms in job shop scheduling research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sungwoo Lee, Younghyun Oh, Hyunhoe An, Hyebhin Yoon, Karl J. Friston, Seok Jun Hong, Choong-Wan Woo</p>
<p>Abstract: Building autonomous -- i.e., choosing goals based on one's needs -- and adaptive -- i.e., surviving in ever-changing environments -- agents has been a holy grail of artificial intelligence (AI). A living organism is a prime example of such an agent, offering important lessons about adaptive autonomy. Here, we focus on interoception, a process of monitoring one's internal environment to keep it within certain bounds, which underwrites the survival of an organism. To develop AI with interoception, we need to factorize the state variables representing internal environments from external environments and adopt life-inspired mathematical properties of internal environment states. This paper offers a new perspective on how interoception can help build autonomous and adaptive agents by integrating the legacy of cybernetics with recent advances in theories of life, reinforcement learning, and neuroscience.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pranab Sahoo, Ayush Kumar Singh, Sriparna Saha, Vinija Jain, Samrat Mondal, Aman Chadha</p>
<p>Abstract: Prompt engineering has emerged as an indispensable technique for extending the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs). This approach leverages task-specific instructions, known as prompts, to enhance model efficacy without modifying the core model parameters. Rather than updating the model parameters, prompts allow seamless integration of pre-trained models into downstream tasks by eliciting desired model behaviors solely based on the given prompt. Prompts can be natural language instructions that provide context to guide the model or learned vector representations that activate relevant knowledge. This burgeoning field has enabled success across various applications, from question-answering to commonsense reasoning. However, there remains a lack of systematic organization and understanding of the diverse prompt engineering methods and techniques. This survey paper addresses the gap by providing a structured overview of recent advancements in prompt engineering, categorized by application area. For each prompting approach, we provide a summary detailing the prompting methodology, its applications, the models involved, and the datasets utilized. We also delve into the strengths and limitations of each approach and include a taxonomy diagram and table summarizing datasets, models, and critical points of each prompting technique. This systematic analysis enables a better understanding of this rapidly developing field and facilitates future research by illuminating open challenges and opportunities for prompt engineering.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in large language model-driven autonomous agents have revealed that multi-agent collaboration often surpasses each individual through collective reasoning. Inspired by the neural scaling law--increasing neurons enhances performance, this study explores whether the continuous addition of collaborative agents can yield similar benefits. Technically, we utilize directed acyclic graphs to organize agents into a multi-agent collaboration network (MacNet), upon which their interactive reasoning is topologically orchestrated for autonomous task solving. Extensive evaluations reveal that it effectively supports collaboration among over a thousand agents, with irregular topologies outperforming regular ones. We also identify a collaborative scaling law--the overall performance follows a logistic growth pattern as agents scale, with collaborative emergence occurring earlier than traditional neural emergence. We speculate this may be because scaling agents catalyzes their multidimensional considerations during interactive reflection and refinement, thereby producing more comprehensive artifacts.

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17714">Compositional Models for Estimating Causal Effects</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Purva Pruthi, David Jensen</p>
<p>Abstract: Many real-world systems can be usefully represented as sets of interacting components. Examples include computational systems, such as query processors and compilers, natural systems, such as cells and ecosystems, and social systems, such as families and organizations. However, current approaches to estimating potential outcomes and causal effects typically treat such systems as single units, represent them with a fixed set of variables, and assume a homogeneous data-generating process. In this work, we study a compositional approach for estimating individual-level potential outcomes and causal effects in structured systems, where each unit is represented by an instance-specific composition of multiple heterogeneous components. The compositional approach decomposes unit-level causal queries into more fine-grained queries, explicitly modeling how unit-level interventions affect component-level outcomes to generate a unit's outcome. We demonstrate this approach using modular neural network architectures and show that it provides benefits for causal effect estimation from observational data, such as accurate causal effect estimation for structured units, increased sample efficiency, improved overlap between treatment and control groups, and compositional generalization to units with unseen combinations of components. Remarkably, our results show that compositional modeling can improve the accuracy of causal estimation even when component-level outcomes are unobserved. We also create and use a set of real-world evaluation environments for the empirical evaluation of compositional approaches for causal effect estimation and demonstrate the role of composition structure, varying amounts of component-level data access, and component heterogeneity in the performance of compositional models as compared to the non-compositional approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability (MI) is an emerging sub-field of interpretability that seeks to understand a neural network model by reverse-engineering its internal computations. Recently, MI has garnered significant attention for interpreting transformer-based language models (LMs), resulting in many novel insights yet introducing new challenges.

To fill this gap, we provide a comprehensive survey from a task-centric perspective, organizing the taxonomy of MI research around specific research questions or tasks. We outline the fundamental objects of study in MI, along with the techniques, evaluation methods, and key findings for each task in the taxonomy. In particular, we present a task-centric taxonomy as a roadmap for beginners to navigate the field by helping them quickly identify impactful problems in which they are most interested and leverage MI for their benefit. Finally, we discuss the current gaps in the field and suggest potential future directions for MI research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chihcheng Hsieh, Catarina Moreira, Isabel Blanco Nobre, Sandra Costa Sousa, Chun Ouyang, Margot Brereton, Joaquim Jorge, Jacinto C. Nascimento</p>
<p>Abstract: X-ray images are vital in medical diagnostics, but their effectiveness is limited without clinical context. Radiologists often find chest X-rays insufficient for diagnosing underlying diseases, necessitating the integration of structured clinical features with radiology reports.
  To address this, we introduce DALL-M, a novel framework that enhances clinical datasets by generating contextual synthetic data. DALL-M augments structured patient data, including vital signs (e.g., heart rate, oxygen saturation), radiology findings (e.g., lesion presence), and demographic factors. It integrates this tabular data with contextual knowledge extracted from radiology reports and domain-specific resources (e.g., Radiopaedia, Wikipedia), ensuring clinical consistency and reliability.
  DALL-M follows a three-phase process: (i) clinical context storage, (ii) expert query generation, and (iii) context-aware feature augmentation. Using large language models (LLMs), it generates both contextual synthetic values for existing clinical features and entirely new, clinically relevant features.
  Applied to 799 cases from the MIMIC-IV dataset, DALL-M expanded the original 9 clinical features to 91. Empirical validation with machine learning models (including Decision Trees, Random Forests, XGBoost, and TabNET) demonstrated a 16.5% improvement in F1 score and a 25% increase in Precision and Recall.
  DALL-M bridges an important gap in clinical data augmentation by preserving data integrity while enhancing predictive modeling in healthcare. Our results show that integrating LLM-generated synthetic features significantly improves model performance, making DALL-M a scalable and practical approach for AI-driven medical diagnostics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haohan Lin, Zhiqing Sun, Sean Welleck, Yiming Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional language model-based theorem proving assumes that by training on a sufficient amount of formal proof data, a model will learn to prove theorems. Our key observation is that a wealth of informal information that is not present in formal proofs can be useful for learning to prove theorems. For instance, humans think through steps of a proof, but this thought process is not visible in the resulting code. We present Lean-STaR, a framework for training language models to produce informal thoughts prior to each step of a proof, thereby boosting the model's theorem-proving capabilities. Lean-STaR uses retrospective ground-truth tactics to generate synthetic thoughts for training the language model. At inference time, the trained model directly generates the thoughts prior to the prediction of the tactics in each proof step. Building on the self-taught reasoner framework, we then apply expert iteration to further fine-tune the model on the correct proofs it samples and verifies using the Lean solver. Lean-STaR achieves state-of-the-art results on the miniF2F-test benchmark within the Lean theorem proving environment, significantly outperforming base models ($\boldsymbol{43.4\% \rightarrow 46.3\%,}$ Pass@64). We also analyze the impact of the augmented thoughts on various aspects of the theorem proving process, providing insights into their effectiveness.</p>

The dataset construction approach integrates expert knowledge with the capabilities of advanced models, structured across two global stages.

In the second stage, we use Qwen2.5 Plus to annotate a random 10% of the coarse AI-related records, which are then used to train a BERT binary classifier. This step further refines the coarse AI related record set to obtain the final DeepDiveAI dataset. Evaluation results demonstrate that the entire workflow can efficiently and accurately identify AI-related literature from large-scale datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhikai Li, Xuewen Liu, Dongrong Joe Fu, Jianquan Li, Qingyi Gu, Kurt Keutzer, Zhen Dong</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of visual generative models necessitates efficient and reliable evaluation methods. Arena platform, which gathers user votes on model comparisons, can rank models with human preferences. However, traditional Arena methods, while established, require an excessive number of comparisons for ranking to converge and are vulnerable to preference noise in voting, suggesting the need for better approaches tailored to contemporary evaluation challenges. In this paper, we introduce K-Sort Arena, an efficient and reliable platform based on a key insight: images and videos possess higher perceptual intuitiveness than texts, enabling rapid evaluation of multiple samples simultaneously. Consequently, K-Sort Arena employs K-wise comparisons, allowing K models to engage in free-for-all competitions, which yield much richer information than pairwise comparisons. To enhance the robustness of the system, we leverage probabilistic modeling and Bayesian updating techniques. We propose an exploration-exploitation-based matchmaking strategy to facilitate more informative comparisons. In our experiments, K-Sort Arena exhibits 16.3x faster convergence compared to the widely used ELO algorithm. To further validate the superiority and obtain a comprehensive leaderboard, we collect human feedback via crowdsourced evaluations of numerous cutting-edge text-to-image and text-to-video models. Thanks to its high efficiency, K-Sort Arena can continuously incorporate emerging models and update the leaderboard with minimal votes. Our project has undergone several months of internal testing and is now available at https://huggingface.co/spaces/ksort/K-Sort-Arena</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tao Feng, Yanzhen Shen, Jiaxuan You</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapidly growing number and variety of Large Language Models (LLMs) present significant challenges in efficiently selecting the appropriate LLM for a given query, especially considering the trade-offs between performance and computational cost. Current LLM selection methods often struggle to generalize across new LLMs and different tasks because of their limited ability to leverage contextual interactions among tasks, queries, and LLMs, as well as their dependence on a transductive learning framework. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a novel inductive graph framework, named as GraphRouter, which fully utilizes the contextual information among tasks, queries, and LLMs to enhance the LLM selection process. GraphRouter constructs a heterogeneous graph comprising task, query, and LLM nodes, with interactions represented as edges, which efficiently captures the contextual information between the query's requirements and the LLM's capabilities. Through an innovative edge prediction mechanism, GraphRouter is able to predict attributes (the effect and cost of LLM response) of potential edges, allowing for optimized recommendations that adapt to both existing and newly introduced LLMs without requiring retraining. Comprehensive experiments across three distinct effect-cost weight scenarios have shown that GraphRouter substantially surpasses existing routers, delivering a minimum performance improvement of 12.3%. In addition, it achieves enhanced generalization across new LLMs settings and supports diverse tasks with at least a 9.5% boost in effect and a significant reduction in computational demands. This work endeavors to apply a graph-based approach for the contextual and adaptive selection of LLMs, offering insights for real-world applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yin Li, Liangwei Wang, Shiyuan Piao, Boo-Ho Yang, Ziyue Li, Wei Zeng, Fugee Tsung</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in code generation. However, in the factory automation sector, particularly motion control, manual programming, alongside inefficient and unsafe debugging practices, remains prevalent. This stems from the complex interplay of mechanical and electrical systems and stringent safety requirements. Moreover, most current AI-assisted motion control programming efforts focus on PLCs, with little attention given to high-level languages and function libraries. To address these challenges, we introduce MCCoder, an LLM-powered system tailored for generating motion control code, integrated with a soft-motion controller. MCCoder improves code generation through a structured workflow that combines multitask decomposition, hybrid retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and iterative self-correction, utilizing a well-established motion library. Additionally, it integrates a 3D simulator for intuitive motion validation and logs of full motion trajectories for data verification, significantly enhancing accuracy and safety. In the absence of benchmark datasets and metrics tailored for evaluating motion control code generation, we propose MCEVAL, a dataset spanning motion tasks of varying complexity. Experiments show that MCCoder outperforms baseline models using Advanced RAG, achieving an overall performance gain of 33.09% and a 131.77% improvement on complex tasks in the MCEVAL dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daijin Yang, Erica Kleinman, Casper Harteveld</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to GPT's impressive generative capabilities, its applications in games are expanding rapidly. To offer researchers a comprehensive understanding of the current applications and identify both emerging trends and unexplored areas, this paper introduces an updated scoping review of 177 articles, 122 of which were published in 2024, to explore GPT's potential for games. By coding and synthesizing the papers, we identify five prominent applications of GPT in current game research: procedural content generation, mixed-initiative game design, mixed-initiative gameplay, playing games, and game user research. Drawing on insights from these application areas and emerging research, we propose future studies should focus on expanding the technical boundaries of the GPT models and exploring the complex interaction dynamics between them and users. This review aims to illustrate the state of the art in innovative GPT applications in games, offering a foundation to enrich game development and enhance player experiences through cutting-edge AI innovations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Uttamasha Monjoree, Wei Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Spatial intelligence is important in Architecture, Construction, Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM), and Medicine. Understanding three-dimensional (3D) spatial rotations can involve verbal descriptions and visual or interactive examples, illustrating how objects change orientation in 3D space. Recent studies show Artificial Intelligence (AI) with language and vision capabilities still face limitations in spatial reasoning. In this paper, we have studied generative AI's spatial capabilities of understanding rotations of objects utilizing its image and language processing features. We examined the spatial intelligence of the GPT-4 model with vision in understanding spatial rotation process with diagrams based on the Revised Purdue Spatial Visualization Test: Visualization of Rotations (Revised PSVT:R). Next, we incorporated a layer of coordinate system axes on Revised PSVT:R to study the variations in GPT-4's performance. We also examined GPT-4's understanding of 3D rotations in Augmented Reality (AR) scenes that visualize spatial rotations of an object in 3D space and observed increased accuracy of GPT-4's understanding of the rotations by adding supplementary textual information depicting the rotation process or mathematical representations of the rotation (e.g., matrices). The results indicate that while GPT-4 as a major current Generative AI model lacks the understanding of a spatial rotation process, it has the potential to understand the rotation process with additional information that can be provided by methods such as AR. By combining the potentials in spatial intelligence of AI with AR's interactive visualization abilities, we expect to offer enhanced guidance for students' spatial learning activities. Such spatial guidance can benefit understanding spatial transformations and additionally support processes like assembly, fabrication, and manufacturing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francesco Taioli, Edoardo Zorzi, Gianni Franchi, Alberto Castellini, Alessandro Farinelli, Marco Cristani, Yiming Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Language-driven instance object navigation assumes that human users initiate the task by providing a detailed description of the target instance to the embodied agent.While this description is crucial for distinguishing the target from visually similar instances in a scene, providing it prior to navigation can be demanding for human. To bridge this gap, we introduce Collaborative Instance object Navigation (CoIN), a new task setting where the agent actively resolve uncertainties about the target instance during navigation in natural, template-free, open-ended dialogues with human. We propose a novel training-free method, Agent-user Interaction with UncerTainty Awareness (AIUTA), which operates independently from the navigation policy, and focuses on the human-agent interaction reasoning with Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs). First, upon object detection, a Self-Questioner model initiates a self-dialogue within the agent to obtain a complete and accurate observation description with a novel uncertainty estimation technique. Then, an Interaction Trigger module determines whether to ask a question to the human, continue or halt navigation, minimizing user input. For evaluation, we introduce CoIN-Bench, with a curated dataset designed for challenging multi-instance scenarios. CoIN-Bench supports both online evaluation with humans and reproducible experiments with simulated user-agent interactions. On CoIN-Bench, we show that AIUTA serves as a competitive baseline, while existing language-driven instance navigation methods struggle in complex multi-instance scenes. Code and benchmark will be available upon acceptance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenyu Wang, Weichao Zhou, Shantanu Ghosh, Kayhan Batmanghelich, Wenchao Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Radiology report generation (RRG) has shown great potential in assisting radiologists by automating the labor-intensive task of report writing. While recent advancements have improved the quality and coherence of generated reports, ensuring their factual correctness remains a critical challenge. Although generative medical Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) have been proposed to address this issue, these models are prone to hallucinations and can produce inaccurate diagnostic information. To address these concerns, we introduce a novel Semantic Consistency-Based Uncertainty Quantification framework that provides both report-level and sentence-level uncertainties. Unlike existing approaches, our method does not require modifications to the underlying model or access to its inner state, such as output token logits, thus serving as a plug-and-play module that can be seamlessly integrated with state-of-the-art models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our method in detecting hallucinations and enhancing the factual accuracy of automatically generated radiology reports. By abstaining from high-uncertainty reports, our approach improves factuality scores by $10$\%, achieved by rejecting $20$\% of reports using the \texttt{Radialog} model on the MIMIC-CXR dataset. Furthermore, sentence-level uncertainty flags the lowest-precision sentence in each report with an $82.9$\% success rate.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hang Luo, Jian Zhang, Chujun Li</p>
<p>Abstract: In knowledge-intensive tasks, especially in high-stakes domains like medicine and law, it is critical not only to retrieve relevant information but also to provide causal reasoning and explainability. Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in natural language understanding and generation tasks. However, they often suffer from limitations such as difficulty in incorporating new knowledge, generating hallucinations, and explaining their reasoning process. To address these challenges, integrating knowledge graphs with Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) has emerged as an effective solution. Traditional Graph RAG methods often rely on simple graph traversal or semantic similarity, which do not capture causal relationships or align well with the model's internal reasoning steps. This paper proposes a novel pipeline that filters large knowledge graphs to emphasize cause-effect edges, aligns the retrieval process with the model's chain-of-thought (CoT), and enhances reasoning through multi-stage path improvements. Experiments on medical question-answering tasks show consistent gains, with up to a 10\% absolute improvement across multiple large language models (LLMs). This approach demonstrates the value of combining causal reasoning with stepwise retrieval, leading to more interpretable and logically grounded solutions for complex queries.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> ShuiDe Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: In the study by Chen et al. (2023) [01], the large language model GPT demonstrated economic rationality comparable to or exceeding the average human level in tasks such as budget allocation and risk preference. Building on this finding, this paper further incorporates specialized agents, such as biotechnology experts and economists, for a horizontal comparison to explore whether specialization can enhance or maintain economic rationality equivalent to that of GPT in similar decision-making scenarios. The results indicate that when agents invest more effort in specialized fields, their decision-making behavior is more prone to 'rationality shift,' specifically manifested as increased violations of GARP (Generalized Axiom of Revealed Preference), decreased CCEI (Critical Cost Efficiency Index), and more significant decision deviations under high-risk conditions. In contrast, GPT and more generalized basic agents maintain a more stable and consistent level of rationality across multiple tasks. This study reveals the inherent conflict between specialization and economic rationality, providing new insights for constructing AI decision-making systems that balance specialization and generalization across various scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: As the open-weight AI landscape continues to proliferate-with model development, significant investment, and user interest-it becomes increasingly important to predict which models will ultimately drive innovation and shape AI ecosystems. Building on parallels with citation dynamics in scientific literature, we propose a framework to quantify how an open-weight model's influence evolves. Specifically, we adapt the model introduced by Wang et al. for scientific citations, using three key parameters-immediacy, longevity, and relative fitness-to track the cumulative number of fine-tuned models of an open-weight model. Our findings reveal that this citation-style approach can effectively capture the diverse trajectories of open-weight model adoption, with most models fitting well and outliers indicating unique patterns or abrupt jumps in usage.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weiyu Ma, Yuqian Fu, Zecheng Zhang, Guohao Li, Bernard Ghanem</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce VLM-Attention, a multimodal StarCraft II environment that aligns artificial agent perception with the human gameplay experience. Traditional frameworks such as SMAC rely on abstract state representations that diverge significantly from human perception, limiting the ecological validity of agent behavior. Our environment addresses this limitation by incorporating RGB visual inputs and natural language observations that more closely simulate human cognitive processes during gameplay. The VLM-Attention framework consists of three integrated components: (1) a vision-language model enhanced with specialized self-attention mechanisms for strategic unit targeting and battlefield assessment, (2) a retrieval-augmented generation system that leverages domain-specific StarCraft II knowledge to inform tactical decisions, and (3) a dynamic role-based task distribution system that enables coordinated multi-agent behavior. Our experimental evaluation across 21 custom scenarios demonstrates that VLM-based agents powered by foundation models (specifically Qwen-VL and GPT-4o) can execute complex tactical maneuvers without explicit training, achieving comparable performance to traditional MARL methods that require substantial training iterations. This work establishes a foundation for developing human-aligned StarCraft II agents and advances the broader research agenda of multimodal game AI.

<p>Abstract: Ensuring safe and effective use of AI requires understanding and anticipating its performance on novel tasks, from advanced scientific challenges to transformed workplace activities. So far, benchmarking has guided progress in AI, but it has offered limited explanatory and predictive power for general-purpose AI systems, given the low transferability across diverse tasks. In this paper, we introduce general scales for AI evaluation that can explain what common AI benchmarks really measure, extract ability profiles of AI systems, and predict their performance for new task instances, in- and out-of-distribution. Our fully-automated methodology builds on 18 newly-crafted rubrics that place instance demands on general scales that do not saturate. Illustrated for 15 large language models and 63 tasks, high explanatory power is unleashed from inspecting the demand and ability profiles, bringing insights on the sensitivity and specificity exhibited by different benchmarks, and how knowledge, metacognition and reasoning are affected by model size, chain-of-thought and distillation. Surprisingly, high predictive power at the instance level becomes possible using these demand levels, providing superior estimates over black-box baseline predictors based on embeddings or finetuning, especially in out-of-distribution settings (new tasks and new benchmarks). The scales, rubrics, battery, techniques and results presented here represent a major step for AI evaluation, underpinning the reliable deployment of AI in the years ahead.

While self-correction techniques refine outputs, they often introduce new errors. Existing methods focused on execution feedback mainly address syntax issues, leaving semantic errors -- where the query's logic fails to align with the user's intent -- largely unaddressed. We propose a novel approach combining structured execution feedback with a trained critic agent that provides detailed, interpretable critiques. This method effectively identifies and corrects both syntactic and semantic errors, enhancing accuracy and interpretability.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kuang-Da Wang, Ping-Chun Hsieh, Wen-Chih Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: Stackelberg games, widely applied in domains like economics and security, involve asymmetric interactions where a leader's strategy drives follower responses. Accurately modeling these dynamics allows domain experts to optimize strategies in interactive scenarios, such as turn-based sports like badminton. In multi-agent systems, agent behaviors are interdependent, and traditional Multi-Agent Imitation Learning (MAIL) methods often fail to capture these complex interactions. Correlated policies, which account for opponents' strategies, are essential for accurately modeling such dynamics. However, even methods designed for learning correlated policies, like CoDAIL, struggle in Stackelberg games due to their asymmetric decision-making, where leaders and followers cannot simultaneously account for each other's actions, often leading to non-correlated policies. Furthermore, existing MAIL methods that match occupancy measures or use adversarial techniques like GAIL or Inverse RL face scalability challenges, particularly in high-dimensional environments, and suffer from unstable training. To address these challenges, we propose a correlated policy occupancy measure specifically designed for Stackelberg games and introduce the Latent Stackelberg Differential Network (LSDN) to match it. LSDN models two-agent interactions as shared latent state trajectories and uses multi-output Geometric Brownian Motion (MO-GBM) to effectively capture joint policies. By leveraging MO-GBM, LSDN disentangles environmental influences from agent-driven transitions in latent space, enabling the simultaneous learning of interdependent policies. This design eliminates the need for adversarial training and simplifies the learning process. Extensive experiments on Iterative Matrix Games and multi-agent particle environments demonstrate that LSDN can better reproduce complex interaction dynamics than existing MAIL methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andy Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Siege, a multi-turn adversarial framework that models the gradual erosion of Large Language Model (LLM) safety through a tree search perspective. Unlike single-turn jailbreaks that rely on one meticulously engineered prompt, Siege expands the conversation at each turn in a breadth-first fashion, branching out multiple adversarial prompts that exploit partial compliance from previous responses. By tracking these incremental policy leaks and re-injecting them into subsequent queries, Siege reveals how minor concessions can accumulate into fully disallowed outputs. Evaluations on the JailbreakBench dataset show that Siege achieves a 100% success rate on GPT-3.5-turbo and 97% on GPT-4 in a single multi-turn run, using fewer queries than baselines such as Crescendo or GOAT. This tree search methodology offers an in-depth view of how model safeguards degrade over successive dialogue turns, underscoring the urgency of robust multi-turn testing procedures for language models.</p>

<p>Abstract: The construction of Generalized Knowledge Graph (GKG), including knowledge graph, event knowledge graph and commonsense knowledge graph, is fundamental for various natural language processing tasks. Current studies typically construct these types of graph separately, overlooking holistic insights and potential unification that could be beneficial in computing resources and usage perspectives. However, a key challenge in developing a unified framework for GKG is obstacles arising from task-specific differences. In this study, we propose a unified framework for constructing generalized knowledge graphs to address this challenge. First, we collect data from 15 sub-tasks in 29 datasets across the three types of graphs, categorizing them into in-sample, counter-task, and out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Then, we propose a three-stage curriculum learning fine-tuning framework, by iteratively injecting knowledge from the three types of graphs into the Large Language Models. Extensive experiments show that our proposed model improves the construction of all three graph types across in-domain, OOD and counter-task data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Satyapriya Krishna, Tessa Han, Alex Gu, Steven Wu, Shahin Jabbari, Himabindu Lakkaraju</p>
<p>Abstract: As various post hoc explanation methods are increasingly being leveraged to explain complex models in high-stakes settings, it becomes critical to develop a deeper understanding of if and when the explanations output by these methods disagree with each other, and how such disagreements are resolved in practice. However, there is little to no research that provides answers to these critical questions. In this work, we introduce and study the disagreement problem in explainable machine learning. More specifically, we formalize the notion of disagreement between explanations, analyze how often such disagreements occur in practice, and how practitioners resolve these disagreements. We first conduct interviews with data scientists to understand what constitutes disagreement between explanations generated by different methods for the same model prediction and introduce a novel quantitative framework to formalize this understanding. We then leverage this framework to carry out a rigorous empirical analysis with four real-world datasets, six state-of-the-art post hoc explanation methods, and six different predictive models, to measure the extent of disagreement between the explanations generated by various popular explanation methods. In addition, we carry out an online user study with data scientists to understand how they resolve the aforementioned disagreements. Our results indicate that (1) state-of-the-art explanation methods often disagree in terms of the explanations they output, and (2) machine learning practitioners often employ ad hoc heuristics when resolving such disagreements. These findings suggest that practitioners may be relying on misleading explanations when making consequential decisions. They also underscore the importance of developing principled frameworks for effectively evaluating and comparing explanations output by various explanation techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zixuan Dong, Che Wang, Keith Ross</p>
<p>Abstract: In reinforcement learning, Monte Carlo algorithms update the Q function by averaging the episodic returns. In the Monte Carlo UCB (MC-UCB) algorithm, the action taken in each state is the action that maximizes the Q function plus an Upper Confidence Bounds (UCB) exploration term, which biases the choice of actions to those that have been chosen less frequently. Although there has been significant work on establishing regret bounds for MC-UCB, most of that work has been focused on finite-horizon versions of the problem, for which each episode terminates after a constant number of steps. For such finite-horizon problems, the optimal policy depends both on the current state and the time within the episode. However, for many natural episodic problems, such as games like Go and Chess and robotic tasks, the episode is of random length and the optimal policy is stationary. For such environments, it is an open question whether the Q-function in MC-UCB will converge to the optimal Q function; we conjecture that, unlike Q-learning, it does not converge for all MDPs. We nevertheless show that for a large class of MDPs, which includes stochastic MDPs such as blackjack and deterministic MDPs such as Go, the Q function in MC-UCB converges almost surely to the optimal Q function. An immediate corollary of this result is that it also converges almost surely for all finite-horizon MDPs. We also provide numerical experiments, providing further insights into MC-UCB.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liyuan Hu, Mengbing Li, Chengchun Shi, Zhenke Wu, Piotr Fryzlewicz</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper studies reinforcement learning (RL) in doubly inhomogeneous environments under temporal non-stationarity and subject heterogeneity. In a number of applications, it is commonplace to encounter datasets generated by system dynamics that may change over time and population, challenging high-quality sequential decision making. Nonetheless, most existing RL solutions require either temporal stationarity or subject homogeneity, which would result in sub-optimal policies if both assumptions were violated. To address both challenges simultaneously, we propose an original algorithm to determine the ``best data chunks" that display similar dynamics over time and across individuals for policy learning, which alternates between most recent change point detection and cluster identification. Our method is general, and works with a wide range of clustering and change point detection algorithms. It is multiply robust in the sense that it takes multiple initial estimators as input and only requires one of them to be consistent. Moreover, by borrowing information over time and population, it allows us to detect weaker signals and has better convergence properties when compared to applying the clustering algorithm per time or the change point detection algorithm per subject. Empirically, we demonstrate the usefulness of our method through extensive simulations and a real data application.</p>

Despite the growing attention and the proliferation of research in this emerging field, there is currently a lack of a systematic review and in-depth analysis of deep learning-based time series models with FT. It is also unclear why FT can enhance time series analysis and what its limitations are in the field. To address these gaps, we present a comprehensive review that systematically investigates and summarizes the recent research advancements in deep learning-based time series analysis with FT. Specifically, we explore the primary approaches used in current models that incorporate FT, the types of neural networks that leverage FT, and the representative FT-equipped models in deep time series analysis. We propose a novel taxonomy to categorize the existing methods in this field, providing a structured overview of the diverse approaches employed in incorporating FT into deep learning models for time series analysis. Finally, we highlight the advantages and limitations of FT for time series modeling and identify potential future research directions that can further contribute to the community of time series analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lucio La Cava, Davide Costa, Andrea Tagarelli</p>
<p>Abstract: The fervor for Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) attracted countless creators, leading to a Big Bang of digital assets driven by latent or explicit forms of inspiration, as in many creative processes. This work exploits Vision Transformers and graph-based modeling to delve into visual inspiration phenomena between NFTs over the years. Our goals include unveiling the main structural traits that shape visual inspiration networks, exploring the interrelation between visual inspiration and asset performances, investigating crypto influence on inspiration processes, and explaining the inspiration relationships among NFTs. Our findings unveil how the pervasiveness of inspiration led to a temporary saturation of the visual feature space, the impact of the dichotomy between inspiring and inspired NFTs on their financial performance, and an intrinsic self-regulatory mechanism between markets and inspiration waves. Our work can serve as a starting point for gaining a broader view of the evolution of Web3.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Li Pan, Lv Peizhuo, Chen Kai, Zhang Shengzhi, Cai Yuling, Xiang Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: Compared to traditional neural networks with a single output channel, a multi-exit network has multiple exits that allow for early outputs from the model's intermediate layers, thus significantly improving computational efficiency while maintaining similar main task accuracy. Existing model stealing attacks can only steal the model's utility while failing to capture its output strategy, i.e., a set of thresholds used to determine from which exit to output. This leads to a significant decrease in computational efficiency for the extracted model, thereby losing the advantage of multi-exit networks. In this paper, we propose the first model stealing attack against multi-exit networks to extract both the model utility and the output strategy. We employ Kernel Density Estimation to analyze the target model's output strategy and use performance loss and strategy loss to guide the training of the extracted model. Furthermore, we design a novel output strategy search algorithm to maximize the consistency between the victim model and the extracted model's output behaviors. In experiments across multiple multi-exit networks and benchmark datasets, our method always achieves accuracy and efficiency closest to the victim models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Farhad Mortezapour Shiri, Thinagaran Perumal, Norwati Mustapha, Raihani Mohamed</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has emerged as a powerful subset of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), outperforming traditional ML methods, especially in handling unstructured and large datasets. Its impact spans across various domains, including speech recognition, healthcare, autonomous vehicles, cybersecurity, predictive analytics, and more. However, the complexity and dynamic nature of real-world problems present challenges in designing effective deep learning models. Consequently, several deep learning models have been developed to address different problems and applications. In this article, we conduct a comprehensive survey of various deep learning models, including Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN), Transformer, Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KAN), Generative Models, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), and Deep Transfer Learning. We examine the structure, applications, benefits, and limitations of each model. Furthermore, we perform an analysis using three publicly available datasets: IMDB, ARAS, and Fruit-360. We compared the performance of six renowned deep learning models: CNN, RNN, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM, Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Bidirectional GRU alongside two newer models, TCN and Transformer, using the IMDB and ARAS datasets. Additionally, we evaluated the performance of eight CNN-based models, including VGG (Visual Geometry Group), Inception, ResNet (Residual Network), InceptionResNet, Xception (Extreme Inception), MobileNet, DenseNet (Dense Convolutional Network), and NASNet (Neural Architecture Search Network), for image classification tasks using the Fruit-360 dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruipu Luo, Ziwang Zhao, Min Yang, Zheming Yang, Minghui Qiu, Tao Wang, Zhongyu Wei, Yanhao Wang, Cen Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), with remarkable conversational capability, have emerged as AI assistants that can handle both visual and textual modalities. However, their effectiveness in joint video and language understanding has not been extensively explored. In the paper, we introduce Valley, a multi-modal foundation model that is designed to enable enhanced video comprehension and instruction-following capabilities. To this end, we construct two datasets, namely Valley-702k and Valley-instruct-73k, to cover a diverse range of video-text alignment and video-based instruction tasks, such as multi-shot captions, long video descriptions, action recognition, causal inference, etc. Then, we adopt ViT-L/14 as the vision encoder and explore three different temporal modeling modules to learn multifaceted features for enhanced video understanding. In addition, we implement a two-phase training approach for Valley: the first phase focuses solely on training the projection module to facilitate the LLM's capacity to understand visual input, and the second phase jointly trains the projection module and the LLM to improve their instruction following ability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Valley has the potential to serve as an effective video assistant, simplifying complex video-understanding scenarios.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jan Heuer</p>
<p>Abstract: With the increase in industrial applications using Answer Set Programming, the need for formal verification tools, particularly for critical applications, has also increased. During the program optimisation process, it would be desirable to have a tool which can automatically verify whether an optimised subprogram can replace the original subprogram. Formally this corresponds to the problem of verifying the strong equivalence of two programs. In order to do so, the translation tool anthem was developed. It can be used in conjunction with an automated theorem prover for classical logic to verify that two programs are strongly equivalent. With the current version of anthem, only the strong equivalence of positive programs with a restricted input language can be verified. This is a result of the translation $\tau^*$ implemented in anthem that produces formulas in the logic of here-and-there, which coincides with classical logic only for positive programs. This thesis extends anthem in order to overcome these limitations. First, the transformation $\sigma^*$ is presented, which transforms formulas from the logic of here-and-there to classical logic. A theorem formalises how $\sigma^*$ can be used to express equivalence in the logic of here-and-there in classical logic. Second, the translation $\tau^*$ is extended to programs containing pools. Another theorem shows how $\sigma^*$ can be combined with $\tau^*$ to express the strong equivalence of two programs in classical logic. With $\sigma^*$ and the extended $\tau^*$, it is possible to express the strong equivalence of logic programs containing negation, simple choices, and pools. Both the extended $\tau^*$ and $\sigma^*$ are implemented in a new version of anthem. Several examples of logic programs containing pools, negation, and simple choice rules, which the new version of anthem can translate to classical logic, are presented. Some a...</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marios Papachristou, Longqi Yang, Chin-Chia Hsu</p>
<p>Abstract: In various work contexts, such as meeting scheduling, collaborating, and project planning, collective decision-making is essential but often challenging due to diverse individual preferences, varying work focuses, and power dynamics among members. To address this, we propose a system leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to facilitate group decision-making by managing conversations and balancing preferences among individuals. Our system aims to extract individual preferences from each member's conversation with the system and suggest options that satisfy the preferences of the members. We specifically apply this system to corporate meeting scheduling. We create synthetic employee profiles and simulate conversations at scale, leveraging LLMs to evaluate the system performance as a novel approach to conducting a user study. Our results indicate efficient coordination with reduced interactions between the members and the LLM-based system. The system refines and improves its proposed options over time, ensuring that many of the members' individual preferences are satisfied in an equitable way. Finally, we conduct a survey study involving human participants to assess our system's ability to aggregate preferences and reasoning about them. Our findings show that the system exhibits strong performance in both dimensions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Payam Jome Yazdian, Rachel Lagasse, Hamid Mohammadi, Eric Liu, Li Cheng, Angelica Lim</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce MotionScript, a novel framework for generating highly detailed, natural language descriptions of 3D human motions. Unlike existing motion datasets that rely on broad action labels or generic captions, MotionScript provides fine-grained, structured descriptions that capture the full complexity of human movement including expressive actions (e.g., emotions, stylistic walking) and interactions beyond standard motion capture datasets. MotionScript serves as both a descriptive tool and a training resource for text-to-motion models, enabling the synthesis of highly realistic and diverse human motions from text. By augmenting motion datasets with MotionScript captions, we demonstrate significant improvements in out-of-distribution motion generation, allowing large language models (LLMs) to generate motions that extend beyond existing data. Additionally, MotionScript opens new applications in animation, virtual human simulation, and robotics, providing an interpretable bridge between intuitive descriptions and motion synthesis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to systematically translate 3D motion into structured natural language without requiring training data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kun Wu, Ning Liu, Zhen Zhao, Di Qiu, Jinming Li, Zhengping Che, Zhiyuan Xu, Jian Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Improving data utilization, especially for imperfect data from task failures, is crucial for robotic manipulation due to the challenging, time-consuming, and expensive data collection process in the real world. Current imitation learning (IL) typically discards imperfect data, focusing solely on successful expert data. While reinforcement learning (RL) can learn from explorations and failures, the sim2real gap and its reliance on dense reward and online exploration make it difficult to apply effectively in real-world scenarios. In this work, we aim to conquer the challenge of leveraging imperfect data without the need for reward information to improve the model performance for robotic manipulation in an offline manner. Specifically, we introduce a Self-Supervised Data Filtering framework (SSDF) that combines expert and imperfect data to compute quality scores for failed trajectory segments. High-quality segments from the failed data are used to expand the training dataset. Then, the enhanced dataset can be used with any downstream policy learning method for robotic manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments on the ManiSkill2 benchmark built on the high-fidelity Sapien simulator and real-world robotic manipulation tasks using the Franka robot arm demonstrated that the SSDF can accurately expand the training dataset with high-quality imperfect data and improve the success rates for all robotic manipulation tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Many time series classification tasks, where labels vary over time, are affected by label noise that also varies over time. Such noise can cause label quality to improve, worsen, or periodically change over time. We first propose and formalize temporal label noise, an unstudied problem for sequential classification of time series. In this setting, multiple labels are recorded over time while being corrupted by a time-dependent noise function. We first demonstrate the importance of modeling the temporal nature of the label noise function and how existing methods will consistently underperform. We then propose methods to train noise-tolerant classifiers by estimating the temporal label noise function directly from data. We show that our methods lead to state-of-the-art performance under diverse types of temporal label noise on real-world datasets</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Divij Handa, Zehua Zhang, Amir Saeidi, Shrinidhi Kumbhar, Chitta Baral</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Model (LLM) safety have primarily focused on mitigating attacks crafted in natural language or common ciphers (e.g. Base64), which are likely integrated into newer models' safety training. However, we reveal a paradoxical vulnerability: as LLMs advance in reasoning, they inadvertently become more susceptible to novel jailbreaking attacks. Enhanced reasoning enables LLMs to interpret complex instructions and decode complex user-defined ciphers, creating an exploitable security gap. To study this vulnerability, we introduce Attacks using Custom Encryptions (ACE), a jailbreaking technique that encodes malicious queries with novel ciphers. Extending ACE, we introduce Layered Attacks using Custom Encryptions (LACE), which applies multi-layer ciphers to amplify attack complexity. Furthermore, we develop CipherBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' accuracy in decoding encrypted benign text. Our experiments reveal a critical trade-off: LLMs that are more capable of decoding ciphers are more vulnerable to these jailbreaking attacks, with success rates on GPT-4o escalating from 40% under ACE to 78% with LACE. These findings highlight a critical insight: as LLMs become more adept at deciphering complex user ciphers--many of which cannot be preemptively included in safety training--they become increasingly exploitable.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christophe Roux, Max Zimmer, Sebastian Pokutta</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) algorithms using Knowledge Distillation (KD) have received increasing attention due to their favorable properties with respect to privacy, non-i.i.d. data and communication cost. These methods depart from transmitting model parameters and instead communicate information about a learning task by sharing predictions on a public dataset. In this work, we study the performance of such approaches in the byzantine setting, where a subset of the clients act in an adversarial manner aiming to disrupt the learning process. We show that KD-based FL algorithms are remarkably resilient and analyze how byzantine clients can influence the learning process. Based on these insights, we introduce two new byzantine attacks and demonstrate their ability to break existing byzantine-resilient methods. Additionally, we propose a novel defence method which enhances the byzantine resilience of KD-based FL algorithms. Finally, we provide a general framework to obfuscate attacks, making them significantly harder to detect, thereby improving their effectiveness. Our findings serve as an important building block in the analysis of byzantine FL, contributing through the development of new attacks and new defence mechanisms, further advancing the robustness of KD-based FL algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Chen, Zihan Wang, Ran Tao, Hongxin Wei, Xing Xie, Masashi Sugiyama, Bhiksha Raj, Jindong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models are usually pre-trained on large-scale datasets and then adapted to downstream tasks through tuning. However, the large-scale pre-training datasets, often inaccessible or too expensive to handle, can contain label noise that may adversely affect the generalization of the model and pose unexpected risks. This paper stands out as the first work to comprehensively understand and analyze the nature of noise in pre-training datasets and then effectively mitigate its impacts on downstream tasks. Specifically, through extensive experiments of fully-supervised and image-text contrastive pre-training on synthetic noisy ImageNet-1K, YFCC15M, and CC12M datasets, we demonstrate that, while slight noise in pre-training can benefit in-domain (ID) performance, where the training and testing data share a similar distribution, it always deteriorates out-of-domain (OOD) performance, where training and testing distributions are significantly different. These observations are agnostic to scales of pre-training datasets, pre-training noise types, model architectures, pre-training objectives, downstream tuning methods, and downstream applications. We empirically ascertain that the reason behind this is that the pre-training noise shapes the feature space differently. We then propose a tuning method (NMTune) to affine the feature space to mitigate the malignant effect of noise and improve generalization, which is applicable in both parameter-efficient and black-box tuning manners. We additionally conduct extensive experiments on popular vision and language models, including APIs, which are supervised and self-supervised pre-trained on realistic noisy data for evaluation. Our analysis and results demonstrate the importance of this novel and fundamental research direction, which we term as Noisy Model Learning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Surgical Visual Question Answering (Surgical-VQA) and related region grounding have shown great promise for robotic and medical applications, addressing the critical need for automated methods in personalized surgical mentorship. However, existing models primarily provide simple structured answers and struggle with complex scenarios due to their limited capability in recognizing long-range dependencies and aligning multimodal information. In this paper, we introduce Surgical-LVLM, a novel personalized large vision-language model tailored for complex surgical scenarios. Leveraging the pre-trained large vision-language model and specialized Visual Perception LoRA (VP-LoRA) blocks, our model excels in understanding complex visual-language tasks within surgical contexts. In addressing the visual grounding task, we propose the Token-Interaction (TIT) module, which strengthens the interaction between the grounding module and the language responses of the Large Visual Language Model (LVLM) after projecting them into the latent space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Surgical-LVLM on several benchmarks, including EndoVis-17-VQLA, EndoVis-18-VQLA, and a newly introduced EndoVis Conversations dataset, which sets new performance standards. Our work contributes to advancing the field of automated surgical mentorship by providing a context-aware solution.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nadav Timor, Jonathan Mamou, Daniel Korat, Moshe Berchansky, Oren Pereg, Moshe Wasserblat, Tomer Galanti, Michal Gordon, David Harel</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces distributed speculative inference (DSI), a novel inference algorithm that is provably faster than speculative inference (SI) [leviathan2023, chen2023, miao2024, sun2025, timor2025] and standard autoregressive inference (non-SI). Like other SI algorithms, DSI operates on frozen language models (LMs), requiring no training or architectural modifications, and it preserves the target distribution. Prior studies on SI have demonstrated empirical speedups over non-SI--but rely on sufficiently fast and accurate drafters, which are often unavailable in practice. We identify a gap where SI can be slower than non-SI if drafters are too slow or inaccurate. We close this gap by proving that DSI is faster than both SI and non-SI--given any drafters. DSI is therefore not only faster than SI, but also unlocks the acceleration of LMs for which SI fails. DSI leverages speculation parallelism (SP), a novel type of task parallelism, to orchestrate target and drafter instances that overlap in time, establishing a new foundational tradeoff between computational resources and latency. Our simulations show that DSI is 1.29-1.92x faster than SI in single-node setups for various off-the-shelf LMs and tasks. We open-source all our code.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhi Zheng, Qian Feng, Hang Li, Alois Knoll, Jianxiang Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have witnessed remarkable performance as zero-shot task planners for robotic manipulation tasks. However, the open-loop nature of previous works makes LLM-based planning error-prone and fragile. On the other hand, failure detection approaches for closed-loop planning are often limited by task-specific heuristics or following an unrealistic assumption that the prediction is trustworthy all the time. As a general-purpose reasoning machine, LLMs or Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are promising for detecting failures. However, However, the appropriateness of the aforementioned assumption diminishes due to the notorious hullucination problem. In this work, we attempt to mitigate these issues by introducing a framework for closed-loop LLM-based planning called KnowLoop, backed by an uncertainty-based MLLMs failure detector, which is agnostic to any used MLLMs or LLMs. Specifically, we evaluate three different ways for quantifying the uncertainty of MLLMs, namely token probability, entropy, and self-explained confidence as primary metrics based on three carefully designed representative prompting strategies. With a self-collected dataset including various manipulation tasks and an LLM-based robot system, our experiments demonstrate that token probability and entropy are more reflective compared to self-explained confidence. By setting an appropriate threshold to filter out uncertain predictions and seek human help actively, the accuracy of failure detection can be significantly enhanced. This improvement boosts the effectiveness of closed-loop planning and the overall success rate of tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shwai He, Daize Dong, Liang Ding, Ang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Scaling large language models has driven remarkable advancements across various domains, yet the continual increase in model size presents significant challenges for real-world deployment. The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture offers a promising solution by dynamically selecting and activating only a subset of experts during inference, thus substantially reducing computational costs while preserving high performance. Despite these benefits, MoE introduces new inefficiencies, such as excessive parameters and communication overhead. In this work, we present a holistic study of compression techniques for Mixture of Experts to enhance both efficiency and scalability. While recent efforts have focused on Expert Trimming, which reduces the number of experts, these approaches still suffer from considerable communication and computational costs. To address this, we propose more aggressive strategies, such as Layer Drop, which removes entire MoE layers, and Block Drop, which eliminates transformer blocks. Surprisingly, these aggressive pruning techniques not only preserve model performance but also substantially improve computation and memory efficiency. Furthermore, beyond Expert Trimming, we also introduce Expert Slimming, which compresses individual experts to further boost performance and can be seamlessly integrated with Expert Trimming. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods-Layer Drop and Block Drop-along with the comprehensive recipe that integrates Expert Slimming and Expert Trimming, achieving a 6.05x speedup with 77.1% reduced memory usage while maintaining over 92% of performance on Mixtral-8x7B.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Roman Belaire, Arunesh Sinha, Pradeep Varakantham</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) policies are highly susceptible to adversarial noise in observations, which poses significant risks in safety-critical scenarios. The challenge inherent to adversarial perturbations is that by altering the information observed by the agent, the state becomes only partially observable. Existing approaches address this by either enforcing consistent actions across nearby states or maximizing the worst-case value within adversarially perturbed observations. However, the former suffers from performance degradation when attacks succeed, while the latter tends to be overly conservative, leading to suboptimal performance in benign settings. We hypothesize that these limitations stem from their failing to account for partial observability directly. To this end, we introduce a novel objective called Adversarial Counterfactual Error (ACoE), defined on the beliefs about the true state and balancing value optimization with robustness. To make ACoE scalable in model-free settings, we propose the theoretically-grounded surrogate objective Cumulative-ACoE (C-ACoE). Our empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks (MuJoCo, Atari, and Highway) demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches for addressing adversarial RL challenges, offering a promising direction for improving robustness in DRL under adversarial conditions.

<p>Abstract: Collaborative self-supervised learning has recently become feasible in highly distributed environments by dividing the network layers between client devices and a central server. However, state-of-the-art methods, such as MocoSFL, are optimized for network division at the initial layers, which decreases the protection of the client data and increases communication overhead. In this paper, we demonstrate that splitting depth is crucial for maintaining privacy and communication efficiency in distributed training. We also show that MocoSFL suffers from a catastrophic quality deterioration for the minimal communication overhead. As a remedy, we introduce Momentum-Aligned contrastive Split Federated Learning (MonAcoSFL), which aligns online and momentum client models during training procedure. Consequently, we achieve state-of-the-art accuracy while significantly reducing the communication overhead, making MonAcoSFL more practical in real-world scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Swapnil Bhosale, Haosen Yang, Diptesh Kanojia, Jiankang Deng, Xiatian Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Novel view acoustic synthesis (NVAS) aims to render binaural audio at any target viewpoint, given a mono audio emitted by a sound source at a 3D scene. Existing methods have proposed NeRF-based implicit models to exploit visual cues as a condition for synthesizing binaural audio. However, in addition to low efficiency originating from heavy NeRF rendering, these methods all have a limited ability of characterizing the entire scene environment such as room geometry, material properties, and the spatial relation between the listener and sound source. To address these issues, we propose a novel Audio-Visual Gaussian Splatting (AV-GS) model. To obtain a material-aware and geometry-aware condition for audio synthesis, we learn an explicit point-based scene representation with an audio-guidance parameter on locally initialized Gaussian points, taking into account the space relation from the listener and sound source. To make the visual scene model audio adaptive, we propose a point densification and pruning strategy to optimally distribute the Gaussian points, with the per-point contribution in sound propagation (e.g., more points needed for texture-less wall surfaces as they affect sound path diversion). Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our AV-GS over existing alternatives on the real-world RWAS and simulation-based SoundSpaces datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lijie Hu, Tianhao Huang, Huanyi Xie, Chenyang Ren, Zhengyu Hu, Lu Yu, Di Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have garnered increasing attention due to their ability to provide concept-based explanations for black-box deep learning models while achieving high final prediction accuracy using human-like concepts. However, the training of current CBMs heavily relies on the accuracy and richness of annotated concepts in the dataset. These concept labels are typically provided by experts, which can be costly and require significant resources and effort. Additionally, concept saliency maps frequently misalign with input saliency maps, causing concept predictions to correspond to irrelevant input features - an issue related to annotation alignment. To address these limitations, we propose a new framework called SSCBM (Semi-supervised Concept Bottleneck Model). Our SSCBM is suitable for practical situations where annotated data is scarce. By leveraging joint training on both labeled and unlabeled data and aligning the unlabeled data at the concept level, we effectively solve these issues. We proposed a strategy to generate pseudo labels and an alignment loss. Experiments demonstrate that our SSCBM is both effective and efficient. With only 20% labeled data, we achieved 93.19% (96.39% in a fully supervised setting) concept accuracy and 75.51% (79.82% in a fully supervised setting) prediction accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxuan Wu, Ziyu Wang, Bhiksha Raj, Gus Xia</p>
<p>Abstract: We contribute an unsupervised method that effectively learns disentangled content and style representations from sequences of observations. Unlike most disentanglement algorithms that rely on domain-specific labels or knowledge, our method is based on the insight of domain-general statistical differences between content and style -- content varies more among different fragments within a sample but maintains an invariant vocabulary across data samples, whereas style remains relatively invariant within a sample but exhibits more significant variation across different samples. We integrate such inductive bias into an encoder-decoder architecture and name our method after V3 (variance-versus-invariance). Experimental results show that V3 generalizes across multiple domains and modalities, successfully learning disentangled content and style representations, such as pitch and timbre from music audio, digit and color from images of hand-written digits, and action and character appearance from simple animations. V3 demonstrates strong disentanglement performance compared to existing unsupervised methods, along with superior out-of-distribution generalization under few-shot adaptation compared to supervised counterparts. Lastly, symbolic-level interpretability emerges in the learned content codebook, forging a near one-to-one alignment between machine representation and human knowledge.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tongzhou Liao, Barnab\'as P\'oczos</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become important tools for machine learning on graph-structured data. In this paper, we explore the synergistic combination of graph encoding, graph rewiring, and graph attention, by introducing Graph Attention with Stochastic Structures (GRASS), a novel GNN architecture. GRASS utilizes relative random walk probabilities (RRWP) encoding and a novel decomposed variant (D-RRWP) to efficiently capture structural information. It rewires the input graph by superimposing a random regular graph to enhance long-range information propagation. It also employs a novel additive attention mechanism tailored for graph-structured data. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that GRASS achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets, including a 20.3% reduction in mean absolute error on the ZINC dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Romy Williamson, Niloy J. Mitra</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural surfaces (e.g., neural map encoding, deep implicits and neural radiance fields) have recently gained popularity because of their generic structure (e.g., multi-layer perceptron) and easy integration with modern learning-based setups. Traditionally, we have a rich toolbox of geometry processing algorithms designed for polygonal meshes to analyze and operate on surface geometry. In the absence of an analogous toolbox, neural representations are typically discretized and converted into a mesh, before applying any geometry processing algorithm. This is unsatisfactory and, as we demonstrate, unnecessary. In this work, we propose a spherical neural surface representation for genus-0 surfaces and demonstrate how to compute core geometric operators directly on this representation. Namely, we estimate surface normals and first and second fundamental forms of the surface, as well as compute surface gradient, surface divergence and Laplace-Beltrami operator on scalar/vector fields defined on the surface. Our representation is fully seamless, overcoming a key limitation of similar explicit representations such as Neural Surface Maps [Morreale et al. 2021]. These operators, in turn, enable geometry processing directly on the neural representations without any unnecessary meshing. We demonstrate illustrative applications in (neural) spectral analysis, heat flow and mean curvature flow, and evaluate robustness to isometric shape variations. We propose theoretical formulations and validate their numerical estimates, against analytical estimates, mesh-based baselines, and neural alternatives, where available. By systematically linking neural surface representations with classical geometry processing algorithms, we believe that this work can become a key ingredient in enabling neural geometry processing. Code is accessible from the project webpage.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lucio La Cava, Davide Costa, Andrea Tagarelli</p>
<p>Abstract: The significant progress in the development of Large Language Models has contributed to blurring the distinction between human and AI-generated text. The increasing pervasiveness of AI-generated text and the difficulty in detecting it poses new challenges for our society. In this paper, we tackle the problem of detecting and attributing AI-generated text by proposing WhosAI, a triplet-network contrastive learning framework designed to predict whether a given input text has been generated by humans or AI and to unveil the authorship of the text. Unlike most existing approaches, our proposed framework is conceived to learn semantic similarity representations from multiple generators at once, thus equally handling both detection and attribution tasks. Furthermore, WhosAI is model-agnostic and scalable to the release of new AI text-generation models by incorporating their generated instances into the embedding space learned by our framework. Experimental results on the TuringBench benchmark of 200K news articles show that our proposed framework achieves outstanding results in both the Turing Test and Authorship Attribution tasks, outperforming all the methods listed in the TuringBench benchmark leaderboards.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuang Wang, Qianwen Lu, Boxing Peng, Yihe Nie, Qingchuan Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: For the task of low-light image enhancement, deep learning-based algorithms have demonstrated superiority and effectiveness compared to traditional methods. However, these methods, primarily based on Retinex theory, tend to overlook the noise and color distortions in input images, leading to significant noise amplification and local color distortions in enhanced results. To address these issues, we propose the Dual-Path Error Compensation (DPEC) method, designed to improve image quality under low-light conditions by preserving local texture details while restoring global image brightness without amplifying noise. DPEC incorporates precise pixel-level error estimation to capture subtle differences and an independent denoising mechanism to prevent noise amplification. We introduce the HIS-Retinex loss to guide DPEC's training, ensuring the brightness distribution of enhanced images closely aligns with real-world conditions. To balance computational speed and resource efficiency while training DPEC for a comprehensive understanding of the global context, we integrated the VMamba architecture into its backbone. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in low-light image enhancement.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Danfeng Guo, Demetri Terzopoulos</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved significant success in recent years, and they have been extended to the medical domain. Although demonstrating satisfactory performance on medical Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks, Medical LVLMs (MLVLMs) suffer from the hallucination problem, which makes them fail to diagnose complex pathologies. Moreover, they readily fail to learn minority pathologies due to imbalanced training data. We propose two prompting strategies for MLVLMs that reduce hallucination and improve VQA performance. In the first strategy, we provide a detailed explanation of the queried pathology. In the second strategy, we fine-tune a cheap, weak learner to achieve high performance on a specific metric, and textually provide its judgment to the MLVLM. Tested on the MIMIC-CXR-JPG and Chexpert datasets, our methods significantly improve the diagnostic F1 score, with the highest increase being 0.27. We also demonstrate that our prompting strategies can be extended to general LVLM domains. Based on POPE metrics, it effectively suppresses the false negative predictions of existing LVLMs and improves Recall by approximately 0.07.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fushuo Huo, Wenchao Xu, Zhong Zhang, Haozhao Wang, Zhicheng Chen, Peilin Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have rapidly advanced in recent years, the prevalent issue known as the `hallucination' problem has emerged as a significant bottleneck, hindering their real-world deployments. Existing methods mitigate this issue mainly from two perspectives: One approach leverages extra knowledge like robust instruction tuning LVLMs with curated datasets or employing auxiliary analysis networks, which inevitable incur additional costs. Another approach, known as contrastive decoding, induces hallucinations by manually disturbing the vision or instruction raw inputs and mitigates them by contrasting the outputs of the disturbed and original LVLMs. However, these approaches rely on empirical holistic input disturbances and double the inference cost. To avoid these issues, we propose a simple yet effective method named Self-Introspective Decoding (SID). Our empirical investigation reveals that pretrained LVLMs can introspectively assess the importance of vision tokens based on preceding vision and text (both instruction and generated) tokens. We develop the Context and Text-aware Token Selection (CT2S) strategy, which preserves only unimportant vision tokens after early layers of LVLMs to adaptively amplify text-informed hallucination during the auto-regressive decoding. This approach ensures that multimodal knowledge absorbed in the early layers induces multimodal contextual rather than aimless hallucinations. Subsequently, the original token logits subtract the amplified vision-and-text association hallucinations, guiding LVLMs decoding faithfully. Extensive experiments illustrate SID generates less-hallucination and higher-quality texts across various metrics, without extra knowledge and much additional computation burdens.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04811">h4rm3l: A language for Composable Jailbreak Attack Synthesis</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Moussa Koulako Bala Doumbouya, Ananjan Nandi, Gabriel Poesia, Davide Ghilardi, Anna Goldie, Federico Bianchi, Dan Jurafsky, Christopher D. Manning</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite their demonstrated valuable capabilities, state-of-the-art (SOTA) widely deployed large language models (LLMs) still have the potential to cause harm to society due to the ineffectiveness of their safety filters, which can be bypassed by prompt transformations called jailbreak attacks. Current approaches to LLM safety assessment, which employ datasets of templated prompts and benchmarking pipelines, fail to cover sufficiently large and diverse sets of jailbreak attacks, leading to the widespread deployment of unsafe LLMs. Recent research showed that novel jailbreak attacks could be derived by composition; however, a formal composable representation for jailbreak attacks, which, among other benefits, could enable the exploration of a large compositional space of jailbreak attacks through program synthesis methods, has not been previously proposed. We introduce h4rm3l, a novel approach that addresses this gap with a human-readable domain-specific language (DSL). Our framework comprises: (1) The h4rm3l DSL, which formally expresses jailbreak attacks as compositions of parameterized string transformation primitives. (2) A synthesizer with bandit algorithms that efficiently generates jailbreak attacks optimized for a target black box LLM. (3) The h4rm3l red-teaming software toolkit that employs the previous two components and an automated harmful LLM behavior classifier that is strongly aligned with human judgment. We demonstrate h4rm3l's efficacy by synthesizing a dataset of 2656 successful novel jailbreak attacks targeting 6 SOTA open-source and proprietary LLMs, and by benchmarking those models against a subset of these synthesized attacks. Our results show that h4rm3l's synthesized attacks are diverse and more successful than existing jailbreak attacks in literature, with success rates exceeding 90% on SOTA LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ghazal Alinezhad Noghre, Armin Danesh Pazho, Hamed Tabkhi</p>
<p>Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) presents a significant challenge in computer vision, particularly due to the unpredictable and infrequent nature of anomalous events, coupled with the diverse and dynamic environments in which they occur. Human-centric VAD, a specialized area within this domain, faces additional complexities, including variations in human behavior, potential biases in data, and substantial privacy concerns related to human subjects. These issues complicate the development of models that are both robust and generalizable. To address these challenges, recent advancements have focused on pose-based VAD, which leverages human pose as a high-level feature to mitigate privacy concerns, reduce appearance biases, and minimize background interference. In this paper, we introduce SPARTA, a novel transformer-based architecture designed specifically for human-centric pose-based VAD. SPARTA introduces an innovative Spatio-Temporal Pose and Relative Pose (ST-PRP) tokenization method that produces an enriched representation of human motion over time. This approach ensures that the transformer's attention mechanism captures both spatial and temporal patterns simultaneously, rather than focusing on only one aspect. The addition of the relative pose further emphasizes subtle deviations from normal human movements. The architecture's core, a novel Unified Encoder Twin Decoders (UETD) transformer, significantly improves the detection of anomalous behaviors in video data. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that SPARTA consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a new state-of-the-art in pose-based VAD.</p>

<p>Abstract: Harmful fine-tuning attack poses serious safety concerns for large language models' fine-tuning-as-a-service. While existing defenses have been proposed to mitigate the issue, their performances are still far away from satisfactory, and the root cause of the problem has not been fully recovered. To this end, we in this paper show that harmful perturbation over the model weights could be a probable cause of alignment-broken. In order to attenuate the negative impact of harmful perturbation, we propose an alignment-stage solution, dubbed Booster. Technically, along with the original alignment loss, we append a loss regularizer in the alignment stage's optimization. The regularizer ensures that the model's harmful loss reduction after the simulated harmful perturbation is attenuated, thereby mitigating the subsequent fine-tuning risk. Empirical results show that Booster can effectively reduce the harmful score of the fine-tuned models while maintaining the performance of downstream tasks.

<p>Abstract: The recent explosion of generative AI-Music systems has raised numerous concerns over data copyright, licensing music from musicians, and the conflict between open-source AI and large prestige companies. Such issues highlight the need for publicly available, copyright-free musical data, in which there is a large shortage, particularly for symbolic music data. To alleviate this issue, we present PDMX: a large-scale open-source dataset of over 250K public domain MusicXML scores collected from the score-sharing forum MuseScore, making it the largest available copyright-free symbolic music dataset to our knowledge. PDMX additionally includes a wealth of both tag and user interaction metadata, allowing us to efficiently analyze the dataset and filter for high quality user-generated scores. Given the additional metadata afforded by our data collection process, we conduct multitrack music generation experiments evaluating how different representative subsets of PDMX lead to different behaviors in downstream models, and how user-rating statistics can be used as an effective measure of data quality.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shilong Yang, Chulong Zhang, Qi Zang, Juan Yu, Liang Zeng, Xiao Luo, Yexuan Xing, Xin Pan, Qi Li, Xiaokun Liang, Yaoqin Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Breast cancer is a significant global health issue, and the diagnosis of breast imaging has always been challenging. Mammography images typically have extremely high resolution, with lesions occupying only a very small area. Down-sampling in neural networks can easily lead to the loss of microcalcifications or subtle structures, making it difficult for traditional neural network architectures to address these issues. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Context Clustering Network with triple information fusion. Firstly, compared to CNNs or transformers, we find that Context clustering methods (1) are more computationally efficient and (2) can more easily associate structural or pathological features, making them suitable for the clinical tasks of mammography. Secondly, we propose a triple information fusion mechanism that integrates global information, feature-based local information, and patch-based local information. The proposed approach is rigorously evaluated on two public datasets, Vindr-Mammo and CBIS-DDSM, using five independent splits to ensure statistical robustness. Our method achieves an AUC of 0.828 on Vindr-Mammo and 0.805 on CBIS-DDSM, outperforming the next best method by 3.1% and 2.4%, respectively. These improvements are statistically significant (p<0.05), underscoring the benefits of Context Clustering Network with triple information fusion. Overall, our Context Clustering framework demonstrates strong potential as a scalable and cost-effective solution for large-scale mammography screening, enabling more efficient and accurate breast cancer detection.

<p>Abstract: Comparing robotic cloth-manipulation systems in a real-world setup is challenging. The fidelity gap between simulation-trained cloth neural controllers and real-world operation hinders the reliable deployment of these methods in physical trials. Inconsistent experimental setups and hardware limitations among different approaches obstruct objective evaluations. This study demonstrates a reliable real-world comparison of different simulation-trained neural controllers on both flattening and folding tasks with different types of fabrics varying in material, size, and colour. We introduce the DRAPER framework to enable this comprehensive study, which reliably reflects the true capabilities of these neural controllers. It specifically addresses real-world grasping errors, such as misgrasping and multilayer grasping, through real-world adaptations of the simulation environment to provide data trajectories that closely reflect real-world grasping scenarios. It also employs a special set of vision processing techniques to close the simulation-to-reality gap in the perception. Furthermore, it achieves robust grasping by adopting a tweezer-extended gripper and a grasping procedure. We demonstrate DRAPER's generalisability across different deep-learning methods and robotic platforms, offering valuable insights to the cloth manipulation research community.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aldo Pacchiano</p>
<p>Abstract: Many works have developed no-regret algorithms for contextual bandits with function approximation, where the mean reward function over context-action pairs belongs to a function class. Although there are many approaches to this problem, one that has gained in importance is the use of algorithms based on the optimism principle such as optimistic least squares. It can be shown the regret of this algorithm scales as square root of the product of the eluder dimension (a statistical measure of the complexity of the function class), the logarithm of the function class size and the time horizon. Unfortunately, even if the variance of the measurement noise of the rewards at each time is changing and is very small, the regret of the optimistic least squares algorithm scales with square root of the time horizon. In this work we are the first to develop algorithms that satisfy regret bounds of scaling not with the square root of the time horizon, but the square root of the sum of the measurement variances in the setting of contextual bandits with function approximation when the variances are unknown. These bounds generalize existing techniques for deriving second order bounds in contextual linear problems.</p>

<p>Abstract: The task of automated code review has recently gained a lot of attention from the machine learning community. However, current review comment evaluation metrics rely on comparisons with a human-written reference for a given code change (also called a diff). Furthermore, code review is a one-to-many problem, like generation and summarization, with many "valid reviews" for a diff. Thus, we develop CRScore - a reference-free metric to measure dimensions of review quality like conciseness, comprehensiveness, and relevance. We design CRScore to evaluate reviews in a way that is grounded in claims and potential issues detected in the code by LLMs and static analyzers. We demonstrate that CRScore can produce valid, fine-grained scores of review quality that have the greatest alignment with human judgment among open source metrics (0.54 Spearman correlation) and are more sensitive than reference-based metrics. We also release a corpus of 2.9k human-annotated review quality scores for machine-generated and GitHub review comments to support the development of automated metrics.</p>

However, the challenge of effectively pretraining such hybrid networks remains an open question. Existing methods, such as Masked Autoencoders (MAE) or autoregressive (AR) pretraining, primarily focus on single-type network architectures. In contrast, pretraining strategies for hybrid architectures must be effective for both Mamba and Transformer components. Based on this, we propose Masked Autoregressive Pretraining (MAP) to pretrain a hybrid Mamba-Transformer vision backbone network. This strategy combines the strengths of both MAE and Autoregressive pretraining, improving the performance of Mamba and Transformer modules within a unified paradigm. Experimental results show that the hybrid Mamba-Transformer vision backbone network pretrained with MAP significantly outperforms other pretraining strategies, achieving state-of-the-art performance. We validate the method's effectiveness on both 2D and 3D datasets and provide detailed ablation studies to support the design choices for each component.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Ying Chiu, Liwei Jiang, Yejin Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: As users increasingly seek guidance from LLMs for decision-making in daily life, many of these decisions are not clear-cut and depend significantly on the personal values and ethical standards of people. We present DailyDilemmas, a dataset of 1,360 moral dilemmas encountered in everyday life. Each dilemma presents two possible actions, along with affected parties and relevant human values for each action. Based on these dilemmas, we gather a repository of human values covering diverse everyday topics, such as interpersonal relationships, workplace, and environmental issues. With DailyDilemmas, we evaluate LLMs on these dilemmas to determine what action they will choose and the values represented by these action choices. Then, we analyze values through the lens of five theoretical frameworks inspired by sociology, psychology, and philosophy, including the World Values Survey, Moral Foundations Theory, Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, Aristotle's Virtues, and Plutchik's Wheel of Emotions. For instance, we find LLMs are most aligned with self-expression over survival in World Values Survey and care over loyalty in Moral Foundations Theory. Interestingly, we find substantial preference differences in models for some core values. For example, for truthfulness, Mixtral-8x7B neglects it by 9.7% while GPT-4-turbo selects it by 9.4%. We also study the recent guidance released by OpenAI (ModelSpec), and Anthropic (Constitutional AI) to understand how their designated principles reflect their models' actual value prioritization when facing nuanced moral reasoning in daily-life settings. Finally, we find that end users cannot effectively steer such prioritization using system prompts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alihan H\"uy\"uk, Xinnuo Xu, Jacqueline Maasch, Aditya V. Nori, Javier Gonz\'alez</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the increasing effectiveness of language models, their reasoning capabilities remain underdeveloped. In particular, causal reasoning through counterfactual question answering is lacking. This work aims to bridge this gap. We first derive novel metrics that balance accuracy in factual and counterfactual questions, capturing a more complete view of the reasoning abilities of language models than traditional factual-only based metrics. Second, we propose several fine-tuning approaches that aim to elicit better reasoning mechanisms, in the sense of the proposed metrics. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the fine-tuned language models in a variety of realistic scenarios. In particular, we investigate to what extent our fine-tuning approaches systemically achieve better generalization with respect to the base models in several problems that require, among others, inductive and deductive reasoning capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pedro Cisneros-Velarde</p>
<p>Abstract: Social balance is a well-established concept in sociology which dictates how individual interactions can lead a population to become one faction of positive interactions or be divided in two or more antagonistic factions. In this paper, we consider a group of large language models (LLMs) and study how, after continuous interactions, they can achieve social balance. Across three different LLM models, we find that achieving social balance depends on (i) the type of interaction; (ii) whether agents consider homophily or influence from their peers; and (iii) the population size. We characterize how each model achieves social balance with different frequency, diversity of positive or negative interactions, and interaction stability across conditions (i) to (iii). We show that models achieve different notions of social balance and justify their social dynamics differently. Remarkably, the largest model is not necessarily more likely to achieve social balance with more frequency, stability, and diversity than the smaller ones.</p>

<p>Abstract: Can objects that are not visible in an image -- but are in the vicinity of the camera -- be detected? This study introduces the novel tasks of 2D, 2.5D and 3D unobserved object detection for predicting the location of nearby objects that are occluded or lie outside the image frame. We adapt several state-of-the-art pre-trained generative models to address this task, including 2D and 3D diffusion models and vision-language models, and show that they can be used to infer the presence of objects that are not directly observed. To benchmark this task, we propose a suite of metrics that capture different aspects of performance. Our empirical evaluation on indoor scenes from the RealEstate10k and NYU Depth v2 datasets demonstrate results that motivate the use of generative models for the unobserved object detection task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Lan, Philip Torr, Austin Meek, Ashkan Khakzar, David Krueger, Fazl Barez</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigate feature universality in large language models (LLMs), a research field that aims to understand how different models similarly represent concepts in the latent spaces of their intermediate layers. Demonstrating feature universality allows discoveries about latent representations to generalize across several models. However, comparing features across LLMs is challenging due to polysemanticity, in which individual neurons often correspond to multiple features rather than distinct ones, making it difficult to disentangle and match features across different models. To address this issue, we employ a method known as dictionary learning by using sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to transform LLM activations into more interpretable spaces spanned by neurons corresponding to individual features. After matching feature neurons across models via activation correlation, we apply representational space similarity metrics on SAE feature spaces across different LLMs. Our experiments reveal significant similarities in SAE feature spaces across various LLMs, providing new evidence for feature universality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arash Khajooeinejad, Fatemeh Sadat Masoumi, Masoumeh Chapariniya</p>
<p>Abstract: Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) is well-suitedd for solving complex tasks by breaking them down into structured policies. However, HRL agents often struggle with efficient exploration and quick adaptation. To overcome these limitations, we propose integrating meta-learning into HRL to enable agents to learn and adapt hierarchical policies more effectively. Our method leverages meta-learning to facilitate rapid task adaptation using prior experience, while intrinsic motivation mechanisms drive efficient exploration by rewarding the discovery of novel states. Specifically, our agent employs a high-level policy to choose among multiple low-level policies within custom-designed grid environments. By incorporating gradient-based meta-learning with differentiable inner-loop updates, we optimize performance across a curriculum of progressively challenging tasks. Experimental results highlight that our metalearning-enhanced hierarchical agent significantly outperforms standard HRL approaches lacking meta-learning and intrinsic motivation. The agent demonstrates faster learning, greater cumulative rewards, and higher success rates in complex grid-based scenarios. These Findings underscore the effectiveness of combining meta-learning, curriculum learning, and intrinsic motivation to enhance the capability of HRL agents in tackling complex tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hengxiang Zhang, Songxin Zhang, Bingyi Jing, Hongxin Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: In the era of large language models (LLMs), detecting pretraining data has been increasingly important due to concerns about fair evaluation and ethical risks. Current methods differentiate members and non-members by designing scoring functions, like Perplexity and Min-k%. However, the diversity and complexity of training data magnifies the difficulty of distinguishing, leading to suboptimal performance in detecting pretraining data. In this paper, we first explore the benefits of unseen data, which can be easily collected after the release of the LLM. We find that the perplexities of LLMs shift differently for members and non-members, after fine-tuning with a small amount of previously unseen data. In light of this, we introduce a novel and effective method termed Fine-tuned Score Deviation(FSD), which improves the performance of current scoring functions for pretraining data detection. In particular, we propose to measure the deviation distance of current scores after fine-tuning on a small amount of unseen data within the same domain. In effect, using a few unseen data can largely decrease the scores of all non-members, leading to a larger deviation distance than members. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, significantly improving the AUC score on common benchmark datasets across various models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenyu Wang, Masatoshi Uehara, Yichun He, Amy Wang, Tommaso Biancalani, Avantika Lal, Tommi Jaakkola, Sergey Levine, Hanchen Wang, Aviv Regev</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the strong empirical performance of diffusion models on discrete sequences across domains from natural language to biological sequence generation. For example, in the protein inverse folding task, conditional diffusion models have achieved impressive results in generating natural-like sequences that fold back into the original structure. However, practical design tasks often require not only modeling a conditional distribution but also optimizing specific task objectives. For instance, we may prefer protein sequences with high stability. To address this, we consider the scenario where we have pre-trained discrete diffusion models that can generate natural-like sequences, as well as reward models that map sequences to task objectives. We then formulate the reward maximization problem within discrete diffusion models, analogous to reinforcement learning (RL), while minimizing the KL divergence against pretrained diffusion models to preserve naturalness. To solve this RL problem, we propose a novel algorithm, DRAKES, that enables direct backpropagation of rewards through entire trajectories generated by diffusion models, by making the originally non-differentiable trajectories differentiable using the Gumbel-Softmax trick. Our theoretical analysis indicates that our approach can generate sequences that are both natural-like and yield high rewards. While similar tasks have been recently explored in diffusion models for continuous domains, our work addresses unique algorithmic and theoretical challenges specific to discrete diffusion models, which arise from their foundation in continuous-time Markov chains rather than Brownian motion. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of DRAKES in generating DNA and protein sequences that optimize enhancer activity and protein stability, respectively, important tasks for gene therapies and protein-based therapeutics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bruno Mlodozeniec, Runa Eschenhagen, Juhan Bae, Alexander Immer, David Krueger, Richard Turner</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have led to significant advancements in generative modelling. Yet their widespread adoption poses challenges regarding data attribution and interpretability. In this paper, we aim to help address such challenges in diffusion models by developing an influence functions framework. Influence function-based data attribution methods approximate how a model's output would have changed if some training data were removed. In supervised learning, this is usually used for predicting how the loss on a particular example would change. For diffusion models, we focus on predicting the change in the probability of generating a particular example via several proxy measurements. We show how to formulate influence functions for such quantities and how previously proposed methods can be interpreted as particular design choices in our framework. To ensure scalability of the Hessian computations in influence functions, we systematically develop K-FAC approximations based on generalised Gauss-Newton matrices specifically tailored to diffusion models. We recast previously proposed methods as specific design choices in our framework and show that our recommended method outperforms previous data attribution approaches on common evaluations, such as the Linear Data-modelling Score (LDS) or retraining without top influences, without the need for method-specific hyperparameter tuning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Addison Kristanto Julistiono, Davoud Ataee Tarzanagh, Navid Azizan</p>
<p>Abstract: Attention mechanisms have revolutionized several domains of artificial intelligence, such as natural language processing and computer vision, by enabling models to selectively focus on relevant parts of the input data. While recent work has characterized the optimization dynamics of gradient descent (GD) in attention-based models and the structural properties of its preferred solutions, less is known about more general optimization algorithms such as mirror descent (MD). In this paper, we investigate the convergence properties and implicit biases of a family of MD algorithms tailored for softmax attention mechanisms, with the potential function chosen as the $p$-th power of the $\ell_p$-norm. Specifically, we show that these algorithms converge in direction to a generalized hard-margin SVM with an $\ell_p$-norm objective when applied to a classification problem using a softmax attention model. Notably, our theoretical results reveal that the convergence rate is comparable to that of traditional GD in simpler models, despite the highly nonlinear and nonconvex nature of the present problem. Additionally, we delve into the joint optimization dynamics of the key-query matrix and the decoder, establishing conditions under which this complex joint optimization converges to their respective hard-margin SVM solutions. Lastly, our numerical experiments on real data demonstrate that MD algorithms improve generalization over standard GD and excel in optimal token selection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yukun Huang, Sanxing Chen, Hongyi Cai, Bhuwan Dhingra</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are often augmented with external contexts, such as those used in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However, these contexts can be inaccurate or intentionally misleading, leading to conflicts with the model's internal knowledge. We argue that robust LLMs should demonstrate situated faithfulness, dynamically calibrating their trust in external information based on their confidence in the internal knowledge and the external context to resolve knowledge conflicts. To benchmark this capability, we evaluate LLMs across several QA datasets, including a newly created dataset featuring in-the-wild incorrect contexts sourced from Reddit posts. We show that when provided with both correct and incorrect contexts, both open-source and proprietary models tend to overly rely on external information, regardless of its factual accuracy. To enhance situated faithfulness, we propose two approaches: Self-Guided Confidence Reasoning (SCR) and Rule-Based Confidence Reasoning (RCR). SCR enables models to self-assess the confidence of external information relative to their own internal knowledge to produce the most accurate answer. RCR, in contrast, extracts explicit confidence signals from the LLM and determines the final answer using predefined rules. Our results show that for LLMs with strong reasoning capabilities, such as GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini, SCR outperforms RCR, achieving improvements of up to 24.2% over a direct input augmentation baseline. Conversely, for a smaller model like Llama-3-8B, RCR outperforms SCR. Fine-tuning SCR with our proposed Confidence Reasoning Direct Preference Optimization (CR-DPO) method improves performance on both seen and unseen datasets, yielding an average improvement of 8.9% on Llama-3-8B. In addition to quantitative results, we offer insights into the relative strengths of SCR and RCR.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14729">Is Less More? Exploring Token Condensation as Training-free Test-time Adaptation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zixin Wang, Dong Gong, Sen Wang, Zi Huang, Yadan Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) excels at learning generalizable image representations but often falls short in zero-shot inference on certain downstream datasets. Test-time adaptation (TTA) mitigates this issue by adjusting components like normalization layers or context prompts, yet it typically requires large batch sizes and extensive augmentations, leading to high computational costs. This raises a key question: Can VLMs' performance drop in specific test cases be mitigated through efficient, training-free approaches? To explore the solution, we investigate token condensation (TC) techniques, originally designed to enhance vision transformer efficiency by refining token usage during inference. We observe that informative tokens improve visual-text alignment in VLMs like CLIP on unseen datasets. However, existing TC methods often fail to maintain in-distribution performance when reducing tokens, prompting us to ask: How can we transform TC into an effective ``free-lunch'' adaptation strategy for VLMs? To address this, we propose Token Condensation as Adaptation (TCA), a training-free adaptation method that takes a step beyond standard TC. Rather than passively discarding tokens, TCA condenses token representation by introducing reservoir-based domain anchor tokens for information-preserving token reduction and logits correction. TCA achieves up to a 21.4% performance improvement over the strongest baseline on cross-dataset benchmark and the CIFAR-100-Corrupted dataset while reducing GFLOPs by 12.2% to 48.9%, with minimal hyperparameter dependency on both CLIP and SigLIP series.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minhyuk Seo, Hyunseo Koh, Jonghyun Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: The majority of online continual learning (CL) advocates single-epoch training and imposes restrictions on the size of replay memory. However, single-epoch training would incur a different amount of computations per CL algorithm, and the additional storage cost to store logit or model in addition to replay memory is largely ignored in calculating the storage budget. Arguing different computational and storage budgets hinder fair comparison among CL algorithms in practice, we propose to use floating point operations (FLOPs) and total memory size in Byte as a metric for computational and memory budgets, respectively, to compare and develop CL algorithms in the same 'total resource budget.' To improve a CL method in a limited total budget, we propose adaptive layer freezing that does not update the layers for less informative batches to reduce computational costs with a negligible loss of accuracy. In addition, we propose a memory retrieval method that allows the model to learn the same amount of knowledge as using random retrieval in fewer iterations. Empirical validations on the CIFAR-10/100, CLEAR-10/100, and ImageNet-1K datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods within the same total budget</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Noukhovitch, Shengyi Huang, Sophie Xhonneux, Arian Hosseini, Rishabh Agarwal, Aaron Courville</p>
<p>Abstract: The dominant paradigm for RLHF is online and on-policy RL: synchronously generating from the large language model (LLM) policy, labelling with a reward model, and learning using feedback on the LLM's own outputs. While performant, this paradigm is computationally inefficient. Inspired by classical deep RL literature, we propose separating generation and learning in RLHF. This enables asynchronous generation of new samples while simultaneously training on old samples, leading to faster training and more compute-optimal scaling. However, asynchronous training relies on an underexplored regime, online but off-policy RLHF: learning on samples from previous iterations of our model which give a worse training signal. We tackle the fundamental challenge in this regime: how much off-policyness can we tolerate for asynchronous training to speed up learning but maintain performance? Among several RLHF algorithms we test, online DPO is found to be most robust to off-policy data, and robustness increases with the scale of the policy model. We study further compute optimizations for asynchronous RLHF but find that they come at a performance cost, giving rise to a trade-off. We verify the scalability of asynchronous RLHF by training a general-purpose chatbot from LLaMA 3.1 8B on an instruction-following task ~40% faster than a synchronous run while matching final performance. Finally, we extend our results to math and reasoning to demonstrate asynchronous RL can finetune Rho 1B on GSM8k ~70% faster while matching synchronous accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shilin Lu, Zihan Zhou, Jiayou Lu, Yuanzhi Zhu, Adams Wai-Kin Kong</p>
<p>Abstract: Current image watermarking methods are vulnerable to advanced image editing techniques enabled by large-scale text-to-image models. These models can distort embedded watermarks during editing, posing significant challenges to copyright protection. In this work, we introduce W-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the robustness of watermarking methods against a wide range of image editing techniques, including image regeneration, global editing, local editing, and image-to-video generation. Through extensive evaluations of eleven representative watermarking methods against prevalent editing techniques, we demonstrate that most methods fail to detect watermarks after such edits. To address this limitation, we propose VINE, a watermarking method that significantly enhances robustness against various image editing techniques while maintaining high image quality. Our approach involves two key innovations: (1) we analyze the frequency characteristics of image editing and identify that blurring distortions exhibit similar frequency properties, which allows us to use them as surrogate attacks during training to bolster watermark robustness; (2) we leverage a large-scale pretrained diffusion model SDXL-Turbo, adapting it for the watermarking task to achieve more imperceptible and robust watermark embedding. Experimental results show that our method achieves outstanding watermarking performance under various image editing techniques, outperforming existing methods in both image quality and robustness.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaochen Hu, Mai Zeng, Ge Zhang, Pavel Rumiantsev, Liheng Ma, Yingxue Zhang, Mark Coates</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNN) exhibit superior performance in graph representation learning, but their inference cost can be high, due to an aggregation operation that can require a memory fetch for a very large number of nodes. This inference cost is the major obstacle to deploying GNN models with \emph{online prediction} to reflect the potentially dynamic node features. To address this, we propose an approach to reduce the number of nodes that are included during aggregation. We achieve this through a sparse decomposition, learning to approximate node representations using a weighted sum of linearly transformed features of a carefully selected subset of nodes within the extended neighbourhood. The approach achieves linear complexity with respect to the average node degree and the number of layers in the graph neural network. We introduce an algorithm to compute the optimal parameters for the sparse decomposition, ensuring an accurate approximation of the original GNN model, and present effective strategies to reduce the training time and improve the learning process. We demonstrate via extensive experiments that our method outperforms other baselines designed for inference speedup, achieving significant accuracy gains with comparable inference times for both node classification and spatio-temporal forecasting tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Julie Kallini, Shikhar Murty, Christopher D. Manning, Christopher Potts, R\'obert Csord\'as</p>
<p>Abstract: Models that rely on subword tokenization have significant drawbacks, such as sensitivity to character-level noise like spelling errors and inconsistent compression rates across different languages and scripts. While character- or byte-level models like ByT5 attempt to address these concerns, they have not gained widespread adoption -- processing raw byte streams without tokenization results in significantly longer sequence lengths, making training and inference inefficient. This work introduces MrT5 (MergeT5), a more efficient variant of ByT5 that integrates a token deletion mechanism in its encoder to dynamically shorten the input sequence length. After processing through a fixed number of encoder layers, a learned delete gate determines which tokens are to be removed and which are to be retained for subsequent layers. MrT5 effectively "merges" critical information from deleted tokens into a more compact sequence, leveraging contextual information from the remaining tokens. In continued pre-training experiments, we find that MrT5 can achieve significant gains in inference runtime with minimal effect on performance, as measured by bits-per-byte. Additionally, with multilingual training, MrT5 adapts to the orthographic characteristics of each language, learning language-specific compression rates. Furthermore, MrT5 shows comparable accuracy to ByT5 on downstream evaluations such as XNLI, TyDi QA, and character-level tasks while reducing sequence lengths by up to 75%. Our approach presents a solution to the practical limitations of existing byte-level models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and alignment of large language models (LLMs) are key steps in providing a good user experience. However, the concept of an appropriate alignment is inherently application-dependent, and current methods often rely on heuristic choices to drive optimization. In this work, we formulate SFT and alignment as a constrained optimization problem: the LLM is fine-tuned on a task while being required to meet application-specific requirements, without resorting to heuristics. To solve this, we propose Lagrange Large Language Models (L3Ms), which employ logarithmic barriers to enforce the constraints. This approach allows for the customization of L3Ms across diverse applications while avoiding heuristic-driven processes. We experimentally demonstrate the versatility and efficacy of L3Ms in achieving tailored alignments for various applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emanuele Marconato, S\'ebastien Lachapelle, Sebastian Weichwald, Luigi Gresele</p>
<p>Abstract: We analyze identifiability as a possible explanation for the ubiquity of linear properties across language models, such as the vector difference between the representations of "easy" and "easiest" being parallel to that between "lucky" and "luckiest". For this, we ask whether finding a linear property in one model implies that any model that induces the same distribution has that property, too. To answer that, we first prove an identifiability result to characterize distribution-equivalent next-token predictors, lifting a diversity requirement of previous results. Second, based on a refinement of relational linearity [Paccanaro and Hinton, 2001; Hernandez et al., 2024], we show how many notions of linearity are amenable to our analysis. Finally, we show that under suitable conditions, these linear properties either hold in all or none distribution-equivalent next-token predictors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenyu Wang, Sharut Gupta, Xinyi Zhang, Sana Tonekaboni, Stefanie Jegelka, Tommi Jaakkola, Caroline Uhler</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal representation learning seeks to relate and decompose information inherent in multiple modalities. By disentangling modality-specific information from information that is shared across modalities, we can improve interpretability and robustness and enable downstream tasks such as the generation of counterfactual outcomes. Separating the two types of information is challenging since they are often deeply entangled in many real-world applications. We propose Disentangled Self-Supervised Learning (DisentangledSSL), a novel self-supervised approach for learning disentangled representations. We present a comprehensive analysis of the optimality of each disentangled representation, particularly focusing on the scenario not covered in prior work where the so-called Minimum Necessary Information (MNI) point is not attainable. We demonstrate that DisentangledSSL successfully learns shared and modality-specific features on multiple synthetic and real-world datasets and consistently outperforms baselines on various downstream tasks, including prediction tasks for vision-language data, as well as molecule-phenotype retrieval tasks for biological data.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akash Dhruv, Anshu Dubey</p>
<p>Abstract: The emergence of foundational models and generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is poised to transform productivity in scientific computing, especially in code development, refactoring, and translating from one programming language to another. However, because the output of GenAI cannot be guaranteed to be correct, manual intervention remains necessary. Some of this intervention can be automated through task-specific tools, alongside additional methodologies for correctness verification and effective prompt development. We explored the application of GenAI in assisting with code translation, language interoperability, and codebase inspection within a legacy Fortran codebase used to simulate particle interactions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In the process, we developed a tool, CodeScribe, which combines prompt engineering with user supervision to establish an efficient process for code conversion. In this paper, we demonstrate how CodeScribe assists in converting Fortran code to C++, generating Fortran-C APIs for integrating legacy systems with modern C++ libraries, and providing developer support for code organization and algorithm implementation. We also address the challenges of AI-driven code translation and highlight its benefits for enhancing productivity in scientific computing workflows.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Robert Fonod, Haechan Cho, Hwasoo Yeo, Nikolas Geroliminis</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a framework for extracting georeferenced vehicle trajectories from high-altitude drone imagery, addressing key challenges in urban traffic monitoring and the limitations of traditional ground-based systems. Our approach integrates several novel contributions, including a tailored object detector optimized for high-altitude bird's-eye view perspectives, a unique track stabilization method that uses detected vehicle bounding boxes as exclusion masks during image registration, and an orthophoto and master frame-based georeferencing strategy that enhances consistent alignment across multiple drone viewpoints. Additionally, our framework features robust vehicle dimension estimation and detailed road segmentation, enabling comprehensive traffic analysis. Conducted in the Songdo International Business District, South Korea, the study utilized a multi-drone experiment covering 20 intersections, capturing approximately 12TB of 4K video data over four days. The framework produced two high-quality datasets: the Songdo Traffic dataset, comprising approximately 700,000 unique vehicle trajectories, and the Songdo Vision dataset, containing over 5,000 human-annotated images with about 300,000 vehicle instances in four classes. Comparisons with high-precision sensor data from an instrumented probe vehicle highlight the accuracy and consistency of our extraction pipeline in dense urban environments. The public release of Songdo Traffic and Songdo Vision, and the complete source code for the extraction pipeline, establishes new benchmarks in data quality, reproducibility, and scalability in traffic research. Results demonstrate the potential of integrating drone technology with advanced computer vision for precise and cost-effective urban traffic monitoring, providing valuable resources for developing intelligent transportation systems and enhancing traffic management strategies.</p>

<p>Abstract: Real-world enterprise text-to-SQL workflows often involve complex cloud or local data across various database systems, multiple SQL queries in various dialects, and diverse operations from data transformation to analytics. We introduce Spider 2.0, an evaluation framework comprising 632 real-world text-to-SQL workflow problems derived from enterprise-level database use cases. The databases in Spider 2.0 are sourced from real data applications, often containing over 1,000 columns and stored in local or cloud database systems such as BigQuery and Snowflake. We show that solving problems in Spider 2.0 frequently requires understanding and searching through database metadata, dialect documentation, and even project-level codebases. This challenge calls for models to interact with complex SQL workflow environments, process extremely long contexts, perform intricate reasoning, and generate multiple SQL queries with diverse operations, often exceeding 100 lines, which goes far beyond traditional text-to-SQL challenges. Our evaluations indicate that based on o1-preview, our code agent framework successfully solves only 21.3% of the tasks, compared with 91.2% on Spider 1.0 and 73.0% on BIRD. Our results on Spider 2.0 show that while language models have demonstrated remarkable performance in code generation -- especially in prior text-to-SQL benchmarks -- they require significant improvement in order to achieve adequate performance for real-world enterprise usage. Progress on Spider 2.0 represents crucial steps towards developing intelligent, autonomous, code agents for real-world enterprise settings.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guangzhao Dai, Jian Zhao, Yuantao Chen, Yusen Qin, Hao Zhao, Guosen Xie, Yazhou Yao, Xiangbo Shu, Xuelong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN), where an agent follows instructions to reach a target destination, has recently seen significant advancements. In contrast to navigation in discrete environments with predefined trajectories, VLN in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) presents greater challenges, as the agent is free to navigate any unobstructed location and is more vulnerable to visual occlusions or blind spots. Recent approaches have attempted to address this by imagining future environments, either through predicted future visual images or semantic features, rather than relying solely on current observations. However, these RGB-based and feature-based methods lack intuitive appearance-level information or high-level semantic complexity crucial for effective navigation. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel, generalizable 3DGS-based pre-training paradigm, called UnitedVLN, which enables agents to better explore future environments by unitedly rendering high-fidelity 360 visual images and semantic features. UnitedVLN employs two key schemes: search-then-query sampling and separate-then-united rendering, which facilitate efficient exploitation of neural primitives, helping to integrate both appearance and semantic information for more robust navigation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UnitedVLN outperforms state-of-the-art methods on existing VLN-CE benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anubhav Jain, Yuya Kobayashi, Takashi Shibuya, Yuhta Takida, Nasir Memon, Julian Togelius, Yuki Mitsufuji</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models are prone to exactly reproduce images from the training data. This exact reproduction of the training data is concerning as it can lead to copyright infringement and/or leakage of privacy-sensitive information. In this paper, we present a novel perspective on the memorization phenomenon and propose a simple yet effective approach to mitigate it. We argue that memorization occurs because of an attraction basin in the denoising process which steers the diffusion trajectory towards a memorized image. However, this can be mitigated by guiding the diffusion trajectory away from the attraction basin by not applying classifier-free guidance until an ideal transition point occurs from which classifier-free guidance is applied. This leads to the generation of non-memorized images that are high in image quality and well-aligned with the conditioning mechanism. To further improve on this, we present a new guidance technique, opposite guidance, that escapes the attraction basin sooner in the denoising process. We demonstrate the existence of attraction basins in various scenarios in which memorization occurs, and we show that our proposed approach successfully mitigates memorization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanhui Wang, Yihua Zhang, Ruizheng Bai, Yue Zhao, Sijia Liu, Zhengzhong Tu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have made generative image editing more accessible, enabling creative edits but raising ethical concerns, particularly regarding malicious edits to human portraits that threaten privacy and identity security. Existing protection methods primarily rely on adversarial perturbations to nullify edits but often fail against diverse editing requests. We propose FaceLock, a novel approach to portrait protection that optimizes adversarial perturbations to destroy or significantly alter biometric information, rendering edited outputs biometrically unrecognizable. FaceLock integrates facial recognition and visual perception into perturbation optimization to provide robust protection against various editing attempts. We also highlight flaws in commonly used evaluation metrics and reveal how they can be manipulated, emphasizing the need for reliable assessments of protection. Experiments show FaceLock outperforms baselines in defending against malicious edits and is robust against purification techniques. Ablation studies confirm its stability and broad applicability across diffusion-based editing algorithms. Our work advances biometric defense and sets the foundation for privacy-preserving practices in image editing. The code is available at: https://github.com/taco-group/FaceLock.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17388">Can LLMs be Good Graph Judger for Knowledge Graph Construction?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyu Huang, Chong Chen, Conghui He, Yang Li, Jiawei Jiang, Wentao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In real-world scenarios, most of the data obtained from information retrieval (IR) system is unstructured. Converting natural language sentences into structured Knowledge Graphs (KGs) remains a critical challenge. The quality of constructed KGs may also impact the performance of some KG-dependent domains like GraphRAG systems and recommendation systems. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in addressing a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However, there are still challenges when utilizing LLMs to address the task of generating structured KGs. And we have identified three limitations with respect to existing KG construction methods. (1)There is a large amount of information and excessive noise in real-world documents, which could result in extracting messy information. (2)Native LLMs struggle to effectively extract accuracy knowledge from some domain-specific documents. (3)Hallucinations phenomenon cannot be overlooked when utilizing LLMs directly as an unsupervised method for constructing KGs.
  In this paper, we propose GraphJudger, a knowledge graph construction framework to address the aforementioned challenges. We introduce three innovative modules in our method, which are entity-centric iterative text denoising, knowledge aware instruction tuning and graph judgement, respectively. We seek to utilize the capacity of LLMs to function as a graph judger, a capability superior to their role only as a predictor for KG construction problems. Experiments conducted on two general text-graph pair datasets and one domain-specific text-graph pair dataset show superior performances compared to baseline methods. The code of our proposed method is available at https://github.com/hhy-huang/GraphJudger.</p>

Occhipinti</p>
<p>Abstract: At-home rehabilitation for post-stroke patients presents significant challenges, as continuous, personalized care is often limited outside clinical settings. Additionally, the absence of comprehensive solutions addressing diverse monitoring and assistance needs in home environments complicates recovery efforts. Here, we present a multimodal smart home platform designed for continuous, at-home rehabilitation of post-stroke patients, integrating wearable sensing, ambient monitoring, and adaptive automation. A plantar pressure insole equipped with a machine learning pipeline classifies users into motor recovery stages with up to 94% accuracy, enabling quantitative tracking of walking patterns. A head-mounted eye-tracking module supports cognitive assessments and hands-free control of household devices, while ambient sensors ensure sub-second response times for interaction. These data streams are fused locally via a hierarchical Internet of Things (IoT) architecture, protecting privacy and minimizing latency. An embedded large language model (LLM) agent, Auto-Care, continuously interprets multimodal data to provide real-time interventions-issuing personalized reminders, adjusting environmental conditions, and notifying caregivers. Implemented in a post-stroke context, this integrated smart home platform increases overall user satisfaction by an average of 115% (p<0.01) compared to traditional home environment. Beyond stroke, the system offers a scalable framework for patient-centered, long-term care in broader neurorehabilitation and aging-in-place applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jun Gao, Yongqi Li, Ziqiang Cao, Wenjie Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting elicits large language models (LLMs) to produce a series of intermediate reasoning steps before arriving at the final answer. However, when transitioning to vision-language models (VLMs), their text-only rationales struggle to express the fine-grained associations with the original image. In this paper, we propose an image-incorporated multimodal Chain-of-Thought, named \textbf{Interleaved-modal Chain-of-Thought (ICoT)}, which generates sequential reasoning steps consisting of paired visual and textual rationales to infer the final answer. Intuitively, the novel ICoT requires VLMs to enable the generation of fine-grained interleaved-modal content, which is hard for current VLMs to fulfill. Considering that the required visual information is usually part of the input image, we propose \textbf{Attention-driven Selection (ADS)} to realize ICoT over existing VLMs. ADS intelligently inserts regions of the input image to generate the interleaved-modal reasoning steps with ignorable additional latency. ADS relies solely on the attention map of VLMs without the need for parameterization, and therefore it is a plug-and-play strategy that can be generalized to a spectrum of VLMs. We apply ADS to realize ICoT on two popular VLMs of different architectures. Extensive evaluations of three benchmarks have shown that ICoT prompting achieves substantial performance (up to 14\%) and interpretability improvements compared to existing multimodal CoT prompting methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenjia Wang, Liang Pan, Zhiyang Dou, Jidong Mei, Zhouyingcheng Liao, Yuke Lou, Yifan Wu, Lei Yang, Jingbo Wang, Taku Komura</p>
<p>Abstract: Simulating stylized human-scene interactions (HSI) in physical environments is a challenging yet fascinating task. Prior works emphasize long-term execution but fall short in achieving both diverse style and physical plausibility. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel hierarchical framework named SIMS that seamlessly bridges highlevel script-driven intent with a low-level control policy, enabling more expressive and diverse human-scene interactions. Specifically, we employ Large Language Models with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to generate coherent and diverse long-form scripts, providing a rich foundation for motion planning. A versatile multicondition physics-based control policy is also developed, which leverages text embeddings from the generated scripts to encode stylistic cues, simultaneously perceiving environmental geometries and accomplishing task goals. By integrating the retrieval-augmented script generation with the multi-condition controller, our approach provides a unified solution for generating stylized HSI motions. We further introduce a comprehensive planning dataset produced by RAG and a stylized motion dataset featuring diverse locomotions and interactions. Extensive experiments demonstrate SIMS's effectiveness in executing various tasks and generalizing across different scenarios, significantly outperforming previous methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Heitor R. Medeiros, Atif Belal, Srikanth Muralidharan, Eric Granger, Marco Pedersoli</p>
<p>Abstract: The zero-shot performance of object detectors degrades when tested on different modalities, such as infrared and depth. While recent work has explored image translation techniques to adapt detectors to new modalities, these methods are limited to a single modality and apply only to traditional detectors. Recently, vision-language detectors, such as YOLO-World and Grounding DINO, have shown promising zero-shot capabilities, however, they have not yet been adapted for other visual modalities. Traditional fine-tuning approaches compromise the zero-shot capabilities of the detectors. The visual prompt strategies commonly used for classification with vision-language models apply the same linear prompt translation to each image, making them less effective. To address these limitations, we propose ModPrompt, a visual prompt strategy to adapt vision-language detectors to new modalities without degrading zero-shot performance. In particular, an encoder-decoder visual prompt strategy is proposed, further enhanced by the integration of inference-friendly modality prompt decoupled residual, facilitating a more robust adaptation. Empirical benchmarking results show our method for modality adaptation on two vision-language detectors, YOLO-World and Grounding DINO, and on challenging infrared (LLVIP, FLIR) and depth (NYUv2) datasets, achieving performance comparable to full fine-tuning while preserving the model's zero-shot capability.

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) gained immense popularity due to their impressive capabilities in unstructured conversations. Empowering LLMs with advanced prompting strategies such as reasoning and acting (ReAct) (Yao et al., 2022) has shown promise in solving complex tasks traditionally requiring reinforcement learning. In this work, we apply the ReAct strategy to guide LLMs performing task-oriented dialogue (TOD). We evaluate ReAct-based LLMs (ReAct-LLMs) both in simulation and with real users. While ReAct-LLMs severely underperform state-of-the-art approaches on success rate in simulation, this difference becomes less pronounced in human evaluation. Moreover, compared to the baseline, humans report higher subjective satisfaction with ReAct-LLM despite its lower success rate, most likely thanks to its natural and confidently phrased responses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Khaled Abud, Sergey Lavrushkin, Alexey Kirillov, Dmitriy Vatolin</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion-based models have recently revolutionized image generation, achieving unprecedented levels of fidelity. However, consistent generation of high-quality images remains challenging partly due to the lack of conditioning mechanisms for perceptual quality. In this work, we propose methods to integrate image quality assessment (IQA) models into diffusion-based generators, enabling quality-aware image generation. We show that diffusion models can learn complex qualitative relationships from both IQA models' outputs and internal activations. First, we experiment with gradient-based guidance to optimize image quality directly and show this method has limited generalizability. To address this, we introduce IQA-Adapter, a novel framework that conditions generation on target quality levels by learning the implicit relationship between images and quality scores. When conditioned on high target quality, IQA-Adapter can shift the distribution of generated images towards a higher-quality subdomain, and, inversely, it can be used as a degradation model, generating progressively more distorted images when provided with a lower-quality signal. Under high-quality condition, IQA-Adapter achieves up to a 10% improvement across multiple objective metrics, as confirmed by a user preference study, while preserving generative diversity and content. Furthermore, we extend IQA-Adapter to a reference-based conditioning scenario, utilizing the rich activation space of IQA models to transfer highly specific, content-agnostic qualitative features between images.</p>

<p>Abstract: Search is an ability foundational in many important tasks, and recent studies have shown that large language models (LLMs) struggle to perform search robustly. It is unknown whether this inability is due to a lack of data, insufficient model parameters, or fundamental limitations of the transformer architecture. In this work, we use the foundational graph connectivity problem as a testbed to generate effectively limitless high-coverage data to train small transformers and test whether they can learn to perform search. We find that, when given the right training distribution, the transformer is able to learn to search.
  We analyze the algorithm that the transformer has learned through a novel mechanistic interpretability technique that enables us to extract the computation graph from the trained model. We find that transformers perform search at every vertex in parallel: For each vertex in the input graph, transformers compute the set of vertices reachable from that vertex. Each layer then progressively expands these sets, allowing the model to search over a number of vertices exponential in $n_{\text{layers}}$.
  However, we find that as the input graph size increases, the transformer has greater difficulty in learning the task. This difficulty is not resolved even as the number of parameters is increased, suggesting that increasing model scale will not lead to robust search abilities. We also find that performing search in-context (i.e., chain-of-thought) does not resolve this inability to learn to search on larger graphs.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces M$^{3}$-20M, a large-scale Multi-Modal Molecule dataset that contains over 20 million molecules, with the data mainly being integrated from existing databases and partially generated by large language models. Designed to support AI-driven drug design and discovery, M$^{3}$-20M is 71 times more in the number of molecules than the largest existing dataset, providing an unprecedented scale that can highly benefit the training or fine-tuning of models, including large language models for drug design and discovery tasks. This dataset integrates one-dimensional SMILES, two-dimensional molecular graphs, three-dimensional molecular structures, physicochemical properties, and textual descriptions collected through web crawling and generated using GPT-3.5, offering a comprehensive view of each molecule. To demonstrate the power of M$^{3}$-20M in drug design and discovery, we conduct extensive experiments on two key tasks: molecule generation and molecular property prediction, using large language models including GLM4, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Llama3-8b. Our experimental results show that M$^{3}$-20M can significantly boost model performance in both tasks. Specifically, it enables the models to generate more diverse and valid molecular structures and achieve higher property prediction accuracy than existing single-modal datasets, which validates the value and potential of M$^{3}$-20M in supporting AI-driven drug design and discovery.

<p>Abstract: Quantization is a critical step to enable efficient LLM serving under limited resource. However, previous research observes that certain weights in the LLM, known as outliers, are significantly sensitive to quantization noises. Existing quantization methods leave these outliers as floating points or higher precisions to retain performance, posting challenges on the efficient hardware deployment of the mixed-precision model. This work investigates an alternative way to tame the sensitive weights' impact on the quantization error, by reducing the loss Hessian trace with respect to outliers through an efficient fine-tuning process. We propose Noise Perturbation Fine-tuning (NPFT), which identifies outlier weights and add random weight perturbations on the outliers as the model going through a PEFT optimization. NPFT tames the sensitivity of outlier weights so that the quantized model performance can be improved without special treatment to the outliers. When applied to OPT and LLaMA models, our NPFT method achieves stable performance improvements for both uniform and non-uniform quantizers, while also offering better inference efficiency. Notably, the simplest RTN can achieve performance on par with GPTQ using our NPFT on LLaMA2-7B-4bits benchmark.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anubhav Jain, Yuya Kobayashi, Takashi Shibuya, Yuhta Takida, Nasir Memon, Julian Togelius, Yuki Mitsufuji</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image diffusion models have brought them to the public spotlight, becoming widely accessible and embraced by everyday users. However, these models have been shown to generate harmful content such as not-safe-for-work (NSFW) images. While approaches have been proposed to erase such abstract concepts from the models, jail-breaking techniques have succeeded in bypassing such safety measures. In this paper, we propose TraSCE, an approach to guide the diffusion trajectory away from generating harmful content. Our approach is based on negative prompting, but as we show in this paper, a widely used negative prompting strategy is not a complete solution and can easily be bypassed in some corner cases. To address this issue, we first propose using a specific formulation of negative prompting instead of the widely used one. Furthermore, we introduce a localized loss-based guidance that enhances the modified negative prompting technique by steering the diffusion trajectory. We demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks in removing harmful content, including ones proposed by red teams, and erasing artistic styles and objects. Our proposed approach does not require any training, weight modifications, or training data (either image or prompt), making it easier for model owners to erase new concepts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kyle Stein, Andrew Arash Mahyari, Guillermo Francia, Eman El-Sheikh</p>
<p>Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a critical threat by embedding hidden triggers into inputs, causing models to misclassify them into target labels. While extensive research has focused on mitigating these attacks in object recognition models through weight fine-tuning, much less attention has been given to detecting backdoored samples directly. Given the vast datasets used in training, manual inspection for backdoor triggers is impractical, and even state-of-the-art defense mechanisms fail to fully neutralize their impact. To address this gap, we introduce a groundbreaking method to detect unseen backdoored images during both training and inference. Leveraging the transformative success of prompt tuning in Vision Language Models (VLMs), our approach trains learnable text prompts to differentiate clean images from those with hidden backdoor triggers. Experiments demonstrate the exceptional efficacy of this method, achieving an impressive average accuracy of 86% across two renowned datasets for detecting unseen backdoor triggers, establishing a new standard in backdoor defense.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yilei Zhao, Wentao Zhang, Tingran Yang, Yong Jiang, Fei Huang, Wei Yang Bryan Lim</p>
<p>Abstract: In financial trading, factor models are widely used to price assets and capture excess returns from mispricing. Recently, we have witnessed the rise of variational autoencoder-based latent factor models, which learn latent factors self-adaptively. While these models focus on modeling overall market conditions, they often fail to effectively capture the temporal patterns of individual stocks. Additionally, representing multiple factors as single values simplifies the model but limits its ability to capture complex relationships and dependencies. As a result, the learned factors are of low quality and lack diversity, reducing their effectiveness and robustness across different trading periods. To address these issues, we propose a Spatio-Temporal factOR Model based on dual vector quantized variational autoencoders, named STORM, which extracts features of stocks from temporal and spatial perspectives, then fuses and aligns these features at the fine-grained and semantic level, and represents the factors as multi-dimensional embeddings. The discrete codebooks cluster similar factor embeddings, ensuring orthogonality and diversity, which helps distinguish between different factors and enables factor selection in financial trading. To show the performance of the proposed factor model, we apply it to two downstream experiments: portfolio management on two stock datasets and individual trading tasks on six specific stocks. The extensive experiments demonstrate STORM's flexibility in adapting to downstream tasks and superior performance over baseline models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Chen, Ze Wang, Xiang Li, Ximeng Sun, Fangyi Chen, Jiang Liu, Jindong Wang, Bhiksha Raj, Zicheng Liu, Emad Barsoum</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficient image tokenization with high compression ratios remains a critical challenge for training generative models. We present SoftVQ-VAE, a continuous image tokenizer that leverages soft categorical posteriors to aggregate multiple codewords into each latent token, substantially increasing the representation capacity of the latent space. When applied to Transformer-based architectures, our approach compresses 256x256 and 512x512 images using as few as 32 or 64 1-dimensional tokens. Not only does SoftVQ-VAE show consistent and high-quality reconstruction, more importantly, it also achieves state-of-the-art and significantly faster image generation results across different denoising-based generative models. Remarkably, SoftVQ-VAE improves inference throughput by up to 18x for generating 256x256 images and 55x for 512x512 images while achieving competitive FID scores of 1.78 and 2.21 for SiT-XL. It also improves the training efficiency of the generative models by reducing the number of training iterations by 2.3x while maintaining comparable performance. With its fully-differentiable design and semantic-rich latent space, our experiment demonstrates that SoftVQ-VAE achieves efficient tokenization without compromising generation quality, paving the way for more efficient generative models. Code and model are released.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiale Cheng, Xiao Liu, Cunxiang Wang, Xiaotao Gu, Yida Lu, Dan Zhang, Yuxiao Dong, Jie Tang, Hongning Wang, Minlie Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Instruction-following is a fundamental capability of language models, requiring the model to recognize even the most subtle requirements in the instructions and accurately reflect them in its output. Such an ability is well-suited for and often optimized by preference learning. However, existing methods often directly sample multiple independent responses from the model when creating preference pairs. Such practice can introduce content variations irrelevant to whether the instruction is precisely followed (e.g., different expressions about the same semantic), interfering with the goal of teaching models to recognize the key differences that lead to improved instruction following. In light of this, we introduce SPaR, a self-play framework integrating tree-search self-refinement to yield valid and comparable preference pairs free from distractions. By playing against itself, an LLM employs a tree-search strategy to refine its previous responses with respect to the instruction while minimizing unnecessary variations. Our experiments show that a LLaMA3-8B model, trained over three iterations guided by SPaR, surpasses GPT-4-Turbo on the IFEval benchmark without losing general capabilities. Furthermore, SPaR demonstrates promising scalability, greatly enhancing models like GLM-4-9B and LLaMA3-70B. We also identify how inference scaling in tree search would impact model performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kun Wu, Yinuo Zhao, Zhiyuan Xu, Zhengping Che, Chengxiang Yin, Chi Harold Liu, Feiferi Feng, Jian Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL), which operates solely on static datasets without further interactions with the environment, provides an appealing alternative to learning a safe and promising control policy. The prevailing methods typically learn a conservative policy to mitigate the problem of Q-value overestimation, but it is prone to overdo it, leading to an overly conservative policy. Moreover, they optimize all samples equally with fixed constraints, lacking the nuanced ability to control conservative levels in a fine-grained manner. Consequently, this limitation results in a performance decline. To address the above two challenges in a united way, we propose a framework, Adaptive Conservative Level in Q-Learning (ACL-QL), which limits the Q-values in a mild range and enables adaptive control on the conservative level over each state-action pair, i.e., lifting the Q-values more for good transitions and less for bad transitions. We theoretically analyze the conditions under which the conservative level of the learned Q-function can be limited in a mild range and how to optimize each transition adaptively. Motivated by the theoretical analysis, we propose a novel algorithm, ACL-QL, which uses two learnable adaptive weight functions to control the conservative level over each transition. Subsequently, we design a monotonicity loss and surrogate losses to train the adaptive weight functions, Q-function, and policy network alternatively. We evaluate ACL-QL on the commonly used D4RL benchmark and conduct extensive ablation studies to illustrate the effectiveness and state-of-the-art performance compared to existing offline DRL baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dewu Zheng, Yanlin Wang, Ensheng Shi, Xilin Liu, Yuchi Ma, Hongyu Zhang, Zibin Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), extensive research has been conducted to investigate the code generation capabilities of LLMs. However, existing efforts primarily focus on general-domain tasks, leaving LLMs' code generation performance in real-world application domains underexplored. This raises a critical question: can a model's general-domain coding ability reliably represent its ability in specialized domains? In this paper, we introduce DomainCodeBench, a multi-domain code generation benchmark designed to systematically evaluate LLMs across 12 software application domains and 15 programming languages. DomainCodeBench contains 2,400 manually verified tasks with ground truth, human-annotated docstrings, and fine-grained dependency information to ensure more coverage of domain-specific challenges. Specifically, we first identify the most popular application domains by topic mining. Then, we curate coding tasks based on commonly used frameworks and platforms in each domain. We obtain several findings through extensive experiments on DomainCodeBench with ten mainstream LLMs. (1) Performance decoupling: experiments reveal that top general-domain models do not consistently excel in specific application domains; (2) Domain-specific weaknesses: LLMs often fail due to domain knowledge gaps and third-party library misusage; (3) Contextual enhancement: we show that augmenting prompts with domain-specific knowledge improves performance by around 38.17%, providing actionable insights for performance optimization.

<p>Abstract: Multimodal Vision Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a transformative technology at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing, enabling machines to perceive and reason about the world through both visual and textual modalities. For example, models such as CLIP, Claude, and GPT-4V demonstrate strong reasoning and understanding abilities on visual and textual data and beat classical single modality vision models on zero-shot classification. Despite their rapid advancements in research and growing popularity in applications, a comprehensive survey of existing studies on VLMs is notably lacking, particularly for researchers aiming to leverage VLMs in their specific domains. To this end, we provide a systematic overview of VLMs in the following aspects: model information of the major VLMs developed over the past five years (2019-2024); the main architectures and training methods of these VLMs; summary and categorization of the popular benchmarks and evaluation metrics of VLMs; the applications of VLMs including embodied agents, robotics, and video generation; the challenges and issues faced by current VLMs such as hallucination, fairness, and safety.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuliang Guo, Sparsh Garg, S. Mahdi H. Miangoleh, Xinyu Huang, Liu Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: While recent depth foundation models exhibit strong zero-shot generalization, achieving accurate metric depth across diverse camera types-particularly those with large fields of view (FoV) such as fisheye and 360-degree cameras-remains a significant challenge. This paper presents Depth Any Camera (DAC), a powerful zero-shot metric depth estimation framework that extends a perspective-trained model to effectively handle cameras with varying FoVs. The framework is designed to ensure that all existing 3D data can be leveraged, regardless of the specific camera types used in new applications. Remarkably, DAC is trained exclusively on perspective images but generalizes seamlessly to fisheye and 360-degree cameras without the need for specialized training data. DAC employs Equi-Rectangular Projection (ERP) as a unified image representation, enabling consistent processing of images with diverse FoVs. Its core components include pitch-aware Image-to-ERP conversion with efficient online augmentation to simulate distorted ERP patches from undistorted inputs, FoV alignment operations to enable effective training across a wide range of FoVs, and multi-resolution data augmentation to further address resolution disparities between training and testing. DAC achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot metric depth estimation, improving $\delta_1$ accuracy by up to 50% on multiple fisheye and 360-degree datasets compared to prior metric depth foundation models, demonstrating robust generalization across camera types.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mayukh Bagchi</p>
<p>Abstract: Since decades, the modelling of metadata has been core to the functioning of any academic library. Its importance has only enhanced with the increasing pervasiveness of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven information activities and services which constitute a library's outreach. However, with the rising importance of metadata, there arose several outstanding problems with the process of designing a library metadata model impacting its reusability, crosswalk and interoperability with other metadata models. This paper posits that the above problems stem from an underlying thesis that there should only be a few core metadata models which would be necessary and sufficient for any information service using them, irrespective of the heterogeneity of intra-domain or inter-domain settings. To that end, this paper advances a contrary view of the above thesis and substantiates its argument in three key steps. First, it introduces a novel way of thinking about a library metadata model as an ontology-driven composition of five functionally interlinked representation levels from perception to its intensional definition via properties. Second, it introduces the representational manifoldness implicit in each of the five levels which cumulatively contributes to a conceptually entangled library metadata model. Finally, and most importantly, it proposes a Generative AI-driven Human-Large Language Model (LLM) collaboration based metadata modelling approach to disentangle the entanglement inherent in each representation level leading to the generation of a conceptually disentangled metadata model. Throughout the paper, the arguments are exemplified by motivating scenarios and examples from representative libraries handling cancer information.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zheqi Lv, Wenkai Wang, Jiawei Wang, Shengyu Zhang, Fei Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficient Multimodal Large Language Models (EMLLMs) can improve performance through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, but they have poor self-evaluation capabilities during the CoT reasoning process. This is due to their tendency to simplify the reasoning process and the degradation of self-evaluation ability during downstream task fine-tuning. To address this, we intuitively propose \textit{Self-Evaluation Augmented Training (SEAT)}, which uses more powerful EMLLMs to evaluate CoT reasoning data. The evaluation data is then used to train EMLLMs. However, due to the difficulties EMLLMs face with processing long token input-output sequences, and the degradation of self-evaluation ability as a basis for CoT reasoning, the SEAT method is not fully adapted. Therefore, we further propose \textit{Cascaded Self-Evaluation Augmented Training (Cas-SEAT)}, which converts long prompts into cascaded short prompts, each focusing on a specific task. Additionally, we mix CoT reasoning and self-evaluation data to preserve its CoT reasoning ability while enhancing the self-evaluation capability of EMLLMs. We also conduct \textit{Double-level Data Filtering (DDF)}, which includes source data filtering and labeled data filtering, using both manual selection and MLLMs for filtering. Cas-SEAT and DDF work together to improve the performance of EMLLMs. Experiments show that Cas-SEAT achieves an average improvement of 22.16% across multiple datasets, and DDF significantly reduces the resource consumption of training</p>

<p>Abstract: Automated audio captioning is a task that generates textual descriptions for audio content, and recent studies have explored using visual information to enhance captioning quality. However, current methods often fail to effectively fuse audio and visual data, missing important semantic cues from each modality. To address this, we introduce LAVCap, a large language model (LLM)-based audio-visual captioning framework that effectively integrates visual information with audio to improve audio captioning performance. LAVCap employs an optimal transport-based alignment loss to bridge the modality gap between audio and visual features, enabling more effective semantic extraction. Additionally, we propose an optimal transport attention module that enhances audio-visual fusion using an optimal transport assignment map. Combined with the optimal training strategy, experimental results demonstrate that each component of our framework is effective. LAVCap outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on the AudioCaps dataset, without relying on large datasets or post-processing.

<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation equips large language models with the capability to retrieve external knowledge, thereby mitigating hallucinations by incorporating information beyond the model's intrinsic abilities. However, most prior works have focused on invoking retrieval deterministically, which makes it unsuitable for tasks such as long-form question answering. Instead, dynamically performing retrieval by invoking it only when the underlying LLM lacks the required knowledge can be more efficient. In this context, we delve deeper into the question, "To Retrieve or Not to Retrieve?" by exploring multiple uncertainty detection methods. We evaluate these methods for the task of long-form question answering, employing dynamic retrieval, and present our comparisons. Our findings suggest that uncertainty detection metrics, such as Degree Matrix Jaccard and Eccentricity, can reduce the number of retrieval calls by almost half, with only a slight reduction in question-answering accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zijin Hong, Hao Wu, Su Dong, Junnan Dong, Yilin Xiao, Yujing Zhang, Zhu Wang, Feiran Huang, Linyi Li, Hongxia Yang, Xiao Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies have raised concerns about the reliability of current mathematical benchmarks, highlighting issues such as simplistic design and potential data contamination. Therefore, creating a reliable benchmark that effectively evaluates the genuine capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in mathematical reasoning remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose RV-Bench, a framework for Benchmarking LLMs via Random Variables in mathematical reasoning. Specifically, the background content of a random variable question (RV question) mirrors the original problem in existing benchmarks, but the variable combinations are randomized, making it "unseen" by the LLMs. Models must completely understand the question pattern of the original problem to correctly answer RV questions with various variable values. As a result, the LLM's genuine capability in mathematical reasoning is reflected by its accuracy and robustness on RV-Bench. We conducted extensive experiments on over 30 representative LLMs across more than 1000 RV questions. Our findings suggest that LLMs exhibit an imbalance in proficiency between encountered and "unseen" data domains. Proficiency generalization across similar mathematical reasoning tasks is verified to be limited by accuracy and robustness, but it can still be enhanced through test-time scaling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ningyu Xu, Qi Zhang, Chao Du, Qiang Luo, Xipeng Qiu, Xuanjing Huang, Menghan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) provide a new opportunity to address the long-standing question of how concepts are represented and organized in the mind, which is central to unravelling the nature of human cognition. Here, we reframed the classic reverse dictionary task to simulate human concept inference in context and investigated the emergence of human-like conceptual representations within LLMs. We found that LLMs were able to infer concepts from definitional descriptions and construct representation spaces that converge towards a shared, context-independent structure. These representations effectively predicted human behavioural judgments and aligned well with neural activity patterns in the human brain, offering evidence for biological plausibility. These findings demonstrate that human-like conceptual representations and organization can naturally emerge from language prediction, even without real-world grounding. Our work supports the view that LLMs serve as valuable tools for understanding complex human cognition and paves the way for better alignment between artificial and human intelligence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yooseop Lee, Suin Kim, Yohan Jo</p>
<p>Abstract: In designing multiple-choice questions (MCQs) in education, creating plausible distractors is crucial for identifying students' misconceptions and gaps in knowledge and accurately assessing their understanding. However, prior studies on distractor generation have not paid sufficient attention to enhancing the difficulty of distractors, resulting in reduced effectiveness of MCQs. This study presents a pipeline for training a model to generate distractors that are more likely to be selected by students. First, we train a pairwise ranker to reason about students' misconceptions and assess the relative plausibility of two distractors. Using this model, we create a dataset of pairwise distractor ranks and then train a distractor generator via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to generate more plausible distractors. Experiments on computer science subjects (Python, DB, MLDL) demonstrate that our pairwise ranker effectively identifies students' potential misunderstandings and achieves ranking accuracy comparable to human experts. Furthermore, our distractor generator outperforms several baselines in generating plausible distractors and produces questions with a higher item discrimination index (DI).</p>

<p>Abstract: Albeit the ubiquitous use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in machine learning (ML) prediction tasks involving graph-structured data, their interpretability remains challenging. In explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), the Shapley Value (SV) is the predominant method to quantify contributions of individual features to a ML model's output. Addressing the limitations of SVs in complex prediction models, Shapley Interactions (SIs) extend the SV to groups of features. In this work, we explain single graph predictions of GNNs with SIs that quantify node contributions and interactions among multiple nodes. By exploiting the GNN architecture, we show that the structure of interactions in node embeddings are preserved for graph prediction. As a result, the exponential complexity of SIs depends only on the receptive fields, i.e. the message-passing ranges determined by the connectivity of the graph and the number of convolutional layers. Based on our theoretical results, we introduce GraphSHAP-IQ, an efficient approach to compute any-order SIs exactly. GraphSHAP-IQ is applicable to popular message passing techniques in conjunction with a linear global pooling and output layer. We showcase that GraphSHAP-IQ substantially reduces the exponential complexity of computing exact SIs on multiple benchmark datasets. Beyond exact computation, we evaluate GraphSHAP-IQ's approximation of SIs on popular GNN architectures and compare with existing baselines. Lastly, we visualize SIs of real-world water distribution networks and molecule structures using a SI-Graph.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Srinitish Srinivasan, Omkumar CU</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph representation learning has emerged as a cornerstone for tasks like node classification and link prediction, yet prevailing self-supervised learning (SSL) methods face challenges such as computational inefficiency, reliance on contrastive objectives, and representation collapse. Existing approaches often depend on feature reconstruction, negative sampling, or complex decoders, which introduce training overhead and hinder generalization. Further, current techniques which address such limitations fail to account for the contribution of node embeddings to a certain prediction in the absence of labeled nodes. To address these limitations, we propose a novel joint embedding predictive framework for graph SSL that eliminates contrastive objectives and negative sampling while preserving semantic and structural information. Additionally, we introduce a semantic-aware objective term that incorporates pseudo-labels derived from Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), enhancing node discriminability by evaluating latent feature contributions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art graph SSL methods across benchmarks, achieving superior performance without contrastive loss or complex decoders. Key innovations include (1) a non-contrastive, view-invariant joint embedding predictive architecture, (2) Leveraging single context and multiple targets relationship between subgraphs, and (3) GMM-based pseudo-label scoring to capture semantic contributions. This work advances graph SSL by offering a computationally efficient, collapse-resistant paradigm that bridges spatial and semantic graph features for downstream tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ashutosh Kumar, Aman Chadha</p>
<p>Abstract: This study explores the challenges of integrating human visual cue-based dehazing into object detection, given the selective nature of human perception. While human vision adapts dynamically to environmental conditions, computational dehazing does not always enhance detection uniformly. We propose a multi-stage framework where a lightweight detector identifies regions of interest (RoIs), which are then improved via spatial attention-based dehazing before final detection by a heavier model. Though effective in foggy conditions, this approach unexpectedly degrades the performance on clear images. We analyze this phenomenon, investigate possible causes, and offer insights for designing hybrid pipelines that balance enhancement and detection. Our findings highlight the need for selective preprocessing and challenge assumptions about universal benefits from cascading transformations.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper proposes ShapeShifter, a new 3D generative model that learns to synthesize shape variations based on a single reference model. While generative methods for 3D objects have recently attracted much attention, current techniques often lack geometric details and/or require long training times and large resources. Our approach remedies these issues by combining sparse voxel grids and point, normal, and color sampling within a multiscale neural architecture that can be trained efficiently and in parallel. We show that our resulting variations better capture the fine details of their original input and can handle more general types of surfaces than previous SDF-based methods. Moreover, we offer interactive generation of 3D shape variants, allowing more human control in the design loop if needed.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lu Yi, Jie Peng, Yanping Zheng, Fengran Mo, Zhewei Wei, Yuhang Ye, Yue Zixuan, Zengfeng Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Future link prediction is a fundamental challenge in various real-world dynamic systems. To address this, numerous temporal graph neural networks (temporal GNNs) and benchmark datasets have been developed. However, these datasets often feature excessive repeated edges and lack complex sequential dynamics, a key characteristic inherent in many real-world applications such as recommender systems and ``Who-To-Follow'' on social networks. This oversight has led existing methods to inadvertently downplay the importance of learning sequential dynamics, focusing primarily on predicting repeated edges.
  In this study, we demonstrate that existing methods, such as GraphMixer and DyGFormer, are inherently incapable of learning simple sequential dynamics, such as ``a user who has followed OpenAI and Anthropic is more likely to follow AI at Meta next.'' Motivated by this issue, we introduce the Temporal Graph Benchmark with Sequential Dynamics (TGB-Seq), a new benchmark carefully curated to minimize repeated edges, challenging models to learn sequential dynamics and generalize to unseen edges. TGB-Seq comprises large real-world datasets spanning diverse domains, including e-commerce interactions, movie ratings, business reviews, social networks, citation networks and web link networks. Benchmarking experiments reveal that current methods usually suffer significant performance degradation and incur substantial training costs on TGB-Seq, posing new challenges and opportunities for future research.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiuhong Shen, Xuanyu Yi, Mingbao Lin, Hanwang Zhang, Shuicheng Yan, Xinchao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of efficiently representing casually captured monocular videos in a spatially- and temporally-coherent manner. While existing approaches predominantly rely on 2D/2.5D techniques treating videos as collections of spatiotemporal pixels, they struggle with complex motions, occlusions, and geometric consistency due to absence of temporal coherence and explicit 3D structure. Drawing inspiration from monocular video as a projection of the dynamic 3D world, we explore representing videos in their intrinsic 3D form through continuous flows of Gaussian primitives in space-time. In this paper, we propose NutWorld, a novel framework that efficiently transforms monocular videos into dynamic 3D Gaussian representations in a single forward pass. At its core, NutWorld introduces a structured spatial-temporal aligned Gaussian (STAG) representation, enabling optimization-free scene modeling with effective depth and flow regularization. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that NutWorld achieves high-fidelity video reconstruction quality while enabling various downstream applications in real-time. Demos and code will be available at https://github.com/Nut-World/NutWorld.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liran Nochumsohn, Hedi Zisling, Omri Azencot</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate forecasting of multivariate time series data is important in many engineering and scientific applications. Recent state-of-the-art works ignore the inter-relations between variates, using their model on each variate independently. This raises several research questions related to proper modeling of multivariate data. In this work, we propose to view multivariate forecasting as a multi-task learning problem, facilitating the analysis of forecasting by considering the angle between task gradients and their balance. To do so, we analyze linear models to characterize the behavior of tasks. Our analysis suggests that tasks can be defined by grouping similar variates together, which we achieve via a simple clustering that depends on correlation-based similarities. Moreover, to balance tasks, we scale gradients with respect to their prediction error. Then, each task is solved with a linear model within our MTLinear framework. We evaluate our approach on challenging benchmarks in comparison to strong baselines, and we show it obtains on-par or better results on multivariate forecasting problems.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tenglong Liu, Jianxiong Li, Yinan Zheng, Haoyi Niu, Yixing Lan, Xin Xu, Xianyuan Zhan</p>
<p>Abstract: Humans excel at reusing prior knowledge to address new challenges and developing skills while solving problems. This paradigm becomes increasingly popular in the development of autonomous agents, as it develops systems that can self-evolve in response to new challenges like human beings. However, previous methods suffer from limited training efficiency when expanding new skills and fail to fully leverage prior knowledge to facilitate new task learning. In this paper, we propose Parametric Skill Expansion and Composition (PSEC), a new framework designed to iteratively evolve the agents' capabilities and efficiently address new challenges by maintaining a manageable skill library. This library can progressively integrate skill primitives as plug-and-play Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules in parameter-efficient finetuning, facilitating efficient and flexible skill expansion. This structure also enables the direct skill compositions in parameter space by merging LoRA modules that encode different skills, leveraging shared information across skills to effectively program new skills. Based on this, we propose a context-aware module to dynamically activate different skills to collaboratively handle new tasks. Empowering diverse applications including multi-objective composition, dynamics shift, and continual policy shift, the results on D4RL, DSRL benchmarks, and the DeepMind Control Suite show that PSEC exhibits superior capacity to leverage prior knowledge to efficiently tackle new challenges, as well as expand its skill libraries to evolve the capabilities.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lingze Zhang, Ellie Pavlick</p>
<p>Abstract: An increasingly common practice is to train large language models (LLMs) using synthetic data. Often this synthetic data is produced by the same or similar LLMs as those it is being used to train. This raises the question of whether the synthetic data might in fact exacerbate certain "blindspots" by reinforcing heuristics that the LLM already encodes. In this paper, we conduct simulated experiments on the natural language inference (NLI) task with Llama-2-7B-hf models. We use MultiNLI as the general task and HANS, a targeted evaluation set designed to measure the presence of specific heuristic strategies for NLI, as our "blindspot" task. Our goal is to determine whether performance disparities between the general and blind spot tasks emerge. Our results indicate that synthetic data does not reinforce blindspots in the way we expected. Specifically, we see that, while fine-tuning with synthetic data doesn't necessarily reduce the use of the heuristic, it also does not make it worse as we hypothesized.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ding-Tao Huang, Xinyi He, Debei Hua, Dongfang Yu, En-Te Lin, Long Zeng</p>
<p>Abstract: While recent advances in object suction grasping have shown remarkable progress, significant challenges persist particularly in cluttered and complex parcel handling scenarios. Two fundamental limitations hinder current approaches: (1) the lack of a comprehensive suction grasp dataset tailored for parcel manipulation tasks, and (2) insufficient adaptability to diverse object characteristics including size variations, geometric complexity, and textural diversity. To address these challenges, we present Parcel-Suction-Dataset, a large-scale synthetic dataset containing 25 thousand cluttered scenes with 410 million precision-annotated suction grasp poses. This dataset is generated through our novel geometric sampling algorithm that enables efficient generation of optimal suction grasps incorporating both physical constraints and material properties. We further propose Diffusion-Suction, an innovative framework that reformulates suction grasp prediction as a conditional generation task through denoising diffusion probabilistic models. Our method iteratively refines random noise into suction grasp score maps through visual-conditioned guidance from point cloud observations, effectively learning spatial point-wise affordances from our synthetic dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the simple yet efficient Diffusion-Suction achieves new state-of-the-art performance compared to previous models on both Parcel-Suction-Dataset and the public SuctionNet-1Billion benchmark.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Bj\"orkegren, Jun Ho Choi, Divya Budihal, Dominic Sobhani, Oliver Garrod, Paul Atherton</p>
<p>Abstract: Although 85% of sub-Saharan Africa's population is covered by mobile broadband signal, only 37% use the internet, and those who do seldom use the web. The most frequently cited reason for low internet usage is the cost of data. We investigate whether AI can bridge this gap by analyzing 40,350 queries submitted to an AI chatbot by 469 teachers in Sierra Leone over 17 months. Teachers use AI for teaching assistance more frequently than web search. We compare the AI responses to the corresponding top search results for the same queries from the most popular local web search engine, google.com.sl. Only 2% of results for corresponding web searches contain content from in country. Additionally, the average web search result consumes 3,107 times more data than an AI response. Bandwidth alone costs \$2.41 per thousand web search results loaded, while the total cost of AI is \$0.30 per thousand responses. As a result, AI is 87% less expensive than web search. In blinded evaluations, an independent sample of teachers rate AI responses as more relevant, helpful, and correct than web search results. These findings suggest that AI-driven solutions can cost-effectively bridge information gaps in low-connectivity regions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junyi Guan, Abhijith Sharma, Chong Tian, Salem Lahlou</p>
<p>Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are increasingly explored for their energy efficiency and robustness in real-world applications, yet their privacy risks remain largely unexamined. In this work, we investigate the susceptibility of SNNs to Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) -- a major privacy threat where an adversary attempts to determine whether a given sample was part of the training dataset. While prior work suggests that SNNs may offer inherent robustness due to their discrete, event-driven nature, we find that its resilience diminishes as latency (T) increases. Furthermore, we introduce an input dropout strategy under black box setting, that significantly enhances membership inference in SNNs. Our findings challenge the assumption that SNNs are inherently more secure, and even though they are expected to be better, our results reveal that SNNs exhibit privacy vulnerabilities that are equally comparable to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jun Zhang, Jue Wang, Huan Li, Lidan Shou, Ke Chen, Yang You, Guiming Xie, Xuejian Gong, Kunlong Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced natural language processing with exceptional task generalization capabilities. Low-Rank Adaption (LoRA) offers a cost-effective fine-tuning solution, freezing the original model parameters and training only lightweight, low-rank adapter matrices. However, the memory footprint of LoRA is largely dominated by the original model parameters. To mitigate this, we propose LoRAM, a memory-efficient LoRA training scheme founded on the intuition that many neurons in over-parameterized LLMs have low training utility but are essential for inference. LoRAM presents a unique twist: it trains on a pruned (small) model to obtain pruned low-rank matrices, which are then recovered and utilized with the original (large) model for inference. Additionally, minimal-cost continual pre-training, performed by the model publishers in advance, aligns the knowledge discrepancy between pruned and original models. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of LoRAM across various pruning strategies and downstream tasks. For a model with 70 billion parameters, LoRAM enables training on a GPU with only 20G HBM, replacing an A100-80G GPU for LoRA training and 15 GPUs for full fine-tuning. Specifically, QLoRAM implemented by structured pruning combined with 4-bit quantization, for LLaMA-3.1-70B (LLaMA-2-70B), reduces the parameter storage cost that dominates the memory usage in low-rank matrix training by 15.81$\times$ (16.95$\times$), while achieving dominant performance gains over both the original LLaMA-3.1-70B (LLaMA-2-70B) and LoRA-trained LLaMA-3.1-8B (LLaMA-2-13B).

Through extensive experimentation on three distinct datasets (RefrigerationDevices, ElectricDevices, and PLAID), we quantitatively evaluate model performance and energy efficiency across different transformer configurations. Our experimental results demonstrate that static quantization reduces energy consumption by 29.14% while maintaining classification performance, and L1 pruning achieves a 63% improvement in inference speed with minimal accuracy degradation. Our findings provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of optimization strategies for transformer-based time series classification, establishing a foundation for efficient model deployment in resource-constrained environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xilin Jiang, Sukru Samet Dindar, Vishal Choudhari, Stephan Bickel, Ashesh Mehta, Guy M McKhann, Daniel Friedman, Adeen Flinker, Nima Mesgarani</p>
<p>Abstract: Auditory foundation models, including auditory large language models (LLMs), process all sound inputs equally, independent of listener perception. However, human auditory perception is inherently selective: listeners focus on specific speakers while ignoring others in complex auditory scenes. Existing models do not incorporate this selectivity, limiting their ability to generate perception-aligned responses. To address this, we introduce Intention-Informed Auditory Scene Understanding (II-ASU) and present Auditory Attention-Driven LLM (AAD-LLM), a prototype system that integrates brain signals to infer listener attention. AAD-LLM extends an auditory LLM by incorporating intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings to decode which speaker a listener is attending to and refine responses accordingly. The model first predicts the attended speaker from neural activity, then conditions response generation on this inferred attentional state. We evaluate AAD-LLM on speaker description, speech transcription and extraction, and question answering in multitalker scenarios, with both objective and subjective ratings showing improved alignment with listener intention. By taking a first step toward intention-aware auditory AI, this work explores a new paradigm where listener perception informs machine listening, paving the way for future listener-centered auditory systems.

<p>Abstract: Recent studies have shown that reducing symmetries in neural networks enhances linear mode connectivity between networks without requiring parameter space alignment, leading to improved performance in linearly interpolated neural networks. However, in practical applications, neural network interpolation is rarely used; instead, ensembles of networks are more common. In this paper, we empirically investigate the impact of reducing symmetries on the performance of deep ensembles and Mixture of Experts (MoE) across five datasets. Additionally, to explore deeper linear mode connectivity, we introduce the Mixture of Interpolated Experts (MoIE). Our results show that deep ensembles built on asymmetric neural networks achieve significantly better performance as ensemble size increases compared to their symmetric counterparts. In contrast, our experiments do not provide conclusive evidence on whether reducing symmetries affects both MoE and MoIE architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tian Yu Liu, Alessandro Achille, Matthew Trager, Aditya Golatkar, Luca Zancato, Stefano Soatto</p>
<p>Abstract: Providing Large Language Models with relevant contextual knowledge at inference time has been shown to greatly improve the quality of their generations. This is often achieved by prepending informative passages of text, or 'contexts', retrieved from external knowledge bases to their input. However, processing additional contexts online incurs significant computation costs that scale with their length. State Space Models (SSMs) offer a promising solution by allowing a database of contexts to be mapped onto fixed-dimensional states from which to start the generation. A key challenge arises when attempting to leverage information present across multiple contexts, since there is no straightforward way to condition generation on multiple independent states in existing SSMs. To address this, we leverage a simple mathematical relation derived from SSM dynamics to compose multiple states into one that efficiently approximates the effect of concatenating raw context tokens. Since the temporal ordering of contexts can often be uninformative, we enforce permutation-invariance by efficiently averaging states obtained via our composition algorithm across all possible context orderings. We evaluate our resulting method on WikiText and MSMARCO in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings, and show that we can match the strongest performing baseline while enjoying on average 5.4x speedup.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhan Chen, Yihong Luo, Yifan Song, Pengwen Dai, Jing Tang, Xiaochun Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite extensive research efforts focused on OOD detection on images, OOD detection on nodes in graph learning remains underexplored. The dependence among graph nodes hinders the trivial adaptation of existing approaches on images that assume inputs to be i.i.d. sampled, since many unique features and challenges specific to graphs are not considered, such as the heterophily issue. Recently, GNNSafe, which considers node dependence, adapted energy-based detection to the graph domain with state-of-the-art performance, however, it has two serious issues: 1) it derives node energy from classification logits without specifically tailored training for modeling data distribution, making it less effective at recognizing OOD data; 2) it highly relies on energy propagation, which is based on homophily assumption and will cause significant performance degradation on heterophilic graphs, where the node tends to have dissimilar distribution with its neighbors. To address the above issues, we suggest training EBMs by MLE to enhance data distribution modeling and remove energy propagation to overcome the heterophily issues. However, training EBMs via MLE requires performing MCMC sampling on both node feature and node neighbors, which is challenging due to the node interdependence and discrete graph topology. To tackle the sampling challenge, we introduce DeGEM, which decomposes the learning process into two parts: a graph encoder that leverages topology information for node representations and an energy head that operates in latent space. Extensive experiments validate that DeGEM, without OOD exposure during training, surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average AUROC improvement of 6.71% on homophilic graphs and 20.29% on heterophilic graphs, and even outperform methods trained with OOD exposure.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taishi Nakamura, Takuya Akiba, Kazuki Fujii, Yusuke Oda, Rio Yokota, Jun Suzuki</p>
<p>Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture reduces the training and inference cost significantly compared to a dense model of equivalent capacity. Upcycling is an approach that initializes and trains an MoE model using a pre-trained dense model. While upcycling leads to initial performance gains, the training progresses slower than when trained from scratch, leading to suboptimal performance in the long term. We propose Drop-Upcycling - a method that effectively addresses this problem. Drop-Upcycling combines two seemingly contradictory approaches: utilizing the knowledge of pre-trained dense models while statistically re-initializing some parts of the weights. This approach strategically promotes expert specialization, significantly enhancing the MoE model's efficiency in knowledge acquisition. Extensive large-scale experiments demonstrate that Drop-Upcycling significantly outperforms previous MoE construction methods in the long term, specifically when training on hundreds of billions of tokens or more. As a result, our MoE model with 5.9B active parameters achieves comparable performance to a 13B dense model in the same model family, while requiring approximately 1/4 of the training FLOPs. All experimental resources, including source code, training data, model checkpoints and logs, are publicly available to promote reproducibility and future research on MoE.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Carlos Luengo Vera, Ignacio Ferro Picon, M. Teresa del Val Nunez, Jose Andres Gomez Gandia, Antonio de Lucas Ancillo, Victor Ramos Arroyo, Carlos Milan Figueredo</p>
<p>Abstract: This study presents a comparative evaluation of 22 large language models LLMs on the Spanish Medical Intern Resident MIR examinations for 2024 and 2025 with a focus on clinical reasoning domain specific expertise and multimodal processing capabilities The MIR exam consisting of 210 multiple choice questions some requiring image interpretation serves as a stringent benchmark for assessing both factual recall and complex clinical problem solving skills Our investigation encompasses general purpose models such as GPT4 Claude LLaMA and Gemini as well as specialized fine tuned systems like Miri Pro which leverages proprietary Spanish healthcare data to excel in medical contexts
  Recent market entries Deepseek and Grok have further enriched the evaluation landscape particularly for tasks that demand advanced visual and semantic analysis The findings indicate that while general purpose LLMs perform robustly overall fine tuned models consistently achieve superior accuracy especially in addressing nuanced domain specific challenges A modest performance decline observed between the two exam cycles appears attributable to the implementation of modified questions designed to mitigate reliance on memorization
  The results underscore the transformative potential of domain specific fine tuning and multimodal integration in advancing medical AI applications They also highlight critical implications for the future integration of LLMs into medical education training and clinical decision making emphasizing the importance of balancing automated reasoning with ethical and context aware judgment</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingkai Sha, John S. Schreck, William Chapman, David John Gagne II</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) weather prediction (AIWP) models often produce "blurry" precipitation forecasts that overestimate drizzle and underestimate extremes. This study provides a novel solution to tackle this problem -- integrating terrain-following coordinates with global mass and energy conservation schemes into AIWP models. Forecast experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of this solution using FuXi, an example AIWP model, adapted to 1.0-degree grid spacing data. Verification results show large performance gains. The conservation schemes are found to reduce drizzle bias, whereas using terrain-following coordinates improves the estimation of extreme events and precipitation intensity spectra. Furthermore, a case study reveals that terrain-following coordinates capture near-surface winds better over mountains, offering AIWP models more accurate information on understanding the dynamics of precipitation processes. The proposed solution of this study can benefit a wide range of AIWP models and bring insights into how atmospheric domain knowledge can support the development of AIWP models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jacqueline R. M. A. Maasch, Alihan H\"uy\"uk, Xinnuo Xu, Aditya V. Nori, Javier Gonzalez</p>
<p>Abstract: Causal reasoning and compositional reasoning are two core aspirations in generative AI. Measuring the extent of these behaviors requires principled evaluation methods. We explore a unified perspective that considers both behaviors simultaneously, termed compositional causal reasoning (CCR): the ability to infer how causal measures compose and, equivalently, how causal quantities propagate through graphs. We instantiate a framework for the systematic evaluation of CCR for the average treatment effect and the probability of necessity and sufficiency. As proof of concept, we demonstrate the design of CCR tasks for language models in the LLama, Phi, and GPT families. On a math word problem, our framework revealed a range of taxonomically distinct error patterns. Additionally, CCR errors increased with the complexity of causal paths for all models except o1.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yijie Xu, Aiwei Liu, Xuming Hu, Lijie Wen, Hui Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: As open-source large language models (LLMs) like Llama3 become more capable, it is crucial to develop watermarking techniques to detect their potential misuse. Existing watermarking methods either add watermarks during LLM inference, which is unsuitable for open-source LLMs, or primarily target classification LLMs rather than recent generative LLMs. Adapting these watermarks to open-source LLMs for misuse detection remains an open challenge. This work defines two misuse scenarios for open-source LLMs: intellectual property (IP) violation and LLM Usage Violation. Then, we explore the application of inference-time watermark distillation and backdoor watermarking in these contexts. We propose comprehensive evaluation methods to assess the impact of various real-world further fine-tuning scenarios on watermarks and the effect of these watermarks on LLM performance. Our experiments reveal that backdoor watermarking could effectively detect IP Violation, while inference-time watermark distillation is applicable in both scenarios but less robust to further fine-tuning and has a more significant impact on LLM performance compared to backdoor watermarking. Exploring more advanced watermarking methods for open-source LLMs to detect their misuse should be an important future direction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Houyi Li, Wenzheng Zheng, Jingcheng Hu, Qiufeng Wang, Hanshan Zhang, Zili Wang, Shijie Xuyang, Yuantao Fan, Shuigeng Zhou, Xiangyu Zhang, Daxin Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: The impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) across diverse tasks are now well-established, yet their effective deployment necessitates careful hyperparameter optimization. Through extensive empirical studies involving grid searches across diverse configurations, we discover universal scaling laws governing these hyperparameters: optimal learning rate follows a power-law relationship with both model parameters and data sizes, while optimal batch size scales primarily with data sizes. Our analysis reveals a convex optimization landscape for hyperparameters under fixed models and data size conditions. This convexity implies an optimal hyperparameter plateau. We contribute a universal, plug-and-play optimal hyperparameter tool for the community. Its estimated values on the test set are merely 0.09% away from the globally optimal LLM performance found via an exhaustive search. These laws demonstrate remarkable robustness across variations in model sparsity, training data distribution, and model shape. To our best known, this is the first work that unifies different model shapes and structures, such as Mixture-of-Experts models and dense transformers, as well as establishes optimal hyperparameter scaling laws across diverse data distributions. This exhaustive optimization process demands substantial computational resources, utilizing nearly one million NVIDIA H800 GPU hours to train 3,700 LLMs of varying sizes and hyperparameters from scratch and consuming approximately 100 trillion tokens in total. To facilitate reproducibility and further research, we will progressively release all loss measurements and model checkpoints through our designated repository https://step-law.github.io/</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thanh Le-Cong, Bach Le, Toby Murray</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to automate programming tasks. Yet, LLMs' capabilities in reasoning about program semantics are still inadequately studied, leaving significant potential for further exploration. This paper introduces FormalBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' reasoning abilities on program semantics, particularly via the task of synthesizing formal program specifications to assist verifying program correctness. This task requires both comprehensive reasoning over all possible program executions and the generation of precise, syntactically correct expressions that adhere to formal syntax and semantics. Using this benchmark, we evaluated the ability of LLMs in synthesizing consistent and complete specifications. Our findings show that LLMs perform well with simple control flows but struggle with more complex structures, especially loops, even with advanced prompting. Additionally, LLMs exhibit limited robustness against semantic-preserving transformations. We also highlight common failure patterns and design self-repair prompts, improving success rates by 25%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hank Gerba</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative AI promises to finally realize dynamic, personalized storytelling technologies across a range of media. To date, experimentation with generative AI in the field of procedural narrative generation has been quite promising from a technical perspective. However, fundamental narrative dilemmas remain, such as the balance between player agency and narrative coherence, and no rigorous narrative standard has been proposed to specifically leverage the strengths of generative AI. In this paper, we propose the Universal Narrative Model (UNM), an open and extensible standard designed to place writers at the center of future narrative design workflows and enable interoperability across authoring platforms. By encoding an author's intent according to an objective narrative model, the UNM enables narrative portability as well as intent-based constraints for generative systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: The challenge of reducing the size of Large Language Models (LLMs) while maintaining their performance has gained significant attention. However, existing methods, such as model distillation and transfer learning, often fail to achieve high accuracy. To address this limitation, we introduce the Branch-Merge distillation approach, which enhances model compression through two phases: (1) the Branch Phase, where knowledge from a large teacher model is \textit{selectively distilled} into specialized student models via domain-specific supervised fine-tuning (SFT); And (2) the Merge Phase, where these student models are merged to enable cross-domain knowledge transfer and improve generalization. We validate our distillation approach using DeepSeek-R1 as the teacher and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B as the student. The resulting merged model, TinyR1-32B-Preview, outperforms its counterpart DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B across multiple benchmarks, including Mathematics (+5.5 points), Coding (+4.4 points) and Science (+2.9 points), while achieving near-equal performance to DeepSeek-R1 on AIME 2024. The Branch-Merge distillation approach provides a scalable solution for creating smaller, high-performing LLMs with reduced computational cost and time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shawn Li, Peilin Cai, Yuxiao Zhou, Zhiyu Ni, Renjie Liang, You Qin, Yi Nian, Zhengzhong Tu, Xiyang Hu, Yue Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is critical for ensuring the reliability of machine learning models in safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving and medical diagnosis. While deploying personalized OOD detection directly on edge devices is desirable, it remains challenging due to large model sizes and the computational infeasibility of on-device training. Federated learning partially addresses this but still requires gradient computation and backpropagation, exceeding the capabilities of many edge devices. To overcome these challenges, we propose SecDOOD, a secure cloud-device collaboration framework for efficient on-device OOD detection without requiring device-side backpropagation. SecDOOD utilizes cloud resources for model training while ensuring user data privacy by retaining sensitive information on-device. Central to SecDOOD is a HyperNetwork-based personalized parameter generation module, which adapts cloud-trained models to device-specific distributions by dynamically generating local weight adjustments, effectively combining central and local information without local fine-tuning. Additionally, our dynamic feature sampling and encryption strategy selectively encrypts only the most informative feature channels, largely reducing encryption overhead without compromising detection performance. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and OOD scenarios demonstrate that SecDOOD achieves performance comparable to fully fine-tuned models, enabling secure, efficient, and personalized OOD detection on resource-limited edge devices.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shawn Li, Jiashu Qu, Yuxiao Zhou, Yuehan Qin, Tiankai Yang, Yue Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have advanced multi-modal tasks like image captioning, visual question answering, and reasoning. However, they often generate hallucinated outputs inconsistent with the visual context or prompt, limiting reliability in critical applications like autonomous driving and medical imaging. Existing studies link hallucination to statistical biases, language priors, and biased feature learning but lack a structured causal understanding. In this work, we introduce a causal perspective to analyze and mitigate hallucination in VLMs. We hypothesize that hallucination arises from unintended direct influences of either the vision or text modality, bypassing proper multi-modal fusion. To address this, we construct a causal graph for VLMs and employ counterfactual analysis to estimate the Natural Direct Effect (NDE) of vision, text, and their cross-modal interaction on the output. We systematically identify and mitigate these unintended direct effects to ensure that responses are primarily driven by genuine multi-modal fusion. Our approach consists of three steps: (1) designing structural causal graphs to distinguish correct fusion pathways from spurious modality shortcuts, (2) estimating modality-specific and cross-modal NDE using perturbed image representations, hallucinated text embeddings, and degraded visual inputs, and (3) implementing a test-time intervention module to dynamically adjust the model's dependence on each modality. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly reduces hallucination while preserving task performance, providing a robust and interpretable framework for improving VLM reliability.

<p>Abstract: Audio-driven human gesture synthesis is a crucial task with broad applications in virtual avatars, human-computer interaction, and creative content generation. Despite notable progress, existing methods often produce gestures that are coarse, lack expressiveness, and fail to fully align with audio semantics. To address these challenges, we propose ExGes, a novel retrieval-enhanced diffusion framework with three key designs: (1) a Motion Base Construction, which builds a gesture library using training dataset; (2) a Motion Retrieval Module, employing constrative learning and momentum distillation for fine-grained reference poses retreiving; and (3) a Precision Control Module, integrating partial masking and stochastic masking to enable flexible and fine-grained control. Experimental evaluations on BEAT2 demonstrate that ExGes reduces Fr\'echet Gesture Distance by 6.2\% and improves motion diversity by 5.3\% over EMAGE, with user studies revealing a 71.3\% preference for its naturalness and semantic relevance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Martin Kuhn, Joscha Gr\"uger, Tobias Geyer, Ralph Bergmann</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid progress in modern medicine presents physicians with complex challenges when planning patient treatment. Techniques from the field of Predictive Business Process Monitoring, like Next-activity-prediction (NAP) can be used as a promising technique to support physicians in treatment planning, by proposing a possible next treatment step. Existing patient data, often in the form of electronic health records, can be analyzed to recommend the next suitable step in the treatment process. However, the use of patient data poses many challenges due to its knowledge-intensive character, high variability and scarcity of medical data. To overcome these challenges, this article examines the use of the knowledge encoded in taxonomies to improve and explain the prediction of the next activity in the treatment process. This study proposes the TS4NAP approach, which uses medical taxonomies (ICD-10-CM and ICD-10-PCS) in combination with graph matching to assess the similarities of medical codes to predict the next treatment step. The effectiveness of the proposed approach will be evaluated using event logs that are derived from the MIMIC-IV dataset. The results highlight the potential of using domain-specific knowledge held in taxonomies to improve the prediction of the next activity, and thus can improve treatment planning and decision-making by making the predictions more explainable.</p>

<p>Abstract: The research presents a machine learning (ML) classifier designed to differentiate between schizophrenia patients and healthy controls by utilising features extracted from electroencephalogram (EEG) data, specifically focusing on event-related potentials (ERPs) and certain demographic variables. The dataset comprises data from 81 participants, encompassing 32 healthy controls and 49 schizophrenia patients, all sourced from an online dataset. After preprocessing the dataset, our ML model achieved an accuracy of 99.930%. This performance outperforms earlier research, including those that used deep learning methods. Additionally, an analysis was conducted to assess individual features' contribution to improving classification accuracy. This involved systematically excluding specific features from the original dataset one at a time, and another technique involved an iterative process of removing features based on their entropy scores incrementally. The impact of these removals on model performance was evaluated to identify the most informative features.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Edwin Hamel-De le Court, Francesco Belardinelli, Alex W. Goodall</p>
<p>Abstract: In real-life scenarios, a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent aiming to maximise their reward, must often also behave in a safe manner, including at training time. Thus, much attention in recent years has been given to Safe RL, where an agent aims to learn an optimal policy among all policies that satisfy a given safety constraint. However, strict safety guarantees are often provided through approaches based on linear programming, and thus have limited scaling. In this paper we present a new, scalable method, which enjoys strict formal guarantees for Safe RL, in the case where the safety dynamics of the Markov Decision Process (MDP) are known, and safety is defined as an undiscounted probabilistic avoidance property. Our approach is based on state-augmentation of the MDP, and on the design of a shield that restricts the actions available to the agent. We show that our approach provides a strict formal safety guarantee that the agent stays safe at training and test time. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach is viable in practice through experimental evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kwanyoung Kim, Byeongsu Sim</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have shown impressive results in generating high-quality conditional samples using guidance techniques such as Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG). However, existing methods often require additional training or neural function evaluations (NFEs), making them incompatible with guidance-distilled models. Also, they rely on heuristic approaches that need identifying target layers. In this work, we propose a novel and efficient method, termed PLADIS, which boosts pre-trained models (U-Net/Transformer) by leveraging sparse attention. Specifically, we extrapolate query-key correlations using softmax and its sparse counterpart in the cross-attention layer during inference, without requiring extra training or NFEs. By leveraging the noise robustness of sparse attention, our PLADIS unleashes the latent potential of text-to-image diffusion models, enabling them to excel in areas where they once struggled with newfound effectiveness. It integrates seamlessly with guidance techniques, including guidance-distilled models. Extensive experiments show notable improvements in text alignment and human preference, offering a highly efficient and universally applicable solution.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kai Qiu, Xiang Li, Jason Kuen, Hao Chen, Xiaohao Xu, Jiuxiang Gu, Yinyi Luo, Bhiksha Raj, Zhe Lin, Marios Savvides</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent image generation schemes typically capture image distribution in a pre-constructed latent space relying on a frozen image tokenizer. Though the performance of tokenizer plays an essential role to the successful generation, its current evaluation metrics (e.g. rFID) fail to precisely assess the tokenizer and correlate its performance to the generation quality (e.g. gFID). In this paper, we comprehensively analyze the reason for the discrepancy of reconstruction and generation qualities in a discrete latent space, and, from which, we propose a novel plug-and-play tokenizer training scheme to facilitate latent space construction. Specifically, a latent perturbation approach is proposed to simulate sampling noises, i.e., the unexpected tokens sampled, from the generative process. With the latent perturbation, we further propose (1) a novel tokenizer evaluation metric, i.e., pFID, which successfully correlates the tokenizer performance to generation quality and (2) a plug-and-play tokenizer training scheme, which significantly enhances the robustness of tokenizer thus boosting the generation quality and convergence speed. Extensive benchmarking are conducted with 11 advanced discrete image tokenizers with 2 autoregressive generation models to validate our approach. The tokenizer trained with our proposed latent perturbation achieve a notable 1.60 gFID with classifier-free guidance (CFG) and 3.45 gFID without CFG with a $\sim$400M generator.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zheng Qin, Ruobing Zheng, Yabing Wang, Tianqi Li, Zixin Zhu, Minghui Yang, Ming Yang, Le Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Human animation from a single reference image shall be flexible to synthesize whole-body motion for either a headshot or whole-body portrait, where the motions are readily controlled by audio signal and text prompts. This is hard for most existing methods as they only support producing pre-specified head or half-body motion aligned with audio inputs. In this paper, we propose a versatile human animation method, i.e., VersaAnimator, which generates whole-body talking human from arbitrary portrait images, not only driven by audio signal but also flexibly controlled by text prompts. Specifically, we design a text-controlled, audio-driven motion generator that produces whole-body motion representations in 3D synchronized with audio inputs while following textual motion descriptions. To promote natural smooth motion, we propose a code-pose translation module to link VAE codebooks with 2D DWposes extracted from template videos. Moreover, we introduce a multi-modal video diffusion that generates photorealistic human animation from a reference image according to both audio inputs and whole-body motion representations. Extensive experiments show that VersaAnimator outperforms existing methods in visual quality, identity preservation, and audio-lip synchronization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aviad Barzilai, Yotam Gigi, Amr Helmy, Vered Silverman, Yehonathan Refael, Bolous Jaber, Tomer Shekel, George Leifman, Genady Beryozkin</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models have had a significant impact across various AI applications, enabling use cases that were previously impossible. Contrastive Visual Language Models (VLMs), in particular, have outperformed other techniques in many tasks. However, their prevalence in remote sensing (RS) is still limited, due to the scarcity of diverse remote-sensing visual-language datasets. In this work we introduce two novel image-caption datasets for training of remote sensing foundation models. The first dataset pairs aerial and satellite imagery with captions generated by Gemini using landmarks extracted from Google Maps. The second dataset utilizes public web images and their corresponding alt-text, filtered for the remote sensing domain, resulting in a diverse dataset with greater breadth in image styles and subject matter. These datasets are used to pre-train the MaMMUT~\citep{kuo2023mammutsimplearchitecturejoint} VLM architecture, resulting in state-of-the-art generalization performance in zero-shot cross-modal retrieval on well-known public benchmarks. Finally, we present our ongoing research to distill image-level knowledge gained in the VLM contrastive training procedure to enhance the model's localization ability. Specifically, we iteratively generate pseudo-labels for image regions based on the model's attention maps and use these labels for further training. To mitigate noisy attention maps and create robust segmentation masks, we introduce a novel attention-pooling mechanism called the Smooth-Attention-Operation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyeonho Jeong, Suhyeon Lee, Jong Chul Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Reangle-A-Video, a unified framework for generating synchronized multi-view videos from a single input video. Unlike mainstream approaches that train multi-view video diffusion models on large-scale 4D datasets, our method reframes the multi-view video generation task as video-to-videos translation, leveraging publicly available image and video diffusion priors. In essence, Reangle-A-Video operates in two stages. (1) Multi-View Motion Learning: An image-to-video diffusion transformer is synchronously fine-tuned in a self-supervised manner to distill view-invariant motion from a set of warped videos. (2) Multi-View Consistent Image-to-Images Translation: The first frame of the input video is warped and inpainted into various camera perspectives under an inference-time cross-view consistency guidance using DUSt3R, generating multi-view consistent starting images. Extensive experiments on static view transport and dynamic camera control show that Reangle-A-Video surpasses existing methods, establishing a new solution for multi-view video generation. We will publicly release our code and data. Project page: https://hyeonho99.github.io/reangle-a-video/</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jian Zhu, Zhengyu Jia, Tian Gao, Jiaxin Deng, Shidi Li, Fu Liu, Peng Jia, Xianpeng Lang, Xiaolong Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Advanced end-to-end autonomous driving systems predict other vehicles' motions and plan ego vehicle's trajectory. The world model that can foresee the outcome of the trajectory has been used to evaluate the end-to-end autonomous driving system. However, existing world models predominantly emphasize the trajectory of the ego vehicle and leave other vehicles uncontrollable. This limitation hinders their ability to realistically simulate the interaction between the ego vehicle and the driving scenario. In addition, it remains a challenge to match multiple trajectories with each vehicle in the video to control the video generation. To address above issues, a driving World Model named EOT-WM is proposed in this paper, unifying Ego-Other vehicle Trajectories in videos. Specifically, we first project ego and other vehicle trajectories in the BEV space into the image coordinate to match each trajectory with its corresponding vehicle in the video. Then, trajectory videos are encoded by the Spatial-Temporal Variational Auto Encoder to align with driving video latents spatially and temporally in the unified visual space. A trajectory-injected diffusion Transformer is further designed to denoise the noisy video latents for video generation with the guidance of ego-other vehicle trajectories. In addition, we propose a metric based on control latent similarity to evaluate the controllability of trajectories. Extensive experiments are conducted on the nuScenes dataset, and the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 30% in FID and 55% in FVD. The model can also predict unseen driving scenes with self-produced trajectories.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xu Jiang, Gehui Li, Bin Chen, Jian Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Image restoration (IR) is challenging due to the complexity of real-world degradations. While many specialized and all-in-one IR models have been developed, they fail to effectively handle complex, mixed degradations. Recent agentic methods RestoreAgent and AgenticIR leverage intelligent, autonomous workflows to alleviate this issue, yet they suffer from suboptimal results and inefficiency due to their resource-intensive finetunings, and ineffective searches and tool execution trials for satisfactory outputs. In this paper, we propose MAIR, a novel Multi-Agent approach for complex IR problems. We introduce a real-world degradation prior, categorizing degradations into three types: (1) scene, (2) imaging, and (3) compression, which are observed to occur sequentially in real world, and reverse them in the opposite order. Built upon this three-stage restoration framework, MAIR emulates a team of collaborative human specialists, including a "scheduler" for overall planning and multiple "experts" dedicated to specific degradations. This design minimizes search space and trial efforts, improving image quality while reducing inference costs. In addition, a registry mechanism is introduced to enable easy integration of new tools. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that proposed MAIR achieves competitive performance and improved efficiency over the previous agentic IR system. Code and models will be made available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qitan Lv, Tianyu Liu, Hong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely adopted in mathematical optimization in scientific scenarios for their extensive knowledge and advanced reasoning capabilities. Existing methods mainly focus on utilizing LLMs to solve optimization problems in a prompt-based manner, which takes observational feedback as additional textual descriptions. However, due to LLM's \textbf{high sensitivity to the prompts} and \textbf{tendency to get lost in lengthy prompts}, these methods struggle to effectively utilize the {observational} feedback from each optimization step, which severely hinders the applications for real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a conceptually simple and general {bi-level} optimization method, namely \textbf{G}eneral \textbf{S}cientific \textbf{O}ptimizers (GSO). Specifically, GSO first utilizes inner-level simulators as experimental platforms to evaluate the current solution and provide observational feedback. Then, LLMs serve as knowledgeable and versatile scientists, generating new solutions by refining potential errors from the feedback as the outer-level optimization. Finally, simulations together with the expert knowledge in LLMs are jointly updated with bi-level interactions via model editing. Extensive experiments show that GSO consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods using \textit{six} different LLM backbones on \textit{seven} different tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness and a wide range of applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abe Bohan Hou, Hongru Du, Yichen Wang, Jingyu Zhang, Zixiao Wang, Paul Pu Liang, Daniel Khashabi, Lauren Gardner, Tianxing He</p>
<p>Abstract: Can we simulate a sandbox society with generative agents to model human behavior, thereby reducing the over-reliance on real human trials for assessing public policies? In this work, we investigate the feasibility of simulating health-related decision-making, using vaccine hesitancy, defined as the delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccines despite the availability of vaccination services (MacDonald, 2015), as a case study. To this end, we introduce the VacSim framework with 100 generative agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). VacSim simulates vaccine policy outcomes with the following steps: 1) instantiate a population of agents with demographics based on census data; 2) connect the agents via a social network and model vaccine attitudes as a function of social dynamics and disease-related information; 3) design and evaluate various public health interventions aimed at mitigating vaccine hesitancy. To align with real-world results, we also introduce simulation warmup and attitude modulation to adjust agents' attitudes. We propose a series of evaluations to assess the reliability of various LLM simulations. Experiments indicate that models like Llama and Qwen can simulate aspects of human behavior but also highlight real-world alignment challenges, such as inconsistent responses with demographic profiles. This early exploration of LLM-driven simulations is not meant to serve as definitive policy guidance; instead, it serves as a call for action to examine social simulation for policy development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuanmin Huang, Mi Zhang, Zhaoxiang Wang, Wenxuan Li, Min Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series classification (TSC) is a cornerstone of modern web applications, powering tasks such as financial data analysis, network traffic monitoring, and user behavior analysis. In recent years, deep neural networks (DNNs) have greatly enhanced the performance of TSC models in these critical domains. However, DNNs are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where attackers can covertly implant triggers into models to induce malicious outcomes. Existing backdoor attacks targeting DNN-based TSC models remain elementary. In particular, early methods borrow trigger designs from computer vision, which are ineffective for time series data. More recent approaches utilize generative models for trigger generation, but at the cost of significant computational complexity. In this work, we analyze the limitations of existing attacks and introduce an enhanced method, FreqBack. Drawing inspiration from the fact that DNN models inherently capture frequency domain features in time series data, we identify that improper perturbations in the frequency domain are the root cause of ineffective attacks. To address this, we propose to generate triggers both effectively and efficiently, guided by frequency analysis. FreqBack exhibits substantial performance across five models and eight datasets, achieving an impressive attack success rate of over 90%, while maintaining less than a 3% drop in model accuracy on clean data.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09853">Who Are You Behind the Screen? Implicit MBTI and Gender Detection Using Artificial Intelligence</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Kourosh Shahnazari, Seyed Moein Ayyoubzadeh</p>
<p>Abstract: In personalized technology and psychological research, precisely detecting demographic features and personality traits from digital interactions becomes ever more important. This work investigates implicit categorization, inferring personality and gender variables directly from linguistic patterns in Telegram conversation data, while conventional personality prediction techniques mostly depend on explicitly self-reported labels. We refine a Transformer-based language model (RoBERTa) to capture complex linguistic cues indicative of personality traits and gender differences using a dataset comprising 138,866 messages from 1,602 users annotated with MBTI types and 195,016 messages from 2,598 users annotated with gender. Confidence levels help to greatly raise model accuracy to 86.16\%, hence proving RoBERTa's capacity to consistently identify implicit personality types from conversational text data. Our results highlight the usefulness of Transformer topologies for implicit personality and gender classification, hence stressing their efficiency and stressing important trade-offs between accuracy and coverage in realistic conversational environments. With regard to gender classification, the model obtained an accuracy of 74.4\%, therefore capturing gender-specific language patterns. Personality dimension analysis showed that people with introverted and intuitive preferences are especially more active in text-based interactions. This study emphasizes practical issues in balancing accuracy and data coverage as Transformer-based models show their efficiency in implicit personality and gender prediction tasks from conversational texts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiming Jia, Jiachen Li, Xiang Yue, Bo Li, Ping Nie, Kai Zou, Wenhu Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models have made significant progress on many perception-focused tasks. However, their progress on reasoning-focused tasks remains limited due to the lack of high-quality and diverse training data. In this work, we aim to address the scarcity of reasoning-focused multimodal datasets. We propose VisualWebInstruct, a novel approach that leverages search engines to create a diverse and high-quality dataset spanning multiple disciplines, including mathematics, physics, finance, and chemistry, etc. Starting with a meticulously selected set of 30,000 seed images, we employ Google Image Search to identify websites containing similar images. We collect and process HTML data from over 700K unique URLs. Through a pipeline of content extraction, filtering, and synthesis, we construct a dataset of approximately 900K question-answer (QA) pairs, with 40% consisting of visual QA pairs and the remaining comprising text-based QA pairs. Models fine-tuned on VisualWebInstruct demonstrate significant performance improvements: (1) fine-tuning on Llava-OV results in 10-20 absolute points improvement across benchmarks, and (2) fine-tuning from MAmmoTH-VL yields a 5 absolute points gain across benchmarks. Our best model, MAmmoTH-VL2, achieves state-of-the-art performance within the 10B parameter class on MMMU-Pro (40.7), MathVerse (42.6), and DynaMath (55.7). These results highlight the effectiveness of our dataset in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of vision-language models for complex multimodal tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andy Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Adapting large language models to multiple tasks can cause cross-skill interference, where improvements for one skill degrade another. While methods such as LoRA impose orthogonality constraints at the weight level, they do not fully address interference in hidden-state representations. We propose Compositional Subspace Representation Fine-tuning (CS-ReFT), a novel representation-based approach that learns multiple orthonormal subspace transformations, each specializing in a distinct skill, and composes them via a lightweight router. By isolating these subspace edits in the hidden state, rather than weight matrices, CS-ReFT prevents cross-task conflicts more effectively. On the AlpacaEval benchmark, applying CS-ReFT to Llama-2-7B achieves a 93.94% win rate, surpassing GPT-3.5 Turbo (86.30%) while requiring only 0.0098% of model parameters. These findings show that specialized representation edits, composed via a simple router, significantly enhance multi-task instruction following with minimal overhead.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingyue Cheng, Yucong Luo, Jie Ouyang, Qi Liu, Huijie Liu, Li Li, Shuo Yu, Bohou Zhang, Jiawei Cao, Jie Ma, Daoyu Wang, Enhong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has gained significant attention in recent years for its potential to enhance natural language understanding and generation by combining large-scale retrieval systems with generative models. RAG leverages external knowledge sources, such as documents, databases, or structured data, to improve model performance and generate more accurate and contextually relevant outputs. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of RAG by examining its fundamental components, including retrieval mechanisms, generation processes, and the integration between the two. We discuss the key characteristics of RAG, such as its ability to augment generative models with dynamic external knowledge, and the challenges associated with aligning retrieved information with generative objectives. We also present a taxonomy that categorizes RAG methods, ranging from basic retrieval-augmented approaches to more advanced models incorporating multi-modal data and reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we review the evaluation benchmarks and datasets commonly used to assess RAG systems, along with a detailed exploration of its applications in fields such as question answering, summarization, and information retrieval. Finally, we highlight emerging research directions and opportunities for improving RAG systems, such as enhanced retrieval efficiency, model interpretability, and domain-specific adaptations. This paper concludes by outlining the prospects for RAG in addressing real-world challenges and its potential to drive further advancements in natural language processing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gang Li, Jizhong Liu, Heinrich Dinkel, Yadong Niu, Junbo Zhang, Jian Luan</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has been shown to greatly enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), and RL-based approaches have been progressively applied to visual multimodal tasks. However, the audio modality has largely been overlooked in these developments. Thus, we conduct a series of RL explorations in audio understanding and reasoning, specifically focusing on the audio question answering (AQA) task. We leverage the group relative policy optimization (GRPO) algorithm to Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct, and our experiments demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on the MMAU Test-mini benchmark, achieving an accuracy rate of 64.5%. The main findings in this technical report are as follows: 1) The GRPO algorithm can be effectively applied to large audio language models (LALMs), even when the model has only 8.2B parameters; 2) With only 38k post-training samples, RL significantly outperforms supervised fine-tuning (SFT), indicating that RL-based approaches can be effective without large datasets; 3) The explicit reasoning process has not shown significant benefits for AQA tasks, and how to efficiently utilize deep thinking remains an open question for further research; 4) LALMs still lag far behind humans auditory-language reasoning, suggesting that the RL-based approaches warrant further exploration.
