<p><b>Authors:</b> Oline Ranum, David R. Wessels, Gomer Otterspeer, Erik J. Bekkers, Floris Roelofsen, Jari I. Andersen</p>
<p>Abstract: Sign Language Processing (SLP) provides a foundation for a more inclusive future in language technology; however, the field faces several significant challenges that must be addressed to achieve practical, real-world applications. This work addresses multi-view isolated sign recognition (MV-ISR), and highlights the essential role of 3D awareness and geometry in SLP systems. We introduce the NGT200 dataset, a novel spatio-temporal multi-view benchmark, establishing MV-ISR as distinct from single-view ISR (SV-ISR). We demonstrate the benefits of synthetic data and propose conditioning sign representations on spatial symmetries inherent in sign language. Leveraging an SE(2) equivariant model improves MV-ISR performance by 8%-22% over the baseline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Conor O'Sullivan, Ambrish Kashyap, Seamus Coveney, Xavier Monteys, Soumyabrata Dev</p>
<p>Abstract: Ireland's coastline, a critical and dynamic resource, is facing challenges such as erosion, sedimentation, and human activities. Monitoring these changes is a complex task we approach using a combination of satellite imagery and deep learning methods. However, limited research exists in this area, particularly for Ireland. This paper presents the Landsat Irish Coastal Segmentation (LICS) dataset, which aims to facilitate the development of deep learning methods for coastal water body segmentation while addressing modelling challenges specific to Irish meteorology and coastal types. The dataset is used to evaluate various automated approaches for segmentation, with U-NET achieving the highest accuracy of 95.0% among deep learning methods. Nevertheless, the Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI) benchmark outperformed U-NET with an average accuracy of 97.2%. The study suggests that deep learning approaches can be further improved with more accurate training data and by considering alternative measurements of erosion. The LICS dataset and code are freely available to support reproducible research and further advancements in coastal monitoring efforts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Prudence Djagba, J. K. Buwa Mbouobda</p>
<p>Abstract: Breast cancer is a major global health issue that affects millions of women worldwide. Classification of breast cancer as early and accurately as possible is crucial for effective treatment and enhanced patient outcomes. Deep transfer learning has emerged as a promising technique for improving breast cancer classification by utilizing pre-trained models and transferring knowledge across related tasks. In this study, we examine the use of a VGG, Vision Transformers (ViT) and Resnet to classify images for Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) cancer and make a comparative analysis of the algorithms. The result shows a great advantage of Resnet-34 with an accuracy of $90.40\%$ in classifying cancer images. However, the pretrained VGG-16 demonstrates a higher F1-score because there is less parameters to update. We believe that the field of breast cancer diagnosis stands to benefit greatly from the use of deep transfer learning. Transfer learning may assist to increase the accuracy and accessibility of breast cancer screening by allowing deep learning models to be trained with little data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aurelio F. Bariviera, Roberta Hansen, Ver\'onica E. Pastor</p>
<p>Abstract: The analysis of the spatial arrangement of colors and roughness/smoothness of figures is relevant due to its wide range of applications. This paper proposes a texture classification method that extracts data from images using the Hilbert curve. Three information theory quantifiers are then computed: permutation entropy, permutation complexity, and Fisher information measure. The proposal exhibits some important properties: (i) it allows to discriminate figures according to varying degrees of correlations (as measured by the Hurst exponent), (ii) it is invariant to rotation and symmetry transformations, (iii) it can be used either in black and white or color images. Validations have been made not only using synthetic images but also using the well-known Brodatz image database.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Grant Rosario, David Noever</p>
<p>Abstract: The utility of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery in remote sensing and satellite image analysis is well established, offering robustness under various weather and lighting conditions. However, SAR images, characterized by their unique structural and texture characteristics, often pose interpretability challenges for analysts accustomed to electrooptical (EO) imagery. This application compares state-of-the-art Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) including Pix2Pix, CycleGan, S-CycleGan, and a novel dual?generator GAN utilizing partial convolutions and a novel dual-generator architecture utilizing transformers. These models are designed to progressively refine the realism in the translated optical images, thereby enhancing the visual interpretability of SAR data. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through qualitative and quantitative evaluations, comparing the synthesized EO images with actual EO images in terms of visual fidelity and feature preservation. The results show significant improvements in interpretability, making SAR data more accessible for analysts familiar with EO imagery. Furthermore, we explore the potential of this technology in various applications, including environmental monitoring, urban planning, and military reconnaissance, where rapid, accurate interpretation of SAR data is crucial. Our research contributes to the field of remote sensing by bridging the gap between SAR and EO imagery, offering a novel tool for enhanced data interpretation and broader application of SAR technology in various domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Radim Spetlik, David Futschik, Daniel Sykora</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce StyleReiser, an example-based video stylization method that transfers style from a given keyframe to the entire video sequence while maintaining visual consistency even in distant frames where the scene structure may change significantly. Unlike previous keyframe-based methods, our approach considers consistency with the prescribed style and maintains fidelity to new structural elements appearing in the target video sequence. This combination can significantly improve the quality of the stylized sequence without the need to add more correction keyframes. We also demonstrate that our approach can notably enhance the output of text-driven video stylization methods by suppressing their structural instability and enabling the user to perform custom edits on the generated keyframes. Moreover, due to its capability to perform inference in real-time, our technique can also be applied in interactive scenarios, such as consistently stylized video calls, which are difficult to achieve using text-driven approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: Lifelike visualizations in design, cinematography, and gaming rely on precise physics simulations, typically requiring extensive computational resources and detailed physical input. This paper presents a method that can infer a system's physical properties from a short video, eliminating the need for explicit parameter input, provided it is close to the training condition. The learned representation is then used within a Graph Network-based Simulator to emulate the trajectories of physical systems. We demonstrate that the video-derived encodings effectively capture the physical properties of the system and showcase a linear dependence between some of the encodings and the system's motion.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shengbo Wang, Shuo Gao, Tongming Pu, Liangbing Zhao, Arokia Nathan</p>
<p>Abstract: Optical flow is crucial for robotic visual perception, yet current methods primarily operate in a 2D format, capturing movement velocities only in horizontal and vertical dimensions. This limitation results in incomplete motion cues, such as missing regions of interest or detailed motion analysis of different regions, leading to delays in processing high-volume visual data in real-world settings. Here, we report a 3D neuromorphic optical flow method that leverages the time-domain processing capability of memristors to embed external motion features directly into hardware, thereby completing motion cues and dramatically accelerating the computation of movement velocities and subsequent task-specific algorithms. In our demonstration, this approach reduces visual data processing time by an average of 0.3 seconds while maintaining or improving the accuracy of motion prediction, object tracking, and object segmentation. Interframe visual processing is achieved for the first time in UAV scenarios. Furthermore, the neuromorphic optical flow algorithm's flexibility allows seamless integration with existing algorithms, ensuring broad applicability. These advancements open unprecedented avenues for robotic perception, without the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Frederik Riedmann, Bernhard Egger, Tim Rohe</p>
<p>Abstract: Previous studies have shown that faces are rated as more attractive when they are partially occluded. The cause of this observation remains unclear. One explanation is a mental reconstruction of the occluded face parts which is biased towards a more attractive percept as shown in face-attractiveness rating tasks. We aimed to test for this hypothesis by using a delayed matching-to-sample task, which directly requires mental reconstruction. In two online experiments, we presented observers with unattractive, neutral or attractive synthetic reconstructions of the occluded face parts using a state-of-the-art diffusion-based image generator. Our experiments do not support the initial hypothesis and reveal an unattractiveness bias for occluded faces instead. This suggests that facial attractiveness rating tasks do not prompt reconstructions. Rather, the attractivity bias may arise from global image features, and faces may actually be reconstructed with unattractive properties when mental reconstruction is applied.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maximilian Weiherer, Bernhard Egger</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose to use the family of Mat\'ern kernels for tunable implicit surface reconstruction, building upon the recent success of kernel methods for 3D reconstruction of oriented point clouds. As we show, both, from a theoretical and practical perspective, Mat\'ern kernels have some appealing properties which make them particularly well suited for surface reconstruction -- outperforming state-of-the-art methods based on the arc-cosine kernel while being significantly easier to implement, faster to compute, and scaleable. Being stationary, we demonstrate that the Mat\'ern kernels' spectrum can be tuned in the same fashion as Fourier feature mappings help coordinate-based MLPs to overcome spectral bias. Moreover, we theoretically analyze Mat\'ern kernel's connection to SIREN networks as well as its relation to previously employed arc-cosine kernels. Finally, based on recently introduced Neural Kernel Fields, we present data-dependent Mat\'ern kernels and conclude that especially the Laplace kernel (being part of the Mat\'ern family) is extremely competitive, performing almost on par with state-of-the-art methods in the noise-free case while having a more than five times shorter training time.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15477">MediConfusion: Can you trust your AI radiologist? Probing the reliability of multimodal medical foundation models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Shahab Sepehri, Zalan Fabian, Maryam Soltanolkotabi, Mahdi Soltanolkotabi</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have tremendous potential to improve the accuracy, availability, and cost-effectiveness of healthcare by providing automated solutions or serving as aids to medical professionals. Despite promising first steps in developing medical MLLMs in the past few years, their capabilities and limitations are not well-understood. Recently, many benchmark datasets have been proposed that test the general medical knowledge of such models across a variety of medical areas. However, the systematic failure modes and vulnerabilities of such models are severely underexplored with most medical benchmarks failing to expose the shortcomings of existing models in this safety-critical domain. In this paper, we introduce MediConfusion, a challenging medical Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark dataset, that probes the failure modes of medical MLLMs from a vision perspective. We reveal that state-of-the-art models are easily confused by image pairs that are otherwise visually dissimilar and clearly distinct for medical experts. Strikingly, all available models (open-source or proprietary) achieve performance below random guessing on MediConfusion, raising serious concerns about the reliability of existing medical MLLMs for healthcare deployment. We also extract common patterns of model failure that may help the design of a new generation of more trustworthy and reliable MLLMs in healthcare.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mao Ye, Gregory P. Meyer, Zaiwei Zhang, Dennis Park, Siva Karthik Mustikovela, Yuning Chai, Eric M Wolff</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring robust performance on long-tail examples is an important problem for many real-world applications of machine learning, such as autonomous driving. This work focuses on the problem of identifying rare examples within a corpus of unlabeled data. We propose a simple and scalable data mining approach that leverages the knowledge contained within a large vision language model (VLM). Our approach utilizes a VLM to summarize the content of an image into a set of keywords, and we identify rare examples based on keyword frequency. We find that the VLM offers a distinct signal for identifying long-tail examples when compared to conventional methods based on model uncertainty. Therefore, we propose a simple and general approach for integrating signals from multiple mining algorithms. We evaluate the proposed method on two diverse tasks: 2D image classification, in which inter-class variation is the primary source of data diversity, and on 3D object detection, where intra-class variation is the main concern. Furthermore, through the detection task, we demonstrate that the knowledge extracted from 2D images is transferable to the 3D domain. Our experiments consistently show large improvements (between 10\% and 50\%) over the baseline techniques on several representative benchmarks: ImageNet-LT, Places-LT, and the Waymo Open Dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence have led to remarkable improvements in generating realistic human faces. While these advancements demonstrate significant progress in generative models, they also raise concerns about the potential misuse of these generated images. In this study, we investigate how humans perceive and distinguish between real and fake images. We designed a perceptual experiment using eye-tracking technology to analyze how individuals differentiate real faces from those generated by AI. Our analysis of StyleGAN-3 generated images reveals that participants can distinguish real from fake faces with an average accuracy of 76.80%. Additionally, we found that participants scrutinize images more closely when they suspect an image to be fake. We believe this study offers valuable insights into human perception of AI-generated media.</p>

Our method captures diverse inputs in a single, cohesive representation, enabling emergent properties for multimodal sequence generation, particularly for text and pixelated images. Inspired by state-of-the-art sequence models such as Image Transformers, PixelCNN, and Mamba-Bytes, PixelBytes aims to address the challenges of integrating different data types.

Our experiments, conducted on a specialized PixelBytes Pok{\'e}mon dataset, demonstrate that bidirectional sequence models with PxBy embedding and convolutional layers can generate coherent multimodal sequences. This work contributes to the advancement of integrated AI models capable of understanding and generating multimodal data in a unified manner.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tavis Shore, Oscar Mendez, Simon Hadfield</p>
<p>Abstract: Cross-View Geo-Localisation within urban regions is challenging in part due to the lack of geo-spatial structuring within current datasets and techniques. We propose utilising graph representations to model sequences of local observations and the connectivity of the target location. Modelling as a graph enables generating previously unseen sequences by sampling with new parameter configurations. To leverage this newly available information, we propose a GNN-based architecture, producing spatially strong embeddings and improving discriminability over isolated image embeddings. We outline SpaGBOL, introducing three novel contributions. 1) The first graph-structured dataset for Cross-View Geo-Localisation, containing multiple streetview images per node to improve generalisation. 2) Introducing GNNs to the problem, we develop the first system that exploits the correlation between node proximity and feature similarity. 3) Leveraging the unique properties of the graph representation - we demonstrate a novel retrieval filtering approach based on neighbourhood bearings. SpaGBOL achieves state-of-the-art accuracies on the unseen test graph - with relative Top-1 retrieval improvements on previous techniques of 11%, and 50% when filtering with Bearing Vector Matching on the SpaGBOL dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vanshika Vats, Marzia Binta Nizam, James Davis</p>
<p>Abstract: Vehicle object detection is possible using both LiDAR and camera data. Methods using LiDAR generally outperform those using cameras only. The highest accuracy methods utilize both of these modalities through data fusion. In our study, we propose a model-independent late fusion method, VaLID, which validates whether each predicted bounding box is acceptable or not. Our method verifies the higher-performing, yet overly optimistic LiDAR model detections using camera detections that are obtained from either specially trained, general, or open-vocabulary models. VaLID uses a simple multi-layer perceptron trained with a high recall bias to reduce the false predictions made by the LiDAR detector, while still preserving the true ones. Evaluating with multiple combinations of LiDAR and camera detectors on the KITTI dataset, we reduce false positives by an average of 63.9%, thus outperforming the individual detectors on 2D average precision (2DAP). Our approach is model-agnostic and demonstrates state-of-the-art competitive performance even when using generic camera detectors that were not trained specifically for this dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sebastian Janampa, Marios Pattichis</p>
<p>Abstract: Camera calibration consists of estimating camera parameters such as the zenith vanishing point and horizon line. Estimating the camera parameters allows other tasks like 3D rendering, artificial reality effects, and object insertion in an image. Transformer-based models have provided promising results; however, they lack cross-scale interaction. In this work, we introduce \textit{multi-Scale defOrmable transFormer for camera calibratIon with enhanced line queries}, SOFI. SOFI improves the line queries used in CTRL-C and MSCC by using both line content and line geometric features. Moreover, SOFI's line queries allow transformer models to adopt the multi-scale deformable attention mechanism to promote cross-scale interaction between the feature maps produced by the backbone. SOFI outperforms existing methods on the \textit {Google Street View}, \textit {Horizon Line in the Wild}, and \textit {Holicity} datasets while keeping a competitive inference speed.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alireza Ganjdanesh, Yan Kang, Yuchen Liu, Richard Zhang, Zhe Lin, Heng Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models can generate high-quality samples. Yet, their sampling process requires numerous denoising steps, making it slow and computationally intensive. We propose to reduce the sampling cost by pruning a pretrained diffusion model into a mixture of efficient experts. First, we study the similarities between pairs of denoising timesteps, observing a natural clustering, even across different datasets. This suggests that rather than having a single model for all time steps, separate models can serve as ``experts'' for their respective time intervals. As such, we separately fine-tune the pretrained model on each interval, with elastic dimensions in depth and width, to obtain experts specialized in their corresponding denoising interval. To optimize the resource usage between experts, we introduce our Expert Routing Agent, which learns to select a set of proper network configurations. By doing so, our method can allocate the computing budget between the experts in an end-to-end manner without requiring manual heuristics. Finally, with a selected configuration, we fine-tune our pruned experts to obtain our mixture of efficient experts. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, DiffPruning, across several datasets, LSUN-Church, LSUN-Beds, FFHQ, and ImageNet, on the Latent Diffusion Model architecture.</p>

<p>Abstract: QUB-PHEO introduces a visual-based, dyadic dataset with the potential of advancing human-robot interaction (HRI) research in assembly operations and intention inference. This dataset captures rich multimodal interactions between two participants, one acting as a 'robot surrogate,' across a variety of assembly tasks that are further broken down into 36 distinct subtasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Brendan Hogan Rappazzo, Aaron Ferber, Carla Gomes</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern neural network classifiers achieve remarkable performance across a variety of tasks; however, they frequently exhibit overconfidence in their predictions due to the cross-entropy loss. Inspired by this problem, we propose the \textbf{Cr}i\textbf{t}ic Loss for Image \textbf{Cl}assification (CrtCl, pronounced Critical). CrtCl formulates image classification training in a generator-critic framework, with a base classifier acting as a generator, and a correctness critic imposing a loss on the classifier. The base classifier, acting as the generator, given images, generates the probability distribution over classes and intermediate embeddings. The critic model, given the image, intermediate embeddings, and output predictions of the base model, predicts the probability that the base model has produced the correct classification, which then can be back propagated as a self supervision signal. Notably, the critic does not use the label as input, meaning that the critic can train the base model on both labeled and unlabeled data in semi-supervised learning settings. CrtCl represents a learned loss method for accuracy, alleviating the negative side effects of using cross-entropy loss. Additionally, CrtCl provides a powerful way to select data to be labeled in an active learning setting, by estimating the classification ability of the base model on unlabeled data. We study the effectiveness of CrtCl in low-labeled data regimes, and in the context of active learning. In classification, we find that CrtCl, compared to recent baselines, increases classifier generalization and calibration with various amounts of labeled data. In active learning, we show our method outperforms baselines in accuracy and calibration. We observe consistent results across three image classification datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jing Wei Tan, SeungKyu Kim, Eunsu Kim, Sung Hak Lee, Sangjeong Ahn, Won-Ki Jeong</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision language models (VLM) have achieved success in both natural language comprehension and image recognition tasks. However, their use in pathology report generation for whole slide images (WSIs) is still limited due to the huge size of multi-scale WSIs and the high cost of WSI annotation. Moreover, in most of the existing research on pathology report generation, sufficient validation regarding clinical efficacy has not been conducted. Herein, we propose a novel Patient-level Multi-organ Pathology Report Generation (PMPRG) model, which utilizes the multi-scale WSI features from our proposed multi-scale regional vision transformer (MR-ViT) model and their real pathology reports to guide VLM training for accurate pathology report generation. The model then automatically generates a report based on the provided key features attended regional features. We assessed our model using a WSI dataset consisting of multiple organs, including the colon and kidney. Our model achieved a METEOR score of 0.68, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. This model allows pathologists to efficiently generate pathology reports for patients, regardless of the number of WSIs involved.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junyuan Ding, Ziteng Wang, Chang Gao, Min Liu, Qinyu Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Eye tracking is a key technology for gaze-based interactions in Extended Reality (XR), but traditional frame-based systems struggle to meet XR's demands for high accuracy, low latency, and power efficiency. Event cameras offer a promising alternative due to their high temporal resolution and low power consumption. In this paper, we present FACET (Fast and Accurate Event-based Eye Tracking), an end-to-end neural network that directly outputs pupil ellipse parameters from event data, optimized for real-time XR applications. The ellipse output can be directly used in subsequent ellipse-based pupil trackers. We enhance the EV-Eye dataset by expanding annotated data and converting original mask labels to ellipse-based annotations to train the model. Besides, a novel trigonometric loss is adopted to address angle discontinuities and a fast causal event volume event representation method is put forward. On the enhanced EV-Eye test set, FACET achieves an average pupil center error of 0.20 pixels and an inference time of 0.53 ms, reducing pixel error and inference time by 1.6$\times$ and 1.8$\times$ compared to the prior art, EV-Eye, with 4.4$\times$ and 11.7$\times$ less parameters and arithmetic operations.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francisco Roza de Moraes, Irineu da Silva</p>
<p>Abstract: Creating 3D models through the Structure from Motion technique is a recognized, efficient, cost-effective structural monitoring strategy. This technique is applied in several engineering fields, particularly for creating models of large structures from photographs taken a few tens of meters away. However, discussions about its usability and the procedures for conducting laboratory analysis, such as structural tests, are rarely addressed. This study investigates the potential of the SfM method to create submillimeter-quality models for structural tests, with short-distance captures. A series of experiments was carried out, with photographic captures at a 1-meter distance, using different quality settings: camera calibration model, Scale Bars dispersion, overlapping rates, and the use of vertical and oblique images. Employing a calibration model with images taken over a test board and a set of Scale Bars (SB) appropriately distributed over the test area, an overlap rate of 80 percent, and the integration of vertical and oblique images, RMSE values of approximately 0.1 mm were obtained. This result indicates the potential application of the technique for 3D modeling with submillimeter positional quality, as required for structural tests in laboratory environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyungtae Lim, Daebeom Kim, Gunhee Shin, Jingnan Shi, Ignacio Vizzo, Hyun Myung, Jaesik Park, and Luca Carlone</p>
<p>Abstract: While global point cloud registration systems have advanced significantly in all aspects, many studies have focused on specific components, such as feature extraction, graph-theoretic pruning, or pose solvers. In this paper, we take a holistic view on the registration problem and develop an open-source and versatile C++ library for point cloud registration, called \textit{KISS-Matcher}. KISS-Matcher combines a novel feature detector, \textit{Faster-PFH}, that improves over the classical fast point feature histogram (FPFH). Moreover, it adopts a $k$-core-based graph-theoretic pruning to reduce the time complexity of rejecting outlier correspondences. Finally, it combines these modules in a complete, user-friendly, and ready-to-use pipeline. As verified by extensive experiments, KISS-Matcher has superior scalability and broad applicability, achieving a substantial speed-up compared to state-of-the-art outlier-robust registration pipelines while preserving accuracy.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Divya Kothandaraman, Kuldeep Kulkarni, Sumit Shekhar, Balaji Vasan Srinivasan, Dinesh Manocha</p>
<p>Abstract: We present ImPoster, a novel algorithm for generating a target image of a 'source' subject performing a 'driving' action. The inputs to our algorithm are a single pair of a source image with the subject that we wish to edit and a driving image with a subject of an arbitrary class performing the driving action, along with the text descriptions of the two images. Our approach is completely unsupervised and does not require any access to additional annotations like keypoints or pose. Our approach builds on a pretrained text-to-image latent diffusion model and learns the characteristics of the source and the driving image by finetuning the diffusion model for a small number of iterations. At inference time, ImPoster performs step-wise text prompting i.e. it denoises by first moving in the direction of the image manifold corresponding to the driving image followed by the direction of the image manifold corresponding to the text description of the desired target image. We propose a novel diffusion guidance formulation, image frequency guidance, to steer the generation towards the manifold of the source subject and the driving action at every step of the inference denoising. Our frequency guidance formulations are derived from the frequency domain properties of images. We extensively evaluate ImPoster on a diverse set of source-driving image pairs to demonstrate improvements over baselines. To the best of our knowledge, ImPoster is the first approach towards achieving both subject-driven as well as action-driven image personalization.

<p>Abstract: UAVs emerge as the optimal carriers for visual weed iden?tification and integrated pest and disease management in crops. How?ever, the absence of specialized datasets impedes the advancement of model development in this domain. To address this, we have developed the Pests and Diseases Tree dataset (PDT dataset). PDT dataset repre?sents the first high-precision UAV-based dataset for targeted detection of tree pests and diseases, which is collected in real-world operational environments and aims to fill the gap in available datasets for this field. Moreover, by aggregating public datasets and network data, we further introduced the Common Weed and Crop dataset (CWC dataset) to ad?dress the challenge of inadequate classification capabilities of test models within datasets for this field. Finally, we propose the YOLO-Dense Pest (YOLO-DP) model for high-precision object detection of weed, pest, and disease crop images. We re-evaluate the state-of-the-art detection models with our proposed PDT dataset and CWC dataset, showing the completeness of the dataset and the effectiveness of the YOLO-DP.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jae Yong Lee, Yuqun Wu, Chuhang Zou, Derek Hoiem, Shenlong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The goal of this paper is to encode a 3D scene into an extremely compact representation from 2D images and to enable its transmittance, decoding and rendering in real-time across various platforms. Despite the progress in NeRFs and Gaussian Splats, their large model size and specialized renderers make it challenging to distribute free-viewpoint 3D content as easily as images. To address this, we have designed a novel 3D representation that encodes the plenoptic function into sinusoidal function indexed dense volumes. This approach facilitates feature sharing across different locations, improving compactness over traditional spatial voxels. The memory footprint of the dense 3D feature grid can be further reduced using spatial decomposition techniques. This design combines the strengths of spatial hashing functions and voxel decomposition, resulting in a model size as small as 150 KB for each 3D scene. Moreover, PPNG features a lightweight rendering pipeline with only 300 lines of code that decodes its representation into standard GL textures and fragment shaders. This enables real-time rendering using the traditional GL pipeline, ensuring universal compatibility and efficiency across various platforms without additional dependencies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shihe Shen, Huachen Gao, Wangze Xu, Rui Peng, Luyang Tang, Kaiqiang Xiong, Jianbo Jiao, Ronggang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The utilization of the triplane-based radiance fields has gained attention in recent years due to its ability to effectively disentangle 3D scenes with a high-quality representation and low computation cost. A key requirement of this method is the precise input of camera poses. However, due to the local update property of the triplane, a similar joint estimation as previous joint pose-NeRF optimization works easily results in local minima. To this end, we propose the Disentangled Triplane Generation module to introduce global feature context and smoothness into triplane learning, which mitigates errors caused by local updating. Then, we propose the Disentangled Plane Aggregation to mitigate the entanglement caused by the common triplane feature aggregation during camera pose updating. In addition, we introduce a two-stage warm-start training strategy to reduce the implicit constraints caused by the triplane generator. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis with noisy or unknown camera poses, as well as efficient convergence of optimization.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15727">LaPose: Laplacian Mixture Shape Modeling for RGB-Based Category-Level Object Pose Estimation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruida Zhang, Ziqin Huang, Gu Wang, Chenyangguang Zhang, Yan Di, Xingxing Zuo, Jiwen Tang, Xiangyang Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: While RGBD-based methods for category-level object pose estimation hold promise, their reliance on depth data limits their applicability in diverse scenarios. In response, recent efforts have turned to RGB-based methods; however, they face significant challenges stemming from the absence of depth information. On one hand, the lack of depth exacerbates the difficulty in handling intra-class shape variation, resulting in increased uncertainty in shape predictions. On the other hand, RGB-only inputs introduce inherent scale ambiguity, rendering the estimation of object size and translation an ill-posed problem. To tackle these challenges, we propose LaPose, a novel framework that models the object shape as the Laplacian mixture model for Pose estimation. By representing each point as a probabilistic distribution, we explicitly quantify the shape uncertainty. LaPose leverages both a generalized 3D information stream and a specialized feature stream to independently predict the Laplacian distribution for each point, capturing different aspects of object geometry. These two distributions are then integrated as a Laplacian mixture model to establish the 2D-3D correspondences, which are utilized to solve the pose via the PnP module. In order to mitigate scale ambiguity, we introduce a scale-agnostic representation for object size and translation, enhancing training efficiency and overall robustness. Extensive experiments on the NOCS datasets validate the effectiveness of LaPose, yielding state-of-the-art performance in RGB-based category-level object pose estimation.

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in adverse weather restoration have shown potential, yet the unpredictable and varied combinations of weather degradations in the real world pose significant challenges. Previous methods typically struggle with dynamically handling intricate degradation combinations and carrying on background reconstruction precisely, leading to performance and generalization limitations. Drawing inspiration from prompt learning and the "Teaching Tailored to Talent" concept, we introduce a novel pipeline, T3-DiffWeather. Specifically, we employ a prompt pool that allows the network to autonomously combine sub-prompts to construct weather-prompts, harnessing the necessary attributes to adaptively tackle unforeseen weather input. Moreover, from a scene modeling perspective, we incorporate general prompts constrained by Depth-Anything feature to provide the scene-specific condition for the diffusion process. Furthermore, by incorporating contrastive prompt loss, we ensures distinctive representations for both types of prompts by a mutual pushing strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across various synthetic and real-world datasets, markedly outperforming existing diffusion techniques in terms of computational efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Likun Zhang, Hao Wu, Lingcui Zhang, Fengyuan Xu, Jin Cao, Fenghua Li, Ben Niu</p>
<p>Abstract: The emergence of text-to-image models has recently sparked significant interest, but the attendant is a looming shadow of potential infringement by violating the user terms. Specifically, an adversary may exploit data created by a commercial model to train their own without proper authorization. To address such risk, it is crucial to investigate the attribution of a suspicious model's training data by determining whether its training data originates, wholly or partially, from a specific source model. To trace the generated data, existing methods require applying extra watermarks during either the training or inference phases of the source model. However, these methods are impractical for pre-trained models that have been released, especially when model owners lack security expertise. To tackle this challenge, we propose an injection-free training data attribution method for text-to-image models. It can identify whether a suspicious model's training data stems from a source model, without additional modifications on the source model. The crux of our method lies in the inherent memorization characteristic of text-to-image models. Our core insight is that the memorization of the training dataset is passed down through the data generated by the source model to the model trained on that data, making the source model and the infringing model exhibit consistent behaviors on specific samples. Therefore, our approach involves developing algorithms to uncover these distinct samples and using them as inherent watermarks to verify if a suspicious model originates from the source model. Our experiments demonstrate that our method achieves an accuracy of over 80\% in identifying the source of a suspicious model's training data, without interfering the original training or generation process of the source model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soojin Jang, Jungmin Yun, Junehyoung Kwon, Eunju Lee, Youngbin Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) approaches typically rely on class activation maps (CAMs) for initial seed generation, which often fail to capture global context due to limited supervision from image-level labels. To address this issue, we introduce DALNet, Dense Alignment Learning Network that leverages text embeddings to enhance the comprehensive understanding and precise localization of objects across different levels of granularity. Our key insight is to employ a dual-level alignment strategy: (1) Global Implicit Alignment (GIA) to capture global semantics by maximizing the similarity between the class token and the corresponding text embeddings while minimizing the similarity with background embeddings, and (2) Local Explicit Alignment (LEA) to improve object localization by utilizing spatial information from patch tokens. Moreover, we propose a cross-contrastive learning approach that aligns foreground features between image and text modalities while separating them from the background, encouraging activation in missing regions and suppressing distractions. Through extensive experiments on the PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets, we demonstrate that DALNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art WSSS methods. Our approach, in particular, allows for more efficient end-to-end process as a single-stage method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Naiwen Hu, Haozhe Cheng, Yifan Xie, Shiqi Li, Jihua Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Invariance-based and generative methods have shown a conspicuous performance for 3D self-supervised representation learning (SSRL). However, the former relies on hand-crafted data augmentations that introduce bias not universally applicable to all downstream tasks, and the latter indiscriminately reconstructs masked regions, resulting in irrelevant details being saved in the representation space. To solve the problem above, we introduce 3D-JEPA, a novel non-generative 3D SSRL framework. Specifically, we propose a multi-block sampling strategy that produces a sufficiently informative context block and several representative target blocks. We present the context-aware decoder to enhance the reconstruction of the target blocks. Concretely, the context information is fed to the decoder continuously, facilitating the encoder in learning semantic modeling rather than memorizing the context information related to target blocks. Overall, 3D-JEPA predicts the representation of target blocks from a context block using the encoder and context-aware decoder architecture. Various downstream tasks on different datasets demonstrate 3D-JEPA's effectiveness and efficiency, achieving higher accuracy with fewer pretraining epochs, e.g., 88.65% accuracy on PB_T50_RS with 150 pretraining epochs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Naiwen Hu, Haozhe Cheng, Yifan Xie, Pengcheng Shi, Jihua Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D contrastive representation learning has exhibited remarkable efficacy across various downstream tasks. However, existing contrastive learning paradigms based on cosine similarity fail to deeply explore the potential intra-modal hierarchical and cross-modal semantic correlations about multi-modal data in Euclidean space. In response, we seek solutions in hyperbolic space and propose a hyperbolic image-and-pointcloud contrastive learning method (HyperIPC). For the intra-modal branch, we rely on the intrinsic geometric structure to explore the hyperbolic embedding representation of point cloud to capture invariant features. For the cross-modal branch, we leverage images to guide the point cloud in establishing strong semantic hierarchical correlations. Empirical experiments underscore the outstanding classification performance of HyperIPC. Notably, HyperIPC enhances object classification results by 2.8% and few-shot classification outcomes by 5.9% on ScanObjectNN compared to the baseline. Furthermore, ablation studies and confirmatory testing validate the rationality of HyperIPC's parameter settings and the effectiveness of its submodules.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Roberto Alcover-Couso, Juan C. SanMiguel, Marcos Escudero-Vi\~nolo, Jose M Mart\'inez</p>
<p>Abstract: Merging parameters of multiple models has resurfaced as an effective strategy to enhance task performance and robustness, but prior work is limited by the high costs of ensemble creation and inference. In this paper, we leverage the abundance of freely accessible trained models to introduce a cost-free approach to model merging. It focuses on a layer-wise integration of merged models, aiming to maintain the distinctiveness of the task-specific final layers while unifying the initial layers, which are primarily associated with feature extraction. This approach ensures parameter consistency across all layers, essential for boosting performance. Moreover, it facilitates seamless integration of knowledge, enabling effective merging of models from different datasets and tasks. Specifically, we investigate its applicability in Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA), an unexplored area for model merging, for Semantic and Panoptic Segmentation. Experimental results demonstrate substantial UDA improvements without additional costs for merging same-architecture models from distinct datasets ($\uparrow 2.6\%$ mIoU) and different-architecture models with a shared backbone ($\uparrow 6.8\%$ mIoU). Furthermore, merging Semantic and Panoptic Segmentation models increases mPQ by $\uparrow 7\%$. These findings are validated across a wide variety of UDA strategies, architectures, and datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sutharsan Mahendren, Saimunur Rahman, Piotr Koniusz, Tharindu Fernando, Sridha Sridharan, Clinton Fookes, Peyman Moghadam</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose PseudoNeg-MAE, a novel self-supervised learning framework that enhances global feature representation of point cloud mask autoencoder by making them both discriminative and sensitive to transformations. Traditional contrastive learning methods focus on achieving invariance, which can lead to the loss of valuable transformation-related information. In contrast, PseudoNeg-MAE explicitly models the relationship between original and transformed data points using a parametric network COPE, which learns the localized displacements caused by transformations within the latent space. However, jointly training COPE with the MAE leads to undesirable trivial solutions where COPE outputs collapse to an identity. To address this, we introduce a novel loss function incorporating pseudo-negatives, which effectively penalizes these trivial invariant solutions and promotes transformation sensitivity in the embeddings. We validate PseudoNeg-MAE on shape classification and relative pose estimation tasks, where PseudoNeg-MAE achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN datasets under challenging evaluation protocols and demonstrates superior accuracy in estimating relative poses. These results show the effectiveness of PseudoNeg-MAE in learning discriminative and transformation-sensitive representations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Localization of the craniofacial landmarks from lateral cephalograms is a fundamental task in cephalometric analysis. The automation of the corresponding tasks has thus been the subject of intense research over the past decades. In this paper, we introduce the "Cephalometric Landmark Detection (CL-Detection)" dataset, which is the largest publicly available and comprehensive dataset for cephalometric landmark detection. This multi-center and multi-vendor dataset includes 600 lateral X-ray images with 38 landmarks acquired with different equipment from three medical centers. The overarching objective of this paper is to measure how far state-of-the-art deep learning methods can go for cephalometric landmark detection. Following the 2023 MICCAI CL-Detection Challenge, we report the results of the top ten research groups using deep learning methods. Results show that the best methods closely approximate the expert analysis, achieving a mean detection rate of 75.719% and a mean radial error of 1.518 mm. While there is room for improvement, these findings undeniably open the door to highly accurate and fully automatic location of craniofacial landmarks. We also identify scenarios for which deep learning methods are still failing. Both the dataset and detailed results are publicly available online, while the platform will remain open for the community to benchmark future algorithm developments at https://cl-detection2023.grand-challenge.org/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Erxin Guo, Pei An, You Yang, Qiong Liu, An-An Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: 4D occupancy forecasting is one of the important techniques for autonomous driving, which can avoid potential risk in the complex traffic scenes. Scene flow is a crucial element to describe 4D occupancy map tendency. However, an accurate scene flow is difficult to predict in the real scene. In this paper, we find that BEV scene flow can approximately represent 3D scene flow in most traffic scenes. And coarse BEV scene flow is easy to generate. Under this thought, we propose 4D occupancy forecasting method FSF-Net based on coarse BEV scene flow. At first, we develop a general occupancy forecasting architecture based on coarse BEV scene flow. Then, to further enhance 4D occupancy feature representation ability, we propose a vector quantized based Mamba (VQ-Mamba) network to mine spatial-temporal structural scene feature. After that, to effectively fuse coarse occupancy maps forecasted from BEV scene flow and latent features, we design a U-Net based quality fusion (UQF) network to generate the fine-grained forecasting result. Extensive experiments are conducted on public Occ3D dataset. FSF-Net has achieved IoU and mIoU 9.56% and 10.87% higher than state-of-the-art method. Hence, we believe that proposed FSF-Net benefits to the safety of autonomous driving.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15846">Potential Field as Scene Affordance for Behavior Change-Based Visual Risk Object Identification</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Pang-Yuan Pao, Shu-Wei Lu, Ze-Yan Lu, Yi-Ting Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: We study behavior change-based visual risk object identification (Visual-ROI), a critical framework designed to detect potential hazards for intelligent driving systems. Existing methods often show significant limitations in spatial accuracy and temporal consistency, stemming from an incomplete understanding of scene affordance. For example, these methods frequently misidentify vehicles that do not impact the ego vehicle as risk objects. Furthermore, existing behavior change-based methods are inefficient because they implement causal inference in the perspective image space. We propose a new framework with a Bird's Eye View (BEV) representation to overcome the above challenges. Specifically, we utilize potential fields as scene affordance, involving repulsive forces derived from road infrastructure and traffic participants, along with attractive forces sourced from target destinations. In this work, we compute potential fields by assigning different energy levels according to the semantic labels obtained from BEV semantic segmentation. We conduct thorough experiments and ablation studies, comparing the proposed method with various state-of-the-art algorithms on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Our results show a notable increase in spatial and temporal consistency, with enhancements of 20.3% and 11.6% on the RiskBench dataset, respectively. Additionally, we can improve computational efficiency by 88%. We achieve improvements of 5.4% in spatial accuracy and 7.2% in temporal consistency on the nuScenes dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Davide Cozzolino, Giovanni Poggi, Matthias Nie{\ss}ner, Luisa Verdoliva</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting AI-generated images has become an extraordinarily difficult challenge as new generative architectures emerge on a daily basis with more and more capabilities and unprecedented realism. New versions of many commercial tools, such as DALLE, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion, have been released recently, and it is impractical to continually update and retrain supervised forensic detectors to handle such a large variety of models. To address this challenge, we propose a zero-shot entropy-based detector (ZED) that neither needs AI-generated training data nor relies on knowledge of generative architectures to artificially synthesize their artifacts. Inspired by recent works on machine-generated text detection, our idea is to measure how surprising the image under analysis is compared to a model of real images. To this end, we rely on a lossless image encoder that estimates the probability distribution of each pixel given its context. To ensure computational efficiency, the encoder has a multi-resolution architecture and contexts comprise mostly pixels of the lower-resolution version of the image.Since only real images are needed to learn the model, the detector is independent of generator architectures and synthetic training data. Using a single discriminative feature, the proposed detector achieves state-of-the-art performance. On a wide variety of generative models it achieves an average improvement of more than 3% over the SoTA in terms of accuracy. Code is available at https://grip-unina.github.io/ZED/.</p>

<p>Abstract: Human speech conveys prosody, linguistic content, and speaker identity. This article investigates a novel speaker anonymization approach using an end-to-end network based on a Vector-Quantized Variational Auto-Encoder (VQ-VAE) to deal with these speech components. This approach is designed to disentangle these components to specifically target and modify the speaker identity while preserving the linguistic and emotionalcontent. To do so, three separate branches compute embeddings for content, prosody, and speaker identity respectively. During synthesis, taking these embeddings, the decoder of the proposed architecture is conditioned on both speaker and prosody information, allowing for capturing more nuanced emotional states and precise adjustments to speaker identification. Findings indicate that this method outperforms most baseline techniques in preserving emotional information. However, it exhibits more limited performance on other voice privacy tasks, emphasizing the need for further improvements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joohyeok Kim, Joonhyeon Song, Seohwan Yun, Seongho Yoon, Sangmin Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: The Foundation model for image segmentation, Segment Anything (SAM), has been actively researched in various fields since its proposal. Various researches have been proposed to adapt SAM to specific domains, with one notable approach involving the addition and training of lightweight adapter modules. While adapter-based fine-tuning approaches have reported parameter efficiency and significant performance improvements, they face a often overlooked issue: the excessive consumption of GPU memory relative to the number of trainable parameters. Addressing this issue, this paper proposes a memory-efficient parallel convolutional adapter architecture. This architecture connects in parallel with SAM's image encoder, eliminating the need to store activations and gradients of the image encoder during model training. Our proposed architecture demonstrated competitive experimental results while using less than half the GPU memory compared to SAM Adapter, indicating its value as an alternative to simple decoder fine-tuning when hardware limitations preclude adapter-based learning. Our code implementation is available at our github.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mei Wang, Weihong Deng, Jiani Hu, Sen Su</p>
<p>Abstract: The study of oracle characters plays an important role in Chinese archaeology and philology. However, the difficulty of collecting and annotating real-world scanned oracle characters hinders the development of oracle character recognition. In this paper, we develop a novel unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) method, i.e., unsupervised attention regularization net?work (UARN), to transfer recognition knowledge from labeled handprinted oracle characters to unlabeled scanned data. First, we experimentally prove that existing UDA methods are not always consistent with human priors and cannot achieve optimal performance on the target domain. For these oracle characters with flip-insensitivity and high inter-class similarity, model interpretations are not flip-consistent and class-separable. To tackle this challenge, we take into consideration visual perceptual plausibility when adapting. Specifically, our method enforces attention consistency between the original and flipped images to achieve the model robustness to flipping. Simultaneously, we constrain attention separability between the pseudo class and the most confusing class to improve the model discriminability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UARN shows better interpretability and achieves state-of-the-art performance on Oracle-241 dataset, substantially outperforming the previously structure-texture separation network by 8.5%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chuqiao Li, Julian Chibane, Yannan He, Naama Pearl, Andreas Geiger, Gerard Pons-moll</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Unimotion, the first unified multi-task human motion model capable of both flexible motion control and frame-level motion understanding. While existing works control avatar motion with global text conditioning, or with fine-grained per frame scripts, none can do both at once. In addition, none of the existing works can output frame-level text paired with the generated poses. In contrast, Unimotion allows to control motion with global text, or local frame-level text, or both at once, providing more flexible control for users. Importantly, Unimotion is the first model which by design outputs local text paired with the generated poses, allowing users to know what motion happens and when, which is necessary for a wide range of applications. We show Unimotion opens up new applications: 1.) Hierarchical control, allowing users to specify motion at different levels of detail, 2.) Obtaining motion text descriptions for existing MoCap data or YouTube videos 3.) Allowing for editability, generating motion from text, and editing the motion via text edits. Moreover, Unimotion attains state-of-the-art results for the frame-level text-to-motion task on the established HumanML3D dataset. The pre-trained model and code are available available on our project page at https://coral79.github.io/Unimotion/.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to learn compact channel correlation representation for LiDAR place recognition, called C3R, aimed at reducing the computational burden and dimensionality associated with traditional covariance pooling methods for place recognition tasks. Our method partitions the feature matrix into smaller groups, computes group-wise covariance matrices, and aggregates them via a learnable aggregation strategy. Matrix power normalization is applied to ensure stability. Theoretical analyses are also given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, including its ability to preserve permutation invariance and maintain high mutual information between the original features and the aggregated representation. We conduct extensive experiments on four large-scale, public LiDAR place recognition datasets including Oxford RobotCar, In-house, MulRan, and WildPlaces datasets to validate our approach's superiority in accuracy, and robustness. Furthermore, we provide the quantitative results of our approach for a deeper understanding. The code will be released upon acceptance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tim B\"uchner, Niklas Penzel, Orlando Guntinas-Lichius, Joachim Denzler</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding expressions is vital for deciphering human behavior, and nowadays, end-to-end trained black box models achieve high performance. Due to the black-box nature of these models, it is unclear how they behave when applied out-of-distribution. Specifically, these models show decreased performance for unilateral facial palsy patients. We hypothesize that one crucial factor guiding the internal decision rules is facial symmetry. In this work, we use insights from causal reasoning to investigate the hypothesis. After deriving a structural causal model, we develop a synthetic interventional framework. This approach allows us to analyze how facial symmetry impacts a network's output behavior while keeping other factors fixed. All 17 investigated expression classifiers significantly lower their output activations for reduced symmetry. This result is congruent with observed behavior on real-world data from healthy subjects and facial palsy patients. As such, our investigation serves as a case study for identifying causal factors that influence the behavior of black-box models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marek Wodzinski, Henning M\"uller</p>
<p>Abstract: The automatic registration of noninvasive second-harmonic generation microscopy to hematoxylin and eosin slides is a highly desired, yet still unsolved problem. The task is challenging because the second-harmonic images contain only partial information, in contrast to the stained H&E slides that provide more information about the tissue morphology. Moreover, both imaging methods have different intensity distributions. Therefore, the task can be formulated as a multi-modal registration problem with missing data. In this work, we propose a method based on automatic keypoint matching followed by deformable registration based on instance optimization. The method does not require any training and is evaluated using the dataset provided in the Learn2Reg challenge by the COMULIS organization. The method achieved relatively good generalizability resulting in 88% of success rate in the initial alignment and average target registration error equal to 2.48 on the external validation set. We openly release the source code and incorporate it in the DeeperHistReg image registration framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengya Liu, Ajad Chhatkuli, Janis Postels, Luc Van Gool, Federico Tombari</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D shape completion is traditionally solved using supervised training or by distribution learning on complete shape examples. Recently self-supervised learning approaches that do not require any complete 3D shape examples have gained more interests. In this paper, we propose a non-adversarial self-supervised approach for the shape completion task. Our first finding is that completion problems can be formulated as an involutory function trivially, which implies a special constraint on the completion function G, such that G(G(X)) = X. Our second constraint on self-supervised shape completion relies on the fact that shape completion becomes easier to solve with correspondences and similarly, completion can simplify the correspondences problem. We formulate a consistency measure in the canonical space in order to supervise the completion function. We efficiently optimize the completion and correspondence modules using "freeze and alternate" strategy. The overall approach performs well for rigid shapes in a category as well as dynamic non-rigid shapes. We ablate our design choices and compare our solution against state-of-the-art methods, showing remarkable accuracy approaching supervised accuracy in some cases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Roy Y. He, Sung Ha Kang, Jean-Michel Morel</p>
<p>Abstract: Image vectorization converts raster images into vector graphics composed of regions separated by curves. Typical vectorization methods first define the regions by grouping similar colored regions via color quantization, then approximate their boundaries by Bezier curves. In that way, the raster input is converted into an SVG format parameterizing the regions' colors and the Bezier control points. This compact representation has many graphical applications thanks to its universality and resolution-independence. In this paper, we remark that image vectorization is nothing but an image segmentation, and that it can be built by fine to coarse region merging. Our analysis of the problem leads us to propose a vectorization method alternating region merging and curve smoothing. We formalize the method by alternate operations on the dual and primal graph induced from any domain partition. In that way, we address a limitation of current vectorization methods, which separate the update of regional information from curve approximation. We formalize region merging methods by associating them with various gain functionals, including the classic Beaulieu-Goldberg and Mumford-Shah functionals. More generally, we introduce and compare region merging criteria involving region number, scale, area, and internal standard deviation. We also show that the curve smoothing, implicit in all vectorization methods, can be performed by the shape-preserving affine scale space. We extend this flow to a network of curves and give a sufficient condition for the topological preservation of the segmentation. The general vectorization method that follows from this analysis shows explainable behaviors, explicitly controlled by a few intuitive parameters. It is experimentally compared to state-of-the-art software and proved to have comparable or superior fidelity and cost efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luca Ciampi, Nicola Messina, Matteo Pierucci, Giuseppe Amato, Marco Avvenuti, Fabrizio Falchi</p>
<p>Abstract: Class-agnostic counting (CAC) is a recent task in computer vision that aims to estimate the number of instances of arbitrary object classes never seen during model training. With the recent advancement of robust vision-and-language foundation models, there is a growing interest in prompt-based CAC, where object categories to be counted can be specified using natural language. However, we identify significant limitations in current benchmarks for evaluating this task, which hinder both accurate assessment and the development of more effective solutions. Specifically, we argue that the current evaluation protocols do not measure the ability of the model to understand which object has to be counted. This is due to two main factors: (i) the shortcomings of CAC datasets, which primarily consist of images containing objects from a single class, and (ii) the limitations of current counting performance evaluators, which are based on traditional class-specific counting and focus solely on counting errors. To fill this gap, we introduce the Prompt-Aware Counting (PrACo) benchmark, which comprises two targeted tests, each accompanied by appropriate evaluation metrics. We evaluate state-of-the-art methods and demonstrate that, although some achieve impressive results on standard class-specific counting metrics, they exhibit a significant deficiency in understanding the input prompt, indicating the need for more careful training procedures or revised designs. The code for reproducing our results is available at https://github.com/ciampluca/PrACo.</p>

<p>Abstract: Quantum neural networks are deemed suitable to replace classical neural networks in their ability to learn and scale up network models using quantum-exclusive phenomena like superposition and entanglement. However, in the noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) era, the trainability and expressibility of quantum models are yet under investigation. Medical image classification on the other hand, pertains well to applications in deep learning, particularly, convolutional neural networks. In this paper, we carry out a study of three hybrid classical-quantum neural network architectures and combine them using standard ensembling techniques on a breast cancer histopathological dataset. The best accuracy percentage obtained by an individual model is 85.59. Whereas, on performing ensemble, we have obtained accuracy as high as 86.72%, an improvement over the individual hybrid network as well as classical neural network counterparts of the hybrid network models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hannah Schieber, Jacob Young, Tobias Langlotz, Stefanie Zollmann, Daniel Roth</p>
<p>Abstract: Advancements in 3D rendering like Gaussian Splatting (GS) allow novel view synthesis and real-time rendering in virtual reality (VR). However, GS-created 3D environments are often difficult to edit. For scene enhancement or to incorporate 3D assets, segmenting Gaussians by class is essential. Existing segmentation approaches are typically limited to certain types of scenes, e.g., ''circular'' scenes, to determine clear object boundaries. However, this method is ineffective when removing large objects in non-''circling'' scenes such as large outdoor scenes. We propose Semantics-Controlled GS (SCGS), a segmentation-driven GS approach, enabling the separation of large scene parts in uncontrolled, natural environments. SCGS allows scene editing and the extraction of scene parts for VR. Additionally, we introduce a challenging outdoor dataset, overcoming the ''circling'' setup. We outperform the state-of-the-art in visual quality on our dataset and in segmentation quality on the 3D-OVS dataset. We conducted an exploratory user study, comparing a 360-video, plain GS, and SCGS in VR with a fixed viewpoint. In our subsequent main study, users were allowed to move freely, evaluating plain GS and SCGS. Our main study results show that participants clearly prefer SCGS over plain GS. We overall present an innovative approach that surpasses the state-of-the-art both technically and in user experience.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junhao Kuang, Siyuan Liang, Jiawei Liang, Kuanrong Liu, Xiaochun Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal contrastive pretraining, exemplified by models like CLIP, has been found to be vulnerable to backdoor attacks. While current backdoor defense methods primarily employ conventional data augmentation to create augmented samples aimed at feature alignment, these methods fail to capture the distinct features of backdoor samples, resulting in suboptimal defense performance. Observations reveal that adversarial examples and backdoor samples exhibit similarities in the feature space within the compromised models. Building on this insight, we propose Adversarial Backdoor Defense (ABD), a novel data augmentation strategy that aligns features with meticulously crafted adversarial examples. This approach effectively disrupts the backdoor association. Our experiments demonstrate that ABD provides robust defense against both traditional uni-modal and multimodal backdoor attacks targeting CLIP. Compared to the current state-of-the-art defense method, CleanCLIP, ABD reduces the attack success rate by 8.66% for BadNet, 10.52% for Blended, and 53.64% for BadCLIP, while maintaining a minimal average decrease of just 1.73% in clean accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunbo Long, Zhengyang Ling, Sam Brook, Duncan McFarlane, Alexandra Brintrup</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional machine learning-based visual inspection systems require extensive data collection and repetitive model training to improve accuracy. These systems typically require expensive camera, computing equipment and significant machine learning ex- pertise, which can substantially burden small and medium-sized enterprises. This study explores leveraging unsupervised learning methods with pre-trained models and low-cost hardware to create a cost-effective visual anomaly detection system. The research aims to develop a low-cost visual anomaly detection solution that uses minimal data for model training while maintaining general- izability and scalability. The system utilises unsupervised learning models from Anomalib and is deployed on affordable Raspberry Pi hardware through openVINO. The results show that this cost-effective system can complete anomaly defection training and inference on a Raspberry Pi in just 90 seconds using only 10 normal product images, achieving an F1 macro score exceeding 0.95. While the system is slightly sensitive to environmental changes like lighting, product positioning, or background, it remains a swift and economical method for factory automation inspection for small and medium-sized manufacturers</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leire Benito-Del-Valle, Aitor Alvarez-Gila, Itziar Eguskiza, Cristina L. Saratxaga</p>
<p>Abstract: Histopathology image classification is crucial for the accurate identification and diagnosis of various diseases but requires large and diverse datasets. Obtaining such datasets, however, is often costly and time-consuming due to the need for expert annotations and ethical constraints. To address this, we examine the suitability of different generative models and image selection approaches to create realistic synthetic histopathology image patches conditioned on class labels. Our findings highlight the importance of selecting an appropriate generative model type and architecture to enhance performance. Our experiments over the PCam dataset show that diffusion models are effective for transfer learning, while GAN-generated samples are better suited for augmentation. Additionally, transformer-based generative models do not require image filtering, in contrast to those derived from Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which benefit from realism score-based selection. Therefore, we show that synthetic images can effectively augment existing datasets, ultimately improving the performance of the downstream histopathology image classification task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuguang Yao, Anil Jain, Sijia Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Watermarking is an essential technique for embedding an identifier (i.e., watermark message) within digital images to assert ownership and monitor unauthorized alterations. In face recognition systems, watermarking plays a pivotal role in ensuring data integrity and security. However, an adversary could potentially interfere with the watermarking process, significantly impairing recognition performance. We explore the interaction between watermarking and adversarial attacks on face recognition models. Our findings reveal that while watermarking or input-level perturbation alone may have a negligible effect on recognition accuracy, the combined effect of watermarking and perturbation can result in an adversarial watermarking attack, significantly degrading recognition performance. Specifically, we introduce a novel threat model, the adversarial watermarking attack, which remains stealthy in the absence of watermarking, allowing images to be correctly recognized initially. However, once watermarking is applied, the attack is activated, causing recognition failures. Our study reveals a previously unrecognized vulnerability: adversarial perturbations can exploit the watermark message to evade face recognition systems. Evaluated on the CASIA-WebFace dataset, our proposed adversarial watermarking attack reduces face matching accuracy by 67.2% with an $\ell_\infty$ norm-measured perturbation strength of ${2}/{255}$ and by 95.9% with a strength of ${4}/{255}$.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16057">Towards Robust Object Detection: Identifying and Removing Backdoors via Module Inconsistency Analysis</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xianda Zhang, Siyuan Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Object detection models, widely used in security-critical applications, are vulnerable to backdoor attacks that cause targeted misclassifications when triggered by specific patterns. Existing backdoor defense techniques, primarily designed for simpler models like image classifiers, often fail to effectively detect and remove backdoors in object detectors. We propose a backdoor defense framework tailored to object detection models, based on the observation that backdoor attacks cause significant inconsistencies between local modules' behaviors, such as the Region Proposal Network (RPN) and classification head. By quantifying and analyzing these inconsistencies, we develop an algorithm to detect backdoors. We find that the inconsistent module is usually the main source of backdoor behavior, leading to a removal method that localizes the affected module, resets its parameters, and fine-tunes the model on a small clean dataset. Extensive experiments with state-of-the-art two-stage object detectors show our method achieves a 90% improvement in backdoor removal rate over fine-tuning baselines, while limiting clean data accuracy loss to less than 4%. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first approach that addresses both the detection and removal of backdoors in two-stage object detection models, advancing the field of securing these complex systems against backdoor attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> An Wang, Haochen Yin, Beilei Cui, Mengya Xu, Hongliang Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate depth perception is crucial for patient outcomes in endoscopic surgery, yet it is compromised by image distortions common in surgical settings. To tackle this issue, our study presents a benchmark for assessing the robustness of endoscopic depth estimation models. We have compiled a comprehensive dataset that reflects real-world conditions, incorporating a range of synthetically induced corruptions at varying severity levels. To further this effort, we introduce the Depth Estimation Robustness Score (DERS), a novel metric that combines measures of error, accuracy, and robustness to meet the multifaceted requirements of surgical applications. This metric acts as a foundational element for evaluating performance, establishing a new paradigm for the comparative analysis of depth estimation technologies. Additionally, we set forth a benchmark focused on robustness for the evaluation of depth estimation in endoscopic surgery, with the aim of driving progress in model refinement. A thorough analysis of two monocular depth estimation models using our framework reveals crucial information about their reliability under adverse conditions. Our results emphasize the essential need for algorithms that can tolerate data corruption, thereby advancing discussions on improving model robustness. The impact of this research transcends theoretical frameworks, providing concrete gains in surgical precision and patient safety. This study establishes a benchmark for the robustness of depth estimation and serves as a foundation for developing more resilient surgical support technologies.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Swayam Rajat Mohanty, Moin Uddin Maruf, Vaibhav Singh, Zeeshan Ahmad</p>
<p>Abstract: Solar photovoltaic (PV) modules are prone to damage during manufacturing, installation and operation which reduces their power conversion efficiency. This diminishes their positive environmental impact over the lifecycle. Continuous monitoring of PV modules during operation via unmanned aerial vehicles is essential to ensure that defective panels are promptly replaced or repaired to maintain high power conversion efficiencies. Computer vision provides an automatic, non-destructive and cost-effective tool for monitoring defects in large-scale PV plants. We review the current landscape of deep learning-based computer vision techniques used for detecting defects in solar modules. We compare and evaluate the existing approaches at different levels, namely the type of images used, data collection and processing method, deep learning architectures employed, and model interpretability. Most approaches use convolutional neural networks together with data augmentation or generative adversarial network-based techniques. We evaluate the deep learning approaches by performing interpretability analysis on classification tasks. This analysis reveals that the model focuses on the darker regions of the image to perform the classification. We find clear gaps in the existing approaches while also laying out the groundwork for mitigating these challenges when building new models. We conclude with the relevant research gaps that need to be addressed and approaches for progress in this field: integrating geometric deep learning with existing approaches for building more robust and reliable models, leveraging physics-based neural networks that combine domain expertise of physical laws to build more domain-aware deep learning models, and incorporating interpretability as a factor for building models that can be trusted. The review points towards a clear roadmap for making this technology commercially relevant.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sunoh Lee, Minsik Jeon, Jihong Min, Junwon Seo</p>
<p>Abstract: While humans naturally identify novel objects and understand their relationships, deep learning-based object detectors struggle to detect and relate objects that are not observed during training. To overcome this issue, Open World Object Detection(OWOD) has been introduced to enable models to detect unknown objects in open-world scenarios. However, OWOD methods fail to capture the fine-grained relationships between detected objects, which are crucial for comprehensive scene understanding and applications such as class discovery and tracking. In this paper, we propose a method to train an object detector that can both detect novel objects and extract semantically rich features in open-world conditions by leveraging the knowledge of Vision Foundation Models(VFM). We first utilize the semantic masks from the Segment Anything Model to supervise the box regression of unknown objects, ensuring accurate localization. By transferring the instance-wise similarities obtained from the VFM features to the detector's instance embeddings, our method then learns a semantically rich feature space of these embeddings. Extensive experiments show that our method learns a robust and generalizable feature space, outperforming other OWOD-based feature extraction methods. Additionally, we demonstrate that the enhanced feature from our model increases the detector's applicability to tasks such as open-world tracking.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dipankar Das, Deepak Ranjan Nayak</p>
<p>Abstract: Glaucoma is a common eye disease that leads to irreversible blindness unless timely detected. Hence, glaucoma detection at an early stage is of utmost importance for a better treatment plan and ultimately saving the vision. The recent literature has shown the prominence of CNN-based methods to detect glaucoma from retinal fundus images. However, such methods mainly focus on solving binary classification tasks and have not been thoroughly explored for the detection of different glaucoma stages, which is relatively challenging due to minute lesion size variations and high inter-class similarities. This paper proposes a global self-attention based network called GS-Net for efficient multi-stage glaucoma classification. We introduce a global self-attention module (GSAM) consisting of two parallel attention modules, a channel attention module (CAM) and a spatial attention module (SAM), to learn global feature dependencies across channel and spatial dimensions. The GSAM encourages extracting more discriminative and class-specific features from the fundus images. The experimental results on a publicly available dataset demonstrate that our GS-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Also, the GSAM achieves competitive performance against popular attention modules.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiacheng Ruan, Wenzhen Yuan, Zehao Lin, Ning Liao, Zhiyu Li, Feiyu Xiong, Ting Liu, Yuzhuo Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large visual-language models (LVLMs) have achieved great success in multiple applications. However, they still encounter challenges in complex scenes, especially those involving camouflaged objects. This is primarily due to the lack of samples related to camouflaged scenes in the training dataset. To mitigate this issue, we construct the MM-CamObj dataset for the first time, comprising two subsets: CamObj-Align and CamObj-Instruct. Specifically, CamObj-Align contains 11,363 image-text pairs, and it is designed for VL alignment and injecting rich knowledge of camouflaged scenes into LVLMs. CamObj-Instruct is collected for fine-tuning the LVLMs with improved instruction-following capabilities, and it includes 11,363 images and 68,849 conversations with diverse instructions. Based on the MM-CamObj dataset, we propose the CamObj-Llava, an LVLM specifically designed for addressing tasks in camouflaged scenes. To facilitate our model's effective acquisition of knowledge about camouflaged objects and scenes, we introduce a curriculum learning strategy with six distinct modes. Additionally, we construct the CamObj-Bench to evaluate the existing LVLMs' capabilities of understanding, recognition, localization and count in camouflage scenes. This benchmark includes 600 images and 7 tasks, with a total of 9,449 questions. Extensive experiments are conducted on the CamObj-Bench with CamObj-Llava, 8 existing open-source and 3 closed-source LVLMs. Surprisingly, the results indicate that our model achieves a 25.84% improvement in 4 out of 7 tasks compared to GPT-4o.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16089">From Pixels to Words: Leveraging Explainability in Face Recognition through Interactive Natural Language Processing</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ivan DeAndres-Tame, Muhammad Faisal, Ruben Tolosana, Rouqaiah Al-Refai, Ruben Vera-Rodriguez, Philipp Terh\"orst</p>
<p>Abstract: Face Recognition (FR) has advanced significantly with the development of deep learning, achieving high accuracy in several applications. However, the lack of interpretability of these systems raises concerns about their accountability, fairness, and reliability. In the present study, we propose an interactive framework to enhance the explainability of FR models by combining model-agnostic Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The proposed framework is able to accurately answer various questions of the user through an interactive chatbot. In particular, the explanations generated by our proposed method are in the form of natural language text and visual representations, which for example can describe how different facial regions contribute to the similarity measure between two faces. This is achieved through the automatic analysis of the output's saliency heatmaps of the face images and a BERT question-answering model, providing users with an interface that facilitates a comprehensive understanding of the FR decisions. The proposed approach is interactive, allowing the users to ask questions to get more precise information based on the user's background knowledge. More importantly, in contrast to previous studies, our solution does not decrease the face recognition performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method through different experiments, highlighting its potential to make FR systems more interpretable and user-friendly, especially in sensitive applications where decision-making transparency is crucial.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gabriele Magrini, Federico Becattini, Pietro Pala, Alberto Del Bimbo, Antonio Porta</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, drone detection has quickly become a subject of extreme interest: the potential for fast-moving objects of contained dimensions to be used for malicious intents or even terrorist attacks has posed attention to the necessity for precise and resilient systems for detecting and identifying such elements. While extensive literature and works exist on object detection based on RGB data, it is also critical to recognize the limits of such modality when applied to UAVs detection. Detecting drones indeed poses several challenges such as fast-moving objects and scenes with a high dynamic range or, even worse, scarce illumination levels. Neuromorphic cameras, on the other hand, can retain precise and rich spatio-temporal information in situations that are challenging for RGB cameras. They are resilient to both high-speed moving objects and scarce illumination settings, while prone to suffer a rapid loss of information when the objects in the scene are static. In this context, we present a novel model for integrating both domains together, leveraging multimodal data to take advantage of the best of both worlds. To this end, we also release NeRDD (Neuromorphic-RGB Drone Detection), a novel spatio-temporally synchronized Event-RGB Drone detection dataset of more than 3.5 hours of multimodal annotated recordings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuqi Ma, Mengyin Liu, Chao Zhu, Xu-Cheng Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) models are considered to be Large Multi-modal Models (LMM), due to their extensive training data and a large number of parameters. Mainstream OVD models prioritize object coarse-grained category rather than focus on their fine-grained attributes, e.g., colors or materials, thus failed to identify objects specified with certain attributes. However, OVD models are pretrained on large-scale image-text pairs with rich attribute words, whose latent feature space can represent the global text feature as a linear composition of fine-grained attribute tokens without highlighting them. Therefore, we propose in this paper a universal and explicit approach for frozen mainstream OVD models that boosts their attribute-level detection capabilities by highlighting fine-grained attributes in explicit linear space. Firstly, a LLM is leveraged to highlight attribute words within the input text as a zero-shot prompted task. Secondly, by strategically adjusting the token masks, the text encoders of OVD models extract both global text and attribute-specific features, which are then explicitly composited as two vectors in linear space to form the new attribute-highlighted feature for detection tasks, where corresponding scalars are hand-crafted or learned to reweight both two vectors. Notably, these scalars can be seamlessly transferred among different OVD models, which proves that such an explicit linear composition is universal. Empirical evaluation on the FG-OVD dataset demonstrates that our proposed method uniformly improves fine-grained attribute-level OVD of various mainstream models and achieves new state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mark Hamilton, Simon Stent, Vasha DuTell, Anne Harrington, Jennifer Corbett, Ruth Rosenholtz, William T. Freeman</p>
<p>Abstract: The human visual system is well-tuned to detect faces of all shapes and sizes. While this brings obvious survival advantages, such as a better chance of spotting unknown predators in the bush, it also leads to spurious face detections. ``Face pareidolia'' describes the perception of face-like structure among otherwise random stimuli: seeing faces in coffee stains or clouds in the sky. In this paper, we study face pareidolia from a computer vision perspective. We present an image dataset of ``Faces in Things'', consisting of five thousand web images with human-annotated pareidolic faces. Using this dataset, we examine the extent to which a state-of-the-art human face detector exhibits pareidolia, and find a significant behavioral gap between humans and machines. We find that the evolutionary need for humans to detect animal faces, as well as human faces, may explain some of this gap. Finally, we propose a simple statistical model of pareidolia in images. Through studies on human subjects and our pareidolic face detectors we confirm a key prediction of our model regarding what image conditions are most likely to induce pareidolia.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxiao Chen, Kai Li, Wentao Bao, Deep Patel, Yu Kong, Martin Renqiang Min, Dimitris N. Metaxas</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning to localize temporal boundaries of procedure steps in instructional videos is challenging due to the limited availability of annotated large-scale training videos. Recent works focus on learning the cross-modal alignment between video segments and ASR-transcripted narration texts through contrastive learning. However, these methods fail to account for the alignment noise, i.e., irrelevant narrations to the instructional task in videos and unreliable timestamps in narrations. To address these challenges, this work proposes a novel training framework. Motivated by the strong capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in procedure understanding and text summarization, we first apply an LLM to filter out task-irrelevant information and summarize task-related procedure steps (LLM-steps) from narrations. To further generate reliable pseudo-matching between the LLM-steps and the video for training, we propose the Multi-Pathway Text-Video Alignment (MPTVA) strategy. The key idea is to measure alignment between LLM-steps and videos via multiple pathways, including: (1) step-narration-video alignment using narration timestamps, (2) direct step-to-video alignment based on their long-term semantic similarity, and (3) direct step-to-video alignment focusing on short-term fine-grained semantic similarity learned from general video domains. The results from different pathways are fused to generate reliable pseudo step-video matching. We conducted extensive experiments across various tasks and problem settings to evaluate our proposed method. Our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods in three downstream tasks: procedure step grounding, step localization, and narration grounding by 5.9\%, 3.1\%, and 2.8\%.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have unlocked significant potential for modeling 3D head avatars, providing greater flexibility than mesh-based methods and more efficient rendering compared to NeRF-based approaches. Despite these advancements, the creation of controllable 3DGS-based head avatars remains time-intensive, often requiring tens of minutes to hours. To expedite this process, we here introduce the ``Gaussian D\'ej\`a-vu" framework, which first obtains a generalized model of the head avatar and then personalizes the result. The generalized model is trained on large 2D (synthetic and real) image datasets. This model provides a well-initialized 3D Gaussian head that is further refined using a monocular video to achieve the personalized head avatar. For personalizing, we propose learnable expression-aware rectification blendmaps to correct the initial 3D Gaussians, ensuring rapid convergence without the reliance on neural networks. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method meets its objectives. It outperforms state-of-the-art 3D Gaussian head avatars in terms of photorealistic quality as well as reduces training time consumption to at least a quarter of the existing methods, producing the avatar in minutes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emanuele Vivoli, Niccol\`o Biondi, Marco Bertini, Dimosthenis Karatzas</p>
<p>Abstract: The comic domain is rapidly advancing with the development of single- and multi-page analysis and synthesis models. Recent benchmarks and datasets have been introduced to support and assess models' capabilities in tasks such as detection (panels, characters, text), linking (character re-identification and speaker identification), and analysis of comic elements (e.g., dialog transcription). However, to provide a comprehensive understanding of the storyline, a model must not only extract elements but also understand their relationships and generate highly informative captions. In this work, we propose a pipeline that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to obtain dense, grounded captions. To construct our pipeline, we introduce an attribute-retaining metric that assesses whether all important attributes are identified in the caption. Additionally, we created a densely annotated test set to fairly evaluate open-source VLMs and select the best captioning model according to our metric. Our pipeline generates dense captions with bounding boxes that are quantitatively and qualitatively superior to those produced by specifically trained models, without requiring any additional training. Using this pipeline, we annotated over 2 million panels across 13,000 books, which will be available on the project page https://github.com/emanuelevivoli/ComiCap.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16160">MIMO: Controllable Character Video Synthesis with Spatial Decomposed Modeling</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifang Men, Yuan Yao, Miaomiao Cui, Liefeng Bo</p>
<p>Abstract: Character video synthesis aims to produce realistic videos of animatable characters within lifelike scenes. As a fundamental problem in the computer vision and graphics community, 3D works typically require multi-view captures for per-case training, which severely limits their applicability of modeling arbitrary characters in a short time. Recent 2D methods break this limitation via pre-trained diffusion models, but they struggle for pose generality and scene interaction. To this end, we propose MIMO, a novel framework which can not only synthesize character videos with controllable attributes (i.e., character, motion and scene) provided by simple user inputs, but also simultaneously achieve advanced scalability to arbitrary characters, generality to novel 3D motions, and applicability to interactive real-world scenes in a unified framework. The core idea is to encode the 2D video to compact spatial codes, considering the inherent 3D nature of video occurrence. Concretely, we lift the 2D frame pixels into 3D using monocular depth estimators, and decompose the video clip to three spatial components (i.e., main human, underlying scene, and floating occlusion) in hierarchical layers based on the 3D depth. These components are further encoded to canonical identity code, structured motion code and full scene code, which are utilized as control signals of synthesis process. The design of spatial decomposed modeling enables flexible user control, complex motion expression, as well as 3D-aware synthesis for scene interactions. Experimental results demonstrate effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16174">Fine Tuning Text-to-Image Diffusion Models for Correcting Anomalous Images</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyunwoo Yoo</p>
<p>Abstract: Since the advent of GANs and VAEs, image generation models have continuously evolved, opening up various real-world applications with the introduction of Stable Diffusion and DALL-E models. These text-to-image models can generate high-quality images for fields such as art, design, and advertising. However, they often produce aberrant images for certain prompts. This study proposes a method to mitigate such issues by fine-tuning the Stable Diffusion 3 model using the DreamBooth technique. Experimental results targeting the prompt "lying on the grass/street" demonstrate that the fine-tuned model shows improved performance in visual evaluation and metrics such as Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), and Frechet Inception Distance (FID). User surveys also indicated a higher preference for the fine-tuned model. This research is expected to make contributions to enhancing the practicality and reliability of text-to-image models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dimitrije Anti\'c, Sai Kumar Dwivedi, Shashank Tripathi, Theo Gevers, Dimitrios Tzionas</p>
<p>Abstract: We focus on recovering 3D object pose and shape from single images. This is highly challenging due to strong (self-)occlusions, depth ambiguities, the enormous shape variance, and lack of 3D ground truth for natural images. Recent work relies mostly on learning from finite datasets, so it struggles generalizing, while it focuses mostly on the shape itself, largely ignoring the alignment with pixels. Moreover, it performs feed-forward inference, so it cannot refine estimates. We tackle these limitations with a novel framework, called SDFit. To this end, we make three key observations: (1) Learned signed-distance-function (SDF) models act as a strong morphable shape prior. (2) Foundational models embed 2D images and 3D shapes in a joint space, and (3) also infer rich features from images. SDFit exploits these as follows. First, it uses a category-level morphable SDF (mSDF) model, called DIT, to generate 3D shape hypotheses. This mSDF is initialized by querying OpenShape's latent space conditioned on the input image. Then, it computes 2D-to-3D correspondences, by extracting and matching features from the image and mSDF. Last, it fits the mSDF to the image in an render-and-compare fashion, to iteratively refine estimates. We evaluate SDFit on the Pix3D and Pascal3D+ datasets of real-world images. SDFit performs roughly on par with state-of-the-art learned methods, but, uniquely, requires no re-training. Thus, SDFit is promising for generalizing in the wild, paving the way for future research. Code will be released</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaohong Liu, Guoxing Yang, Yulin Luo, Jiaji Mao, Xiang Zhang, Ming Gao, Shanghang Zhang, Jun Shen, Guangyu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Radiology is a vital and complex component of modern clinical workflow and covers many tasks. Recently, vision-language (VL) foundation models in medicine have shown potential in processing multimodal information, offering a unified solution for various radiology tasks. However, existing studies either pre-trained VL models on natural data or did not fully integrate vision-language architecture and pretraining, often neglecting the unique multimodal complexity in radiology images and their textual contexts. Additionally, their practical applicability in real-world scenarios remains underexplored. Here, we present RadFound, a large and open-source vision-language foundation model tailored for radiology, that is trained on the most extensive dataset of over 8.1 million images and 250,000 image-text pairs, covering 19 major organ systems and 10 imaging modalities. To establish expert-level multimodal perception and generation capabilities, RadFound introduces an enhanced vision encoder to capture intra-image local features and inter-image contextual information, and a unified cross-modal learning design tailored to radiology. To fully assess the models' capability, we construct a benchmark, RadVLBench, including radiology interpretation tasks like medical vision-language question-answering, as well as text generation tasks ranging from captioning to report generation. We also propose a human evaluation framework. When evaluated on the real-world benchmark involving three representative modalities, 2D images (chest X-rays), multi-view images (mammograms), and 3D images (thyroid CT scans), RadFound significantly outperforms other VL foundation models on both quantitative metrics and human evaluation. In summary, the development of RadFound represents an advancement in radiology generalists, demonstrating broad applicability potential for integration into clinical workflows.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali Badiezadeh, Amin Malekmohammadi, Seyed Mostafa Mirhassani, Parisa Gifani, Majid Vafaeezadeh</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate segmentation of prostate cancer histopathology images is crucial for diagnosis and treatment planning. This study presents a comparative analysis of three deep learning-based methods, Mamba, SAM, and YOLO, for segmenting prostate cancer histopathology images. We evaluated the performance of these models on two comprehensive datasets, Gleason 2019 and SICAPv2, using Dice score, precision, and recall metrics. Our results show that the High-order Vision Mamba UNet (H-vmunet) model outperforms the other two models, achieving the highest scores across all metrics on both datasets. The H-vmunet model's advanced architecture, which integrates high-order visual state spaces and 2D-selective-scan operations, enables efficient and sensitive lesion detection across different scales. Our study demonstrates the potential of the H-vmunet model for clinical applications and highlights the importance of robust validation and comparison of deep learning-based methods for medical image analysis. The findings of this study contribute to the development of accurate and reliable computer-aided diagnosis systems for prostate cancer.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boyan Li, Shengyi Ding, Deen Ma, Yixuan Wu, Hongjie Liao, Kaiyuan Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Millimeter wave sensing provides people with the capability of sensing the surrounding crowds in a non-invasive and privacy-preserving manner, which holds huge application potential. However, detecting stationary crowds remains challenging due to several factors such as minimal movements (like breathing or casual fidgets), which can be easily treated as noise clusters during data collection and consequently filtered in the following processing procedures. Additionally, the uneven distribution of signal power due to signal power attenuation and interferences resulting from external reflectors or absorbers further complicates accurate detection. To address these challenges and enable stationary crowd detection across various application scenarios requiring specialized domain adaption, we introduce LLMCount, the first system to harness the capabilities of large-language models (LLMs) to enhance crowd detection performance. By exploiting the decision-making capability of LLM, we can successfully compensate the signal power to acquire a uniform distribution and thereby achieve a detection with higher accuracy. To assess the system's performance, comprehensive evaluations are conducted under diversified scenarios like hall, meeting room, and cinema. The evaluation results show that our proposed approach reaches high detection accuracy with lower overall latency compared with previous methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mark Weber, Lijun Yu, Qihang Yu, Xueqing Deng, Xiaohui Shen, Daniel Cremers, Liang-Chieh Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Masked transformer models for class-conditional image generation have become a compelling alternative to diffusion models. Typically comprising two stages - an initial VQGAN model for transitioning between latent space and image space, and a subsequent Transformer model for image generation within latent space - these frameworks offer promising avenues for image synthesis. In this study, we present two primary contributions: Firstly, an empirical and systematic examination of VQGANs, leading to a modernized VQGAN. Secondly, a novel embedding-free generation network operating directly on bit tokens - a binary quantized representation of tokens with rich semantics. The first contribution furnishes a transparent, reproducible, and high-performing VQGAN model, enhancing accessibility and matching the performance of current state-of-the-art methods while revealing previously undisclosed details. The second contribution demonstrates that embedding-free image generation using bit tokens achieves a new state-of-the-art FID of 1.52 on the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, with a compact generator model of mere 305M parameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Harry Rogers, Tahmina Zebin, Grzegorz Cielniak, Beatriz De La Iglesia, Ben Magri</p>
<p>Abstract: Precision spraying evaluation requires automation primarily in post-spraying imagery. In this paper we propose an eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) computer vision pipeline to evaluate a precision spraying system post-spraying without the need for traditional agricultural methods. The developed system can semantically segment potential targets such as lettuce, chickweed, and meadowgrass and correctly identify if targets have been sprayed. Furthermore, this pipeline evaluates using a domain-specific Weakly Supervised Deposition Estimation task, allowing for class-specific quantification of spray deposit weights in {\mu}L. Estimation of coverage rates of spray deposition in a class-wise manner allows for further understanding of effectiveness of precision spraying systems. Our study evaluates different Class Activation Mapping techniques, namely AblationCAM and ScoreCAM, to determine which is more effective and interpretable for these tasks. In the pipeline, inference-only feature fusion is used to allow for further interpretability and to enable the automation of precision spraying evaluation post-spray. Our findings indicate that a Fully Convolutional Network with an EfficientNet-B0 backbone and inference-only feature fusion achieves an average absolute difference in deposition values of 156.8 {\mu}L across three classes in our test set.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16225">VideoPatchCore: An Effective Method to Memorize Normality for Video Anomaly Detection</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sunghyun Ahn, Youngwan Jo, Kijung Lee, Sanghyun Park</p>
<p>Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a crucial task in video analysis and surveillance within computer vision. Currently, VAD is gaining attention with memory techniques that store the features of normal frames. The stored features are utilized for frame reconstruction, identifying an abnormality when a significant difference exists between the reconstructed and input frames. However, this approach faces several challenges due to the simultaneous optimization required for both the memory and encoder-decoder model. These challenges include increased optimization difficulty, complexity of implementation, and performance variability depending on the memory size. To address these challenges,we propose an effective memory method for VAD, called VideoPatchCore. Inspired by PatchCore, our approach introduces a structure that prioritizes memory optimization and configures three types of memory tailored to the characteristics of video data. This method effectively addresses the limitations of existing memory-based methods, achieving good performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, our method requires no training and is straightforward to implement, making VAD tasks more accessible. Our code is available online at github.com/SkiddieAhn/Paper-VideoPatchCore.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seoungyoon Kang, Youngsun Lim, Hyunjung Shim</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional dataset distillation primarily focuses on image representation while often overlooking the important role of labels. In this study, we introduce Label-Augmented Dataset Distillation (LADD), a new dataset distillation framework enhancing dataset distillation with label augmentations. LADD sub-samples each synthetic image, generating additional dense labels to capture rich semantics. These dense labels require only a 2.5% increase in storage (ImageNet subsets) with significant performance benefits, providing strong learning signals. Our label generation strategy can complement existing dataset distillation methods for significantly enhancing their training efficiency and performance. Experimental results demonstrate that LADD outperforms existing methods in terms of computational overhead and accuracy. With three high-performance dataset distillation algorithms, LADD achieves remarkable gains by an average of 14.9% in accuracy. Furthermore, the effectiveness of our method is proven across various datasets, distillation hyperparameters, and algorithms. Finally, our method improves the cross-architecture robustness of the distilled dataset, which is important in the application scenario.</p>

<p>Abstract: Crop field boundaries are foundational datasets for agricultural monitoring and assessments but are expensive to collect manually. Machine learning (ML) methods for automatically extracting field boundaries from remotely sensed images could help realize the demand for these datasets at a global scale. However, current ML methods for field instance segmentation lack sufficient geographic coverage, accuracy, and generalization capabilities. Further, research on improving ML methods is restricted by the lack of labeled datasets representing the diversity of global agricultural fields. We present Fields of The World (FTW) -- a novel ML benchmark dataset for agricultural field instance segmentation spanning 24 countries on four continents (Europe, Africa, Asia, and South America). FTW is an order of magnitude larger than previous datasets with 70,462 samples, each containing instance and semantic segmentation masks paired with multi-date, multi-spectral Sentinel-2 satellite images. We provide results from baseline models for the new FTW benchmark, show that models trained on FTW have better zero-shot and fine-tuning performance in held-out countries than models that aren't pre-trained with diverse datasets, and show positive qualitative zero-shot results of FTW models in a real-world scenario -- running on Sentinel-2 scenes over Ethiopia.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have shown encouraging performance in the natural image domain using visual instruction tuning. However, these LMMs struggle to describe the content of remote sensing images for tasks such as image or region grounding, classification, etc. Recently, GeoChat make an effort to describe the contents of the RS images. Although, GeoChat achieves promising performance for various RS tasks, it struggles to describe the changes between bi-temporal RS images which is a key RS task. This necessitates the development of an LMM that can describe the changes between the bi-temporal RS images. However, there is insufficiency of datasets that can be utilized to tune LMMs. In order to achieve this, we introduce a change description instruction dataset that can be utilized to finetune an LMM and provide better change descriptions for RS images. Furthermore, we show that the LLaVA-1.5 model, with slight modifications, can be finetuned on the change description instruction dataset and achieve favorably better performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce the AIM 2024 UHD-IQA Challenge, a competition to advance the No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) task for modern, high-resolution photos. The challenge is based on the recently released UHD-IQA Benchmark Database, which comprises 6,073 UHD-1 (4K) images annotated with perceptual quality ratings from expert raters. Unlike previous NR-IQA datasets, UHD-IQA focuses on highly aesthetic photos of superior technical quality, reflecting the ever-increasing standards of digital photography. This challenge aims to develop efficient and effective NR-IQA models. Participants are tasked with creating novel architectures and training strategies to achieve high predictive performance on UHD-1 images within a computational budget of 50G MACs. This enables model deployment on edge devices and scalable processing of extensive image collections. Winners are determined based on a combination of performance metrics, including correlation measures (SRCC, PLCC, KRCC), absolute error metrics (MAE, RMSE), and computational efficiency (G MACs). To excel in this challenge, participants leverage techniques like knowledge distillation, low-precision inference, and multi-scale training. By pushing the boundaries of NR-IQA for high-resolution photos, the UHD-IQA Challenge aims to stimulate the development of practical models that can keep pace with the rapidly evolving landscape of digital photography. The innovative solutions emerging from this competition will have implications for various applications, from photo curation and enhancement to image compression.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yong Xien Chng, Xuchong Qiu, Yizeng Han, Kai Ding, Wan Ding, Gao Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Open-vocabulary panoptic segmentation is an emerging task aiming to accurately segment the image into semantically meaningful masks based on a set of texts. Despite existing efforts, it remains challenging to develop a high-performing method that generalizes effectively across new domains and requires minimal training resources. Our in-depth analysis of current methods reveals a crucial insight: mask classification is the main performance bottleneck for open-vocab. panoptic segmentation. Based on this, we propose Semantic Refocused Tuning (SMART), a novel framework that greatly enhances open-vocab. panoptic segmentation by improving mask classification through two key innovations. First, SMART adopts a multimodal Semantic-guided Mask Attention mechanism that injects task-awareness into the regional information extraction process. This enables the model to capture task-specific and contextually relevant information for more effective mask classification. Second, it incorporates Query Projection Tuning, which strategically fine-tunes the query projection layers within the Vision Language Model (VLM) used for mask classification. This adjustment allows the model to adapt the image focus of mask tokens to new distributions with minimal training resources, while preserving the VLM's pre-trained knowledge. Extensive ablation studies confirm the superiority of our approach. Notably, SMART sets new state-of-the-art results, demonstrating improvements of up to +1.3 PQ and +5.4 mIoU across representative benchmarks, while reducing training costs by nearly 10x compared to the previous best method. Our code and data will be released.</p>

<p>Abstract: Most existing multimodality methods use separate backbones for autoregression-based discrete text generation and diffusion-based continuous visual generation, or the same backbone by discretizing the visual data to use autoregression for both text and visual generation. In this paper, we propose to study a simple idea: share one transformer for both autoregression and diffusion. The feasibility comes from two main aspects: (i) Transformer is successfully applied to diffusion for visual generation, and (ii) transformer training for autoregression and diffusion is very similar, and the difference merely lies in that diffusion uses bidirectional attention mask and autoregression uses causal attention mask. Experimental results show that our approach achieves comparable image generation performance to current state-of-the-art methods as well as maintains the text generation capability.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ayush Shrivastava, Andrew Owens</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a simple, self-supervised approach to the Tracking Any Point (TAP) problem. We train a global matching transformer to find cycle consistent tracks through video via contrastive random walks, using the transformer's attention-based global matching to define the transition matrices for a random walk on a space-time graph. The ability to perform "all pairs" comparisons between points allows the model to obtain high spatial precision and to obtain a strong contrastive learning signal, while avoiding many of the complexities of recent approaches (such as coarse-to-fine matching). To do this, we propose a number of design decisions that allow global matching architectures to be trained through self-supervision using cycle consistency. For example, we identify that transformer-based methods are sensitive to shortcut solutions, and propose a data augmentation scheme to address them. Our method achieves strong performance on the TapVid benchmarks, outperforming previous self-supervised tracking methods, such as DIFT, and is competitive with several supervised methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) equip pre-trained large-language models (LLMs) with visual capabilities. While textual prompting in LLMs has been widely studied, visual prompting has emerged for more fine-grained and free-form visual instructions. This paper presents the first comprehensive survey on visual prompting methods in MLLMs, focusing on visual prompting, prompt generation, compositional reasoning, and prompt learning. We categorize existing visual prompts and discuss generative methods for automatic prompt annotations on the images. We also examine visual prompting methods that enable better alignment between visual encoders and backbone LLMs, concerning MLLM's visual grounding, object referring, and compositional reasoning abilities. In addition, we provide a summary of model training and in-context learning methods to improve MLLM's perception and understanding of visual prompts.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhizhong Wu, Hao Gong, Jiajing Chen, Zhou Yuru, LiangHao Tan, Ge Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a lightweight image fusion algorithm specifically designed for merging visible light and infrared images, with an emphasis on balancing performance and efficiency. The proposed method enhances the generator in a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) by integrating the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) to improve feature focus and utilizing Depthwise Separable Convolution (DSConv) for more efficient computations. These innovations significantly reduce the model's computational cost, including the number of parameters and inference latency, while maintaining or even enhancing the quality of the fused images. Comparative experiments using the M3FD dataset demonstrate that the proposed algorithm not only outperforms similar image fusion methods in terms of fusion quality but also offers a more resource-efficient solution suitable for deployment on embedded devices. The effectiveness of the lightweight design is validated through extensive ablation studies, confirming its potential for real-time applications in complex environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luis Gustavo Giacon Villani, Samuel da Silva, Americo Cunha Jr</p>
<p>Abstract: The damage detection problem in mechanical systems, using vibration measurements, is commonly called Structural Health Monitoring (SHM). Many tools are able to detect damages by changes in the vibration pattern, mainly, when damages induce nonlinear behavior. However, a more difficult problem is to detect structural variation associated with damage, when the mechanical system has nonlinear behavior even in the reference condition. In these cases, more sophisticated methods are required to detect if the changes in the response are based on some structural variation or changes in the vibration regime, because both can generate nonlinearities. Among the many ways to solve this problem, the use of the Volterra series has several favorable points, because they are a generalization of the linear convolution, allowing the separation of linear and nonlinear contributions by input filtering through the Volterra kernels. On the other hand, the presence of uncertainties in mechanical systems, due to noise, geometric imperfections, manufacturing irregularities, environmental conditions, and others, can also change the responses, becoming more difficult the damage detection procedure. An approach based on a stochastic version of Volterra series is proposed to be used in the detection of a breathing crack in a beam vibrating in a nonlinear regime of motion, even in reference condition (without crack). The system uncertainties are simulated by the variation imposed in the linear stiffness and damping coefficient. The results show, that the nonlinear analysis done, considering the high order Volterra kernels, allows the approach to detect the crack with a small propagation and probability confidence, even in the presence of uncertainties.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Suryansh Vidya, Kush Gupta, Amir Aly, Andy Wills, Emmanuel Ifeachor, Rohit Shankar</p>
<p>Abstract: Early diagnosis and intervention for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) has been shown to significantly improve the quality of life of autistic individuals. However, diagnostics methods for ASD rely on assessments based on clinical presentation that are prone to bias and can be challenging to arrive at an early diagnosis. There is a need for objective biomarkers of ASD which can help improve diagnostic accuracy. Deep learning (DL) has achieved outstanding performance in diagnosing diseases and conditions from medical imaging data. Extensive research has been conducted on creating models that classify ASD using resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data. However, existing models lack interpretability. This research aims to improve the accuracy and interpretability of ASD diagnosis by creating a DL model that can not only accurately classify ASD but also provide explainable insights into its working. The dataset used is a preprocessed version of the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) with 884 samples. Our findings show a model that can accurately classify ASD and highlight critical brain regions differing between ASD and typical controls, with potential implications for early diagnosis and understanding of the neural basis of ASD. These findings are validated by studies in the literature that use different datasets and modalities, confirming that the model actually learned characteristics of ASD and not just the dataset. This study advances the field of explainable AI in medical imaging by providing a robust and interpretable model, thereby contributing to a future with objective and reliable ASD diagnostics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boxun Xu, Hejia Geng, Yuxuan Yin, Peng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViT) are current high-performance models of choice for various vision applications. Recent developments have given rise to biologically inspired spiking transformers that thrive in ultra-low power operations on neuromorphic hardware, however, without fully unlocking the potential of spiking neural networks. We introduce DS2TA, a Denoising Spiking transformer with attenuated SpatioTemporal Attention, designed specifically for vision applications. DS2TA introduces a new spiking attenuated spatiotemporal attention mechanism that considers input firing correlations occurring in both time and space, thereby fully harnessing the computational power of spiking neurons at the core of the transformer architecture. Importantly, DS2TA facilitates parameter-efficient spatiotemporal attention computation without introducing extra weights. DS2TA employs efficient hashmap-based nonlinear spiking attention denoisers to enhance the robustness and expressive power of spiking attention maps. DS2TA demonstrates state-of-the-art performances on several widely adopted static image and dynamic neuromorphic datasets. Operated over 4 time steps, DS2TA achieves 94.92% top-1 accuracy on CIFAR10 and 77.47% top-1 accuracy on CIFAR100, as well as 79.1% and 94.44% on CIFAR10-DVS and DVS-Gesture using 10 time steps.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> EungGu Kang, Byeonghun Lee, Sunghoon Im, Kyong Hwan Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi frame super-resolution(MFSR) achieves higher performance than single image super-resolution (SISR), because MFSR leverages abundant information from multiple frames. Recent MFSR approaches adapt the deformable convolution network (DCN) to align the frames. However, the existing MFSR suffers from misalignments between the reference and source frames due to the limitations of DCN, such as small receptive fields and the predefined number of kernels. From these problems, existing MFSR approaches struggle to represent high-frequency information. To this end, we propose Deep Burst Multi-scale SR using Fourier Space with Optical Flow (BurstM). The proposed method estimates the optical flow offset for accurate alignment and predicts the continuous Fourier coefficient of each frame for representing high-frequency textures. In addition, we have enhanced the network flexibility by supporting various super-resolution (SR) scale factors with the unimodel. We demonstrate that our method has the highest performance and flexibility than the existing MFSR methods. Our source code is available at https://github.com/Egkang-Luis/burstm</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mike Zhang, Kaixian Qu, Vaishakh Patil, Cesar Cadena, Marco Hutter</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) have emerged as a tool for robots to generate task plans using common sense reasoning. For the LLM to generate actionable plans, scene context must be provided, often through a map. Recent works have shifted from explicit maps with fixed semantic classes to implicit open vocabulary maps based on queryable embeddings capable of representing any semantic class. However, embeddings cannot directly report the scene context as they are implicit, requiring further processing for LLM integration. To address this, we propose an explicit text-based map that can represent thousands of semantic classes while easily integrating with LLMs due to their text-based nature by building upon large-scale image recognition models. We study how entities in our map can be localized and show through evaluations that our text-based map localizations perform comparably to those from open vocabulary maps while using two to four orders of magnitude less memory. Real-robot experiments demonstrate the grounding of an LLM with the text-based map to solve user tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Cao, Chuanxin Song, Biqi Yang, Jiangliu Wang, Pheng-Ann Heng, Yun-Hui Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Unseen Object Instance Segmentation (UOIS) is crucial for autonomous robots operating in unstructured environments. Previous approaches require full supervision on large-scale tabletop datasets for effective pretraining. In this paper, we propose UOIS-SAM, a data-efficient solution for the UOIS task that leverages SAM's high accuracy and strong generalization capabilities. UOIS-SAM integrates two key components: (i) a Heatmap-based Prompt Generator (HPG) to generate class-agnostic point prompts with precise foreground prediction, and (ii) a Hierarchical Discrimination Network (HDNet) that adapts SAM's mask decoder, mitigating issues introduced by the SAM baseline, such as background confusion and over-segmentation, especially in scenarios involving occlusion and texture-rich objects. Extensive experimental results on OCID, OSD, and additional photometrically challenging datasets including PhoCAL and HouseCat6D, demonstrate that, even using only 10% of the training samples compared to previous methods, UOIS-SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance in unseen object segmentation, highlighting its effectiveness and robustness in various tabletop scenes.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce a new robotic system that enables a mobile robot to autonomously explore an unknown environment, build a semantic map of the environment, and subsequently update the semantic map to reflect environment changes, such as location changes of objects. Our system leverages a LiDAR scanner for 2D occupancy grid mapping and an RGB-D camera for object perception. We introduce a semantic map representation that combines a 2D occupancy grid map for geometry, with a topological map for object semantics. This map representation enables us to effectively update the semantics by deleting or adding nodes to the topological map. Our system has been tested on a Fetch robot. The robot can semantically map a 93m x 90m floor and update the semantic map once objects are moved in the environment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdul-Lateef Haji-Ali, Marcelo Pereyra, Luke Shaw, Konstantinos Zygalakis</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative diffusion models have recently emerged as a powerful strategy to perform stochastic sampling in Bayesian inverse problems, delivering remarkably accurate solutions for a wide range of challenging applications. However, diffusion models often require a large number of neural function evaluations per sample in order to deliver accurate posterior samples. As a result, using diffusion models as stochastic samplers for Monte Carlo integration in Bayesian computation can be highly computationally expensive. This cost is especially high in large-scale inverse problems such as computational imaging, which rely on large neural networks that are expensive to evaluate. With Bayesian imaging problems in mind, this paper presents a Multilevel Monte Carlo strategy that significantly reduces the cost of Bayesian computation with diffusion models. This is achieved by exploiting cost-accuracy trade-offs inherent to diffusion models to carefully couple models of different levels of accuracy in a manner that significantly reduces the overall cost of the calculation, without reducing the final accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed Multilevel Monte Carlo approach is demonstrated with three canonical computational imaging problems, where we observe a $4\times$-to-$8\times$ reduction in computational cost compared to conventional Monte Carlo averaging.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haojie Huang, Haotian Liu, Dian Wang, Robin Walters, Robert Platt</p>
<p>Abstract: Many manipulation tasks require the robot to rearrange objects relative to one another. Such tasks can be described as a sequence of relative poses between parts of a set of rigid bodies. In this work, we propose MATCH POLICY, a simple but novel pipeline for solving high-precision pick and place tasks. Instead of predicting actions directly, our method registers the pick and place targets to the stored demonstrations. This transfers action inference into a point cloud registration task and enables us to realize nontrivial manipulation policies without any training. MATCH POLICY is designed to solve high-precision tasks with a key-frame setting. By leveraging the geometric interaction and the symmetries of the task, it achieves extremely high sample efficiency and generalizability to unseen configurations. We demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance across various tasks on RLBench benchmark compared with several strong baselines and test it on a real robot with six tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding speech production both visually and kinematically can inform second language learning system designs, as well as the creation of speaking characters in video games and animations. In this work, we introduce a data-driven method to visually represent articulator motion in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) videos of the human vocal tract during speech based on arbitrary audio or speech input. We leverage large pre-trained speech models, which are embedded with prior knowledge, to generalize the visual domain to unseen data using a speech-to-video diffusion model. Our findings demonstrate that the visual generation significantly benefits from the pre-trained speech representations. We also observed that evaluating phonemes in isolation is challenging but becomes more straightforward when assessed within the context of spoken words. Limitations of the current results include the presence of unsmooth tongue motion and video distortion when the tongue contacts the palate.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jack McMahon, Naofumi Tomita, Elizabeth S. Tatishev, Adrienne A. Workman, Cristina R Costales, Niaz Banaei, Isabella W. Martin, Saeed Hassanpour</p>
<p>Abstract: This study introduces a new framework for the artificial intelligence-assisted characterization of Gram-stained whole-slide images (WSIs). As a test for the diagnosis of bloodstream infections, Gram stains provide critical early data to inform patient treatment. Rapid and reliable analysis of Gram stains has been shown to be positively associated with better clinical outcomes, underscoring the need for improved tools to automate Gram stain analysis. In this work, we developed a novel transformer-based model for Gram-stained WSI classification, which is more scalable to large datasets than previous convolutional neural network (CNN) -based methods as it does not require patch-level manual annotations. We also introduce a large Gram stain dataset from Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center (Lebanon, New Hampshire, USA) to evaluate our model, exploring the classification of five major categories of Gram-stained WSIs: Gram-positive cocci in clusters, Gram-positive cocci in pairs/chains, Gram-positive rods, Gram-negative rods, and slides with no bacteria. Our model achieves a classification accuracy of 0.858 (95% CI: 0.805, 0.905) and an AUC of 0.952 (95% CI: 0.922, 0.976) using five-fold nested cross-validation on our 475-slide dataset, demonstrating the potential of large-scale transformer models for Gram stain classification. We further demonstrate the generalizability of our trained model, which achieves strong performance on external datasets without additional fine-tuning.</p>

<p>Abstract: In-orbit automated servicing is a promising path towards lowering the cost of satellite operations and reducing the amount of orbital debris. For this purpose, we present a pipeline for automated satellite docking port detection and state estimation using monocular vision data from standard RGB sensing or an event camera. Rather than taking snapshots of the environment, an event camera has independent pixels that asynchronously respond to light changes, offering advantages such as high dynamic range, low power consumption and latency, etc. This work focuses on satellite-agnostic operations (only a geometric knowledge of the actual port is required) using the recently released Lockheed Martin Mission Augmentation Port (LM-MAP) as the target. By leveraging shallow data-driven techniques to preprocess the incoming data to highlight the LM-MAP's reflective navigational aids and then using basic geometric models for state estimation, we present a lightweight and data-efficient pipeline that can be used independently with either RGB or event cameras. We demonstrate the soundness of the pipeline and perform a quantitative comparison of the two modalities based on data collected with a photometrically accurate test bench that includes a robotic arm to simulate the target satellite's uncontrolled motion.</p>

<p>Abstract: Exploration is a critical challenge in robotics, centered on understanding unknown environments. In this work, we focus on robots exploring structured indoor environments which are often predictable and composed of repeating patterns. Most existing approaches, such as conventional frontier approaches, have difficulty leveraging the predictability and explore with simple heuristics such as `closest first'. Recent works use deep learning techniques to predict unknown regions of the map, using these predictions for information gain calculation. However, these approaches are often sensitive to the predicted map quality or do not reason over sensor coverage. To overcome these issues, our key insight is to jointly reason over what the robot can observe and its uncertainty to calculate probabilistic information gain. We introduce MapEx, a new exploration framework that uses predicted maps to form probabilistic sensor model for information gain estimation. MapEx generates multiple predicted maps based on observed information, and takes into consideration both the computed variances of predicted maps and estimated visible area to estimate the information gain of a given viewpoint. Experiments on the real-world KTH dataset showed on average 12.4% improvement than representative map-prediction based exploration and 25.4% improvement than nearest frontier approach.</p>

<p>Abstract: In practical scenarios, federated learning frequently necessitates training personalized models for each client using heterogeneous data. This paper proposes a backbone self-distillation approach to facilitate personalized federated learning. In this approach, each client trains its local model and only sends the backbone weights to the server. These weights are then aggregated to create a global backbone, which is returned to each client for updating. However, the client's local backbone lacks personalization because of the common representation. To solve this problem, each client further performs backbone self-distillation by using the global backbone as a teacher and transferring knowledge to update the local backbone. This process involves learning two components: the shared backbone for common representation and the private head for local personalization, which enables effective global knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments and comparisons with 12 state-of-the-art approaches demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p>

<p>Abstract: Natural environments pose significant challenges for autonomous robot navigation, particularly due to their unstructured and ever-changing nature. Hiking trails, with their dynamic conditions influenced by weather, vegetation, and human traffic, represent one such challenge. This work introduces a novel approach to autonomous hiking trail navigation that balances trail adherence with the flexibility to adapt to off-trail routes when necessary. The solution is a Traversability Analysis module that integrates semantic data from camera images with geometric information from LiDAR to create a comprehensive understanding of the surrounding terrain. A planner uses this traversability map to navigate safely, adhering to trails while allowing off-trail movement when necessary to avoid on-trail hazards or for safe off-trail shortcuts. The method is evaluated through simulation to determine the balance between semantic and geometric information in traversability estimation. These simulations tested various weights to assess their impact on navigation performance across different trail scenarios. Weights were then validated through field tests at the West Virginia University Core Arboretum, demonstrating the method's effectiveness in a real-world environment.</p>

<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has become integral to our everyday lives. Computer vision has advanced to the point where it can play the safety critical role of detecting pedestrians at road intersections in intelligent transportation systems and alert vehicular traffic as to potential collisions. Centralized computing analyzes camera feeds and generates alerts for nearby vehicles. However, real-time applications face challenges such as latency, limited data transfer speeds, and the risk of life loss. Edge servers offer a potential solution for real-time applications, providing localized computing and storage resources and lower response times. Unfortunately, edge servers have limited processing power. Lightweight deep learning (DL) techniques enable edge servers to utilize compressed deep neural network (DNN) models.
  The research explores implementing a lightweight DL model on Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) edge devices. An optimized You Only Look Once (YOLO) based DL model is deployed for real-time pedestrian detection, with detection events transmitted to the edge server using the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol. The simulation results demonstrate that the optimized YOLO model can achieve real-time pedestrian detection, with a fast inference speed of 147 milliseconds, a frame rate of 2.3 frames per second, and an accuracy of 78%, representing significant improvements over baseline models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Wei, Yaling Tao, Changde Du, Gangming Zhao, Yizhou Yu, Jinpeng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Mammography is the primary imaging tool for breast cancer diagnosis. Despite significant strides in applying deep learning to interpret mammography images, efforts that focus predominantly on visual features often struggle with generalization across datasets. We hypothesize that integrating additional modalities in the radiology practice, notably the linguistic features of reports and manifestation features embodying radiological insights, offers a more powerful, interpretable and generalizable representation. In this paper, we announce MVKL, the first multimodal mammography dataset encompassing multi-view images, detailed manifestations and reports. Based on this dataset, we focus on the challanging task of unsupervised pretraining and propose ViKL, a innovative framework that synergizes Visual, Knowledge, and Linguistic features. This framework relies solely on pairing information without the necessity for pathology labels, which are often challanging to acquire. ViKL employs a triple contrastive learning approach to merge linguistic and knowledge-based insights with visual data, enabling both inter-modality and intra-modality feature enhancement. Our research yields significant findings: 1) Integrating reports and manifestations with unsupervised visual pretraining, ViKL substantially enhances the pathological classification and fosters multimodal interactions. 2) Manifestations can introduce a novel hard negative sample selection mechanism. 3) The multimodal features demonstrate transferability across different datasets. 4) The multimodal pretraining approach curbs miscalibrations and crafts a high-quality representation space. The MVKL dataset and ViKL code are publicly available at https://github.com/wxwxwwxxx/ViKL to support a broad spectrum of future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xujun Li, Xin Wei, Jing Jiang, Danxiang Chen, Wei Zhang, Jinpeng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Breast cancer is a significant threat to human health. Contrastive learning has emerged as an effective method to extract critical lesion features from mammograms, thereby offering a potent tool for breast cancer screening and analysis. A crucial aspect of contrastive learning involves negative sampling, where the selection of appropriate hard negative samples is essential for driving representations to retain detailed information about lesions. In contrastive learning, it is often assumed that features can sufficiently capture semantic content, and that each minibatch inherently includes ideal hard negative samples. However, the characteristics of breast lumps challenge these assumptions. In response, we introduce ManiNeg, a novel approach that leverages manifestations as proxies to mine hard negative samples. Manifestations, which refer to the observable symptoms or signs of a disease, provide a knowledge-driven and robust basis for choosing hard negative samples. This approach benefits from its invariance to model optimization, facilitating efficient sampling. To support ManiNeg and future research endeavors, we developed the MVKL dataset, which includes multi-view mammograms, corresponding reports, meticulously annotated manifestations, and pathologically confirmed benign-malignant outcomes. We evaluate ManiNeg on the benign and malignant classification task. Our results demonstrate that ManiNeg not only improves representation in both unimodal and multimodal contexts but also shows generalization across datasets. The MVKL dataset and our codes are publicly available at https://github.com/wxwxwwxxx/ManiNeg.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leye Zhang, Xiangxiang Tian, Chengli Zhang, Hongjun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Stable Diffusion fine-tuning technique is tried to assist bridge-type innovation. The bridge real photo dataset is built, and Stable Diffusion is fine tuned by using four methods that are Textual Inversion, Dreambooth, Hypernetwork and Lora. All of them can capture the main characteristics of dataset images and realize the personalized customization of Stable Diffusion. Through fine-tuning, Stable Diffusion is not only a drawing tool, but also has the designer's innovative thinking ability. The fine tuned model can generate a large number of innovative new bridge types, which can provide rich inspiration for human designers. The result shows that this technology can be used as an engine of creativity and a power multiplier for human designers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sheng Chen, Zihao Tang, Xinyi Wang, Chenyu Wang, Weidong Cai</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) is a crucial technique in neuroimaging studies, allowing for the non-invasive probing of the underlying structures of brain tissues. Clinical dMRI data is susceptible to various artifacts during acquisition, which can lead to unreliable subsequent analyses. Therefore, dMRI preprocessing is essential for improving image quality, and manual inspection is often required to ensure that the preprocessed data is sufficiently corrected. However, manual inspection requires expertise and is time-consuming, especially with large-scale dMRI datasets. Given these challenges, an automated dMRI artifact detection tool is necessary to increase the productivity and reliability of dMRI data analysis. To this end, we propose a novel unsupervised deep learning framework called $\textbf{U}$nsupervised $\textbf{d}$MRI $\textbf{A}$rtifact $\textbf{D}$etection via $\textbf{A}$ngular Resolution Enhancement and $\textbf{C}$ycle Consistency Learning (UdAD-AC). UdAD-AC leverages dMRI angular resolution enhancement and cycle consistency learning to capture the effective representation of artifact-free dMRI data during training, and it identifies data containing artifacts using designed confidence score during inference. To assess the capability of UdAD-AC, several commonly reported dMRI artifacts, including bias field, susceptibility distortion, and corrupted volume, were added to the testing data. Experimental results demonstrate that UdAD-AC achieves the best performance compared to competitive methods in unsupervised dMRI artifact detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ricardo Coimbra Brioso, Damiano Dei, Nicola Lambri, Pietro Mancosu, Marta Scorsetti, Daniele Loiacono</p>
<p>Abstract: Radiotherapy requires precise segmentation of organs at risk (OARs) and of the Clinical Target Volume (CTV) to maximize treatment efficacy and minimize toxicity. While deep learning (DL) has significantly advanced automatic contouring, complex targets like CTVs remain challenging. This study explores the use of simpler, well-segmented structures (e.g., OARs) as Anatomical Prior (AP) information to improve CTV segmentation. We investigate gender bias in segmentation models and the mitigation effect of the prior information. Findings indicate that incorporating prior knowledge with the discussed strategies enhances segmentation quality in female patients and reduces gender bias, particularly in the abdomen region. This research provides a comparative analysis of new encoding strategies and highlights the potential of using AP to achieve fairer segmentation outcomes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kin Wai Lau, Yasar Abbas Ur Rehman, Pedro Porto Buarque de Gusm\~ao, Lai-Man Po, Lan Ma, Yuyang Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a privacy-preserving method for training machine learning models in a distributed manner on edge devices. However, on-device models face inherent computational power and memory limitations, potentially resulting in constrained gradient updates. As the model's size increases, the frequency of gradient updates on edge devices decreases, ultimately leading to suboptimal training outcomes during any particular FL round. This limits the feasibility of deploying advanced and large-scale models on edge devices, hindering the potential for performance enhancements. To address this issue, we propose FedRepOpt, a gradient re-parameterized optimizer for FL. The gradient re-parameterized method allows training a simple local model with a similar performance as a complex model by modifying the optimizer's gradients according to a set of model-specific hyperparameters obtained from the complex models. In this work, we focus on VGG-style and Ghost-style models in the FL environment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that models using FedRepOpt obtain a significant boost in performance of 16.7% and 11.4% compared to the RepGhost-style and RepVGG-style networks, while also demonstrating a faster convergence time of 11.7% and 57.4% compared to their complex structure.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaxin Ye, Junping Zhang, Hongming Shan</p>
<p>Abstract: Depression is a common mental disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. Although promising, current multimodal methods hinge on aligned or aggregated multimodal fusion, suffering two significant limitations: (i) inefficient long-range temporal modeling, and (ii) sub-optimal multimodal fusion between intermodal fusion and intramodal processing. In this paper, we propose an audio-visual progressive fusion Mamba for multimodal depression detection, termed DepMamba. DepMamba features two core designs: hierarchical contextual modeling and progressive multimodal fusion. On the one hand, hierarchical modeling introduces convolution neural networks and Mamba to extract the local-to-global features within long-range sequences. On the other hand, the progressive fusion first presents a multimodal collaborative State Space Model (SSM) extracting intermodal and intramodal information for each modality, and then utilizes a multimodal enhanced SSM for modality cohesion. Extensive experimental results on two large-scale depression datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our DepMamba over existing state-of-the-art methods.

<p>Abstract: We introduce VascX models, a comprehensive set of model ensembles for analyzing retinal vasculature from color fundus images (CFIs). Annotated CFIs were aggregated from public datasets for vessel, artery-vein, and disc segmentation; and fovea localization. Additional CFIs from the population-based Rotterdam Study were, with arteries and veins annotated by graders at pixel level. Our models achieved robust performance across devices from different vendors, varying levels of image quality levels, and diverse pathologies. Our models demonstrated superior segmentation performance compared to existing systems under a variety of conditions. Significant enhancements were observed in artery-vein and disc segmentation performance, particularly in segmentations of these structures on CFIs of intermediate quality, a common characteristic of large cohorts and clinical datasets. Our model outperformed human graders in segmenting vessels with greater precision. With VascX models we provide a robust, ready-to-use set of model ensembles and inference code aimed at simplifying the implementation and enhancing the quality of automated retinal vasculature analyses. The precise vessel parameters generated by the model can serve as starting points for the identification of disease patterns in and outside of the eye.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xenios Milidonis, Francesco Banterle, Alessandro Artusi</p>
<p>Abstract: Acquisition of high dynamic range (HDR) images is thriving due to the increasing use of smart devices and the demand for high-quality output. Extensive research has focused on developing methods for reducing the luminance range in HDR images using conventional and deep learning-based tone mapping operators to enable accurate reproduction on conventional 8 and 10-bit digital displays. However, these methods often fail to account for pixels that may lie outside the target display's gamut, resulting in visible chromatic distortions or color clipping artifacts. Previous studies suggested that a gamut management step ensures that all pixels remain within the target gamut. However, such approaches are computationally expensive and cannot be deployed on devices with limited computational resources. We propose a generative adversarial network for fast and reliable chroma compression of HDR tone-mapped images. We design a loss function that considers the hue property of generated images to improve color accuracy, and train the model on an extensive image dataset. Quantitative experiments demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art image generation and enhancement networks in color accuracy, while a subjective study suggests that the generated images are on par or superior to those produced by conventional chroma compression methods in terms of visual quality. Additionally, the model achieves real-time performance, showing promising results for deployment on devices with limited computational resources.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wanchen Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Image-to-Image Translation is a vital area of computer vision that focuses on transforming images from one visual domain to another while preserving their core content and structure. However, this field faces two major challenges: first, the data from the two domains are often unpaired, making it difficult to train generative adversarial networks effectively; second, existing methods tend to produce artifacts or hallucinations during image generation, leading to a decline in image quality. To address these issues, this paper proposes an enhanced unsupervised image-to-image translation method based on the Contrastive Unpaired Translation (CUT) model, incorporating Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features. This novel approach ensures the preservation of the semantic structure of images, even without semantic labels, by minimizing the loss between the HOG features of input and generated images. The method was tested on translating synthetic game environments from GTA5 dataset to realistic urban scenes in cityscapes dataset, demonstrating significant improvements in reducing hallucinations and enhancing image quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lucas Beveridge, Le Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent form of cardiac arrhythmia and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The effectiveness of current clinical interventions for AF is often limited by an incomplete understanding of the atrial anatomical structures that sustain this arrhythmia. Late Gadolinium-Enhanced MRI (LGE-MRI) has emerged as a critical imaging modality for assessing atrial fibrosis and scarring, which are essential markers for predicting the success of ablation procedures in AF patients. The Multi-class Bi-Atrial Segmentation (MBAS) challenge at MICCAI 2024 aims to enhance the segmentation of both left and right atria and their walls using a comprehensive dataset of 200 multi-center 3D LGE-MRIs, labelled by experts. This work presents an ensemble approach that integrates multiple machine learning models, including Unet, ResNet, EfficientNet and VGG, to perform automatic bi-atrial segmentation from LGE-MRI data. The ensemble model was evaluated using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and 95% Hausdorff distance (HD95) on the left & right atrium wall, right atrium cavity, and left atrium cavity. On the internal testing dataset, the model achieved a DSC of 88.41%, 98.48%, 98.45% and an HD95 of 1.07, 0.95, 0.64 respectively. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the ensemble model in improving segmentation accuracy. The approach contributes to advancing the understanding of AF and supports the development of more targeted and effective ablation strategies.</p>

<p>Abstract: Nowadays, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are commonly used in search and rescue scenarios to gather information in the search area. The automatic identification of the person searched for in aerial footage could increase the autonomy of such systems, reduce the search time, and thus increase the missed person's chances of survival. In this paper, we present a novel approach to perform semantically conditioned open vocabulary object tracking that is specifically designed to cope with the limitations of UAV hardware. Our approach has several advantages. It can run with verbal descriptions of the missing person, e.g., the color of the shirt, it does not require dedicated training to execute the mission and can efficiently track a potentially moving person. Our experimental results demonstrate the versatility and efficacy of our approach.</p>

While highly accurate, current motion prediction models often impose significant challenges in terms of training resource requirements and deployment on embedded hardware. We propose a new efficient motion prediction model, which achieves highly competitive benchmark results while training only a few hours on a single GPU. Due to our lightweight architectural choices and the focus on reducing the required training resources, our model can easily be applied to custom datasets. Furthermore, its low inference latency makes it particularly suitable for deployment in autonomous applications with limited computing resources.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Constantin Slioussarenko, Pierre-Yves Baudin, Marc Lapert, Benjamin Marty</p>
<p>Abstract: Over the past decade, Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) has emerged as an efficient paradigm for the rapid and simultaneous quantification of multiple MRI parameters, including fat fraction (FF), water T1 ($T1_{H2O}$), water T2 ($T2_{H2O}$), and fat T1 ($T1_{fat}$). These parameters serve as promising imaging biomarkers in various anatomical targets such as the heart, liver, and skeletal muscles. However, measuring these parameters in the upper body poses challenges due to physiological motion, particularly respiratory motion. In this work, we propose a novel approach, motion-corrected (MoCo) MRF T1-FF, which estimates the motion field using an optimized preliminary motion scan and uses it to correct the MRF acquisition data before dictionary search for reconstructing motion-corrected FF and $T1_{H2O}$ parametric maps of the upper-body region. We validated this framework using an $\textit{in vivo}$ dataset comprising ten healthy volunteers and a 10-year-old boy with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. At the ROI level, in regions minimally affected by motion, no significant bias was observed between the uncorrected and MoCo reconstructions for FF (mean difference of -0.7%) and $T1_{H2O}$ (-4.9 ms) values. Moreover, MoCo MRF T1-FF significantly reduced the standard deviations of distributions assessed in these regions, indicating improved precision. Notably, in regions heavily affected by motion, such as respiratory muscles, liver, and kidneys, the MRF parametric maps exhibited a marked reduction in motion blurring and streaking artifacts after motion correction. Furthermore, the diaphragm was consistently discernible on parametric maps after motion correction. This approach lays the groundwork for the joint 3D quantification of FF and $T1_{H2O}$ in regions that are rarely studied, such as the respiratory muscles, particularly the intercostal muscles and diaphragm.</p>

<p>Abstract: Detecting objects in mobile robotics is crucial for numerous applications, from autonomous navigation to inspection. However, robots are often required to perform tasks in different domains with respect to the training one and need to adapt to these changes. Tiny mobile robots, subject to size, power, and computational constraints, encounter even more difficulties in running and adapting these algorithms. Such adaptability, though, is crucial for real-world deployment, where robots must operate effectively in dynamic and unpredictable settings. In this work, we introduce a novel benchmark to evaluate the continual learning capabilities of object detection systems in tiny robotic platforms. Our contributions include: (i) Tiny Robotics Object Detection (TiROD), a comprehensive dataset collected using a small mobile robot, designed to test the adaptability of object detectors across various domains and classes; (ii) an evaluation of state-of-the-art real-time object detectors combined with different continual learning strategies on this dataset, providing detailed insights into their performance and limitations; and (iii) we publish the data and the code to replicate the results to foster continuous advancements in this field. Our benchmark results indicate key challenges that must be addressed to advance the development of robust and efficient object detection systems for tiny robotics.</p>

<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning is arguably the most straightforward way to tailor a pre-trained model (e.g., a foundation model) to downstream applications, but it also comes with the risk of losing valuable knowledge the model had learned in pre-training. For example, fine-tuning a pre-trained classifier capable of recognizing a large number of classes to master a subset of classes at hand is shown to drastically degrade the model's accuracy in the other classes it had previously learned. As such, it is hard to further use the fine-tuned model when it encounters classes beyond the fine-tuning data. In this paper, we systematically dissect the issue, aiming to answer the fundamental question, ''What has been damaged in the fine-tuned model?'' To our surprise, we find that the fine-tuned model neither forgets the relationship among the other classes nor degrades the features to recognize these classes. Instead, the fine-tuned model often produces more discriminative features for these other classes, even if they were missing during fine-tuning! {What really hurts the accuracy is the discrepant logit scales between the fine-tuning classes and the other classes}, implying that a simple post-processing calibration would bring back the pre-trained model's capability and at the same time unveil the feature improvement over all classes. We conduct an extensive empirical study to demonstrate the robustness of our findings and provide preliminary explanations underlying them, suggesting new directions for future theoretical analysis.

<p>Abstract: How can robot manipulation policies generalize to novel tasks involving unseen object types and new motions? In this paper, we provide a solution in terms of predicting motion information from web data through human video generation and conditioning a robot policy on the generated video. Instead of attempting to scale robot data collection which is expensive, we show how we can leverage video generation models trained on easily available web data, for enabling generalization. Our approach Gen2Act casts language-conditioned manipulation as zero-shot human video generation followed by execution with a single policy conditioned on the generated video. To train the policy, we use an order of magnitude less robot interaction data compared to what the video prediction model was trained on. Gen2Act doesn't require fine-tuning the video model at all and we directly use a pre-trained model for generating human videos. Our results on diverse real-world scenarios show how Gen2Act enables manipulating unseen object types and performing novel motions for tasks not present in the robot data.

<p>Abstract: Instance shadow detection, crucial for applications such as photo editing and light direction estimation, has undergone significant advancements in predicting shadow instances, object instances, and their associations. The extension of this task to videos presents challenges in annotating diverse video data and addressing complexities arising from occlusion and temporary disappearances within associations. In response to these challenges, we introduce ViShadow, a semi-supervised video instance shadow detection framework that leverages both labeled image data and unlabeled video data for training. ViShadow features a two-stage training pipeline: the first stage, utilizing labeled image data, identifies shadow and object instances through contrastive learning for cross-frame pairing. The second stage employs unlabeled videos, incorporating an associated cycle consistency loss to enhance tracking ability. A retrieval mechanism is introduced to manage temporary disappearances, ensuring tracking continuity. The SOBA-VID dataset, comprising unlabeled training videos and labeled testing videos, along with the SOAP-VID metric, is introduced for the quantitative evaluation of VISD solutions. The effectiveness of ViShadow is further demonstrated through various video-level applications such as video inpainting, instance cloning, shadow editing, and text-instructed shadow-object manipulation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haotian Bai, Yuanhuiyi Lyu, Lutao Jiang, Sijia Li, Haonan Lu, Xiaodong Lin, Lin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-3D form plays a crucial role in creating editable 3D scenes for AR/VR. Recent advances have shown promise in merging neural radiance fields (NeRFs) with pre-trained diffusion models for text-to-3D object generation. However, one enduring challenge is their inadequate capability to accurately parse and regenerate consistent multi-object environments. Specifically, these models encounter difficulties in accurately representing quantity and style prompted by multi-object texts, often resulting in a collapse of the rendering fidelity that fails to match the semantic intricacies. Moreover, amalgamating these elements into a coherent 3D scene is a substantial challenge, stemming from generic distribution inherent in diffusion models. To tackle the issue of 'guidance collapse' and further enhance scene consistency, we propose a novel framework, dubbed CompoNeRF, by integrating an editable 3D scene layout with object-specific and scene-wide guidance mechanisms. It initiates by interpreting a complex text into the layout populated with multiple NeRFs, each paired with a corresponding subtext prompt for precise object depiction. Next, a tailored composition module seamlessly blends these NeRFs, promoting consistency, while the dual-level text guidance reduces ambiguity and boosts accuracy. Noticeably, our composition design permits decomposition. This enables flexible scene editing and recomposition into new scenes based on the edited layout or text prompts. Utilizing the open-source Stable Diffusion model, CompoNeRF generates multi-object scenes with high fidelity. Remarkably, our framework achieves up to a \textbf{54\%} improvement by the multi-view CLIP score metric. Our user study indicates that our method has significantly improved semantic accuracy, multi-view consistency, and individual recognizability for multi-object scene generation.</p>

LiDAR points are scattered on the surface of objects and buildings, which have strong shape priors along different axes. To enhance message passing along particular axes, Stacked Asymmetric Convolution Block (SACB) is designed, which is one of the main contributions in this paper. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that asymmetric convolution and its corresponding strategies employed by SACB can contribute to the more effective representation of point cloud feature. On this basis, Selective Feature Fusion Block (SFFB), which is formed by stacking point- and channel-wise gating layers in a predefined sequence, is proposed to selectively boost salient local features in certain key regions, as well as to align the features before fusion phase. SACBs and SFFBs are combined to construct a robust and accurate architecture for point cloud-based place recognition, which is termed SelFLoc. Comparative experimental results show that SelFLoc achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the Oxford and other three in-house benchmarks with an improvement of 1.6 absolute percentages on mean average recall@1.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fulong Ma, Xiaoyang Yan, Guoyang Zhao, Xiaojie Xu, Yuxuan Liu, Jun Ma, Ming Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection plays a crucial role in autonomous driving. However, existing monocular 3D detection algorithms depend on 3D labels derived from LiDAR measurements, which are costly to acquire for new datasets and challenging to deploy in novel environments. Specifically, this study investigates the pipeline for training a monocular 3D object detection model on a diverse collection of 3D and 2D datasets. The proposed framework comprises three components: (1) a robust monocular 3D model capable of functioning across various camera settings, (2) a selective-training strategy to accommodate datasets with differing class annotations, and (3) a pseudo 3D training approach using 2D labels to enhance detection performance in scenes containing only 2D labels. With this framework, we could train models on a joint set of various open 3D/2D datasets to obtain models with significantly stronger generalization capability and enhanced performance on new dataset with only 2D labels. We conduct extensive experiments on KITTI/nuScenes/ONCE/Cityscapes/BDD100K datasets to demonstrate the scaling ability of the proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Farhan Ishmam, Md Sakib Hossain Shovon, M. F. Mridha, Nilanjan Dey</p>
<p>Abstract: The multimodal task of Visual Question Answering (VQA) encompassing elements of Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), aims to generate answers to questions on any visual input. Over time, the scope of VQA has expanded from datasets focusing on an extensive collection of natural images to datasets featuring synthetic images, video, 3D environments, and various other visual inputs. The emergence of large pre-trained networks has shifted the early VQA approaches relying on feature extraction and fusion schemes to vision language pre-training (VLP) techniques. However, there is a lack of comprehensive surveys that encompass both traditional VQA architectures and contemporary VLP-based methods. Furthermore, the VLP challenges in the lens of VQA haven't been thoroughly explored, leaving room for potential open problems to emerge. Our work presents a survey in the domain of VQA that delves into the intricacies of VQA datasets and methods over the field's history, introduces a detailed taxonomy to categorize the facets of VQA, and highlights the recent trends, challenges, and scopes for improvement. We further generalize VQA to multimodal question answering, explore tasks related to VQA, and present a set of open problems for future investigation. The work aims to navigate both beginners and experts by shedding light on the potential avenues of research and expanding the boundaries of the field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> You Zhou, Jie Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: We explore how to capture the significance of a sub-text block in an article and how it may be used for text mining tasks. A sub-text block is a sub-sequence of sentences in the article. We formulate the notion of content significance distribution (CSD) of sub-text blocks, referred to as CSD of the first kind and denoted by CSD-1. In particular, we leverage Hugging Face's SentenceTransformer to generate contextual sentence embeddings, and use MoverScore over text embeddings to measure how similar a sub-text block is to the entire text. To overcome the exponential blowup on the number of sub-text blocks, we present an approximation algorithm and show that the approximated CSD-1 is almost identical to the exact CSD-1. Under this approximation, we show that the average and median CSD-1's for news, scholarly research, argument, and narrative articles share the same pattern. We also show that under a certain linear transformation, the complement of the cumulative distribution function of the beta distribution with certain values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ resembles a CSD-1 curve. We then use CSD-1's to extract linguistic features to train an SVC classifier for assessing how well an article is organized. Through experiments, we show that this method achieves high accuracy for assessing student essays. Moreover, we study CSD of sentence locations, referred to as CSD of the second kind and denoted by CSD-2, and show that average CSD-2's for different types of articles possess distinctive patterns, which either conform common perceptions of article structures or provide rectification with minor deviation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soumik Mukhopadhyay, Matthew Gwilliam, Yosuke Yamaguchi, Vatsal Agarwal, Namitha Padmanabhan, Archana Swaminathan, Tianyi Zhou, Jun Ohya, Abhinav Shrivastava</p>
<p>Abstract: While many unsupervised learning models focus on one family of tasks, either generative or discriminative, we explore the possibility of a unified representation learner: a model which addresses both families of tasks simultaneously. We identify diffusion models, a state-of-the-art method for generative tasks, as a prime candidate. Such models involve training a U-Net to iteratively predict and remove noise, and the resulting model can synthesize high-fidelity, diverse, novel images. We find that the intermediate feature maps of the U-Net are diverse, discriminative feature representations. We propose a novel attention mechanism for pooling feature maps and further leverage this mechanism as DifFormer, a transformer feature fusion of features from different diffusion U-Net blocks and noise steps. We also develop DifFeed, a novel feedback mechanism tailored to diffusion. We find that diffusion models are better than GANs, and, with our fusion and feedback mechanisms, can compete with state-of-the-art unsupervised image representation learning methods for discriminative tasks - image classification with full and semi-supervision, transfer for fine-grained classification, object detection and segmentation, and semantic segmentation.

<p>Abstract: We introduce DreamDrone, a novel zero-shot and training-free pipeline for generating unbounded flythrough scenes from textual prompts. Different from other methods that focus on warping images frame by frame, we advocate explicitly warping the intermediate latent code of the pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model for high-quality image generation and generalization ability. To further enhance the fidelity of the generated images, we also propose a feature-correspondence-guidance diffusion process and a high-pass filtering strategy to promote geometric consistency and high-frequency detail consistency, respectively. Extensive experiments reveal that DreamDrone significantly surpasses existing methods, delivering highly authentic scene generation with exceptional visual quality, without training or fine-tuning on datasets or reconstructing 3D point clouds in advance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thibaut Loiseau, Tuan-Hung Vu, Mickael Chen, Patrick P\'erez, Matthieu Cord</p>
<p>Abstract: Assessing the robustness of perception models to covariate shifts and their ability to detect out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs is crucial for safety-critical applications such as autonomous vehicles. By nature of such applications, however, the relevant data is difficult to collect and annotate. In this paper, we show for the first time how synthetic data can be specifically generated to assess comprehensively the real-world reliability of semantic segmentation models. By fine-tuning Stable Diffusion with only in-domain data, we perform zero-shot generation of visual scenes in OOD domains or inpainted with OOD objects. This synthetic data is employed to evaluate the robustness of pretrained segmenters, thereby offering insights into their performance when confronted with real edge cases. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate a high correlation between the performance of models when evaluated on our synthetic OOD data and when evaluated on real OOD inputs, showing the relevance of such virtual testing. Furthermore, we demonstrate how our approach can be utilized to enhance the calibration and OOD detection capabilities of segmenters. Code and data are made public.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yechi Ma, Neehar Peri, Shuoquan Wei, Achal Dave, Wei Hua, Yanan Li, Deva Ramanan, Shu Kong</p>
<p>Abstract: Contemporary autonomous vehicle (AV) benchmarks have advanced techniques for training 3D detectors, particularly on large-scale multi-modal (LiDAR + RGB) data. Surprisingly, although semantic class labels naturally follow a long-tailed distribution, existing benchmarks only focus on a few common classes (e.g., pedestrian and car) and neglect many rare but crucial classes (e.g., emergency vehicle and stroller). However, AVs must reliably detect both common and rare classes for safe operation in the open world. We address this challenge by formally studying the problem of Long-Tailed 3D Detection (LT3D), which evaluates all annotated classes, including those in-the-tail. We address LT3D with hierarchical losses that promote feature sharing across classes, and introduce diagnostic metrics that award partial credit to ``reasonable'' mistakes with respect to the semantic hierarchy (e.g., mistaking a child for an adult). Further, we point out that rare-class accuracy is particularly improved via multi-modal late fusion (MMLF) of independently trained uni-modal LiDAR and RGB detectors. Importantly, such an MMLF framework allows us to leverage large-scale uni-modal datasets (with more examples for rare classes) to train better uni-modal detectors, unlike prevailing end-to-end trained multi-modal detectors that require paired multi-modal data. Finally, we examine three critical components of our simple MMLF approach from first principles and investigate whether to train 2D or 3D RGB detectors for fusion, whether to match RGB and LiDAR detections in 3D or the projected 2D image plane, and how to fuse matched detections. Our proposed MMLF approach significantly improves LT3D performance over prior work, particularly improving rare class performance from 12.8 to 20.0 mAP!</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tavis Shore, Simon Hadfield, Oscar Mendez</p>
<p>Abstract: Cross-view image matching for geo-localisation is a challenging problem due to the significant visual difference between aerial and ground-level viewpoints. The method provides localisation capabilities from geo-referenced images, eliminating the need for external devices or costly equipment. This enhances the capacity of agents to autonomously determine their position, navigate, and operate effectively in GNSS-denied environments. Current research employs a variety of techniques to reduce the domain gap such as applying polar transforms to aerial images or synthesising between perspectives. However, these approaches generally rely on having a 360{\deg} field of view, limiting real-world feasibility. We propose BEV-CV, an approach introducing two key novelties with a focus on improving the real-world viability of cross-view geo-localisation. Firstly bringing ground-level images into a semantic Birds-Eye-View before matching embeddings, allowing for direct comparison with aerial image representations. Secondly, we adapt datasets into application realistic format - limited Field-of-View images aligned to vehicle direction. BEV-CV achieves state-of-the-art recall accuracies, improving Top-1 rates of 70{\deg} crops of CVUSA and CVACT by 23% and 24% respectively. Also decreasing computational requirements by reducing floating point operations to below previous works, and decreasing embedding dimensionality by 33% - together allowing for faster localisation capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Byeonghyeon Lee, Howoong Lee, Xiangyu Sun, Usman Ali, Eunbyung Park</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies in Radiance Fields have paved the robust way for novel view synthesis with their photorealistic rendering quality. Nevertheless, they usually employ neural networks and volumetric rendering, which are costly to train and impede their broad use in various real-time applications due to the lengthy rendering time. Lately 3D Gaussians splatting-based approach has been proposed to model the 3D scene, and it achieves remarkable visual quality while rendering the images in real-time. However, it suffers from severe degradation in the rendering quality if the training images are blurry. Blurriness commonly occurs due to the lens defocusing, object motion, and camera shake, and it inevitably intervenes in clean image acquisition. Several previous studies have attempted to render clean and sharp images from blurry input images using neural fields. The majority of those works, however, are designed only for volumetric rendering-based neural radiance fields and are not straightforwardly applicable to rasterization-based 3D Gaussian splatting methods. Thus, we propose a novel real-time deblurring framework, Deblurring 3D Gaussian Splatting, using a small Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) that manipulates the covariance of each 3D Gaussian to model the scene blurriness. While Deblurring 3D Gaussian Splatting can still enjoy real-time rendering, it can reconstruct fine and sharp details from blurry images. A variety of experiments have been conducted on the benchmark, and the results have revealed the effectiveness of our approach for deblurring.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Baoxiong Jia, Yixin Chen, Huangyue Yu, Yan Wang, Xuesong Niu, Tengyu Liu, Qing Li, Siyuan Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D vision-language grounding, which focuses on aligning language with the 3D physical environment, stands as a cornerstone in the development of embodied agents. In comparison to recent advancements in the 2D domain, grounding language in 3D scenes faces several significant challenges: (i) the inherent complexity of 3D scenes due to the diverse object configurations, their rich attributes, and intricate relationships; (ii) the scarcity of paired 3D vision-language data to support grounded learning; and (iii) the absence of a unified learning framework to distill knowledge from grounded 3D data. In this work, we aim to address these three major challenges in 3D vision-language by examining the potential of systematically upscaling 3D vision-language learning in indoor environments. We introduce the first million-scale 3D vision-language dataset, SceneVerse, encompassing about 68K 3D indoor scenes and comprising 2.5M vision-language pairs derived from both human annotations and our scalable scene-graph-based generation approach. We demonstrate that this scaling allows for a unified pre-training framework, Grounded Pre-training for Scenes (GPS), for 3D vision-language learning. Through extensive experiments, we showcase the effectiveness of GPS by achieving state-of-the-art performance on all existing 3D visual grounding benchmarks. The vast potential of SceneVerse and GPS is unveiled through zero-shot transfer experiments in the challenging 3D vision-language tasks. Project website: https://scene-verse.github.io.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxi Liu, Wenhan Yang, Huihui Bai, Yunchao Wei, Yao Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Learned Image Compression (LIC) has shown remarkable progress in recent years. Existing works commonly employ CNN-based or self-attention-based modules as transform methods for compression. However, there is no prior research on neural transform that focuses on specific regions. In response, we introduce the class-agnostic segmentation masks (i.e. semantic masks without category labels) for extracting region-adaptive contextual information. Our proposed module, Region-Adaptive Transform, applies adaptive convolutions on different regions guided by the masks. Additionally, we introduce a plug-and-play module named Scale Affine Layer to incorporate rich contexts from various regions. While there have been prior image compression efforts that involve segmentation masks as additional intermediate inputs, our approach differs significantly from them. Our advantages lie in that, to avoid extra bitrate overhead, we treat these masks as privilege information, which is accessible during the model training stage but not required during the inference phase. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to employ class-agnostic masks as privilege information and achieve superior performance in pixel-fidelity metrics, such as Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR). The experimental results demonstrate our improvement compared to previously well-performing methods, with about 8.2% bitrate saving compared to VTM-17.0.

<p>Abstract: Current LiDAR-based Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) multi-agent perception systems have shown the significant success on 3D object detection. While these models perform well in the trained clean weather, they struggle in unseen adverse weather conditions with the domain gap. In this paper, we propose a Domain Generalization based approach, named V2X-DGW, for LiDAR-based 3D object detection on multi-agent perception system under adverse weather conditions. Our research aims to not only maintain favorable multi-agent performance in the clean weather but also promote the performance in the unseen adverse weather conditions by learning only on the clean weather data. To realize the Domain Generalization, we first introduce the Adaptive Weather Augmentation (AWA) to mimic the unseen adverse weather conditions, and then propose two alignments for generalizable representation learning: Trust-region Weather-invariant Alignment (TWA) and Agent-aware Contrastive Alignment (ACA). To evaluate this research, we add Fog, Rain, Snow conditions on two publicized multi-agent datasets based on physics-based models, resulting in two new datasets: OPV2V-w and V2XSet-w. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our V2X-DGW achieved significant improvements in the unseen adverse weathers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seongmin Hwang, Daeyoung Han, Cheolkon Jung, Moongu Jeon</p>
<p>Abstract: The surge in interest regarding image dehazing has led to notable advancements in deep learning-based single image dehazing approaches, exhibiting impressive performance in recent studies. Despite these strides, many existing methods fall short in meeting the efficiency demands of practical applications. In this paper, we introduce WaveDH, a novel and compact ConvNet designed to address this efficiency gap in image dehazing. Our WaveDH leverages wavelet sub-bands for guided up-and-downsampling and frequency-aware feature refinement. The key idea lies in utilizing wavelet decomposition to extract low-and-high frequency components from feature levels, allowing for faster processing while upholding high-quality reconstruction. The downsampling block employs a novel squeeze-and-attention scheme to optimize the feature downsampling process in a structurally compact manner through wavelet domain learning, preserving discriminative features while discarding noise components. In our upsampling block, we introduce a dual-upsample and fusion mechanism to enhance high-frequency component awareness, aiding in the reconstruction of high-frequency details. Departing from conventional dehazing methods that treat low-and-high frequency components equally, our feature refinement block strategically processes features with a frequency-aware approach. By employing a coarse-to-fine methodology, it not only refines the details at frequency levels but also significantly optimizes computational costs. The refinement is performed in a maximum 8x downsampled feature space, striking a favorable efficiency-vs-accuracy trade-off. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method, WaveDH, outperforms many state-of-the-art methods on several image dehazing benchmarks with significantly reduced computational costs.

<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have recently gained prominence as powerful deep generative models, demonstrating unmatched performance across various domains. However, their potential in multi-sensor fusion remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce DifFUSER, a novel approach that leverages diffusion models for multi-modal fusion in 3D object detection and BEV map segmentation. Benefiting from the inherent denoising property of diffusion, DifFUSER is able to refine or even synthesize sensor features in case of sensor malfunction, thereby improving the quality of the fused output. In terms of architecture, our DifFUSER blocks are chained together in a hierarchical BiFPN fashion, termed cMini-BiFPN, offering an alternative architecture for latent diffusion. We further introduce a Gated Self-conditioned Modulated (GSM) latent diffusion module together with a Progressive Sensor Dropout Training (PSDT) paradigm, designed to add stronger conditioning to the diffusion process and robustness to sensor failures. Our extensive evaluations on the Nuscenes dataset reveal that DifFUSER not only achieves state-of-the-art performance with a 70.04% mIOU in BEV map segmentation tasks but also competes effectively with leading transformer-based fusion techniques in 3D object detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ryoya Nara, Yu-Chieh Lin, Yuji Nozawa, Youyang Ng, Goh Itoh, Osamu Torii, Yusuke Matsui</p>
<p>Abstract: Many image retrieval studies use metric learning to train an image encoder. However, metric learning cannot handle differences in users' preferences, and requires data to train an image encoder. To overcome these limitations, we revisit relevance feedback, a classic technique for interactive retrieval systems, and propose an interactive CLIP-based image retrieval system with relevance feedback. Our retrieval system first executes the retrieval, collects each user's unique preferences through binary feedback, and returns images the user prefers. Even when users have various preferences, our retrieval system learns each user's preference through the feedback and adapts to the preference. Moreover, our retrieval system leverages CLIP's zero-shot transferability and achieves high accuracy without training. We empirically show that our retrieval system competes well with state-of-the-art metric learning in category-based image retrieval, despite not training image encoders specifically for each dataset. Furthermore, we set up two additional experimental settings where users have various preferences: one-label-based image retrieval and conditioned image retrieval. In both cases, our retrieval system effectively adapts to each user's preferences, resulting in improved accuracy compared to image retrieval without feedback. Overall, our work highlights the potential benefits of integrating CLIP with classic relevance feedback techniques to enhance image retrieval.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matina Mahdizadeh Sani, Ali Royat, Mahdieh Soleymani Baghshah</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks have reached remarkable achievements in medical image processing tasks, specifically in classifying and detecting various diseases. However, when confronted with limited data, these networks face a critical vulnerability, often succumbing to overfitting by excessively memorizing the limited information available. This work addresses the challenge mentioned above by improving the supervised contrastive learning method leveraging both image-level labels and domain-specific augmentations to enhance model robustness. This approach integrates self-supervised pre-training with a two-stage supervised contrastive learning strategy. In the first stage, we employ a modified supervised contrastive loss that not only focuses on reducing false negatives but also introduces an elimination effect to address false positives. In the second stage, a relaxing mechanism is introduced that refines positive and negative pairs based on similarity, ensuring that only relevant image representations are aligned. We evaluate our method on the BreakHis dataset, which consists of breast cancer histopathology images, and demonstrate an increase in classification accuracy by 1.45% in the image level, compared to the state-of-the-art method. This improvement corresponds to 93.63% absolute accuracy, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach in leveraging properties of data to learn more appropriate representation space.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruizhi Shao, Youxin Pang, Zerong Zheng, Jingxiang Sun, Yebin Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a novel approach for generating 360-degree high-quality, spatio-temporally coherent human videos from a single image. Our framework combines the strengths of diffusion transformers for capturing global correlations across viewpoints and time, and CNNs for accurate condition injection. The core is a hierarchical 4D transformer architecture that factorizes self-attention across views, time steps, and spatial dimensions, enabling efficient modeling of the 4D space. Precise conditioning is achieved by injecting human identity, camera parameters, and temporal signals into the respective transformers. To train this model, we collect a multi-dimensional dataset spanning images, videos, multi-view data, and limited 4D footage, along with a tailored multi-dimensional training strategy. Our approach overcomes the limitations of previous methods based on generative adversarial networks or vanilla diffusion models, which struggle with complex motions, viewpoint changes, and generalization. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate our method's ability to synthesize 360-degree realistic, coherent human motion videos, paving the way for advanced multimedia applications in areas such as virtual reality and animation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Wang, Conrad M Albrecht, Xiao Xiang Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised pretraining on large-scale satellite data has raised great interest in building Earth observation (EO) foundation models. However, many important resources beyond pure satellite imagery, such as land-cover-land-use products that provide free global semantic information, as well as vision foundation models that hold strong knowledge of the natural world, are not widely studied. In this work, we show these free additional resources not only help resolve common contrastive learning bottlenecks, but also significantly boost the efficiency and effectiveness of EO pretraining. Specifically, we first propose soft contrastive learning that optimizes cross-scene soft similarity based on land-cover-generated multi-label supervision, naturally solving the issue of multiple positive samples and too strict positive matching in complex scenes. Second, we revisit and explore cross-domain continual pretraining for both multispectral and SAR imagery, building efficient EO foundation models from strongest vision models such as DINOv2. Adapting simple weight-initialization and Siamese masking strategies into our soft contrastive learning framework, we demonstrate impressive continual pretraining performance even when the input modalities are not aligned. Without prohibitive training, we produce multispectral and SAR foundation models that achieve significantly better results in 10 out of 11 downstream tasks than most existing SOTA models. For example, our ResNet50/ViT-S achieve 84.8/85.0 linear probing mAP scores on BigEarthNet-10\% which are better than most existing ViT-L models; under the same setting, our ViT-B sets a new record of 86.8 in multispectral, and 82.5 in SAR, the latter even better than many multispectral models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Takaya Tanaka, Yutaka Yamaguti</p>
<p>Abstract: Successive image generation using cyclic transformations is demonstrated by extending the CycleGAN model to transform images among three different categories. Repeated application of the trained generators produces sequences of images that transition among the different categories. The generated image sequences occupy a more limited region of the image space compared with the original training dataset. Quantitative evaluation using precision and recall metrics indicates that the generated images have high quality but reduced diversity relative to the training dataset. Such successive generation processes are characterized as chaotic dynamics in terms of dynamical system theory. Positive Lyapunov exponents estimated from the generated trajectories confirm the presence of chaotic dynamics, with the Lyapunov dimension of the attractor found to be comparable to the intrinsic dimension of the training data manifold. The results suggest that chaotic dynamics in the image space defined by the deep generative model contribute to the diversity of the generated images, constituting a novel approach for multi-class image generation. This model can be interpreted as an extension of classical associative memory to perform hetero-association among image categories.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tobias Kirschstein, Simon Giebenhain, Jiapeng Tang, Markos Georgopoulos, Matthias Nie{\ss}ner</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning 3D head priors from large 2D image collections is an important step towards high-quality 3D-aware human modeling. A core requirement is an efficient architecture that scales well to large-scale datasets and large image resolutions. Unfortunately, existing 3D GANs struggle to scale to generate samples at high resolutions due to their relatively slow train and render speeds, and typically have to rely on 2D superresolution networks at the expense of global 3D consistency. To address these challenges, we propose Generative Gaussian Heads (GGHead), which adopts the recent 3D Gaussian Splatting representation within a 3D GAN framework. To generate a 3D representation, we employ a powerful 2D CNN generator to predict Gaussian attributes in the UV space of a template head mesh. This way, GGHead exploits the regularity of the template's UV layout, substantially facilitating the challenging task of predicting an unstructured set of 3D Gaussians. We further improve the geometric fidelity of the generated 3D representations with a novel total variation loss on rendered UV coordinates. Intuitively, this regularization encourages that neighboring rendered pixels should stem from neighboring Gaussians in the template's UV space. Taken together, our pipeline can efficiently generate 3D heads trained only from single-view 2D image observations. Our proposed framework matches the quality of existing 3D head GANs on FFHQ while being both substantially faster and fully 3D consistent. As a result, we demonstrate real-time generation and rendering of high-quality 3D-consistent heads at $1024^2$ resolution for the first time.

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09396">Too Many Frames, Not All Useful: Efficient Strategies for Long-Form Video QA</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jongwoo Park, Kanchana Ranasinghe, Kumara Kahatapitiya, Wonjeong Ryoo, Donghyun Kim, Michael S. Ryoo</p>
<p>Abstract: Long-form videos that span across wide temporal intervals are highly information redundant and contain multiple distinct events or entities that are often loosely related. Therefore, when performing long-form video question answering (LVQA), all information necessary to generate a correct response can often be contained within a small subset of frames. Recent literature explore the use of large language models (LLMs) in LVQA benchmarks, achieving exceptional performance, while relying on vision language models (VLMs) to convert all visual content within videos into natural language. Such VLMs often independently caption a large number of frames uniformly sampled from long videos, which is not efficient and can mostly be redundant. Questioning these decision choices, we explore optimal strategies for key-frame selection that can significantly reduce these redundancies, namely Hierarchical Keyframe Selector. Our proposed framework, LVNet, achieves state-of-the-art performance at a comparable caption scale across three benchmark LVQA datasets: EgoSchema, IntentQA, NExT-QA.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiawei Wang, Liping Yuan, Yuchen Zhang, Haomiao Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating fine-grained video descriptions is a fundamental challenge in video understanding. In this work, we introduce Tarsier, a family of large-scale video-language models designed to generate high-quality video descriptions. Tarsier employs CLIP-ViT to encode frames separately and then uses an LLM to model temporal relationships. Despite its simple architecture, we demonstrate that with a meticulously designed two-stage training procedure, the Tarsier models exhibit substantially stronger video description capabilities than any existing open-source model, showing a $+51.4\%$ advantage in human side-by-side evaluation over the strongest model. Additionally, they are comparable to state-of-the-art proprietary models, with a $+12.3\%$ advantage against GPT-4V and a $-6.7\%$ disadvantage against Gemini 1.5 Pro. When upgraded to Tarsier2 by building upon SigLIP and Qwen2-7B, it further improves significantly with a $+4.8\%$ advantage against GPT-4o. Besides video description, Tarsier proves to be a versatile generalist model, achieving new state-of-the-art results across nine public benchmarks, including multi-choice VQA, open-ended VQA, and zero-shot video captioning. Our second contribution is the introduction of a new benchmark -- DREAM-1K (https://tarsier-vlm.github.io/) for evaluating video description models, consisting of a new challenging dataset featuring videos from diverse sources and varying complexity, along with an automatic method specifically designed to assess the quality of fine-grained video descriptions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gabriela Csurka, Tyler L. Hayes, Diane Larlus, Riccardo Volpi</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning models are effective, yet brittle. Even carefully trained, their behavior tends to be hard to predict when confronted with out-of-distribution samples. In this work, our goal is to propose a simple yet effective solution to predict and describe via natural language potential failure modes of computer vision models. Given a pretrained model and a set of samples, our aim is to find sentences that accurately describe the visual conditions in which the model underperforms. In order to study this important topic and foster future research on it, we formalize the problem of Language-Based Error Explainability (LBEE) and propose a set of metrics to evaluate and compare different methods for this task. We propose solutions that operate in a joint vision-and-language embedding space, and can characterize through language descriptions model failures caused, e.g., by objects unseen during training or adverse visual conditions. We experiment with different tasks, such as classification under the presence of dataset bias and semantic segmentation in unseen environments, and show that the proposed methodology isolates nontrivial sentences associated with specific error causes. We hope our work will help practitioners better understand the behavior of models, increasing their overall safety and interpretability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Suncheng Xiang, Jincheng Li, Zhengjie Zhang, Shilun Cai, Jiale Guan, Dahong Qian</p>
<p>Abstract: Colonoscopic Polyp Re-Identification aims to match the same polyp from a large gallery with images from different views taken using different cameras, which plays an important role in the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer in computer-aided diagnosis. However, traditional methods for object ReID directly adopting CNN models trained on the ImageNet dataset usually produce unsatisfactory retrieval performance on colonoscopic datasets due to the large domain gap. Worsely, these solutions typically learn unimodal modal representations on the basis of visual samples, which fails to explore complementary information from other different modalities. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Deep Multimodal Collaborative Learning framework named DMCL for polyp re-identification, which can effectively encourage modality collaboration and reinforce generalization capability in medical scenarios. On the basis of it, a dynamic multimodal feature fusion strategy is introduced to leverage the optimized multimodal representations for multimodal fusion via end-to-end training. Experiments on the standard benchmarks show the benefits of the multimodal setting over state-of-the-art unimodal ReID models, especially when combined with the specialized multimodal fusion strategy, from which we have proved that learning representation with multiple-modality can be competitive to methods based on unimodal representation learning. We also hope that our method will shed light on some related researches to move forward, especially for multimodal collaborative learning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaokun Sun, Zhenyu Zhang, Ying Tai, Qian Wang, Hao Tang, Zili Yi, Jian Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in text-guided 3D avatar generation have made substantial progress by distilling knowledge from diffusion models. Despite the plausible generated appearance, existing methods cannot achieve fine-grained disentanglement or high-fidelity modeling between inner body and outfit. In this paper, we propose Barbie, a novel framework for generating 3D avatars that can be dressed in diverse and high-quality Barbie-like garments and accessories. Instead of relying on a holistic model, Barbie achieves fine-grained disentanglement on avatars by semantic-aligned separated models for human body and outfits. These disentangled 3D representations are then optimized by different expert models to guarantee the domain-specific fidelity. To balance geometry diversity and reasonableness, we propose a series of losses for template-preserving and human-prior evolving. The final avatar is enhanced by unified texture refinement for superior texture consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Barbie outperforms existing methods in both dressed human and outfit generation, supporting flexible apparel combination and animation. The code will be released for research purposes. Our project page is: https://xiaokunsun.github.io/Barbie.github.io/.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06590">Lightweight single-image super-resolution network based on dual paths</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Li Ke, Liu Yukai</p>
<p>Abstract: The single image super-resolution(SISR) algorithms under deep learning currently have two main models, one based on convolutional neural networks and the other based on Transformer. The former uses the stacking of convolutional layers with different convolutional kernel sizes to design the model, which enables the model to better extract the local features of the image; the latter uses the self-attention mechanism to design the model, which allows the model to establish long-distance dependencies between image pixel points through the self-attention mechanism and then better extract the global features of the image. However, both of the above methods face their problems. Based on this, this paper proposes a new lightweight multi-scale feature fusion network model based on two-way complementary convolutional and Transformer, which integrates the respective features of Transformer and convolutional neural networks through a two-branch network architecture, to realize the mutual fusion of global and local information. Meanwhile, considering the partial loss of information caused by the low-pixel images trained by the deep neural network, this paper designs a modular connection method of multi-stage feature supplementation to fuse the feature maps extracted from the shallow stage of the model with those extracted from the deep stage of the model, to minimize the loss of the information in the feature images that is beneficial to the image restoration as much as possible, to facilitate the obtaining of a higher-quality restored image. The practical results finally show that the model proposed in this paper is optimal in image recovery performance when compared with other lightweight models with the same amount of parameters.</p>

<p>Abstract: Traditional fish farming practices often lead to inefficient feeding, resulting in environmental issues and reduced productivity. We developed an innovative system combining computer vision and IoT technologies for precise Tilapia feeding. Our solution uses real-time IoT sensors to monitor water quality parameters and computer vision algorithms to analyze fish size and count, determining optimal feed amounts. A mobile app enables remote monitoring and control. We utilized YOLOv8 for keypoint detection to measure Tilapia weight from length, achieving \textbf{94\%} precision on 3,500 annotated images. Pixel-based measurements were converted to centimeters using depth estimation for accurate feeding calculations. Our method, with data collection mirroring inference conditions, significantly improved results. Preliminary estimates suggest this approach could increase production up to 58 times compared to traditional farms.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiyi Tao, Zhuoyue Wang, Hang Zhang, Lun Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The success of Vision Language Models (VLMs) on various vision-language tasks heavily relies on pre-training with large scale web-crawled datasets. However, the noisy and incomplete nature of web data makes dataset scale crucial for performance, rendering end-to-end training increasingly prohibitive. In this paper, we propose NEVLP, a noise-robust framework for efficient vision-language pre-training that requires less pre-training data. Specifically, we bridge the modality gap between a frozen image encoder and a large language model with a transformer and introduce two innovative learning strategies: noise-adaptive learning and concept-enhanced learning to mitigate the impact of noise. In noise-adaptive learning, we estimate the noise probability of each image-text pair based on the transformer's memorization effect and employ noise-adaptive regularization on image-text contrastive learning to condition cross-modal alignment. In concept-enhanced learning, we enrich incomplete text by incorporating visual concepts (objects in the image) to provide prior information about existing objects for image-text matching and image-grounded text generation, thereby mitigating text incompletion. Our framework effectively utilizes noisy web data and achieves state-of-the-art performance with less pre-training data across a wide range of vision-language tasks, including image-text retrieval, image captioning, and visual question answering.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a novel framework for large-scale scene reconstruction based on 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) and aims to address the scalability and accuracy challenges faced by existing methods. For tackling the scalability issue, we split the large scene into multiple cells, and the candidate point-cloud and camera views of each cell are correlated through a visibility-based camera selection and a progressive point-cloud extension. To reinforce the rendering quality, three highlighted improvements are made in comparison with vanilla 3DGS, which are a strategy of the ray-Gaussian intersection and the novel Gaussians density control for learning efficiency, an appearance decoupling module based on ConvKAN network to solve uneven lighting conditions in large-scale scenes, and a refined final loss with the color loss, the depth distortion loss, and the normal consistency loss. Finally, the seamless stitching procedure is executed to merge the individual Gaussian radiance field for novel view synthesis across different cells. Evaluation of Mill19, Urban3D, and MatrixCity datasets shows that our method consistently generates more high-fidelity rendering results than state-of-the-art methods of large-scale scene reconstruction. We further validate the generalizability of the proposed approach by rendering on self-collected video clips recorded by a commercial drone.</p>

<p>Abstract: Currently, the rapid development of computer vision and deep learning has enabled the creation or manipulation of high-fidelity facial images and videos via deep generative approaches. This technology, also known as deepfake, has achieved dramatic progress and become increasingly popular in social media. However, the technology can generate threats to personal privacy and national security by spreading misinformation. To diminish the risks of deepfake, it is desirable to develop powerful forgery detection methods to distinguish fake faces from real faces. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of recent deep learning-based approaches for facial forgery detection. We attempt to provide the reader with a deeper understanding of the current advances as well as the major challenges for deepfake detection based on deep learning. We present an overview of deepfake techniques and analyse the characteristics of various deepfake datasets. We then provide a systematic review of different categories of deepfake detection and state-of-the-art deepfake detection methods. The drawbacks of existing detection methods are analyzed, and future research directions are discussed to address the challenges in improving both the performance and generalization of deepfake detection.</p>

<p>Abstract: Although current Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate promising results in video understanding, processing extremely long videos remains an ongoing challenge. Typically, MLLMs struggle with handling thousands of tokens that exceed the maximum context length of LLMs, and they experience reduced visual clarity due to token aggregation. Another challenge is the high computational cost stemming from the large number of video tokens. To tackle these issues, we propose Video-XL, an extra-long vision language model designed for efficient hour-scale video understanding. Specifically, we argue that LLMs can be adapted as effective visual condensers and introduce Visual Context Latent Summarization, which condenses visual contexts into highly compact forms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves promising results on popular long video understanding benchmarks, despite being trained on limited image data. Moreover, Video-XL strikes a promising balance between efficiency and effectiveness, processing 1024 frames on a single 80GB GPU while achieving nearly 100\% accuracy in the Needle-in-a-Haystack evaluation. We envision Video-XL becoming a valuable tool for long video applications such as video summarization, surveillance anomaly detection, and Ad placement identification.</p>

<p>Abstract: Arbitrary artistic style transfer is a research area that combines rational academic study with emotive artistic creation. It aims to create a new image from a content image according to a target artistic style, maintaining the content's textural structural information while incorporating the artistic characteristics of the style image. However, existing style transfer methods often significantly damage the texture lines of the content image during the style transformation. To address these issues, we propose affinity-enhanced attentional network, which include the content affinity-enhanced attention (CAEA) module, the style affinity-enhanced attention (SAEA) module, and the hybrid attention (HA) module. The CAEA and SAEA modules first use attention to enhance content and style representations, followed by a detail enhanced (DE) module to reinforce detail features. The hybrid attention module adjusts the style feature distribution based on the content feature distribution. We also introduce the local dissimilarity loss based on affinity attention, which better preserves the affinity with content and style images. Experiments demonstrate that our work achieves better results in arbitrary style transfer than other state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dasol Choi, Dongbin Na</p>
<p>Abstract: With the explosive growth of deep learning applications, the right to be forgotten has become increasingly in demand in various AI industries. For example, given a facial recognition system, some individuals may wish to remove images that might have been used in the training phase from the trained model. Unfortunately, modern deep neural networks sometimes unexpectedly leak personal identities. Recent studies have presented various machine unlearning algorithms to make a trained model unlearn the data to be forgotten. While these methods generally perform well in terms of forgetting scores, we have found that an unexpected modelutility drop can occur. This phenomenon, which we term correlation collapse, happens when the machine unlearning algorithms reduce the useful correlation between image features and the true label. To address this challenge, we propose Distribution-Level Feature Distancing (DLFD), a novel method that efficiently forgets instances while preventing correlation collapse. Our method synthesizes data samples so that the generated data distribution is far from the distribution of samples being forgotten in the feature space, achieving effective results within a single training epoch. Through extensive experiments on facial recognition datasets, we demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art machine unlearning methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minseung Lee, Seokha Moon, Seung Joon Lee, Jinkyu Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurately detecting objects at long distances remains a critical challenge in 3D object detection when relying solely on LiDAR sensors due to the inherent limitations of data sparsity. To address this issue, we propose the LiDAR-Camera Augmentation Network (LCANet), a novel framework that reconstructs LiDAR point cloud data by fusing 2D image features, which contain rich semantic information, generating additional points to improve detection accuracy. LCANet fuses data from LiDAR sensors and cameras by projecting image features into the 3D space, integrating semantic information into the point cloud data. This fused data is then encoded to produce 3D features that contain both semantic and spatial information, which are further refined to reconstruct final points before bounding box prediction. This fusion effectively compensates for LiDAR's weakness in detecting objects at long distances, which are often represented by sparse points. Additionally, due to the sparsity of many objects in the original dataset, which makes effective supervision for point generation challenging, we employ a point cloud completion network to create a complete point cloud dataset that supervises the generation of dense point clouds in our network. Extensive experiments on the KITTI and Waymo datasets demonstrate that LCANet significantly outperforms existing models, particularly in detecting sparse and distant objects.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingyang Zhang, Jingkang Yang, Pengyun Wang, Haoqi Wang, Yueqian Lin, Haoran Zhang, Yiyou Sun, Xuefeng Du, Yixuan Li, Ziwei Liu, Yiran Chen, Hai Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is critical for the reliable operation of open-world intelligent systems. Despite the emergence of an increasing number of OOD detection methods, the evaluation inconsistencies present challenges for tracking the progress in this field. OpenOOD v1 initiated the unification of the OOD detection evaluation but faced limitations in scalability and usability. In response, this paper presents OpenOOD v1.5, a significant improvement from its predecessor that ensures accurate, standardized, and user-friendly evaluation of OOD detection methodologies. Notably, OpenOOD v1.5 extends its evaluation capabilities to large-scale datasets such as ImageNet, investigates full-spectrum OOD detection which is important yet underexplored, and introduces new features including an online leaderboard and an easy-to-use evaluator. This work also contributes in-depth analysis and insights derived from comprehensive experimental results, thereby enriching the knowledge pool of OOD detection methodologies. With these enhancements, OpenOOD v1.5 aims to drive advancements and offer a more robust and comprehensive evaluation benchmark for OOD detection research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lingchen Sun, Jie Liang, Shuaizheng Liu, Hongwei Yong, Lei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: High perceptual quality and low distortion degree are two important goals in image restoration tasks such as super-resolution (SR). Most of the existing SR methods aim to achieve these goals by minimizing the corresponding yet conflicting losses, such as the $\ell_1$ loss and the adversarial loss. Unfortunately, the commonly used gradient-based optimizers, such as Adam, are hard to balance these objectives due to the opposite gradient decent directions of the contradictory losses. In this paper, we formulate the perception-distortion trade-off in SR as a multi-objective optimization problem and develop a new optimizer by integrating the gradient-free evolutionary algorithm (EA) with gradient-based Adam, where EA and Adam focus on the divergence and convergence of the optimization directions respectively. As a result, a population of optimal models with different perception-distortion preferences is obtained. We then design a fusion network to merge these models into a single stronger one for an effective perception-distortion trade-off. Experiments demonstrate that with the same backbone network, the perception-distortion balanced SR model trained by our method can achieve better perceptual quality than its competitors while attaining better reconstruction fidelity.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiacheng Ruan, Jingsheng Gao, Mingye Xie, Suncheng Xiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, Visual Transformer (ViT) has been extensively used in medical image segmentation (MIS) due to applying self-attention mechanism in the spatial domain to modeling global knowledge. However, many studies have focused on improving models in the spatial domain while neglecting the importance of frequency domain information. Therefore, we propose Multi-axis External Weights UNet (MEW-UNet) based on the U-shape architecture by replacing self-attention in ViT with our Multi-axis External Weights block. Specifically, our block performs a Fourier transform on the three axes of the input features and assigns the external weight in the frequency domain, which is generated by our External Weights Generator. Then, an inverse Fourier transform is performed to change the features back to the spatial domain. We evaluate our model on four datasets, including Synapse, ACDC, ISIC17 and ISIC18 datasets, and our approach demonstrates competitive performance, owing to its effective utilization of frequency domain information.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhongsen Li, Wenxuan Chen, Shuai Wang, Chuyu Liu, Qing Zou, Rui Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The inductive bias of the convolutional neural network (CNN) can be a strong prior for image restoration, which is known as the Deep Image Prior (DIP). Recently, DIP is utilized in unsupervised dynamic MRI reconstruction, which adopts a generative model from the latent space to the image space. However, existing methods usually use a pyramid-shaped CNN generator shared by all frames, embedding the temporal modeling within the latent space, which may hamper the model expression capability. In this work, we propose a novel scheme for dynamic MRI representation, named ``Graph Image Prior'' (GIP). GIP adopts a two-stage generative network in a new modeling methodology, which first employs independent CNNs to recover the image structure for each frame, and then exploits the spatio-temporal correlations within the feature space parameterized by a graph model. A graph convolutional network is utilized for feature fusion and dynamic image generation. In addition, we devise an ADMM algorithm to alternately optimize the images and the network parameters to improve the reconstruction performance. Experiments were conducted on cardiac cine MRI reconstruction, which demonstrate that GIP outperforms compressed sensing methods and other DIP-based unsupervised methods, significantly reducing the performance gap with state-of-the-art supervised algorithms. Moreover, GIP displays superior generalization ability when transferred to a different reconstruction setting, without the need for any additional data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziheng Deng, Hua Chen, Yongzheng Zhou, Haibo Hu, Zhiyong Xu, Jiayuan Sun, Tianling Lyu, Yan Xi, Yang Chen, Jun Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Four-dimensional cone-beam computed tomography (4D CBCT) provides respiration-resolved images and can be used for image-guided radiation therapy. However, the ability to reveal respiratory motion comes at the cost of image artifacts. As raw projection data are sorted into multiple respiratory phases, the cone-beam projections become much sparser and the reconstructed 4D CBCT images will be covered by severe streak artifacts. Although several deep learning-based methods have been proposed to address this issue, most algorithms employ 2D network models as backbones, neglecting the intrinsic structural priors within 4D CBCT images. In this paper, we first explore the origin and appearance of streak artifacts in 4D CBCT images. We find that streak artifacts exhibit a unique rotational motion along with the patient's respiration, distinguishable from diaphragm-driven respiratory motion in the spatiotemporal domain. Therefore, we propose a novel 4D neural network model, RSTAR4D-Net, designed to address Rotational STreak Artifact Reduction by integrating the spatial and temporal information within 4D CBCT images. Specifically, we overcome the computational and training difficulties of a 4D neural network. The specially designed model adopts an efficient implementation of 4D convolutions to reduce computational costs and thus can process the whole 4D image in one pass. Additionally, a Tetris training strategy pertinent to the separable 4D convolutions is proposed to effectively train the model using limited 4D training samples. Extensive experiments substantiate the effectiveness of our proposed method, and the RSTAR4D-Net shows superior performance compared to other methods.

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19097">A study of why we need to reassess full reference image quality assessment with medical images</a></h1>

<p>Abstract: Image quality assessment (IQA) is not just indispensable in clinical practice to ensure high standards, but also in the development stage of novel algorithms that operate on medical images with reference data. This paper provides a structured and comprehensive collection of examples where the two most common full reference (FR) image quality measures prove to be unsuitable for the assessment of novel algorithms using different kinds of medical images, including real-world MRI, CT, OCT, X-Ray, digital pathology and photoacoustic imaging data. In particular, the FR-IQA measures PSNR and SSIM are known and tested for working successfully in many natural imaging tasks, but discrepancies in medical scenarios have been noted in the literature. Inconsistencies arising in medical images are not surprising, as they have very different properties than natural images which have not been targeted nor tested in the development of the mentioned measures, and therefore might imply wrong judgement of novel methods for medical images. Therefore, improvement is urgently needed in particular in this era of AI to increase explainability, reproducibility and generalizability in machine learning for medical imaging and beyond. On top of the pitfalls we will provide ideas for future research as well as suggesting guidelines for the usage of FR-IQA measures applied to medical images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yosuke Yamagishi, Shouhei Hanaoka, Tomohiro Kikuchi, Takahiro Nakao, Yuta Nakamura, Yukihiro Nomura, Soichiro Miki, Takeharu Yoshikawa, Osamu Abe</p>
<p>Abstract: Objectives: To evaluate the zero-shot performance of Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) in 3D segmentation of abdominal organs in CT scans, and to investigate the effects of prompt settings on segmentation results.
  Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study, we used a subset of the TotalSegmentator CT dataset from eight institutions to assess SAM 2's ability to segment eight abdominal organs. Segmentation was initiated from three different z-coordinate levels (caudal, mid, and cranial levels) of each organ. Performance was measured using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC). We also analyzed the impact of "negative prompts," which explicitly exclude certain regions from the segmentation process, on accuracy.
  Results: 123 patients (mean age, 60.7 \pm 15.5 years; 63 men, 60 women) were evaluated. As a zero-shot approach, larger organs with clear boundaries demonstrated high segmentation performance, with mean DSCs as follows: liver 0.821 \pm 0.192, right kidney 0.862 \pm 0.212, left kidney 0.870 \pm 0.154, and spleen 0.891 \pm 0.131. Smaller organs showed lower performance: gallbladder 0.531 \pm 0.291, pancreas 0.361 \pm 0.197, and adrenal glands, right 0.203 \pm 0.222, left 0.308 \pm 0.234. The initial slice for segmentation and the use of negative prompts significantly influenced the results. By removing negative prompts from the input, the DSCs significantly decreased for six organs.
  Conclusion: SAM 2 demonstrated promising zero-shot performance in segmenting certain abdominal organs in CT scans, particularly larger organs. Performance was significantly influenced by input negative prompts and initial slice selection, highlighting the importance of optimizing these factors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junjie Wen, Yichen Zhu, Jinming Li, Minjie Zhu, Kun Wu, Zhiyuan Xu, Ning Liu, Ran Cheng, Chaomin Shen, Yaxin Peng, Feifei Feng, Jian Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown remarkable potential in visuomotor control and instruction comprehension through end-to-end learning processes. However, current VLA models face significant challenges: they are slow during inference and require extensive pre-training on large amounts of robotic data, making real-world deployment difficult. In this paper, we introduce a new family of compact vision-language-action models, called TinyVLA, which offers two key advantages over existing VLA models: (1) faster inference speeds, and (2) improved data efficiency, eliminating the need for pre-training stage. Our framework incorporates two essential components to build TinyVLA: (1) initializing the policy backbone with robust, high-speed multimodal models, and (2) integrating a diffusion policy decoder during fine-tuning to enable precise robot actions. We conducted extensive evaluations of TinyVLA in both simulation and on real robots, demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art VLA model, OpenVLA, in terms of speed and data efficiency, while delivering comparable or superior performance. Additionally, TinyVLA exhibits strong generalization capabilities across various dimensions, including language instructions, novel objects, unseen positions, changes in object appearance, background variations, and environmental shifts, often matching or exceeding the performance of OpenVLA. We believe that \methodname offers an interesting perspective on utilizing pre-trained multimodal models for policy learning. Our project is at https://tiny-vla.github.io.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahjol Senbi, Tianyu Huang, Fei Lyu, Qing Li, Yuhui Tao, Wei Shao, Qiang Chen, Chengyan Wang, Shuo Wang, Tao Zhou, Yizhe Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: We explore the feasibility and potential of building a ground-truth-free evaluation model to assess the quality of segmentations generated by the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and its variants in medical imaging. This evaluation model estimates segmentation quality scores by analyzing the coherence and consistency between the input images and their corresponding segmentation predictions. Based on prior research, we frame the task of training this model as a regression problem within a supervised learning framework, using Dice scores (and optionally other metrics) along with mean squared error to compute the training loss. The model is trained utilizing a large collection of public datasets of medical images with segmentation predictions from SAM and its variants. We name this model EvanySeg (Evaluation of Any Segmentation in Medical Images). Our exploration of convolution-based models (e.g., ResNet) and transformer-based models (e.g., ViT) suggested that ViT yields better performance for this task. EvanySeg can be employed for various tasks, including: (1) identifying poorly segmented samples by detecting low-percentile segmentation quality scores; (2) benchmarking segmentation models without ground truth by averaging quality scores across test samples; (3) alerting human experts to poor-quality segmentation predictions during human-AI collaboration by applying a threshold within the score space; and (4) selecting the best segmentation prediction for each test sample at test time when multiple segmentation models are available, by choosing the prediction with the highest quality score. Models and code will be made available at https://github.com/ahjolsenbics/EvanySeg.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have aimed to integrate and interpret data across diverse modalities. However, the capacity of these models to concurrently process and reason about multiple modalities remains inadequately explored, partly due to the lack of comprehensive modality-wise benchmarks. We introduce OmniBench, a novel benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate models' ability to recognize, interpret, and reason across visual, acoustic, and textual inputs simultaneously. We define models capable of such tri-modal processing as omni-language models (OLMs). OmniBench is distinguished by high-quality human annotations, ensuring that accurate responses require integrated understanding and reasoning across all three modalities. Our main findings reveal that: i) most OLMs exhibit critical limitations in instruction-following and reasoning capabilities within tri-modal contexts; and ii) most baselines models perform poorly (below 50\% accuracy) even when provided with alternative textual representations of images or/and audio. These results suggest that the ability to construct a consistent context from text, image, and audio is often overlooked in existing MLLM training paradigms. We advocate for future research to focus on developing more robust tri-modal integration techniques and training strategies to enhance OLM performance across diverse modalities.
