<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengshuo Jia, Gabriela Hug, Ning Zhang, Zhaojian Wang, Yi Wang, Chongqing Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: This two-part tutorial dives into the field of data-driven power flow linearization (DPFL), a domain gaining increased attention. DPFL stands out for its higher approximation accuracy, wide adaptability, and better ability to implicitly incorporate the latest system attributes. This renders DPFL a potentially superior option for managing the significant fluctuations from renewable energy sources, a step towards realizing a more sustainable energy future, by translating the higher model accuracy into increased economic efficiency and less energy losses. To conduct a deep and rigorous reexamination, this tutorial first classifies existing DPFL methods into DPFL training algorithms and supportive techniques. Their mathematical models, analytical solutions, capabilities, limitations, and generalizability are systematically examined, discussed, and summarized. In addition, this tutorial reviews existing DPFL experiments, examining the settings of test systems, the fidelity of datasets, and the comparison made among a limited number of DPFL methods. Further, this tutorial implements extensive numerical comparisons of all existing DPFL methods (40 methods in total) and four classic physics-driven approaches, focusing on their generalizability, applicability, accuracy, and computational efficiency. Through these simulationmethodss, this tutorial aims to reveal the actual performance of all the methods (including the performances exposed to data noise or outliers), guiding the selection of appropriate linearization methods. Furthermore, this tutorial discusses future directions based on the theoretical and numerical insights gained. As the first part, this paper reexamines DPFL theories, covering all the training algorithms and supportive techniques. Capabilities, limitations, and aspects of generalizability, which were previously unmentioned in the literature, have been identified.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Subhankar Ghosh, Jayant Gupta, Arun Sharma, Shuai An, Shashi Shekhar</p>
<p>Abstract: Given a set \emph{S} of spatial feature types, its feature instances, a study area, and a neighbor relationship, the goal is to find pairs $<$a region ($r_{g}$), a subset \emph{C} of \emph{S}$>$ such that \emph{C} is a statistically significant regional-colocation pattern in $r_{g}$. This problem is important for applications in various domains including ecology, economics, and sociology. The problem is computationally challenging due to the exponential number of regional colocation patterns and candidate regions. Previously, we proposed a miner \cite{10.1145/3557989.3566158} that finds statistically significant regional colocation patterns. However, the numerous simultaneous statistical inferences raise the risk of false discoveries (also known as the multiple comparisons problem) and carry a high computational cost. We propose a novel algorithm, namely, multiple comparisons regional colocation miner (MultComp-RCM) which uses a Bonferroni correction. Theoretical analysis, experimental evaluation, and case study results show that the proposed method reduces both the false discovery rate and computational cost.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02549">Diffusion Models for Tabular Data Imputation and Synthetic Data Generation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Mario Villaiz\'an-Vallelado, Matteo Salvatori, Carlos Segura, Ioannis Arapakis</p>
<p>Abstract: Data imputation and data generation have important applications for many domains, like healthcare and finance, where incomplete or missing data can hinder accurate analysis and decision-making. Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative models capable of capturing complex data distributions across various data modalities such as image, audio, and time series data. Recently, they have been also adapted to generate tabular data. In this paper, we propose a diffusion model for tabular data that introduces three key enhancements: (1) a conditioning attention mechanism, (2) an encoder-decoder transformer as the denoising network, and (3) dynamic masking. The conditioning attention mechanism is designed to improve the model's ability to capture the relationship between the condition and synthetic data. The transformer layers help model interactions within the condition (encoder) or synthetic data (decoder), while dynamic masking enables our model to efficiently handle both missing data imputation and synthetic data generation tasks within a unified framework. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation by comparing the performance of diffusion models with transformer conditioning against state-of-the-art techniques, such as Variational Autoencoders, Generative Adversarial Networks and Diffusion Models, on benchmark datasets. Our evaluation focuses on the assessment of the generated samples with respect to three important criteria, namely: (1) Machine Learning efficiency, (2) statistical similarity, and (3) privacy risk mitigation. For the task of data imputation, we consider the efficiency of the generated samples across different levels of missing features.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenjing Chen, Victoria G. Crawford</p>
<p>Abstract: Submodular optimization with bandit feedback has recently been studied in a variety of contexts. In a number of real-world applications such as diversified recommender systems and data summarization, the submodular function exhibits additional linear structure. We consider developing approximation algorithms for the maximization of a submodular objective function $f:2^U\to\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$, where $f=\sum_{i=1}^dw_iF_{i}$. It is assumed that we have value oracle access to the functions $F_i$, but the coefficients $w_i$ are unknown, and $f$ can only be accessed via noisy queries. We develop algorithms for this setting inspired by adaptive allocation algorithms in the best-arm identification for linear bandit, with approximation guarantees arbitrarily close to the setting where we have value oracle access to $f$. Finally, we empirically demonstrate that our algorithms make vast improvements in terms of sample efficiency compared to algorithms that do not exploit the linear structure of $f$ on instances of move recommendation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bokun Wang, Axel Berg, Durmus Alp Emre Acar, Chuteng Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent work has shown that 8-bit floating point (FP8) can be used for efficiently training neural networks with reduced computational overhead compared to training in FP32/FP16. In this work, we investigate the use of FP8 training in a federated learning context. This brings not only the usual benefits of FP8 which are desirable for on-device training at the edge, but also reduces client-server communication costs due to significant weight compression. We present a novel method for combining FP8 client training while maintaining a global FP32 server model and provide convergence analysis. Experiments with various machine learning models and datasets show that our method consistently yields communication reductions of at least 2.9x across a variety of tasks and models compared to an FP32 baseline.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02641">Learning Graph Structures and Uncertainty for Accurate and Calibrated Time-series Forecasting</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Harshavardhan Kamarthi, Lingkai Kong, Alexander Rodriguez, Chao Zhang, B Aditya Prakash</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-variate time series forecasting is an important problem with a wide range of applications. Recent works model the relations between time-series as graphs and have shown that propagating information over the relation graph can improve time series forecasting. However, in many cases, relational information is not available or is noisy and reliable. Moreover, most works ignore the underlying uncertainty of time-series both for structure learning and deriving the forecasts resulting in the structure not capturing the uncertainty resulting in forecast distributions with poor uncertainty estimates. We tackle this challenge and introduce STOIC, that leverages stochastic correlations between time-series to learn underlying structure between time-series and to provide well-calibrated and accurate forecasts. Over a wide-range of benchmark datasets STOIC provides around 16% more accurate and 14% better-calibrated forecasts.
  STOIC also shows better adaptation to noise in data during inference and captures important and useful relational information in various benchmarks.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02657">Large Scale Hierarchical Industrial Demand Time-Series Forecasting incorporating Sparsity</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Harshavardhan Kamarthi, Aditya B. Sasanur, Xinjie Tong, Xingyu Zhou, James Peters, Joe Czyzyk, B. Aditya Prakash</p>
<p>Abstract: Hierarchical time-series forecasting (HTSF) is an important problem for many real-world business applications where the goal is to simultaneously forecast multiple time-series that are related to each other via a hierarchical relation. Recent works, however, do not address two important challenges that are typically observed in many demand forecasting applications at large companies. First, many time-series at lower levels of the hierarchy have high sparsity i.e., they have a significant number of zeros. Most HTSF methods do not address this varying sparsity across the hierarchy. Further, they do not scale well to the large size of the real-world hierarchy typically unseen in benchmarks used in literature. We resolve both these challenges by proposing HAILS, a novel probabilistic hierarchical model that enables accurate and calibrated probabilistic forecasts across the hierarchy by adaptively modeling sparse and dense time-series with different distributional assumptions and reconciling them to adhere to hierarchical constraints. We show the scalability and effectiveness of our methods by evaluating them against real-world demand forecasting datasets. We deploy HAILS at a large chemical manufacturing company for a product demand forecasting application with over ten thousand products and observe a significant 8.5\% improvement in forecast accuracy and 23% better improvement for sparse time-series. The enhanced accuracy and scalability make HAILS a valuable tool for improved business planning and customer experience.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02681">Uniform Transformation: Refining Latent Representation in Variational Autoencoders</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ye Shi, C. S. George Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Irregular distribution in latent space causes posterior collapse, misalignment between posterior and prior, and ill-sampling problem in Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). In this paper, we introduce a novel adaptable three-stage Uniform Transformation (UT) module -- Gaussian Kernel Density Estimation (G-KDE) clustering, non-parametric Gaussian Mixture (GM) Modeling, and Probability Integral Transform (PIT) -- to address irregular latent distributions. By reconfiguring irregular distributions into a uniform distribution in the latent space, our approach significantly enhances the disentanglement and interpretability of latent representations, overcoming the limitation of traditional VAE models in capturing complex data structures. Empirical evaluations demonstrated the efficacy of our proposed UT module in improving disentanglement metrics across benchmark datasets -- dSprites and MNIST. Our findings suggest a promising direction for advancing representation learning techniques, with implication for future research in extending this framework to more sophisticated datasets and downstream tasks.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02687">No Training, No Problem: Rethinking Classifier-Free Guidance for Diffusion Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Seyedmorteza Sadat, Manuel Kansy, Otmar Hilliges, Romann M. Weber</p>
<p>Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) has become the standard method for enhancing the quality of conditional diffusion models. However, employing CFG requires either training an unconditional model alongside the main diffusion model or modifying the training procedure by periodically inserting a null condition. There is also no clear extension of CFG to unconditional models. In this paper, we revisit the core principles of CFG and introduce a new method, independent condition guidance (ICG), which provides the benefits of CFG without the need for any special training procedures. Our approach streamlines the training process of conditional diffusion models and can also be applied during inference on any pre-trained conditional model. Additionally, by leveraging the time-step information encoded in all diffusion networks, we propose an extension of CFG, called time-step guidance (TSG), which can be applied to any diffusion model, including unconditional ones. Our guidance techniques are easy to implement and have the same sampling cost as CFG. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that ICG matches the performance of standard CFG across various conditional diffusion models. Moreover, we show that TSG improves generation quality in a manner similar to CFG, without relying on any conditional information.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02689">Accelerating Distributed Optimization: A Primal-Dual Perspective on Local Steps</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Junchi Yang, Murat Yildirim, Qiu Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: In distributed machine learning, efficient training across multiple agents with different data distributions poses significant challenges. Even with a centralized coordinator, current algorithms that achieve optimal communication complexity typically require either large minibatches or compromise on gradient complexity. In this work, we tackle both centralized and decentralized settings across strongly convex, convex, and nonconvex objectives. We first demonstrate that a basic primal-dual method, (Accelerated) Gradient Ascent Multiple Stochastic Gradient Descent (GA-MSGD), applied to the Lagrangian of distributed optimization inherently incorporates local updates, because the inner loops of running Stochastic Gradient Descent on the primal variable require no inter-agent communication. Notably, for strongly convex objectives, we show (Accelerated) GA-MSGD achieves linear convergence in communication rounds despite the Lagrangian being only linear in the dual variables. This is due to a unique structural property where the dual variable is confined to the span of the coupling matrix, rendering the dual problem strongly concave. When integrated with the Catalyst framework, our approach achieves nearly optimal communication complexity across various settings without the need for minibatches. Moreover, in stochastic decentralized problems, it attains communication complexities comparable to those in deterministic settings, improving over existing algorithms.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02694">LLM-Select: Feature Selection with Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel P. Jeong, Zachary C. Lipton, Pradeep Ravikumar</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate a surprising capability of large language models (LLMs): given only input feature names and a description of a prediction task, they are capable of selecting the most predictive features, with performance rivaling the standard tools of data science. Remarkably, these models exhibit this capacity across various query mechanisms. For example, we zero-shot prompt an LLM to output a numerical importance score for a feature (e.g., "blood pressure") in predicting an outcome of interest (e.g., "heart failure"), with no additional context. In particular, we find that the latest models, such as GPT-4, can consistently identify the most predictive features regardless of the query mechanism and across various prompting strategies. We illustrate these findings through extensive experiments on real-world data, where we show that LLM-based feature selection consistently achieves strong performance competitive with data-driven methods such as the LASSO, despite never having looked at the downstream training data. Our findings suggest that LLMs may be useful not only for selecting the best features for training but also for deciding which features to collect in the first place. This could potentially benefit practitioners in domains like healthcare, where collecting high-quality data comes at a high cost.</p>

<p>Abstract: Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) offer probability distributions for model parameters, enabling uncertainty quantification in predictions. However, they often underperform compared to deterministic neural networks. Utilizing mutual learning can effectively enhance the performance of peer BNNs. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to improve BNNs performance through deep mutual learning. The proposed approaches aim to increase diversity in both network parameter distributions and feature distributions, promoting peer networks to acquire distinct features that capture different characteristics of the input, which enhances the effectiveness of mutual learning. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in the classification accuracy, negative log-likelihood, and expected calibration error when compared to traditional mutual learning for BNNs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Deepak Ravikumar, Efstathia Soufleri, Kaushik Roy</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we explore the properties of loss curvature with respect to input data in deep neural networks. Curvature of loss with respect to input (termed input loss curvature) is the trace of the Hessian of the loss with respect to the input. We investigate how input loss curvature varies between train and test sets, and its implications for train-test distinguishability. We develop a theoretical framework that derives an upper bound on the train-test distinguishability based on privacy and the size of the training set. This novel insight fuels the development of a new black box membership inference attack utilizing input loss curvature. We validate our theoretical findings through experiments in computer vision classification tasks, demonstrating that input loss curvature surpasses existing methods in membership inference effectiveness. Our analysis highlights how the performance of membership inference attack (MIA) methods varies with the size of the training set, showing that curvature-based MIA outperforms other methods on sufficiently large datasets. This condition is often met by real datasets, as demonstrated by our results on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet. These findings not only advance our understanding of deep neural network behavior but also improve the ability to test privacy-preserving techniques in machine learning.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02758">Differential Encoding for Improved Representation Learning over Graphs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Haimin Zhang, Jiahao Xia, Min Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Combining the message-passing paradigm with the global attention mechanism has emerged as an effective framework for learning over graphs. The message-passing paradigm and the global attention mechanism fundamentally generate node embeddings based on information aggregated from a node's local neighborhood or from the whole graph. The most basic and commonly used aggregation approach is to take the sum of information from a node's local neighbourhood or from the whole graph. However, it is unknown if the dominant information is from a node itself or from the node's neighbours (or the rest of the graph nodes). Therefore, there exists information lost at each layer of embedding generation, and this information lost could be accumulated and become more serious when more layers are used in the model. In this paper, we present a differential encoding method to address the issue of information lost. The idea of our method is to encode the differential representation between the information from a node's neighbours (or the rest of the graph nodes) and that from the node itself. The obtained differential encoding is then combined with the original aggregated local or global representation to generate the updated node embedding. By integrating differential encodings, the representational ability of generated node embeddings is improved. The differential encoding method is empirically evaluated on different graph tasks on seven benchmark datasets. The results show that it is a general method that improves the message-passing update and the global attention update, advancing the state-of-the-art performance for graph representation learning on these datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yushan Zhu, Wen Zhang, Yajing Xu, Zhen Yao, Mingyang Chen, Huajun Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Network (GNN), with the main idea of encoding graph structure information of graphs by propagation and aggregation, has developed rapidly. It achieved excellent performance in representation learning of multiple types of graphs such as homogeneous graphs, heterogeneous graphs, and more complex graphs like knowledge graphs. However, merely stacking GNN layers may not improve the model's performance and can even be detrimental. For the phenomenon of performance degradation in deep GNNs, we propose a new perspective. Unlike the popular explanations of over-smoothing or over-squashing, we think the issue arises from the interference of low-quality node representations during message propagation. We introduce a simple and general method, SF-GNN, to address this problem. In SF-GNN, we define two representations for each node, one is the node representation that represents the feature of the node itself, and the other is the message representation specifically for propagating messages to neighbor nodes. A self-filter module evaluates the quality of the node representation and decides whether to integrate it into the message propagation based on this quality assessment. Experiments on node classification tasks for both homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs, as well as link prediction tasks on knowledge graphs, demonstrate that our method can be applied to various GNN models and outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods in addressing deep GNN degradation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) bear promise as a fast and accurate material modeling paradigm for evaluation, analysis, and design. Their vast number of trainable parameters necessitates a wealth of data to achieve accuracy and mitigate overfitting. However, experimental measurements are often limited and costly to obtain in sufficient quantities for finetuning. To this end, we present a physics-based training pipeline that tackles the pathology of data scarcity. The core enabler is a physics-based modeling framework that generates a multitude of synthetic data to align the LLM to a physically consistent initial state before finetuning. Our framework features a two-phase training strategy: (1) utilizing the large-in-amount while less accurate synthetic data for supervised pretraining, and (2) finetuning the phase-1 model with limited experimental data. We empirically demonstrate that supervised pretraining is vital to obtaining accurate finetuned LLMs, via the lens of learning polymer flammability metrics where cone calorimeter data is sparse.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiqi Bu, Shiyun Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose the generalized Newton's method (GeN) -- a Hessian-informed approach that applies to any optimizer such as SGD and Adam, and covers the Newton-Raphson method as a sub-case. Our method automatically and dynamically selects the learning rate that accelerates the convergence, without the intensive tuning of the learning rate scheduler. In practice, out method is easily implementable, since it only requires additional forward passes with almost zero computational overhead (in terms of training time and memory cost), if the overhead is amortized over many iterations. We present extensive experiments on language and vision tasks (e.g. GPT and ResNet) to showcase that GeN optimizers match the state-of-the-art performance, which was achieved with carefully tuned learning rate schedulers.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Meiyu Zhong, Ravi Tandon</p>
<p>Abstract: Certifiable robustness gives the guarantee that small perturbations around an input to a classifier will not change the prediction. There are two approaches to provide certifiable robustness to adversarial examples: a) explicitly training classifiers with small Lipschitz constants, and b) Randomized smoothing, which adds random noise to the input to create a smooth classifier. We propose \textit{SPLITZ}, a practical and novel approach which leverages the synergistic benefits of both the above ideas into a single framework. Our main idea is to \textit{split} a classifier into two halves, constrain the Lipschitz constant of the first half, and smooth the second half via randomization. Motivation for \textit{SPLITZ} comes from the observation that many standard deep networks exhibit heterogeneity in Lipschitz constants across layers. \textit{SPLITZ} can exploit this heterogeneity while inheriting the scalability of randomized smoothing. We present a principled approach to train \textit{SPLITZ} and provide theoretical analysis to derive certified robustness guarantees during inference. We present a comprehensive comparison of robustness-accuracy tradeoffs and show that \textit{SPLITZ} consistently improves upon existing state-of-the-art approaches on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. For instance, with $\ell_2$ norm perturbation budget of \textbf{$\epsilon=1$}, \textit{SPLITZ} achieves $\textbf{43.2\%}$ top-1 test accuracy on CIFAR-10 dataset compared to state-of-art top-1 test accuracy $\textbf{39.8\%}</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Negin Ashrafi, Armin Abdollahi, Greg Placencia, Maryam Pishgar</p>
<p>Abstract: Predicting critical health outcomes such as patient mortality and hospital readmission is essential for improving survivability. However, healthcare datasets have many concurrences that create complexities, leading to poor predictions. Consequently, pre-processing the data is crucial to improve its quality. In this study, we use an existing pre-processing algorithm, concatenation, to improve data quality by decreasing the complexity of datasets. Sixteen healthcare datasets were extracted from two databases - MIMIC III and University of Illinois Hospital - converted to the event logs, they were then fed into the concatenation algorithm. The pre-processed event logs were then fed to the Split Miner (SM) algorithm to produce a process model. Process model quality was evaluated before and after concatenation using the following metrics: fitness, precision, F-Measure, and complexity. The pre-processed event logs were also used as inputs to the Decay Replay Mining (DREAM) algorithm to predict critical outcomes. We compared predicted results before and after applying the concatenation algorithm using Area Under the Curve (AUC) and Confidence Intervals (CI). Results indicated that the concatenation algorithm improved the quality of the process models and predictions of the critical health outcomes.</p>

However, there is little research on Representation learning with CGAN for causal inference. This paper proposes a new method for finding representation learning functions by adopting the adversarial idea.

The theoretical result shows that when two distributions are balanced, the ideal representation function can be found and thus can be used to further research.</p>

<p>Abstract: Optimization algorithms is crucial in training physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), unsuitable methods may lead to poor solutions. Compared to the common gradient descent algorithm, implicit gradient descent (IGD) outperforms it in handling some multi-scale problems. In this paper, we provide convergence analysis for the implicit gradient descent for training over-parametrized two-layer PINNs. We first demonstrate the positive definiteness of Gram matrices for general smooth activation functions, like sigmoidal function, softplus function, tanh function and so on. Then the over-parameterization allows us to show that the randomly initialized IGD converges a globally optimal solution at a linear convergence rate. Moreover, due to the different training dynamics, the learning rate of IGD can be chosen independent of the sample size and the least eigenvalue of the Gram matrix.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adrian Pekar, Richard Jozsa</p>
<p>Abstract: This study investigates the efficacy of machine learning models, specifically Random Forest, in anomaly detection systems when trained on complete flow records and tested on partial flow data. We explore the performance disparity that arises when models are applied to incomplete data typical in real-world, real-time network environments. Our findings demonstrate a significant decline in model performance, with precision and recall dropping by up to 30\% under certain conditions when models trained on complete flows are tested against partial flows. Conversely, models trained and tested on consistently complete or partial datasets maintain robustness, highlighting the importance of dataset consistency in training. The study reveals that a minimum of 7 packets in the test set is required for maintaining reliable detection rates. These results underscore the need for tailored training strategies that can effectively adapt to the dynamics of partial data, enhancing the practical applicability of anomaly detection systems in operational settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the space sector, due to environmental conditions and restricted accessibility, robust fault detection methods are imperative for ensuring mission success and safeguarding valuable assets. This work proposes a novel approach leveraging Physics-Informed Real NVP neural networks, renowned for their ability to model complex and high-dimensional distributions, augmented with a self-supervised task based on sensors' data permutation. It focuses on enhancing fault detection within the satellite multivariate time series. The experiments involve various configurations, including pre-training with self-supervision, multi-task learning, and standalone self-supervised training. Results indicate significant performance improvements across all settings. In particular, employing only the self-supervised loss yields the best overall results, suggesting its efficacy in guiding the network to extract relevant features for fault detection. This study presents a promising direction for improving fault detection in space systems and warrants further exploration in other datasets and applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Noam Koren, Abigail Goldsteen, Ariel Farkash, Guy Amit</p>
<p>Abstract: Analyzing time-series data that may contain personal information, particularly in the medical field, presents serious privacy concerns. Sensitive health data from patients is often used to train machine-learning models for diagnostics and ongoing care. Assessing the privacy risk of such models is crucial to making knowledgeable decisions on whether to use a model in production, share it with third parties, or deploy it in patients homes. Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) are a key method for this kind of evaluation, however time-series prediction models have not been thoroughly studied in this context. We explore existing MIA techniques on time-series models, and introduce new features, focusing on the seasonality and trend components of the data. Seasonality is estimated using a multivariate Fourier transform, and a low-degree polynomial is used to approximate trends. We applied these techniques to various types of time-series models, using datasets from the health domain. Our results demonstrate that these new features enhance the effectiveness of MIAs in identifying membership, improving the understanding of privacy risks in medical data applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Frederic Z. Zhang, Paul Albert, Cristian Rodriguez-Opazo, Anton van den Hengel, Ehsan Abbasnejad</p>
<p>Abstract: Pre-trained models produce strong generic representations that can be adapted via fine-tuning. The learned weight difference relative to the pre-trained model, known as a task vector, characterises the direction and stride of fine-tuning. The significance of task vectors is such that simple arithmetic operations on them can be used to combine diverse representations from different domains. This paper builds on these properties of task vectors and aims to answer (1) whether components of task vectors, particularly parameter blocks, exhibit similar characteristics, and (2) how such blocks can be used to enhance knowledge composition and transfer. To this end, we introduce aTLAS, an algorithm that linearly combines parameter blocks with different learned coefficients, resulting in anisotropic scaling at the task vector level. We show that such linear combinations explicitly exploit the low intrinsic dimensionality of pre-trained models, with only a few coefficients being the learnable parameters. Furthermore, composition of parameter blocks leverages the already learned representations, thereby reducing the dependency on large amounts of data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in task arithmetic, few-shot recognition and test-time adaptation, with supervised or unsupervised objectives. In particular, we show that (1) learned anisotropic scaling allows task vectors to be more disentangled, causing less interference in composition; (2) task vector composition excels with scarce or no labeled data and is less prone to domain shift, thus leading to better generalisability; (3) mixing the most informative parameter blocks across different task vectors prior to training can reduce the memory footprint and improve the flexibility of knowledge transfer. Moreover, we show the potential of aTLAS as a PEFT method, particularly with less data, and demonstrate that its scalibility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yipin Guo, Zihao Li, Yilin Lang, Qinyuan Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: Operators devoid of multiplication, such as Shift and Add, have gained prominence for their compatibility with hardware. However, neural networks (NNs) employing these operators typically exhibit lower accuracy compared to conventional NNs with identical structures. ShiftAddAug uses costly multiplication to augment efficient but less powerful multiplication-free operators, improving performance without any inference overhead. It puts a ShiftAdd tiny NN into a large multiplicative model and encourages it to be trained as a sub-model to obtain additional supervision. In order to solve the weight discrepancy problem between hybrid operators, a new weight sharing method is proposed. Additionally, a novel two stage neural architecture search is used to obtain better augmentation effects for smaller but stronger multiplication-free tiny neural networks. The superiority of ShiftAddAug is validated through experiments in image classification and semantic segmentation, consistently delivering noteworthy enhancements. Remarkably, it secures up to a 4.95% increase in accuracy on the CIFAR100 compared to its directly trained counterparts, even surpassing the performance of multiplicative NNs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunjian Jia, Zhen Huang, Jiping Yan, Yulu Zhang, Kun Luo, Wanli Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: Deploying federated learning at the wireless edge introduces federated edge learning (FEEL). Given FEEL's limited communication resources and potential mislabeled data on devices, improper resource allocation or data selection can hurt convergence speed and increase training costs. Thus, to realize an efficient FEEL system, this paper emphasizes jointly optimizing resource allocation and data selection. Specifically, in this work, through rigorously modeling the training process and deriving an upper bound on FEEL's one-round convergence rate, we establish a problem of joint resource allocation and data selection, which, unfortunately, cannot be solved directly. Toward this end, we equivalently transform the original problem into a solvable form via a variable substitution and then break it into two subproblems, that is, the resource allocation problem and the data selection problem. The two subproblems are mixed-integer non-convex and integer non-convex problems, respectively, and achieving their optimal solutions is a challenging task. Based on the matching theory and applying the convex-concave procedure and gradient projection methods, we devise a low-complexity suboptimal algorithm for the two subproblems, respectively. Finally, the superiority of our proposed scheme of joint resource allocation and data selection is validated by numerical results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yipin Guo, Yilin Lang, Qinyuan Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to their large size, generative Large Language Models (LLMs) require significant computing and storage resources. This paper introduces a new post-training quantization method, GPTQT, to reduce memory usage and enhance processing speed by expressing the weight of LLM in 3bit/2bit. Practice has shown that minimizing the quantization error of weights is ineffective, leading to overfitting. Therefore, GPTQT employs a progressive two-step approach: initially quantizing weights using Linear quantization to a relatively high bit, followed by converting obtained int weight to lower bit binary coding. A re-explore strategy is proposed to optimize initial scaling factor. During inference, these steps are merged into pure binary coding, enabling efficient computation. Testing across various models and datasets confirms GPTQT's effectiveness. Compared to the strong 3-bit quantization baseline, GPTQT further reduces perplexity by 4.01 on opt-66B and increases speed by 1.24 times on opt-30b. The results on Llama2 show that GPTQT is currently the best binary coding quantization method for such kind of LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liulu He, Yufei Zhao, Rui Gao, Yuan Du, Li Du</p>
<p>Abstract: Fast convolution algorithms, including Winograd and FFT, can efficiently accelerate convolution operations in deep models. However, these algorithms depend on high-precision arithmetic to maintain inference accuracy, which conflicts with the model quantization. To resolve this conflict and further improve the efficiency of quantized convolution, we proposes SFC, a new algebra transform for fast convolution by extending the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) with symbolic computing, in which only additions are required to perform the transformation at specific transform points, avoiding the calculation of irrational number and reducing the requirement for precision. Additionally, we enhance convolution efficiency by introducing correction terms to convert invalid circular convolution outputs of the Fourier method into effective ones. The numerical error analysis is presented for the first time in this type of work and proves that our algorithms can provide a 3.68x multiplication reduction for 3x3 convolution, while the Winograd algorithm only achieves a 2.25x reduction with similarly low numerical errors. Experiments carried out on benchmarks and FPGA show that our new algorithms can further improve the computation efficiency of quantized models while maintaining accuracy, surpassing both the quantization-alone method and existing works on fast convolution quantization.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02914">The More the Merrier? Navigating Accuracy vs. Energy Efficiency Design Trade-Offs in Ensemble Learning Systems</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Rafiullah Omar, Justus Bogner, Henry Muccini, Patricia Lago, Silverio Mart\'inez-Fern\'andez, Xavier Franch</p>
<p>Abstract: Background: Machine learning (ML) model composition is a popular technique to mitigate shortcomings of a single ML model and to design more effective ML-enabled systems. While ensemble learning, i.e., forwarding the same request to several models and fusing their predictions, has been studied extensively for accuracy, we have insufficient knowledge about how to design energy-efficient ensembles. Objective: We therefore analyzed three types of design decisions for ensemble learning regarding a potential trade-off between accuracy and energy consumption: a) ensemble size, i.e., the number of models in the ensemble, b) fusion methods (majority voting vs. a meta-model), and c) partitioning methods (whole-dataset vs. subset-based training). Methods: By combining four popular ML algorithms for classification in different ensembles, we conducted a full factorial experiment with 11 ensembles x 4 datasets x 2 fusion methods x 2 partitioning methods (176 combinations). For each combination, we measured accuracy (F1-score) and energy consumption in J (for both training and inference). Results: While a larger ensemble size significantly increased energy consumption (size 2 ensembles consumed 37.49% less energy than size 3 ensembles, which in turn consumed 26.96% less energy than the size 4 ensembles), it did not significantly increase accuracy. Furthermore, majority voting outperformed meta-model fusion both in terms of accuracy (Cohen's d of 0.38) and energy consumption (Cohen's d of 0.92). Lastly, subset-based training led to significantly lower energy consumption (Cohen's d of 0.91), while training on the whole dataset did not increase accuracy significantly. Conclusions: From a Green AI perspective, we recommend designing ensembles of small size (2 or maximum 3 models), using subset-based training, majority voting, and energy-efficient ML algorithms like decision trees, Naive Bayes, or KNN.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Azim Ospanov, Jingwei Zhang, Mohammad Jalali, Xuenan Cao, Andrej Bogdanov, Farzan Farnia</p>
<p>Abstract: While standard evaluation scores for generative models are mostly reference-based, a reference-dependent assessment of generative models could be generally difficult due to the unavailability of applicable reference datasets. Recently, the reference-free entropy scores, VENDI and RKE, have been proposed to evaluate the diversity of generated data. However, estimating these scores from data leads to significant computational costs for large-scale generative models. In this work, we leverage the random Fourier features framework to reduce the computational price and propose the Fourier-based Kernel Entropy Approximation (FKEA) method. We utilize FKEA's approximated eigenspectrum of the kernel matrix to efficiently estimate the mentioned entropy scores. Furthermore, we show the application of FKEA's proxy eigenvectors to reveal the method's identified modes in evaluating the diversity of produced samples. We provide a stochastic implementation of the FKEA assessment algorithm with a complexity $O(n)$ linearly growing with sample size $n$. We extensively evaluate FKEA's numerical performance in application to standard image, text, and video datasets. Our empirical results indicate the method's scalability and interpretability applied to large-scale generative models. The codebase is available at https://github.com/aziksh-ospanov/FKEA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pedro Barbosa, Rosina Savisaar, Alcides Fonseca</p>
<p>Abstract: Black box deep learning models trained on genomic sequences excel at predicting the outcomes of different gene regulatory mechanisms. Therefore, interpreting these models may provide novel insights into the underlying biology, supporting downstream biomedical applications. Due to their complexity, interpretable surrogate models can only be built for local explanations (e.g., a single instance). However, accomplishing this requires generating a dataset in the neighborhood of the input, which must maintain syntactic similarity to the original data while introducing semantic variability in the model's predictions. This task is challenging due to the complex sequence-to-function relationship of DNA.
  We propose using Genetic Programming to generate datasets by evolving perturbations in sequences that contribute to their semantic diversity. Our custom, domain-guided individual representation effectively constrains syntactic similarity, and we provide two alternative fitness functions that promote diversity with no computational effort. Applied to the RNA splicing domain, our approach quickly achieves good diversity and significantly outperforms a random baseline in exploring the search space, as shown by our proof-of-concept, short RNA sequence. Furthermore, we assess its generalizability and demonstrate scalability to larger sequences, resulting in a $\approx$30\% improvement over the baseline.</p>

Existing model-based guardrails have not been designed for resource-constrained computational portable devices, such as mobile phones, more and more of which are running LLM-based applications locally. We introduce LoRA-Guard, a parameter-efficient guardrail adaptation method that relies on knowledge sharing between LLMs and guardrail models. LoRA-Guard extracts language features from the LLMs and adapts them for the content moderation task using low-rank adapters, while a dual-path design prevents any performance degradation on the generative task. We show that LoRA-Guard outperforms existing approaches with 100-1000x lower parameter overhead while maintaining accuracy, enabling on-device content moderation.</p>

An additional challenge is the lack of access to protected user attributes such as gender, for which we propose a solution to obtain a proxy estimate.

This dataset addresses a significant gap in the availability of fairness-focused resources for high-impact domains like advertising -- the actual impact being having access or not to precious employment opportunities, where balancing fairness and utility is a common industrial challenge. We also explore various stages in the advertising process where unfairness can occur and introduce a method to compute a fair utility metric for the job recommendations in online systems case from a biased dataset. Experimental evaluations of bias mitigation techniques on the released dataset demonstrate potential improvements in fairness and the associated trade-offs with utility.</p>

However, their algorithm relies on a costly pure exploration warm-up phase that is hard to implement in practice. This paper eliminates this undesired warm-up phase, replacing it with a simple and efficient contraction mechanism. Our PO algorithm achieves rate-optimal regret with improved dependence on the other parameters of the problem (horizon and function approximation dimension) in two fundamental settings: adversarial losses with full-information feedback and stochastic losses with bandit feedback.</p>

<p>Abstract: While synthetic tabular data generation using Deep Generative Models (DGMs) offers a compelling solution to data scarcity and privacy concerns, their effectiveness relies on substantial training data, often unavailable in real-world applications. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing a novel methodology for generating realistic and reliable synthetic tabular data with DGMs in limited real-data environments. Our approach proposes several ways to generate an artificial inductive bias in a DGM through transfer learning and meta-learning techniques. We explore and compare four different methods within this framework, demonstrating that transfer learning strategies like pre-training and model averaging outperform meta-learning approaches, like Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning, and Domain Randomized Search. We validate our approach using two state-of-the-art DGMs, namely, a Variational Autoencoder and a Generative Adversarial Network, to show that our artificial inductive bias fuels superior synthetic data quality, as measured by Jensen-Shannon divergence, achieving relative gains of up to 50\% when using our proposed approach. This methodology has broad applicability in various DGMs and machine learning tasks, particularly in areas like healthcare and finance, where data scarcity is often a critical issue.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03082">Stable Heterogeneous Treatment Effect Estimation across Out-of-Distribution Populations</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuling Zhang, Anpeng Wu, Kun Kuang, Liang Du, Zixun Sun, Zhi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Heterogeneous treatment effect (HTE) estimation is vital for understanding the change of treatment effect across individuals or subgroups. Most existing HTE estimation methods focus on addressing selection bias induced by imbalanced distributions of confounders between treated and control units, but ignore distribution shifts across populations. Thereby, their applicability has been limited to the in-distribution (ID) population, which shares a similar distribution with the training dataset. In real-world applications, where population distributions are subject to continuous changes, there is an urgent need for stable HTE estimation across out-of-distribution (OOD) populations, which, however, remains an open problem. As pioneers in resolving this problem, we propose a novel Stable Balanced Representation Learning with Hierarchical-Attention Paradigm (SBRL-HAP) framework, which consists of 1) Balancing Regularizer for eliminating selection bias, 2) Independence Regularizer for addressing the distribution shift issue, 3) Hierarchical-Attention Paradigm for coordination between balance and independence. In this way, SBRL-HAP regresses counterfactual outcomes using ID data, while ensuring the resulting HTE estimation can be successfully generalized to out-of-distribution scenarios, thereby enhancing the model's applicability in real-world settings. Extensive experiments conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our SBRL-HAP in achieving stable HTE estimation across OOD populations, with an average 10% reduction in the error metric PEHE and 11% decrease in the ATE bias, compared to the SOTA methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yujin Shin, Kichang Lee, Sungmin Lee, You Rim Choi, Hyung-Sin Kim, JeongGil Ko</p>
<p>Abstract: While federated learning leverages distributed client resources, it faces challenges due to heterogeneous client capabilities. This necessitates allocating models suited to clients' resources and careful parameter aggregation to accommodate this heterogeneity. We propose HypeMeFed, a novel federated learning framework for supporting client heterogeneity by combining a multi-exit network architecture with hypernetwork-based model weight generation. This approach aligns the feature spaces of heterogeneous model layers and resolves per-layer information disparity during weight aggregation. To practically realize HypeMeFed, we also propose a low-rank factorization approach to minimize computation and memory overhead associated with hypernetworks. Our evaluations on a real-world heterogeneous device testbed indicate that HypeMeFed enhances accuracy by 5.12% over FedAvg, reduces the hypernetwork memory requirements by 98.22%, and accelerates its operations by 1.86 times compared to a naive hypernetwork approach. These results demonstrate HypeMeFed's effectiveness in leveraging and engaging heterogeneous clients for federated learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maresa Schr\"oder, Dennis Frauen, Jonas Schweisthal, Konstantin He{\ss}, Valentyn Melnychuk, Stefan Feuerriegel</p>
<p>Abstract: Uncertainty quantification of causal effects is crucial for safety-critical applications such as personalized medicine. A powerful approach for this is conformal prediction, which has several practical benefits due to model-agnostic finite-sample guarantees. Yet, existing methods for conformal prediction of causal effects are limited to binary/discrete treatments and make highly restrictive assumptions such as known propensity scores. In this work, we provide a novel conformal prediction method for potential outcomes of continuous treatments. We account for the additional uncertainty introduced through propensity estimation so that our conformal prediction intervals are valid even if the propensity score is unknown. Our contributions are three-fold: (1) We derive finite-sample prediction intervals for potential outcomes of continuous treatments. (2) We provide an algorithm for calculating the derived intervals. (3) We demonstrate the effectiveness of the conformal prediction intervals in experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose conformal prediction for continuous treatments when the propensity score is unknown and must be estimated from data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anas Krichel, Nikolay Malkin, Salem Lahlou, Yoshua Bengio</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) have emerged as an innovative learning paradigm designed to address the challenge of sampling from an unnormalized probability distribution, called the reward function. This framework learns a policy on a constructed graph, which enables sampling from an approximation of the target probability distribution through successive steps of sampling from the learned policy. To achieve this, GFlowNets can be trained with various objectives, each of which can lead to the model s ultimate goal. The aspirational strength of GFlowNets lies in their potential to discern intricate patterns within the reward function and their capacity to generalize effectively to novel, unseen parts of the reward function. This paper attempts to formalize generalization in the context of GFlowNets, to link generalization with stability, and also to design experiments that assess the capacity of these models to uncover unseen parts of the reward function. The experiments will focus on length generalization meaning generalization to states that can be constructed only by longer trajectories than those seen in training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jos\'e Ribeiro, Lucas Cardoso, Vitor Santos, Eduardo Carvalho, N\'ikolas Carneiro, Ronnie Alves</p>
<p>Abstract: Black box models are increasingly being used in the daily lives of human beings living in society. Along with this increase, there has been the emergence of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods aimed at generating additional explanations regarding how the model makes certain predictions. In this sense, methods such as Dalex, Eli5, eXirt, Lofo and Shap emerged as different proposals and methodologies for generating explanations of black box models in an agnostic way. Along with the emergence of these methods, questions arise such as "How Reliable and Stable are XAI Methods?". With the aim of shedding light on this main question, this research creates a pipeline that performs experiments using the diabetes dataset and four different machine learning models (LGBM, MLP, DT and KNN), creating different levels of perturbations of the test data and finally generates explanations from the eXirt method regarding the confidence of the models and also feature relevances ranks from all XAI methods mentioned, in order to measure their stability in the face of perturbations. As a result, it was found that eXirt was able to identify the most reliable models among all those used. It was also found that current XAI methods are sensitive to perturbations, with the exception of one specific method.</p>

<p>Abstract: The individualization of learning contents based on digital technologies promises large individual and social benefits. However, it remains an open question how this individualization can be implemented. To tackle this question we conduct a randomized controlled trial on a large digital self-learning platform. We develop an algorithm based on two convolutional neural networks that assigns tasks to $4,365$ learners according to their learning paths. Learners are randomized into three groups: two treatment groups -- a group-based adaptive treatment group and an individual adaptive treatment group -- and one control group. We analyze the difference between the three groups with respect to effort learners provide and their performance on the platform. Our null results shed light on the multiple challenges associated with the individualization of learning paths.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chris Lin, Mingyu Lu, Chanwoo Kim, Su-In Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: As diffusion models are deployed in real-world settings, data attribution is needed to ensure fair acknowledgment for contributors of high-quality training data and to identify sources of harmful content. Previous work focuses on identifying individual training samples important for the generation of a given image. However, instead of focusing on a given generated image, some use cases require understanding global properties of the distribution learned by a diffusion model (e.g., demographic diversity). Furthermore, training data for diffusion models are often contributed in groups rather than separately (e.g., multiple artworks from the same artist). Hence, here we tackle the problem of attributing global properties of diffusion models to groups of training data. Specifically, we develop a method to efficiently estimate Shapley values by leveraging model pruning and fine-tuning. We empirically demonstrate the utility of our method with three use cases: (i) global image quality for a DDPM trained on a CIFAR dataset, (ii) demographic diversity for an LDM trained on CelebA-HQ, and (iii) overall aesthetic quality for a Stable Diffusion model LoRA-finetuned on Post-Impressionist artworks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jithendaraa Subramanian, Shivakanth Sujit, Niloy Irtisam, Umong Sain, Derek Nowrouzezahrai, Samira Ebrahimi Kahou, Riashat Islam</p>
<p>Abstract: Protein sequence design, determined by amino acid sequences, are essential to protein engineering problems in drug discovery. Prior approaches have resorted to evolutionary strategies or Monte-Carlo methods for protein design, but often fail to exploit the structure of the combinatorial search space, to generalize to unseen sequences. In the context of discrete black box optimization over large search spaces, learning a mutation policy to generate novel sequences with reinforcement learning is appealing. Recent advances in protein language models (PLMs) trained on large corpora of protein sequences offer a potential solution to this problem by scoring proteins according to their biological plausibility (such as the TM-score). In this work, we propose to use PLMs as a reward function to generate new sequences. Yet the PLM can be computationally expensive to query due to its large size. To this end, we propose an alternative paradigm where optimization can be performed on scores from a smaller proxy model that is periodically finetuned, jointly while learning the mutation policy. We perform extensive experiments on various sequence lengths to benchmark RL-based approaches, and provide comprehensive evaluations along biological plausibility and diversity of the protein. Our experimental results include favorable evaluations of the proposed sequences, along with high diversity scores, demonstrating that RL is a strong candidate for biological sequence design. Finally, we provide a modular open source implementation can be easily integrated in most RL training loops, with support for replacing the reward model with other PLMs, to spur further research in this domain. The code for all experiments is provided in the supplementary material.</p>

Our architecture aims to learn effective representations at many scales across all available data simultaneously. The model contains a number of novel modules: a differentiated form of time series patching which employs multiple resolutions, a multiple-resolution module for time-varying known variables, a mixer-based module for capturing cross-series information, and a novel output head with favourable scaling to account for the increased number of tokens. We present an application of this model to a real world prediction problem faced by the markdown team at a very large retailer. On the experiments conducted our model outperforms in-house models and the selected existing deep learning architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeremy Kedziora</p>
<p>Abstract: In machine learning ensembles predictions from multiple models are aggregated. Despite widespread use and strong performance of ensembles in applied problems little is known about the mathematical properties of aggregating models and associated consequences for safe, explainable use of such models. In this paper we prove a theorem that shows that any ensemble will exhibit at least one of the following forms of prediction instability. It will either ignore agreement among all underlying models, change its mind when none of the underlying models have done so, or be manipulable through inclusion or exclusion of options it would never actually predict. As a consequence, ensemble aggregation procedures will always need to balance the benefits of information use against the risk of these prediction instabilities. This analysis also sheds light on what specific forms of prediction instability to expect from particular ensemble algorithms; for example popular tree ensembles like random forest, or xgboost will violate basic, intuitive monotonicity and fairness properties.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Walt Woods, Alexander Grushin, Simon Khan, Alvaro Velasquez</p>
<p>Abstract: AI-enabled capabilities are reaching the requisite level of maturity to be deployed in the real world, yet do not always make correct or safe decisions. One way of addressing these concerns is to leverage AI control systems alongside and in support of human decisions, relying on the AI control system in safe situations while calling on a human co-decider for critical situations. We extend a methodology for adversarial explanations (AE) to state-of-the-art reinforcement learning frameworks, including MuZero. Multiple improvements to the base agent architecture are proposed. We demonstrate how this technology has two applications: for intelligent decision tools and to enhance training / learning frameworks. In a decision support context, adversarial explanations help a user make the correct decision by highlighting those contextual factors that would need to change for a different AI-recommended decision. As another benefit of adversarial explanations, we show that the learned AI control system demonstrates robustness against adversarial tampering. Additionally, we supplement AE by introducing strategically similar autoencoders (SSAs) to help users identify and understand all salient factors being considered by the AI system. In a training / learning framework, this technology can improve both the AI's decisions and explanations through human interaction. Finally, to identify when AI decisions would most benefit from human oversight, we tie this combined system to our prior art on statistically verified analyses of the criticality of decisions at any point in time.</p>

<p>Abstract: When LLMs are deployed in sensitive, human-facing settings, it is crucial that they do not output unsafe, biased, or privacy-violating outputs. For this reason, models are both trained and instructed to refuse to answer unsafe prompts such as "Tell me how to build a bomb." We find that, despite these safeguards, it is possible to break model defenses simply by appending a space to the end of a model's input. In a study of eight open-source models, we demonstrate that this acts as a strong enough attack to cause the majority of models to generate harmful outputs with very high success rates. We examine the causes of this behavior, finding that the contexts in which single spaces occur in tokenized training data encourage models to generate lists when prompted, overriding training signals to refuse to answer unsafe requests. Our findings underscore the fragile state of current model alignment and promote the importance of developing more robust alignment methods.

<p>Abstract: The growing success of deep learning in various domains has prompted investigations into its application to tabular data, where deep models have shown promising results compared to traditional tree-based methods. In this paper, we revisit Neighborhood Component Analysis (NCA), a classic tabular prediction method introduced in 2004, designed to learn a linear projection that captures semantic similarities between instances. We find that minor modifications, such as adjustments to the learning objectives and the integration of deep learning architectures, significantly enhance NCA's performance, enabling it to surpass most modern deep tabular models. Additionally, we introduce a stochastic neighbor sampling strategy that improves both the efficiency and predictive accuracy of our proposed ModernNCA -- sampling only a subset of neighbors during training, while utilizing the entire neighborhood during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ModernNCA achieves state-of-the-art results in both classification and regression tasks across various tabular datasets, outperforming both tree-based and other deep tabular models, while also reducing training time and model size.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhishek Chandra, Bram Daniels, Mitrofan Curti, Koen Tiels, Elena A. Lomonova</p>
<p>Abstract: Hysteresis modeling is crucial to comprehend the behavior of magnetic devices, facilitating optimal designs. Hitherto, deep learning-based methods employed to model hysteresis, face challenges in generalizing to novel input magnetic fields. This paper addresses the generalization challenge by proposing neural operators for modeling constitutive laws that exhibit magnetic hysteresis by learning a mapping between magnetic fields. In particular, two prominent neural operators -- deep operator network and Fourier neural operator -- are employed to predict novel first-order reversal curves and minor loops, where novel means they are not used to train the model. In addition, a rate-independent Fourier neural operator is proposed to predict material responses at sampling rates different from those used during training to incorporate the rate-independent characteristics of magnetic hysteresis. The presented numerical experiments demonstrate that neural operators efficiently model magnetic hysteresis, outperforming the traditional neural recurrent methods on various metrics and generalizing to novel magnetic fields. The findings emphasize the advantages of using neural operators for modeling hysteresis under varying magnetic conditions, underscoring their importance in characterizing magnetic material based devices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yilun Xu, Gabriele Corso, Tommi Jaakkola, Arash Vahdat, Karsten Kreis</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have revolutionized generative learning. They utilize a diffusion process to encode data into a simple Gaussian distribution. However, encoding a complex, potentially multimodal data distribution into a single continuous Gaussian distribution arguably represents an unnecessarily challenging learning problem. We propose Discrete-Continuous Latent Variable Diffusion Models (DisCo-Diff) to simplify this task by introducing complementary discrete latent variables. We augment DMs with learnable discrete latents, inferred with an encoder, and train DM and encoder end-to-end. DisCo-Diff does not rely on pre-trained networks, making the framework universally applicable. The discrete latents significantly simplify learning the DM's complex noise-to-data mapping by reducing the curvature of the DM's generative ODE. An additional autoregressive transformer models the distribution of the discrete latents, a simple step because DisCo-Diff requires only few discrete variables with small codebooks. We validate DisCo-Diff on toy data, several image synthesis tasks as well as molecular docking, and find that introducing discrete latents consistently improves model performance. For example, DisCo-Diff achieves state-of-the-art FID scores on class-conditioned ImageNet-64/128 datasets with ODE sampler.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaiying Hou, David Brandfonbrener, Sham Kakade, Samy Jelassi, Eran Malach</p>
<p>Abstract: Length generalization refers to the ability to extrapolate from short training sequences to long test sequences and is a challenge for current large language models. While prior work has proposed some architecture or data format changes to achieve length generalization, these proposals typically apply to a limited set of tasks. Building on prior scratchpad and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques, we propose Turing Programs, a novel CoT strategy that decomposes an algorithmic task into steps mimicking the computation of a Turing Machine. This framework is both universal, as it can accommodate any algorithmic task, and simple, requiring only copying text from the context with small modifications. We show that by using Turing Programs, we obtain robust length generalization on a range of algorithmic tasks: addition, multiplication and in-context SGD. We then demonstrate that transformers achieve length generalization on random Turing Programs, suggesting that length generalization is possible for any algorithmic task. Finally, we theoretically prove that transformers can implement Turing Programs, constructing a simple RASP (Weiss et al.) program that simulates an arbitrary Turing machine.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yashar Deldjoo</p>
<p>Abstract: This study explores the nuanced capabilities and inherent biases of Recommender Systems using Large Language Models (RecLLMs), with a focus on ChatGPT-based systems. It studies into the contrasting behaviors of generative models and traditional collaborative filtering models in movie recommendations. The research primarily investigates prompt design strategies and their impact on various aspects of recommendation quality, including accuracy, provider fairness, diversity, stability, genre dominance, and temporal freshness (recency).
  Our experimental analysis reveals that the introduction of specific 'system roles' and 'prompt strategies' in RecLLMs significantly influences their performance. For instance, role-based prompts enhance fairness and diversity in recommendations, mitigating popularity bias. We find that while GPT-based models do not always match the performance of CF baselines, they exhibit a unique tendency to recommend newer and more diverse movie genres. Notably, GPT-based models tend to recommend more recent films, particularly those released post-2000, and show a preference for genres like \sq{Drama} and Comedy, and Romance (compared to CF Action, Adventure) presumably due to the RecLLMs' training on varied data sets, which allows them to capture recent trends and discussions more effectively than CF models. Interestingly, our results demonstrate that the 'Simple' and 'Chain of Thought (COT)' paradigms yield the highest accuracy. These findings imply the potential of combining these strategies with scenarios that favor more recent content, thereby offering a more balanced and up-to-date recommendation experience. This study contributes significantly to the understanding of emerging RecLLMs, particularly in the context of harms and biases within these systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Employing a teleoperation system for gathering demonstrations offers the potential for more efficient learning of robot manipulation. However, teleoperating a robot arm equipped with a dexterous hand or gripper, via a teleoperation system poses significant challenges due to its high dimensionality, complex motions, and differences in physiological structure.
  In this study, we introduce a novel system for joint learning between human operators and robots, that enables human operators to share control of a robot end-effector with a learned assistive agent, facilitating simultaneous human demonstration collection and robot manipulation teaching. In this setup, as data accumulates, the assistive agent gradually learns. Consequently, less human effort and attention are required, enhancing the efficiency of the data collection process. It also allows the human operator to adjust the control ratio to achieve a trade-off between manual and automated control.
  We conducted experiments in both simulated environments and physical real-world settings. Through user studies and quantitative evaluations, it is evident that the proposed system could enhance data collection efficiency and reduce the need for human adaptation while ensuring the collected data is of sufficient quality for downstream tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaxiang Geng, Boyu Li, Xiaoqi Qin, Yixuan Li, Liang Li, Yanzhao Hou, Miao Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: Training latency is critical for the success of numerous intrigued applications ignited by federated learning (FL) over heterogeneous mobile devices. By revolutionarily overlapping local gradient transmission with continuous local computing, FL can remarkably reduce its training latency over homogeneous clients, yet encounter severe model staleness, model drifts, memory cost and straggler issues in heterogeneous environments. To unleash the full potential of overlapping, we propose, FedEx, a novel \underline{fed}erated learning approach to \underline{ex}pedite FL training over mobile devices under data, computing and wireless heterogeneity. FedEx redefines the overlapping procedure with staleness ceilings to constrain memory consumption and make overlapping compatible with participation selection (PS) designs. Then, FedEx characterizes the PS utility function by considering the latency reduced by overlapping, and provides a holistic PS solution to address the straggler issue. FedEx also introduces a simple but effective metric to trigger overlapping, in order to avoid model drifts. Experimental results show that compared with its peer designs, FedEx demonstrates substantial reductions in FL training latency over heterogeneous mobile devices with limited memory cost.</p>

<p>Abstract: This research investigates the application of Multigrid Neural Operator (MgNO), a neural operator architecture inspired by multigrid methods, in the simulation for multiphase flow within porous media. The architecture is adjusted to manage a variety of crucial factors, such as permeability and porosity heterogeneity. The study extendes MgNO to time-dependent porous media flow problems and validate its accuracy in predicting essential aspects of multiphase flows. Furthermore, the research provides a detailed comparison between MgNO and Fourier Neural Opeartor (FNO), which is one of the most popular neural operator methods, on their performance regarding prediction error accumulation over time. This aspect provides valuable insights into the models' long-term predictive stability and reliability. The study demonstrates MgNO's capability to effectively simulate multiphase flow problems, offering considerable time savings compared to traditional simulation methods, marking an advancement in integrating data-driven methodologies in geoscience applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning via sequence modeling has shown remarkable promise in autonomous systems, harnessing the power of offline datasets to make informed decisions in simulated environments. However, the full potential of such methods in complex dynamic environments remain to be discovered. In autonomous driving domain, learning-based agents face significant challenges when transferring knowledge from simulated to real-world settings and the performance is also significantly impacted by data distribution shift. To address these issue, we propose Sample-efficient Imitative Multi-token Decision Transformer (SimDT). SimDT introduces multi-token prediction, imitative online learning and prioritized experience replay to Decision Transformer. The performance is evaluated through empirical experiments and results exceed popular imitation and reinforcement learning algorithms on Waymax benchmark.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinghua Groppe, Sven Groppe, Ralf M\"oller</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning-based approaches for software vulnerability prediction currently mainly rely on the original text of software code as the feature of nodes in the graph of code and thus could learn a representation that is only specific to the code text, rather than the representation that depicts the 'intrinsic' functionality of a program hidden in the text representation. One curse that causes this problem is an infinite number of possibilities to name a variable. In order to lift the curse, in this work we introduce a new type of edge called name dependence, a type of abstract syntax graph based on the name dependence, and an efficient node representation method named 3-property encoding scheme. These techniques will allow us to remove the concrete variable names from code, and facilitate deep learning models to learn the functionality of software hidden in diverse code expressions. The experimental results show that the deep learning models built on these techniques outperform the ones based on existing approaches not only in the prediction of vulnerabilities but also in the memory need. The factor of memory usage reductions of our techniques can be up to the order of 30,000 in comparison to existing approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuan Zheng, Tim Blackmore, James Buckingham, Kerstin Eder</p>
<p>Abstract: Novel test selectors have demonstrated their effectiveness in accelerating the closure of functional coverage for various industrial digital designs in simulation-based verification. The primary advantages of these test selectors include performance that is not impacted by coverage holes, straightforward implementation, and relatively low computational expense. However, the detection of stimuli with novel temporal patterns remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces two novel test selectors designed to identify such stimuli. The experiments reveal that both test selectors can accelerate the functional coverage for a commercial bus bridge, compared to random test selection. Specifically, one selector achieves a 26.9\% reduction in the number of simulated tests required to reach 98.5\% coverage, outperforming the savings achieved by two previously published test selectors by factors of 13 and 2.68, respectively.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this work, we introduce an open-source integrated CAD-CFD tool, Anvil, which combines FreeCAD for CAD modeling and OpenFOAM for CFD analysis, along with an AI-based optimization method (Bayesian optimization) and other sampling algorithms. Anvil serves as a scientific machine learning tool for shape optimization in three modes: data generation, CFD evaluation, and shape optimization. In data generation mode, it automatically runs CFD evaluations and generates data for training a surrogate model. In optimization mode, it searches for the optimal design under given requirements and optimization metrics. In CFD mode, a single CAD file can be evaluated with a single OpenFOAM run. To use Anvil, experimenters provide a JSON configuration file and a parametric CAD seed design. Anvil can be used to study solid-fluid dynamics for any subsonic flow conditions and has been demonstrated in various simulation and optimization use cases.

<p>Abstract: In this study, we address the challenge of obstacle avoidance for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) through an innovative composite imitation learning approach that combines Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with Behavior Cloning (BC) and Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL), enriched by the integration of ray-tracing techniques. Our research underscores the significant role of ray-tracing in enhancing obstacle detection and avoidance capabilities. Moreover, we demonstrate the effectiveness of incorporating GAIL in coordinating the flight paths of two UAVs, showcasing improved collision avoidance capabilities. Extending our methodology, we apply our combined PPO, BC, GAIL, and ray-tracing framework to scenarios involving four UAVs, illustrating its scalability and adaptability to more complex scenarios. The findings indicate that our approach not only improves the reliability of basic PPO based obstacle avoidance but also paves the way for advanced autonomous UAV operations in crowded or dynamic environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xue Yao, Shengren Hou, Serge P. Hoogendoorn, Simeon C. Calvert</p>
<p>Abstract: Lane-changing (LC) is a challenging scenario for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) because of the complex dynamics and high uncertainty of the traffic environment. This challenge can be handled by deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches, leveraging their data-driven and model-free nature. Our previous work proposed a cooperative lane-changing in mixed traffic (CLCMT) mechanism based on TD3 to facilitate an optimal lane-changing strategy. This study enhances the current CLCMT mechanism by considering both the uncertainty of the human-driven vehicles (HVs) and the microscopic interactions between HVs and CAVs. The state-of-the-art (SOTA) DRL algorithms including DDPG, TD3, SAC, and PPO are utilized to deal with the formulated MDP with continuous actions. Performance comparison among the four DRL algorithms demonstrates that DDPG, TD3, and PPO algorithms can deal with uncertainty in traffic environments and learn well-performed LC strategies in terms of safety, efficiency, comfort, and ecology. The PPO algorithm outperforms the other three algorithms, regarding a higher reward, fewer exploration mistakes and crashes, and a more comfortable and ecology LC strategy. The improvements promise CLCMT mechanism greater advantages in the LC motion planning of CAVs.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study proposes CGRclust, a novel combination of unsupervised twin contrastive clustering of Chaos Game Representations (CGR) of DNA sequences, with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). To the best of our knowledge, CGRclust is the first method to use unsupervised learning for image classification (herein applied to two-dimensional CGR images) for clustering datasets of DNA sequences. CGRclust overcomes the limitations of traditional sequence classification methods by leveraging unsupervised twin contrastive learning to detect distinctive sequence patterns, without requiring DNA sequence alignment or biological/taxonomic labels. CGRclust accurately clustered twenty-five diverse datasets, with sequence lengths ranging from 664 bp to 100 kbp, including mitochondrial genomes of fish, fungi, and protists, as well as viral whole genome assemblies and synthetic DNA sequences. Compared with three recent clustering methods for DNA sequences (DeLUCS, iDeLUCS, and MeShClust v3.0.), CGRclust is the only method that surpasses 81.70% accuracy across all four taxonomic levels tested for mitochondrial DNA genomes of fish. Moreover, CGRclust also consistently demonstrates superior performance across all the viral genomic datasets. The high clustering accuracy of CGRclust on these twenty-five datasets, which vary significantly in terms of sequence length, number of genomes, number of clusters, and level of taxonomy, demonstrates its robustness, scalability, and versatility.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning continuously optimizes decision-making based on real-time feedback reward signals through continuous interaction with the environment, demonstrating strong adaptive and self-learning capabilities. In recent years, it has become one of the key methods to achieve autonomous navigation of robots. In this work, an autonomous robot navigation method based on reinforcement learning is introduced. We use the Deep Q Network (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) models to optimize the path planning and decision-making process through the continuous interaction between the robot and the environment, and the reward signals with real-time feedback. By combining the Q-value function with the deep neural network, deep Q network can handle high-dimensional state space, so as to realize path planning in complex environments. Proximal policy optimization is a strategy gradient-based method, which enables robots to explore and utilize environmental information more efficiently by optimizing policy functions. These methods not only improve the robot's navigation ability in the unknown environment, but also enhance its adaptive and self-learning capabilities. Through multiple training and simulation experiments, we have verified the effectiveness and robustness of these models in various complex scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chaoqun Hou, Yuanhang Zhou, Yi Cao, Tong Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: In industrial recommendation systems, there are several mini-apps designed to meet the diverse interests and needs of users. The sample space of them is merely a small subset of the entire space, making it challenging to train an efficient model. In recent years, there have been many excellent studies related to cross-domain recommendation aimed at mitigating the problem of data sparsity. However, few of them have simultaneously considered the adaptability of both sample and representation continual transfer setting to the target task. To overcome the above issue, we propose a Entire space Continual and Adaptive Transfer learning framework called ECAT which includes two core components: First, as for sample transfer, we propose a two-stage method that realizes a coarse-to-fine process. Specifically, we perform an initial selection through a graph-guided method, followed by a fine-grained selection using domain adaptation method. Second, we propose an adaptive knowledge distillation method for continually transferring the representations from a model that is well-trained on the entire space dataset. ECAT enables full utilization of the entire space samples and representations under the supervision of the target task, while avoiding negative migration. Comprehensive experiments on real-world industrial datasets from Taobao show that ECAT advances state-of-the-art performance on offline metrics, and brings +13.6% CVR and +8.6% orders for Baiyibutie, a famous mini-app of Taobao.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Varun Krishna, Sriram Ganapathy</p>
<p>Abstract: The popular frameworks for self-supervised learning of speech representations have largely focused on frame-level masked prediction of speech regions. While this has shown promising downstream task performance for speech recognition and related tasks, this has largely ignored factors of speech that are encoded at coarser level, like characteristics of the speaker or channel that remain consistent through-out a speech utterance. In this work, we propose a framework for Learning Disentangled Self Supervised (termed as Learn2Diss) representations of speech, which consists of frame-level and an utterance-level encoder modules. The two encoders are initially learned independently, where the frame-level model is largely inspired by existing self supervision techniques, thereby learning pseudo-phonemic representations, while the utterance-level encoder is inspired by constrastive learning of pooled embeddings, thereby learning pseudo-speaker representations. The joint learning of these two modules consists of disentangling the two encoders using a mutual information based criterion. With several downstream evaluation experiments, we show that the proposed Learn2Diss achieves state-of-the-art results on a variety of tasks, with the frame-level encoder representations improving semantic tasks, while the utterance-level representations improve non-semantic tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: In pursuit of autonomous vehicles, achieving human-like driving behavior is vital. This study introduces adaptive autopilot (AA), a unique framework utilizing constrained-deep reinforcement learning (C-DRL). AA aims to safely emulate human driving to reduce the necessity for driver intervention. Focusing on the car-following scenario, the process involves (i) extracting data from the highD natural driving study and categorizing it into three driving styles using a rule-based classifier; (ii) employing deep neural network (DNN) regressors to predict human-like acceleration across styles; and (iii) using C-DRL, specifically the soft actor-critic Lagrangian technique, to learn human-like safe driving policies. Results indicate effectiveness in each step, with the rule-based classifier distinguishing driving styles, the regressor model accurately predicting acceleration, outperforming traditional car-following models, and C-DRL agents learning optimal policies for humanlike driving across styles.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuquan Xie, Wanqi Yang, Jinyu Wei, Ming Yang, Yang Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge Tracing (KT) is a critical task in online education systems, aiming to monitor students' knowledge states throughout a learning period. Common KT approaches involve predicting the probability of a student correctly answering the next question based on their exercise history. However, these methods often suffer from performance degradation when faced with the scarcity of student interactions in new education systems. To address this, we leverage student interactions from existing education systems to mitigate performance degradation caused by limited training data. Nevertheless, these interactions exhibit significant differences since they are derived from different education systems. To address this issue, we propose a domain generalization approach for knowledge tracing, where existing education systems are considered source domains, and new education systems with limited data are considered target domains. Additionally, we design a domain-generalizable knowledge tracing framework (DGKT) that can be applied to any KT model. Specifically, we present a concept aggregation approach designed to reduce conceptual disparities within sequences of student interactions from diverse domains. To further mitigate domain discrepancies, we introduce a novel normalization module called Sequence Instance Normalization (SeqIN). Moreover, to fully leverage exercise information, we propose a new knowledge tracing model tailored for the domain generalization KT task, named Domain-Generalizable Relation-based Knowledge Tracing (DGRKT). Extensive experiments across five benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method performs well despite limited training data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Preference optimization techniques have become a standard final stage for training state-of-art large language models (LLMs). However, despite widespread adoption, the vast majority of work to-date has focused on first-class citizen languages like English and Chinese. This captures a small fraction of the languages in the world, but also makes it unclear which aspects of current state-of-the-art research transfer to a multilingual setting. In this work, we perform an exhaustive study to achieve a new state-of-the-art in aligning multilingual LLMs. We introduce a novel, scalable method for generating high-quality multilingual feedback data to balance data coverage. We establish the benefits of cross-lingual transfer and increased dataset size in preference training. Our preference-trained model achieves a 54.4% win-rate against Aya 23 8B, the current state-of-the-art multilingual LLM in its parameter class, and a 69.5% win-rate or higher against widely used models like Gemma-1.1-7B-it, Llama-3-8B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3. As a result of our study, we expand the frontier of alignment techniques to 23 languages covering half of the world's population.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yash More, Prakhar Ganesh, Golnoosh Farnadi</p>
<p>Abstract: Language models are prone to memorizing large parts of their training data, making them vulnerable to extraction attacks. Existing research on these attacks remains limited in scope, often studying isolated trends rather than the real-world interactions with these models. In this paper, we revisit extraction attacks from an adversarial perspective, exploiting the brittleness of language models. We find significant churn in extraction attack trends, i.e., even minor, unintuitive changes to the prompt, or targeting smaller models and older checkpoints, can exacerbate the risks of extraction by up to $2-4 \times$. Moreover, relying solely on the widely accepted verbatim match underestimates the extent of extracted information, and we provide various alternatives to more accurately capture the true risks of extraction. We conclude our discussion with data deduplication, a commonly suggested mitigation strategy, and find that while it addresses some memorization concerns, it remains vulnerable to the same escalation of extraction risks against a real-world adversary. Our findings highlight the necessity of acknowledging an adversary's true capabilities to avoid underestimating extraction risks.</p>

It supports physically-based rendering (PBR), necessary for 3D asset relighting in real-world applications. Additionally, 3DGen supports generative retexturing of previously generated (or artist-created) 3D shapes using additional textual inputs provided by the user. 3DGen integrates key technical components, Meta 3D AssetGen and Meta 3D TextureGen, that we developed for text-to-3D and text-to-texture generation, respectively. By combining their strengths, 3DGen represents 3D objects simultaneously in three ways: in view space, in volumetric space, and in UV (or texture) space. The integration of these two techniques achieves a win rate of 68% with respect to the single-stage model. We compare 3DGen to numerous industry baselines, and show that it outperforms them in terms of prompt fidelity and visual quality for complex textual prompts, while being significantly faster.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large vision language models (VLMs) have progressed incredibly from research to applicability for general-purpose use cases. LLaVA-Med, a pioneering large language and vision assistant for biomedicine, can perform multi-modal biomedical image and data analysis to provide a natural language interface for radiologists. While it is highly generalizable and works with multi-modal data, it is currently limited by well-known challenges that exist in the large language model space. Hallucinations and imprecision in responses can lead to misdiagnosis which currently hinder the clinical adaptability of VLMs. To create precise, user-friendly models in healthcare, we propose D-Rax -- a domain-specific, conversational, radiologic assistance tool that can be used to gain insights about a particular radiologic image. In this study, we enhance the conversational analysis of chest X-ray (CXR) images to support radiological reporting, offering comprehensive insights from medical imaging and aiding in the formulation of accurate diagnosis. D-Rax is achieved by fine-tuning the LLaVA-Med architecture on our curated enhanced instruction-following data, comprising of images, instructions, as well as disease diagnosis and demographic predictions derived from MIMIC-CXR imaging data, CXR-related visual question answer (VQA) pairs, and predictive outcomes from multiple expert AI models. We observe statistically significant improvement in responses when evaluated for both open and close-ended conversations. Leveraging the power of state-of-the-art diagnostic models combined with VLMs, D-Rax empowers clinicians to interact with medical images using natural language, which could potentially streamline their decision-making process, enhance diagnostic accuracy, and conserve their time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziheng Chen, Yue Song, Xiao-Jun Wu, Nicu Sebe</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents two new metrics on the Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) manifold via the Cholesky manifold, i.e., the space of lower triangular matrices with positive diagonal elements. We first unveil that the existing popular Riemannian metric on the Cholesky manifold can be generally characterized as the product metric of a Euclidean metric and a Riemannian metric on the space of n-dimensional positive vectors. Based on this analysis, we propose two novel metrics on the Cholesky manifolds, i.e., Diagonal Power Euclidean Metric and Diagonal Generalized Bures-Wasserstein Metric, which are numerically stabler than the existing Cholesky metric. We also discuss the gyro structures and deformed metrics associated with our metrics. The gyro structures connect the linear and geometric properties, while the deformed metrics interpolate between our proposed metrics and the existing metric. Further, by Cholesky decomposition, the proposed deformed metrics and gyro structures are pulled back to SPD manifolds. Compared with existing Riemannian metrics on SPD manifolds, our metrics are easy to use, computationally efficient, and numerically stable.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Furqan Shaukat, Syed Muhammad Anwar, Abhijeet Parida, Van Khanh Lam, Marius George Linguraru, Mubarak Shah</p>
<p>Abstract: Lung cancer has been one of the major threats to human life for decades. Computer-aided diagnosis can help with early lung nodul detection and facilitate subsequent nodule characterization. Large Visual Language models (VLMs) have been found effective for multiple downstream medical tasks that rely on both imaging and text data. However, lesion level detection and subsequent diagnosis using VLMs have not been explored yet. We propose CADe, for segmenting lung nodules in a zero-shot manner using a variant of the Segment Anything Model called MedSAM. CADe trains on a prompt suite on input computed tomography (CT) scans by using the CLIP text encoder through prefix tuning. We also propose, CADx, a method for the nodule characterization as benign/malignant by making a gallery of radiomic features and aligning image-feature pairs through contrastive learning. Training and validation of CADe and CADx have been done using one of the largest publicly available datasets, called LIDC. To check the generalization ability of the model, it is also evaluated on a challenging dataset, LUNGx. Our experimental results show that the proposed methods achieve a sensitivity of 0.86 compared to 0.76 that of other fully supervised methods.The source code, datasets and pre-processed data can be accessed using the link:</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruibo Shang, Geoffrey P. Luke, Matthew O'Donnell</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning has been used to improve photoacoustic (PA) image reconstruction. One major challenge is that errors cannot be quantified to validate predictions when ground truth is unknown. Validation is key to quantitative applications, especially using limited-bandwidth ultrasonic linear detector arrays. Here, we propose a hybrid Bayesian convolutional neural network (Hybrid-BCNN) to jointly predict PA image and segmentation with error (uncertainty) predictions. Each output pixel represents a probability distribution where error can be quantified. The Hybrid-BCNN was trained with simulated PA data and applied to both simulations and experiments. Due to the sparsity of PA images, segmentation focuses Hybrid-BCNN on minimizing the loss function in regions with PA signals for better predictions. The results show that accurate PA segmentations and images are obtained, and error predictions are highly statistically correlated to actual errors. To leverage error predictions, confidence processing created PA images above a specific confidence level.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Devam Mondal, Carlo Lipizzi</p>
<p>Abstract: In light of recent plagiarism allegations Brough by publishers, newspapers, and other creators of copyrighted corpora against large language model (LLM) developers, we propose a novel system, a variant of a plagiarism detection system, that assesses whether a knowledge source has been used in the training or fine-tuning of a large language model. Unlike current methods, we utilize an approach that uses Resource Description Framework (RDF) triples to create knowledge graphs from both a source document and a LLM continuation of that document. These graphs are then analyzed with respect to content using cosine similarity and with respect to structure using a normalized version of graph edit distance that shows the degree of isomorphism. Unlike traditional systems that focus on content matching and keyword identification between a source and target corpus, our approach enables a broader evaluation of similarity and thus a more accurate comparison of the similarity between a source document and LLM continuation by focusing on relationships between ideas and their organization with regards to others. Additionally, our approach does not require access to LLM metrics like perplexity that may be unavailable in closed large language modeling "black-box" systems, as well as the training corpus. A prototype of our system will be found on a hyperlinked GitHub repository.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vukan Ninkovic, Dejan Vukobratovic, Dragisa Miskovic</p>
<p>Abstract: Distributed learning and inference algorithms have become indispensable for IoT systems, offering benefits such as workload alleviation, data privacy preservation, and reduced latency. This paper introduces an innovative approach that utilizes unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as a coverage extension relay for IoT environmental monitoring in rural areas. Our method integrates a split learning (SL) strategy between edge devices, a UAV and a server to enhance adaptability and performance of inference mechanisms. By employing UAVs as a relay and by incorporating SL, we address connectivity and resource constraints for applications of learning in IoT in remote settings. Our system model accounts for diverse channel conditions to determine the most suitable transmission strategy for optimal system behaviour. Through simulation analysis, the proposed approach demonstrates its robustness and adaptability, even excelling under adverse channel conditions. Integrating UAV relaying and the SL paradigm offers significant flexibility to the server, enabling adaptive strategies that consider various trade-offs beyond simply minimizing overall inference quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Farnaz Kohankhaki, Shaina Raza, Oluwanifemi Bamgbose, Deval Pandya, Elham Dolatabadi</p>
<p>Abstract: In this study, we introduce the application of causal disparity analysis to unveil intricate relationships and causal pathways between sensitive attributes and the targeted outcomes within real-world observational data. Our methodology involves employing causal decomposition analysis to quantify and examine the causal interplay between sensitive attributes and outcomes. We also emphasize the significance of integrating heterogeneity assessment in causal disparity analysis to gain deeper insights into the impact of sensitive attributes within specific sub-groups on outcomes. Our two-step investigation focuses on datasets where race serves as the sensitive attribute. The results on two datasets indicate the benefit of leveraging causal analysis and heterogeneity assessment not only for quantifying biases in the data but also for disentangling their influences on outcomes. We demonstrate that the sub-groups identified by our approach to be affected the most by disparities are the ones with the largest ML classification errors. We also show that grouping the data only based on a sensitive attribute is not enough, and through these analyses, we can find sub-groups that are directly affected by disparities. We hope that our findings will encourage the adoption of such methodologies in future ethical AI practices and bias audits, fostering a more equitable and fair technological landscape.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Efstathia Soufleri, Deepak Ravikumar, Kaushik Roy</p>
<p>Abstract: Compressed video action recognition classifies video samples by leveraging the different modalities in compressed videos, namely motion vectors, residuals, and intra-frames. For this purpose, three neural networks are deployed, each dedicated to processing one modality. Our observations indicate that the network processing intra-frames tend to converge to a flatter minimum than the network processing residuals, which in turn converges to a flatter minimum than the motion vector network. This hierarchy in convergence motivates our strategy for knowledge transfer among modalities to achieve flatter minima, which are generally associated with better generalization. With this insight, we propose Progressive Knowledge Distillation (PKD), a technique that incrementally transfers knowledge across the modalities. This method involves attaching early exits (Internal Classifiers - ICs) to the three networks. PKD distills knowledge starting from the motion vector network, followed by the residual, and finally, the intra-frame network, sequentially improving IC accuracy. Further, we propose the Weighted Inference with Scaled Ensemble (WISE), which combines outputs from the ICs using learned weights, boosting accuracy during inference. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of training the ICs with PKD compared to standard cross-entropy-based training, showing IC accuracy improvements of up to 5.87% and 11.42% on the UCF-101 and HMDB-51 datasets, respectively. Additionally, WISE improves accuracy by up to 4.28% and 9.30% on UCF-101 and HMDB-51, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xu Han, Linghao Jin, Xuezhe Ma, Xiaofeng Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has shown remarkable capabilities in medical image and textual depiction synergy. Nevertheless, many pre-training datasets are restricted by patient privacy concerns, potentially containing noise that can adversely affect downstream performance. Moreover, the growing reliance on multi-modal generation exacerbates this issue because of its susceptibility to adversarial attacks. To investigate how VLMs trained on adversarial noisy data perform on downstream medical tasks, we first craft noisy upstream datasets using multi-modal adversarial attacks. Through our comprehensive analysis, we unveil that moderate noise enhances model robustness and transferability, but increasing noise levels negatively impact downstream task performance. To mitigate this issue, we propose rectify adversarial noise (RAN) framework, a recipe designed to effectively defend adversarial attacks and rectify the influence of upstream noise during fine-tuning.</p>

<p>Abstract: We applied machine learning to the unmet medical need of rapid and accurate diagnosis and prognosis of acute infections and sepsis in emergency departments. Our solution consists of a Myrna (TM) Instrument and embedded TriVerity (TM) classifiers. The instrument measures abundances of 29 messenger RNAs in patient's blood, subsequently used as features for machine learning. The classifiers convert the input features to an intuitive test report comprising the separate likelihoods of (1) a bacterial infection (2) a viral infection, and (3) severity (need for Intensive Care Unit-level care). In internal validation, the system achieved AUROC = 0.83 on the three-class disease diagnosis (bacterial, viral, or non-infected) and AUROC = 0.77 on binary prognosis of disease severity. The Myrna, TriVerity system was granted breakthrough device designation by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This engineering manuscript teaches the standard and novel machine learning methods used to translate an academic research concept to a clinical product aimed at improving patient care, and discusses lessons learned.</p>

<p>Abstract: Knowledge distillation is an effective technique for pre-trained language model compression. Although existing knowledge distillation methods perform well for the most typical model BERT, they could be further improved in two aspects: the relation-level knowledge could be further explored to improve model performance; and the setting of student attention head number could be more flexible to decrease inference time. Therefore, we are motivated to propose a novel knowledge distillation method MLKD-BERT to distill multi-level knowledge in teacher-student framework. Extensive experiments on GLUE benchmark and extractive question answering tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art knowledge distillation methods on BERT. In addition, MLKD-BERT can flexibly set student attention head number, allowing for substantial inference time decrease with little performance drop.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengmeng Sheng, Zeren Sun, Tao Chen, Shuchao Pang, Yucheng Wang, Yazhou Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: Label noise is ubiquitous in real-world scenarios, posing a practical challenge to supervised models due to its effect in hurting the generalization performance of deep neural networks. Existing methods primarily employ the sample selection paradigm and usually rely on dataset-dependent prior knowledge (\eg, a pre-defined threshold) to cope with label noise, inevitably degrading the adaptivity. Moreover, existing methods tend to neglect the class balance in selecting samples, leading to biased model performance. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective approach named \textbf{SED} to deal with label noise in a \textbf{S}elf-adaptiv\textbf{E} and class-balance\textbf{D} manner. Specifically, we first design a novel sample selection strategy to empower self-adaptivity and class balance when identifying clean and noisy data. A mean-teacher model is then employed to correct labels of noisy samples. Subsequently, we propose a self-adaptive and class-balanced sample re-weighting mechanism to assign different weights to detected noisy samples. Finally, we additionally employ consistency regularization on selected clean samples to improve model generalization performance. Extensive experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yushan Zhu, Wen Zhang, Zhiqiang Liu, Mingyang Chen, Lei Liang, Huajun Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) is a common method for Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to serve various artificial intelligence tasks. The suitable dimensions of the embeddings depend on the storage and computing conditions of the specific application scenarios. Once a new dimension is required, a new KGE model needs to be trained from scratch, which greatly increases the training cost and limits the efficiency and flexibility of KGE in serving various scenarios. In this work, we propose a novel KGE training framework MED, through which we could train once to get a croppable KGE model applicable to multiple scenarios with different dimensional requirements, sub-models of the required dimensions can be cropped out of it and used directly without any additional training. In MED, we propose a mutual learning mechanism to improve the low-dimensional sub-models performance and make the high-dimensional sub-models retain the capacity that low-dimensional sub-models have, an evolutionary improvement mechanism to promote the high-dimensional sub-models to master the knowledge that the low-dimensional sub-models can not learn, and a dynamic loss weight to balance the multiple losses adaptively. Experiments on 3 KGE models over 4 standard KG completion datasets, 3 real application scenarios over a real-world large-scale KG, and the experiments of extending MED to the language model BERT show the effectiveness, high efficiency, and flexible extensibility of MED.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gen Li, Zhihao Shu, Jie Ji, Minghai Qin, Fatemeh Afghah, Wei Niu, Xiaolong Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are frequently employed in a variety of computer vision applications. Nowadays, an emerging trend in the current video distribution system is to take advantage of DNN's overfitting properties to perform video resolution upscaling. By splitting videos into chunks and applying a super-resolution (SR) model to overfit each chunk, this scheme of SR models plus video chunks is able to replace traditional video transmission to enhance video quality and transmission efficiency. However, many models and chunks are needed to guarantee high performance, which leads to tremendous overhead on model switching and memory footprints at the user end. To resolve such problems, we propose a Dynamic Deep neural network assisted by a Content-Aware data processing pipeline to reduce the model number down to one (Dy-DCA), which helps promote performance while conserving computational resources. Additionally, to achieve real acceleration on the user end, we designed a framework that optimizes dynamic features (e.g., dynamic shapes, sizes, and control flow) in Dy-DCA to enable a series of compilation optimizations, including fused code generation, static execution planning, etc. By employing such techniques, our method achieves better PSNR and real-time performance (33 FPS) on an off-the-shelf mobile phone. Meanwhile, assisted by our compilation optimization, we achieve a 1.7$\times$ speedup while saving up to 1.61$\times$ memory consumption.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ashutosh Sathe, Sunita Sarawagi</p>
<p>Abstract: Maximizing the likelihood of the next token is an established, statistically sound objective for pre-training language models. In this paper we show that we can train better models faster by pre-aggregating the corpus with a collapsed $n$-gram distribution. Previous studies have proposed corpus-level $n$-gram statistics as a regularizer; however, the construction and querying of such $n$-grams, if done naively, prove to be costly and significantly impede training speed, thereby limiting their application in modern large language model pre-training.
  We introduce an alternative compact representation of the next token distribution that, in expectation, aligns with the complete $n$-gram distribution while markedly reducing variance across mini-batches compared to the standard next-token loss. Empirically, we demonstrate that both the $n$-gram regularized model and our approximation yield substantial improvements in model quality and convergence rate compared to existing methods. Furthermore, our approximation facilitates scalability of gains to larger datasets and models compared to the straightforward $n$-gram regularization method.</p>

<p>Abstract: The explainability of recommendation systems is crucial for enhancing user trust and satisfaction. Leveraging large language models (LLMs) offers new opportunities for comprehensive recommendation logic generation. However, in existing related studies, fine-tuning LLM models for recommendation tasks incurs high computational costs and alignment issues with existing systems, limiting the application potential of proven proprietary/closed-source LLM models, such as GPT-4. In this work, our proposed effective strategy LANE aligns LLMs with online recommendation systems without additional LLMs tuning, reducing costs and improving explainability. This innovative approach addresses key challenges in integrating language models with recommendation systems while fully utilizing the capabilities of powerful proprietary models. Specifically, our strategy operates through several key components: semantic embedding, user multi-preference extraction using zero-shot prompting, semantic alignment, and explainable recommendation generation using Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting. By embedding item titles instead of IDs and utilizing multi-head attention mechanisms, our approach aligns the semantic features of user preferences with those of candidate items, ensuring coherent and user-aligned recommendations. Sufficient experimental results including performance comparison, questionnaire voting, and visualization cases prove that our method can not only ensure recommendation performance, but also provide easy-to-understand and reasonable recommendation logic.</p>

<p>Abstract: Breast cancer poses a profound threat to lives globally, claiming numerous lives each year. Therefore, timely detection is crucial for early intervention and improved chances of survival. Accurately diagnosing and classifying breast tumors using ultrasound images is a persistent challenge in medicine, demanding cutting-edge solutions for improved treatment strategies. This research introduces multiattention-enhanced deep learning (DL) frameworks designed for the classification and segmentation of breast cancer tumors from ultrasound images. A spatial channel attention mechanism is proposed for segmenting tumors from ultrasound images, utilizing a novel LinkNet DL framework with an InceptionResNet backbone. Following this, the paper proposes a deep convolutional neural network with an integrated multi-attention framework (DCNNIMAF) to classify the segmented tumor as benign, malignant, or normal. From experimental results, it is observed that the segmentation model has recorded an accuracy of 98.1%, with a minimal loss of 0.6%. It has also achieved high Intersection over Union (IoU) and Dice Coefficient scores of 96.9% and 97.2%, respectively. Similarly, the classification model has attained an accuracy of 99.2%, with a low loss of 0.31%. Furthermore, the classification framework has achieved outstanding F1-Score, precision, and recall values of 99.1%, 99.3%, and 99.1%, respectively. By offering a robust framework for early detection and accurate classification of breast cancer, this proposed work significantly advances the field of medical image analysis, potentially improving diagnostic precision and patient outcomes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhexin Zhang, Junxiao Yang, Pei Ke, Shiyao Cui, Chujie Zheng, Hongning Wang, Minlie Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: LLMs are known to be vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, even after safety alignment. An important observation is that, while different types of jailbreak attacks can generate significantly different queries, they mostly result in similar responses that are rooted in the same harmful knowledge (e.g., detailed steps to make a bomb). Therefore, we conjecture that directly unlearn the harmful knowledge in the LLM can be a more effective way to defend against jailbreak attacks than the mainstream supervised fine-tuning (SFT) based approaches. Our extensive experiments confirmed our insight and suggested surprising generalizability of our unlearning-based approach: using only 20 raw harmful questions \emph{without} any jailbreak prompt during training, our solution reduced the Attack Success Rate (ASR) in Vicuna-7B on \emph{out-of-distribution} (OOD) harmful questions wrapped with various complex jailbreak prompts from 82.6\% to 7.7\%. This significantly outperforms Llama2-7B-Chat, which is fine-tuned on about 0.1M safety alignment samples but still has an ASR of 21.9\% even under the help of an additional safety system prompt. Further analysis reveals that the generalization ability of our solution stems from the intrinsic relatedness among harmful responses across harmful questions (e.g., response patterns, shared steps and actions, and similarity among their learned representations in the LLM).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sebastian Doerrich, Francesco Di Salvo, Christian Ledig</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite notable advancements, the integration of deep learning (DL) techniques into impactful clinical applications, particularly in the realm of digital histopathology, has been hindered by challenges associated with achieving robust generalization across diverse imaging domains and characteristics. Traditional mitigation strategies in this field such as data augmentation and stain color normalization have proven insufficient in addressing this limitation, necessitating the exploration of alternative methodologies. To this end, we propose a novel generative method for domain generalization in histopathology images. Our method employs a generative, self-supervised Vision Transformer to dynamically extract characteristics of image patches and seamlessly infuse them into the original images, thereby creating novel, synthetic images with diverse attributes. By enriching the dataset with such synthesized images, we aim to enhance its holistic nature, facilitating improved generalization of DL models to unseen domains. Extensive experiments conducted on two distinct histopathology datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, outperforming the state of the art substantially, on the Camelyon17-wilds challenge dataset (+2%) and on a second epithelium-stroma dataset (+26%). Furthermore, we emphasize our method's ability to readily scale with increasingly available unlabeled data samples and more complex, higher parametric architectures.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Krishna Kanth Nakka, Ahmed Frikha, Ricardo Mendes, Xue Jiang, Xuebing Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: The latest and most impactful advances in large models stem from their increased size. Unfortunately, this translates into an improved memorization capacity, raising data privacy concerns. Specifically, it has been shown that models can output personal identifiable information (PII) contained in their training data. However, reported PIII extraction performance varies widely, and there is no consensus on the optimal methodology to evaluate this risk, resulting in underestimating realistic adversaries. In this work, we empirically demonstrate that it is possible to improve the extractability of PII by over ten-fold by grounding the prefix of the manually constructed extraction prompt with in-domain data. Our approach, PII-Compass, achieves phone number extraction rates of 0.92%, 3.9%, and 6.86% with 1, 128, and 2308 queries, respectively, i.e., the phone number of 1 person in 15 is extractable.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of text anonymization where the goal is to prevent adversaries from correctly inferring private attributes of the author, while keeping the text utility, i.e., meaning and semantics. We propose IncogniText, a technique that anonymizes the text to mislead a potential adversary into predicting a wrong private attribute value. Our empirical evaluation shows a reduction of private attribute leakage by more than 90%. Finally, we demonstrate the maturity of IncogniText for real-world applications by distilling its anonymization capability into a set of LoRA parameters associated with an on-device model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmed Frikha, Nassim Walha, Ricardo Mendes, Krishna Kanth Nakka, Xue Jiang, Xuebing Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: This work addresses the timely yet underexplored problem of performing inference and finetuning of a proprietary LLM owned by a model provider entity on the confidential/private data of another data owner entity, in a way that ensures the confidentiality of both the model and the data. Hereby, the finetuning is conducted offsite, i.e., on the computation infrastructure of a third-party cloud provider. We tackle this problem by proposing ObfuscaTune, a novel, efficient and fully utility-preserving approach that combines a simple yet effective obfuscation technique with an efficient usage of confidential computing (only 5% of the model parameters are placed on TEE). We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of ObfuscaTune by validating it on GPT-2 models with different sizes on four NLP benchmark datasets. Finally, we compare to a na\"ive version of our approach to highlight the necessity of using random matrices with low condition numbers in our approach to reduce errors induced by the obfuscation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziad Al-Haj Hemidi, Christian Weihsbach, Mattias P. Heinrich</p>
<p>Abstract: Motion artifacts in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) arise due to relatively long acquisition times and can compromise the clinical utility of acquired images. Traditional motion correction methods often fail to address severe motion, leading to distorted and unreliable results. Deep Learning (DL) alleviated such pitfalls through generalization with the cost of vanishing structures and hallucinations, making it challenging to apply in the medical field where hallucinated structures can tremendously impact the diagnostic outcome. In this work, we present an instance-wise motion correction pipeline that leverages motion-guided Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) to mitigate the impact of motion artifacts while retaining anatomical structure. Our method is evaluated using the NYU fastMRI dataset with different degrees of simulated motion severity. For the correction alone, we can improve over state-of-the-art image reconstruction methods by $+5\%$ SSIM, $+5\:db$ PSNR, and $+14\%$ HaarPSI. Clinical relevance is demonstrated by a subsequent experiment, where our method improves classification outcomes by at least $+1.5$ accuracy percentage points compared to motion-corrupted images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Feijie Wu, Xiaoze Liu, Haoyu Wang, Xingchen Wang, Jing Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) fine-tunes a pretrained large language model (LLM) using preference datasets, enabling the LLM to generate outputs that align with human preferences. Given the sensitive nature of these preference datasets held by various clients, there is a need to implement RLHF within a federated learning (FL) framework, where clients are reluctant to share their data due to privacy concerns. To address this, we introduce a feasible framework in which clients collaboratively train a binary selector with their preference datasets using our proposed FedBis. With a well-trained selector, we can further enhance the LLM that generates human-preferred completions. Meanwhile, we propose a novel algorithm, FedBiscuit, that trains multiple selectors by organizing clients into balanced and disjoint clusters based on their preferences. Compared to the FedBis, FedBiscuit demonstrates superior performance in simulating human preferences for pairwise completions. Our extensive experiments on federated human preference datasets -- marking the first benchmark to address heterogeneous data partitioning among clients -- demonstrate that FedBiscuit outperforms FedBis and even surpasses traditional centralized training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhihua Jin, Shiyi Liu, Haotian Li, Xun Zhao, Huamin Qu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained significant attention but also raised concerns due to the risk of misuse. Jailbreak prompts, a popular type of adversarial attack towards LLMs, have appeared and constantly evolved to breach the safety protocols of LLMs. To address this issue, LLMs are regularly updated with safety patches based on reported jailbreak prompts. However, malicious users often keep their successful jailbreak prompts private to exploit LLMs. To uncover these private jailbreak prompts, extensive analysis of large-scale conversational datasets is necessary to identify prompts that still manage to bypass the system's defenses. This task is highly challenging due to the immense volume of conversation data, diverse characteristics of jailbreak prompts, and their presence in complex multi-turn conversations. To tackle these challenges, we introduce JailbreakHunter, a visual analytics approach for identifying jailbreak prompts in large-scale human-LLM conversational datasets. We have designed a workflow with three analysis levels: group-level, conversation-level, and turn-level. Group-level analysis enables users to grasp the distribution of conversations and identify suspicious conversations using multiple criteria, such as similarity with reported jailbreak prompts in previous research and attack success rates. Conversation-level analysis facilitates the understanding of the progress of conversations and helps discover jailbreak prompts within their conversation contexts. Turn-level analysis allows users to explore the semantic similarity and token overlap between a singleturn prompt and the reported jailbreak prompts, aiding in the identification of new jailbreak strategies. The effectiveness and usability of the system were verified through multiple case studies and expert interviews.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marco Mistretta, Alberto Baldrati, Marco Bertini, Andrew D. Bagdanov</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate remarkable zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks, but fall short of the performance of supervised methods in generalizing to downstream tasks with limited data. Prompt learning is emerging as a parameter-efficient method for adapting VLMs, but state-of-the-art approaches require annotated samples. In this paper we propose a novel approach to prompt learning based on unsupervised knowledge distillation from more powerful models. Our approach, which we call Knowledge Distillation Prompt Learning (KDPL), can be integrated into existing prompt learning techniques and eliminates the need for labeled examples during adaptation. Our experiments on more than ten standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that KDPL is very effective at improving generalization of learned prompts for zero-shot domain generalization, zero-shot cross-dataset generalization, and zero-shot base-to-novel class generalization problems. KDPL requires no ground-truth labels for adaptation, and moreover we show that even in the absence of any knowledge of training class names it can be used to effectively transfer knowledge.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tong Zhou, Shuqiang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) technology, particularly high-density EEG (HD EEG) devices, is widely used in fields such as neuroscience. HD EEG devices improve the spatial resolution of EEG by placing more electrodes on the scalp, meeting the requirements of clinical diagnostic applications such as epilepsy focus localization. However, this technique faces challenges such as high acquisition costs and limited usage scenarios. In this paper, spatio-temporal adaptive diffusion models (STADMs) are proposed to pioneer the use of diffusion models for achieving spatial SR reconstruction from low-resolution (LR, 64 channels or fewer) EEG to high-resolution (HR, 256 channels) EEG. Specifically, a spatio-temporal condition module is designed to extract the spatio-temporal features of LR EEG, which then serve as conditional inputs to guide the reverse denoising process of diffusion models. Additionally, a multi-scale Transformer denoising module is constructed to leverage multi-scale convolution blocks and cross-attention-based diffusion Transformer blocks for conditional guidance to generate subject-adaptive SR EEG. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively enhances the spatial resolution of LR EEG and quantitatively outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, STADMs demonstrate their value by applying synthetic SR EEG to classification and source localization tasks of epilepsy patients, indicating their potential to significantly improve the spatial resolution of LR EEG.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Partha Chakraborty, Krishna Kanth Arumugam, Mahmoud Alfadel, Meiyappan Nagappan, Shane McIntosh</p>
<p>Abstract: The impact of software vulnerabilities on everyday software systems is significant. Despite deep learning models being proposed for vulnerability detection, their reliability is questionable. Prior evaluations show high recall/F1 scores of up to 99%, but these models underperform in practical scenarios, particularly when assessed on entire codebases rather than just the fixing commit. This paper introduces Real-Vul, a comprehensive dataset representing real-world scenarios for evaluating vulnerability detection models. Evaluating DeepWukong, LineVul, ReVeal, and IVDetect shows a significant drop in performance, with precision decreasing by up to 95 percentage points and F1 scores by up to 91 points. Furthermore, Model performance fluctuates based on vulnerability characteristics, with better F1 scores for information leaks or code injection than for path resolution or predictable return values. The results highlight a significant performance gap that needs addressing before deploying deep learning-based vulnerability detection in practical settings. Overfitting is identified as a key issue, and an augmentation technique is proposed, potentially improving performance by up to 30%. Contributions include a dataset creation approach for better model evaluation, Real-Vul dataset, and empirical evidence of deep learning models struggling in real-world settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Rehearsal-based Continual Learning (CL) has been intensely investigated in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, its application in Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) has not been explored in depth. In this paper we introduce the first memory-efficient implementation of Latent Replay (LR)-based CL for SNNs, designed to seamlessly integrate with resource-constrained devices. LRs combine new samples with latent representations of previously learned data, to mitigate forgetting. Experiments on the Heidelberg SHD dataset with Sample and Class-Incremental tasks reach a Top-1 accuracy of 92.5% and 92%, respectively, without forgetting the previously learned information. Furthermore, we minimize the LRs' requirements by applying a time-domain compression, reducing by two orders of magnitude their memory requirement, with respect to a naive rehearsal setup, with a maximum accuracy drop of 4%. On a Multi-Class-Incremental task, our SNN learns 10 new classes from an initial set of 10, reaching a Top-1 accuracy of 78.4% on the full test set.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel combination of two tasks, previously treated separately: acoustic-to-articulatory speech inversion (AAI) and phoneme-to-articulatory (PTA) motion estimation. We refer to this joint task as acoustic phoneme-to-articulatory speech inversion (APTAI) and explore two different approaches, both working speaker- and text-independently during inference. We use a multi-task learning setup, with the end-to-end goal of taking raw speech as input and estimating the corresponding articulatory movements, phoneme sequence, and phoneme alignment. While both proposed approaches share these same requirements, they differ in their way of achieving phoneme-related predictions: one is based on frame classification, the other on a two-staged training procedure and forced alignment. We reach competitive performance of 0.73 mean correlation for the AAI task and achieve up to approximately 87% frame overlap compared to a state-of-the-art text-dependent phoneme force aligner.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingfang Yuan, Kefan Chen, Mehdi Rizvi, Lynne Baillie, Wei Pang</p>
<p>Abstract: The growing interest in fair AI development is evident. The ''Leave No One Behind'' initiative urges us to address multiple and intersecting forms of inequality in accessing services, resources, and opportunities, emphasising the significance of fairness in AI. This is particularly relevant as an increasing number of AI tools are applied to decision-making processes, such as resource allocation and service scheme development, across various sectors such as health, energy, and housing. Therefore, exploring joint inequalities in these sectors is significant and valuable for thoroughly understanding overall inequality and unfairness. This research introduces an innovative approach to quantify cross-sectoral intersecting discrepancies among user-defined groups using latent class analysis. These discrepancies can be used to approximate inequality and provide valuable insights to fairness issues. We validate our approach using both proprietary and public datasets, including EVENS and Census 2021 (England \& Wales) datasets, to examine cross-sectoral intersecting discrepancies among different ethnic groups. We also verify the reliability of the quantified discrepancy by conducting a correlation analysis with a government public metric. Our findings reveal significant discrepancies between minority ethnic groups, highlighting the need for targeted interventions in real-world AI applications. Additionally, we demonstrate how the proposed approach can be used to provide insights into the fairness of machine learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunpeng Jiang, Paul Weng, Yutong Ban</p>
<p>Abstract: Data augmentation is widely applied and has shown its benefits in different machine learning tasks. However, as recently observed in some downstream tasks, data augmentation may introduce an unfair impact on classifications. While it can improve the performance of some classes, it can actually be detrimental for other classes, which can be problematic in some application domains. In this paper, to counteract this phenomenon, we propose a FAir Classification approach with a Two-player game (FACT). We first formulate the training of a classifier with data augmentation as a fair optimization problem, which can be further written as an adversarial two-player game. Following this formulation, we propose a novel multiplicative weight optimization algorithm, for which we theoretically prove that it can converge to a solution that is fair over classes. Interestingly, our formulation also reveals that this fairness issue over classes is not due to data augmentation only, but is in fact a general phenomenon. Our empirical experiments demonstrate that the performance of our learned classifiers is indeed more fairly distributed over classes in five datasets, with only limited impact on the average accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ce Liu, Suryansh Kumar, Shuhang Gu, Radu Timofte, Yao Yao, Luc Van Gool</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Stereo Risk, a new deep-learning approach to solve the classical stereo-matching problem in computer vision. As it is well-known that stereo matching boils down to a per-pixel disparity estimation problem, the popular state-of-the-art stereo-matching approaches widely rely on regressing the scene disparity values, yet via discretization of scene disparity values. Such discretization often fails to capture the nuanced, continuous nature of scene depth. Stereo Risk departs from the conventional discretization approach by formulating the scene disparity as an optimal solution to a continuous risk minimization problem, hence the name "stereo risk". We demonstrate that $L^1$ minimization of the proposed continuous risk function enhances stereo-matching performance for deep networks, particularly for disparities with multi-modal probability distributions. Furthermore, to enable the end-to-end network training of the non-differentiable $L^1$ risk optimization, we exploited the implicit function theorem, ensuring a fully differentiable network. A comprehensive analysis demonstrates our method's theoretical soundness and superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods across various benchmark datasets, including KITTI 2012, KITTI 2015, ETH3D, SceneFlow, and Middlebury 2014.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenyu He, Jun Zhang, Shengjie Luo, Jingjing Xu, Zhi Zhang, Di He</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we investigate a typical scenario in code generation where a developer edits existing code in real time and requests a code assistant, e.g., a large language model, to re-predict the next token or next line on the fly. Naively, the LLM needs to re-encode the entire KV cache to provide an accurate prediction. However, this process is computationally expensive, especially when the sequence length is long. Simply encoding the edited subsequence and integrating it to the original KV cache meets the temporal confusion problem, leading to significantly worse performance. We address this efficiency and accuracy trade-off by introducing \underline{\textbf{Positional \textbf{I}ntegrity \textbf{E}ncoding} (PIE). Building upon the rotary positional encoding, PIE first removes the rotary matrices in the Key cache that introduce temporal confusion and then reapplies the correct rotary matrices. This process ensures that positional relationships between tokens are correct and requires only a single round of matrix multiplication. We validate the effectiveness of PIE through extensive experiments on the RepoBench-C-8k dataset, utilizing DeepSeek-Coder models with 1.3B, 6.7B, and 33B parameters. Our evaluation includes three real-world coding tasks: code insertion, code deletion, and multi-place code editing. Results demonstrate that PIE reduces computational overhead by over 85% compared to the standard full recomputation approach across all model sizes and tasks while well approximating the model performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziqing Yang, Michael Backes, Yang Zhang, Ahmed Salem</p>
<p>Abstract: Open-source large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly popular among both the general public and industry, as they can be customized, fine-tuned, and freely used. However, some open-source LLMs require approval before usage, which has led to third parties publishing their own easily accessible versions. Similarly, third parties have been publishing fine-tuned or quantized variants of these LLMs. These versions are particularly appealing to users because of their ease of access and reduced computational resource demands. This trend has increased the risk of training time attacks, compromising the integrity and security of LLMs. In this work, we present a new training time attack, SOS, which is designed to be low in computational demand and does not require clean data or modification of the model weights, thereby maintaining the model's utility intact. The attack addresses security issues in various scenarios, including the backdoor attack, jailbreak attack, and prompt stealing attack. Our experimental findings demonstrate that the proposed attack is effective across all evaluated targets. Furthermore, we present the other side of our SOS technique, namely the copyright token -- a novel technique that enables users to mark their copyrighted content and prevent models from using it.</p>

<p>Abstract: Teleoperation is a crucial tool for collecting human demonstrations, but controlling robots with bimanual dexterous hands remains a challenge. Existing teleoperation systems struggle to handle the complexity of coordinating two hands for intricate manipulations. We introduce Bunny-VisionPro, a real-time bimanual dexterous teleoperation system that leverages a VR headset. Unlike previous vision-based teleoperation systems, we design novel low-cost devices to provide haptic feedback to the operator, enhancing immersion. Our system prioritizes safety by incorporating collision and singularity avoidance while maintaining real-time performance through innovative designs. Bunny-VisionPro outperforms prior systems on a standard task suite, achieving higher success rates and reduced task completion times. Moreover, the high-quality teleoperation demonstrations improve downstream imitation learning performance, leading to better generalizability. Notably, Bunny-VisionPro enables imitation learning with challenging multi-stage, long-horizon dexterous manipulation tasks, which have rarely been addressed in previous work. Our system's ability to handle bimanual manipulations while prioritizing safety and real-time performance makes it a powerful tool for advancing dexterous manipulation and imitation learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qixiang Chen, Lei Wang, Piotr Koniusz, Tom Gedeon</p>
<p>Abstract: Videos contain rich spatio-temporal information. Traditional methods for extracting motion, used in tasks such as action recognition, often rely on visual contents rather than precise motion features. This phenomenon is referred to as 'blind motion extraction' behavior, which proves inefficient in capturing motions of interest due to a lack of motion-guided cues. Recently, attention mechanisms have enhanced many computer vision tasks by effectively highlighting salient visual areas. Inspired by this, we propose using a modified Sigmoid function with learnable slope and shift parameters as an attention mechanism to activate and modulate motion signals derived from frame differencing maps. This approach generates a sequence of attention maps that enhance the processing of motion-related video content. To ensure temporally continuity and smoothness of the attention maps, we apply pair-wise temporal attention variation regularization to remove unwanted motions (e.g., noise) while preserving important ones. We then perform Hadamard product between each pair of attention maps and the original video frames to highlight the evolving motions of interest over time. These highlighted motions, termed video motion prompts, are subsequently used as inputs to the model instead of the original video frames. We formalize this process as a motion prompt layer and incorporate the regularization term into the loss function to learn better motion prompts. This layer serves as an adapter between the model and the video data, bridging the gap between traditional 'blind motion extraction' and the extraction of relevant motions of interest.</p>

<p>Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic exposed significant weaknesses in the healthcare information system. The overwhelming volume of misinformation on social media and other socioeconomic factors created extraordinary challenges to motivate people to take proper precautions and get vaccinated. In this context, our work explored a novel direction by analyzing an extensive dataset collected over two years, identifying the topics de/motivating the public about COVID-19 vaccination. We analyzed these topics based on time, geographic location, and political orientation. We noticed that while the motivating topics remain the same over time and geographic location, the demotivating topics rapidly. We also identified that intrinsic motivation, rather than external mandate, is more advantageous to inspire the public.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiling Zhou, Zhuanghua Liu, Chengchang Liu, Luo Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of solving large-scale nonlinear equations with H\"older continuous Jacobians. We introduce a novel Incremental Gauss--Newton (IGN) method within explicit superlinear convergence rate, which outperforms existing methods that only achieve linear convergence rate. In particular, we formulate our problem by the nonlinear least squares with finite-sum structure, and our method incrementally iterates with the information of one component in each round. We also provide a mini-batch extension to our IGN method that obtains an even faster superlinear convergence rate. Furthermore, we conduct numerical experiments to show the advantages of the proposed methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kelly Marchisio, Saurabh Dash, Hongyu Chen, Dennis Aumiller, Ahmet \"Ust\"un, Sara Hooker, Sebastian Ruder</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantization techniques are widely used to improve inference speed and deployment of large language models. While a wide body of work examines the impact of quantized LLMs on English tasks, none have examined the effect of quantization across languages. We conduct a thorough analysis of quantized multilingual LLMs, focusing on their performance across languages and at varying scales. We use automatic benchmarks, LLM-as-a-Judge methods, and human evaluation, finding that (1) harmful effects of quantization are apparent in human evaluation, and automatic metrics severely underestimate the detriment: a 1.7% average drop in Japanese across automatic tasks corresponds to a 16.0% drop reported by human evaluators on realistic prompts; (2) languages are disparately affected by quantization, with non-Latin script languages impacted worst; and (3) challenging tasks such as mathematical reasoning degrade fastest. As the ability to serve low-compute models is critical for wide global adoption of NLP technologies, our results urge consideration of multilingual performance as a key evaluation criterion for efficient models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mariela De Lucas \'Alvarez, Jichen Guo, Raul Dom\'inguez, Matias Valdenegro-Toro</p>
<p>Abstract: Terrain Classification is an essential task in space exploration, where unpredictable environments are difficult to observe using only exteroceptive sensors such as vision. Implementing Neural Network classifiers can have high performance but can be deemed untrustworthy as they lack transparency, which makes them unreliable for taking high-stakes decisions during mission planning. We address this by proposing Neural Networks with Uncertainty Quantification in Terrain Classification. We enable our Neural Networks with Monte Carlo Dropout, DropConnect, and Flipout in time series-capable architectures using only proprioceptive data as input. We use Bayesian Optimization with Hyperband for efficient hyperparameter optimization to find optimal models for trustworthy terrain classification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stanislav Budzinskiy</p>
<p>Abstract: The article concerns low-rank approximation of matrices generated by sampling a smooth function of two $m$-dimensional variables. We refute an argument made in the literature that, for a specific class of analytic functions, such matrices admit accurate entrywise approximation of rank that is independent of $m$. We provide a theoretical explanation of the numerical results presented in support of this argument, describing three narrower classes of functions for which $n \times n$ function-generated matrices can be approximated within an entrywise error of order $\varepsilon$ with rank $\mathcal{O}(\log(n) \varepsilon^{-2} \mathrm{polylog}(\varepsilon^{-1}))$ that is independent of the dimension $m$: (i) functions of the inner product of the two variables, (ii) functions of the squared Euclidean distance between the variables, and (iii) shift-invariant positive-definite kernels. We extend our argument to low-rank tensor-train approximation of tensors generated with functions of the multi-linear product of their $m$-dimensional variables. We discuss our results in the context of low-rank approximation of attention in transformer neural networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David P. Woodruff, Taisuke Yasuda</p>
<p>Abstract: The $\ell_p$ subspace approximation problem is an NP-hard low rank approximation problem that generalizes the median hyperplane problem ($p = 1$), principal component analysis ($p = 2$), and the center hyperplane problem ($p = \infty$). A popular approach to cope with the NP-hardness of this problem is to compute a strong coreset, which is a small weighted subset of the input points which simultaneously approximates the cost of every $k$-dimensional subspace, typically to $(1+\varepsilon)$ relative error for a small constant $\varepsilon$.
  We obtain the first algorithm for constructing a strong coreset for $\ell_p$ subspace approximation with a nearly optimal dependence on the rank parameter $k$, obtaining a nearly linear bound of $\tilde O(k)\mathrm{poly}(\varepsilon^{-1})$ for $p<2$ and $\tilde O(k^{p/2})\mathrm{poly}(\varepsilon^{-1})$ for $p>2$. Prior constructions either achieved a similar size bound but produced a coreset with a modification of the original points [SW18, FKW21], or produced a coreset of the original points but lost $\mathrm{poly}(k)$ factors in the coreset size [HV20, WY23].
  Our techniques also lead to the first nearly optimal online strong coresets for $\ell_p$ subspace approximation with similar bounds as the offline setting, resolving a problem of [WY23]. All prior approaches lose $\mathrm{poly}(k)$ factors in this setting, even when allowed to modify the original points.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jessica Pointing</p>
<p>Abstract: One hypothesis for the success of deep neural networks (DNNs) is that they are highly expressive, which enables them to be applied to many problems, and they have a strong inductive bias towards solutions that are simple, known as simplicity bias, which allows them to generalise well on unseen data because most real-world data is structured (i.e. simple). In this work, we explore the inductive bias and expressivity of quantum neural networks (QNNs), which gives us a way to compare their performance to those of DNNs. Our results show that it is possible to have simplicity bias with certain QNNs, but we prove that this type of QNN limits the expressivity of the QNN. We also show that it is possible to have QNNs with high expressivity, but they either have no inductive bias or a poor inductive bias and result in a worse generalisation performance compared to DNNs. We demonstrate that an artificial (restricted) inductive bias can be produced by intentionally restricting the expressivity of a QNN. Our results suggest a bias-expressivity tradeoff. Our conclusion is that the QNNs we studied can not generally offer an advantage over DNNs, because these QNNs either have a poor inductive bias or poor expressivity compared to DNNs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sajani Vithana, Viveck R. Cadambe, Flavio P. Calmon, Haewon Jeong</p>
<p>Abstract: Differentially private distributed mean estimation (DP-DME) is a fundamental building block in privacy-preserving federated learning, where a central server estimates the mean of $d$-dimensional vectors held by $n$ users while ensuring $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP. Local differential privacy (LDP) and distributed DP with secure aggregation (SecAgg) are the most common notions of DP used in DP-DME settings with an untrusted server. LDP provides strong resilience to dropouts, colluding users, and malicious server attacks, but suffers from poor utility. In contrast, SecAgg-based DP-DME achieves an $O(n)$ utility gain over LDP in DME, but requires increased communication and computation overheads and complex multi-round protocols to handle dropouts and malicious attacks. In this work, we propose CorDP-DME, a novel DP-DME mechanism that spans the gap between DME with LDP and distributed DP, offering a favorable balance between utility and resilience to dropout and collusion. CorDP-DME is based on correlated Gaussian noise, ensuring DP without the perfect conditional privacy guarantees of SecAgg-based approaches. We provide an information-theoretic analysis of CorDP-DME, and derive theoretical guarantees for utility under any given privacy parameters and dropout/colluding user thresholds. Our results demonstrate that (anti) correlated Gaussian DP mechanisms can significantly improve utility in mean estimation tasks compared to LDP -- even in adversarial settings -- while maintaining better resilience to dropouts and attacks compared to distributed DP.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Trevor Ablett, Bryan Chan, Jayce Haoran Wang, Jonathan Kelly</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning from examples of success is an appealing approach to reinforcement learning that eliminates many of the disadvantages of using hand-crafted reward functions or full expert-demonstration trajectories, both of which can be difficult to acquire, biased, or suboptimal. However, learning from examples alone dramatically increases the exploration challenge, especially for complex tasks. This work introduces value-penalized auxiliary control from examples (VPACE); we significantly improve exploration in example-based control by adding scheduled auxiliary control and examples of auxiliary tasks. Furthermore, we identify a value-calibration problem, where policy value estimates can exceed their theoretical limits based on successful data. We resolve this problem, which is exacerbated by learning auxiliary tasks, through the addition of an above-success-level value penalty. Across three simulated and one real robotic manipulation environment, and 21 different main tasks, we show that our approach substantially improves learning efficiency.

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03321">Planetarium: A Rigorous Benchmark for Translating Text to Structured Planning Languages</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Max Zuo, Francisco Piedrahita Velez, Xiaochen Li, Michael L. Littman, Stephen H. Bach</p>
<p>Abstract: Many recent works have explored using language models for planning problems. One line of research focuses on translating natural language descriptions of planning tasks into structured planning languages, such as the planning domain definition language (PDDL). While this approach is promising, accurately measuring the quality of generated PDDL code continues to pose significant challenges. First, generated PDDL code is typically evaluated using planning validators that check whether the problem can be solved with a planner. This method is insufficient because a language model might generate valid PDDL code that does not align with the natural language description of the task. Second, existing evaluation sets often have natural language descriptions of the planning task that closely resemble the ground truth PDDL, reducing the challenge of the task. To bridge this gap, we introduce \benchmarkName, a benchmark designed to evaluate language models' ability to generate PDDL code from natural language descriptions of planning tasks. We begin by creating a PDDL equivalence algorithm that rigorously evaluates the correctness of PDDL code generated by language models by flexibly comparing it against a ground truth PDDL. Then, we present a dataset of $132,037$ text-to-PDDL pairs across 13 different tasks, with varying levels of difficulty. Finally, we evaluate several API-access and open-weight language models that reveal this task's complexity. For example, $87.6\%$ of the PDDL problem descriptions generated by GPT-4o are syntactically parseable, $82.2\%$ are valid, solve-able problems, but only $35.1\%$ are semantically correct, highlighting the need for a more rigorous benchmark for this problem.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ronshee Chawla, Abishek Sankararaman, Ayalvadi Ganesh, Sanjay Shakkottai</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider a decentralized multi-agent Multi Armed Bandit (MAB) setup consisting of $N$ agents, solving the same MAB instance to minimize individual cumulative regret. In our model, agents collaborate by exchanging messages through pairwise gossip style communications on an arbitrary connected graph. We develop two novel algorithms, where each agent only plays from a subset of all the arms. Agents use the communication medium to recommend only arm-IDs (not samples), and thus update the set of arms from which they play. We establish that, if agents communicate $\Omega(\log(T))$ times through any connected pairwise gossip mechanism, then every agent's regret is a factor of order $N$ smaller compared to the case of no collaborations. Furthermore, we show that the communication constraints only have a second order effect on the regret of our algorithm. We then analyze this second order term of the regret to derive bounds on the regret-communication tradeoffs. Finally, we empirically evaluate our algorithm and conclude that the insights are fundamental and not artifacts of our bounds. We also show a lower bound which gives that the regret scaling obtained by our algorithm cannot be improved even in the absence of any communication constraints. Our results thus demonstrate that even a minimal level of collaboration among agents greatly reduces regret for all agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aahlad Puli, Nitish Joshi, Yoav Wald, He He, Rajesh Ranganath</p>
<p>Abstract: In prediction tasks, there exist features that are related to the label in the same way across different settings for that task; these are semantic features or semantics. Features with varying relationships to the label are nuisances. For example, in detecting cows from natural images, the shape of the head is semantic but because images of cows often have grass backgrounds but not always, the background is a nuisance. Models that exploit nuisance-label relationships face performance degradation when these relationships change. Building models robust to such changes requires additional knowledge beyond samples of the features and labels. For example, existing work uses annotations of nuisances or assumes ERM-trained models depend on nuisances. Approaches to integrate new kinds of additional knowledge enlarge the settings where robust models can be built. We develop an approach to use knowledge about the semantics by corrupting them in data, and then using the corrupted data to produce models which identify correlations between nuisances and the label. Once these correlations are identified, they can be used to adjust for where nuisances drive predictions. We study semantic corruptions in powering different spurious-correlation avoiding methods on multiple out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks like classifying waterbirds, natural language inference (NLI), and detecting cardiomegaly in chest X-rays.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jos\'e Ribeiro, Lucas Cardoso, Ra\'issa Silva, Vitor Cirilo, N\'ikolas Carneiro, Ronnie Alves</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, XAI researchers have been formalizing proposals and developing new methods to explain black box models, with no general consensus in the community on which method to use to explain these models, with this choice being almost directly linked to the popularity of a specific method. Methods such as Ciu, Dalex, Eli5, Lofo, Shap and Skater emerged with the proposal to explain black box models through global rankings of feature relevance, which based on different methodologies, generate global explanations that indicate how the model's inputs explain its predictions. In this context, 41 datasets, 4 tree-ensemble algorithms (Light Gradient Boosting, CatBoost, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting), and 6 XAI methods were used to support the launch of a new XAI method, called eXirt, based on Item Response Theory - IRT and aimed at tree-ensemble black box models that use tabular data referring to binary classification problems. In the first set of analyses, the 164 global feature relevance ranks of the eXirt were compared with 984 ranks of the other XAI methods present in the literature, seeking to highlight their similarities and differences. In a second analysis, exclusive explanations of the eXirt based on Explanation-by-example were presented that help in understanding the model trust. Thus, it was verified that eXirt is able to generate global explanations of tree-ensemble models and also local explanations of instances of models through IRT, showing how this consolidated theory can be used in machine learning in order to obtain explainable and reliable models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yoav Wald, Gal Yona, Uri Shalit, Yair Carmon</p>
<p>Abstract: Learned classifiers should often possess certain invariance properties meant to encourage fairness, robustness, or out-of-distribution generalization. However, multiple recent works empirically demonstrate that common invariance-inducing regularizers are ineffective in the over-parameterized regime, in which classifiers perfectly fit (i.e. interpolate) the training data. This suggests that the phenomenon of "benign overfitting", in which models generalize well despite interpolating, might not favorably extend to settings in which robustness or fairness are desirable.
  In this work we provide a theoretical justification for these observations. We prove that -- even in the simplest of settings -- any interpolating learning rule (with arbitrarily small margin) will not satisfy these invariance properties. We then propose and analyze an algorithm that -- in the same setting -- successfully learns a non-interpolating classifier that is provably invariant. We validate our theoretical observations on simulated data and the Waterbirds dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ergute Bao, Yizheng Zhu, Xiaokui Xiao, Yin Yang, Beng Chin Ooi, Benjamin Hong Meng Tan, Khin Mi Mi Aung</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks have strong capabilities of memorizing the underlying training data, which can be a serious privacy concern. An effective solution to this problem is to train models with differential privacy, which provides rigorous privacy guarantees by injecting random noise to the gradients. This paper focuses on the scenario where sensitive data are distributed among multiple participants, who jointly train a model through federated learning (FL), using both secure multiparty computation (MPC) to ensure the confidentiality of each gradient update, and differential privacy to avoid data leakage in the resulting model. A major challenge in this setting is that common mechanisms for enforcing DP in deep learning, which inject real-valued noise, are fundamentally incompatible with MPC, which exchanges finite-field integers among the participants. Consequently, most existing DP mechanisms require rather high noise levels, leading to poor model utility. Motivated by this, we propose Skellam mixture mechanism (SMM), an approach to enforce DP on models built via FL. Compared to existing methods, SMM eliminates the assumption that the input gradients must be integer-valued, and, thus, reduces the amount of noise injected to preserve DP. Further, SMM allows tight privacy accounting due to the nice composition and sub-sampling properties of the Skellam distribution, which are key to accurate deep learning with DP. The theoretical analysis of SMM is highly non-trivial, especially considering (i) the complicated math of differentially private deep learning in general and (ii) the fact that the mixture of two Skellam distributions is rather complex, and to our knowledge, has not been studied in the DP literature. Extensive experiments on various practical settings demonstrate that SMM consistently and significantly outperforms existing solutions in terms of the utility of the resulting model.</p>

<p>Abstract: In Bayesian optimisation, we often seek to minimise the black-box objective functions that arise in real-world physical systems. A primary contributor to the cost of evaluating such black-box objective functions is often the effort required to prepare the system for measurement. We consider a common scenario where preparation costs grow as the distance between successive evaluations increases. In this setting, smooth optimisation trajectories are preferred and the jumpy paths produced by the standard myopic (i.e.\ one-step-optimal) Bayesian optimisation methods are sub-optimal. Our algorithm, MONGOOSE, uses a meta-learnt parametric policy to generate smooth optimisation trajectories, achieving performance gains over existing methods when optimising functions with large movement costs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eike Petersen, Enzo Ferrante, Melanie Ganz, Aasa Feragen</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical imaging models have been shown to encode information about patient demographics such as age, race, and sex in their latent representation, raising concerns about their potential for discrimination. Here, we ask whether requiring models not to encode demographic attributes is desirable. We point out that marginal and class-conditional representation invariance imply the standard group fairness notions of demographic parity and equalized odds, respectively. In addition, however, they require matching the risk distributions, thus potentially equalizing away important group differences. Enforcing the traditional fairness notions directly instead does not entail these strong constraints. Moreover, representationally invariant models may still take demographic attributes into account for deriving predictions, implying unequal treatment - in fact, achieving representation invariance may require doing so. In theory, this can be prevented using counterfactual notions of (individual) fairness or invariance. We caution, however, that properly defining medical image counterfactuals with respect to demographic attributes is fraught with challenges. Finally, we posit that encoding demographic attributes may even be advantageous if it enables learning a task-specific encoding of demographic features that does not rely on social constructs such as 'race' and 'gender.' We conclude that demographically invariant representations are neither necessary nor sufficient for fairness in medical imaging. Models may need to encode demographic attributes, lending further urgency to calls for comprehensive model fairness assessments in terms of predictive performance across diverse patient groups.</p>

<p>Abstract: In today's machine learning (ML) models, any part of the training data can affect the model output. This lack of control for information flow from training data to model output is a major obstacle in training models on sensitive data when access control only allows individual users to access a subset of data. To enable secure machine learning for access-controlled data, we propose the notion of information flow control for machine learning, and develop an extension to the Transformer language model architecture that strictly adheres to the IFC definition we propose. Our architecture controls information flow by limiting the influence of training data from each security domain to a single expert module, and only enables a subset of experts at inference time based on the access control policy.The evaluation using large text and code datasets show that our proposed parametric IFC architecture has minimal (1.9%) performance overhead and can significantly improve model accuracy (by 38% for the text dataset, and between 44%--62% for the code datasets) by enabling training on access-controlled data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francesco Cagnetta, Leonardo Petrini, Umberto M. Tomasini, Alessandro Favero, Matthieu Wyart</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning algorithms demonstrate a surprising ability to learn high-dimensional tasks from limited examples. This is commonly attributed to the depth of neural networks, enabling them to build a hierarchy of abstract, low-dimensional data representations. However, how many training examples are required to learn such representations remains unknown. To quantitatively study this question, we introduce the Random Hierarchy Model: a family of synthetic tasks inspired by the hierarchical structure of language and images. The model is a classification task where each class corresponds to a group of high-level features, chosen among several equivalent groups associated with the same class. In turn, each feature corresponds to a group of sub-features chosen among several equivalent ones and so on, following a hierarchy of composition rules. We find that deep networks learn the task by developing internal representations invariant to exchanging equivalent groups. Moreover, the number of data required corresponds to the point where correlations between low-level features and classes become detectable. Overall, our results indicate how deep networks overcome the curse of dimensionality by building invariant representations, and provide an estimate of the number of data required to learn a hierarchical task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gerry Windiarto Mohamad Dunda, Shenghui Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has garnered considerable attention due to its privacy-preserving feature. Nonetheless, the lack of freedom in managing user data can lead to group fairness issues, where models are biased towards sensitive factors such as race or gender. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes a novel algorithm, fair federated averaging with augmented Lagrangian method (FFALM), designed explicitly to address group fairness issues in FL. Specifically, we impose a fairness constraint on the training objective and solve the minimax reformulation of the constrained optimization problem. Then, we derive the theoretical upper bound for the convergence rate of FFALM. The effectiveness of FFALM in improving fairness is shown empirically on CelebA and UTKFace datasets in the presence of severe statistical heterogeneity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francesco Campi, Lukas Gosch, Tom Wollschl\"ager, Yan Scholten, Stephan G\"unnemann</p>
<p>Abstract: We perform the first adversarial robustness study into Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that are provably more powerful than traditional Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs). In particular, we use adversarial robustness as a tool to uncover a significant gap between their theoretically possible and empirically achieved expressive power. To do so, we focus on the ability of GNNs to count specific subgraph patterns, which is an established measure of expressivity, and extend the concept of adversarial robustness to this task. Based on this, we develop efficient adversarial attacks for subgraph counting and show that more powerful GNNs fail to generalize even to small perturbations to the graph's structure. Expanding on this, we show that such architectures also fail to count substructures on out-of-distribution graphs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziliang Wang, Xiaohong Zhang, Kechi Zhang, Ze Shi Li, Meng Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Individual objects, whether users or services, within a specific region often exhibit similar network states due to their shared origin from the same city or autonomous system (AS). Despite this regional network similarity, many existing techniques overlook its potential, resulting in subpar performance arising from challenges such as data sparsity and label imbalance. In this paper, we introduce the regional-based dual latent state learning network(R2SL), a novel deep learning framework designed to overcome the pitfalls of traditional individual object-based prediction techniques in Quality of Service (QoS) prediction. Unlike its predecessors, R2SL captures the nuances of regional network behavior by deriving two distinct regional network latent states: the city-network latent state and the AS-network latent state. These states are constructed utilizing aggregated data from common regions rather than individual object data. Furthermore, R2SL adopts an enhanced Huber loss function that adjusts its linear loss component, providing a remedy for prevalent label imbalance issues. To cap off the prediction process, a multi-scale perception network is leveraged to interpret the integrated feature map, a fusion of regional network latent features and other pertinent information, ultimately accomplishing the QoS prediction. Through rigorous testing on real-world QoS datasets, R2SL demonstrates superior performance compared to prevailing state-of-the-art methods. Our R2SL approach ushers in an innovative avenue for precise QoS predictions by fully harnessing the regional network similarities inherent in objects.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kirill Neklyudov, Rob Brekelmans, Alexander Tong, Lazar Atanackovic, Qiang Liu, Alireza Makhzani</p>
<p>Abstract: The dynamical formulation of the optimal transport can be extended through various choices of the underlying geometry (kinetic energy), and the regularization of density paths (potential energy). These combinations yield different variational problems (Lagrangians), encompassing many variations of the optimal transport problem such as the Schr\"odinger bridge, unbalanced optimal transport, and optimal transport with physical constraints, among others. In general, the optimal density path is unknown, and solving these variational problems can be computationally challenging. We propose a novel deep learning based framework approaching all of these problems from a unified perspective. Leveraging the dual formulation of the Lagrangians, our method does not require simulating or backpropagating through the trajectories of the learned dynamics, and does not need access to optimal couplings. We showcase the versatility of the proposed framework by outperforming previous approaches for the single-cell trajectory inference, where incorporating prior knowledge into the dynamics is crucial for correct predictions.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study explores the application of self-supervised learning techniques for event sequences. It is a key modality in various applications such as banking, e-commerce, and healthcare. However, there is limited research on self-supervised learning for event sequences, and methods from other domains like images, texts, and speech may not easily transfer. To determine the most suitable approach, we conduct a detailed comparative analysis of previously identified best-performing methods. We find that neither the contrastive nor generative method is superior. Our assessment includes classifying event sequences, predicting the next event, and evaluating embedding quality. These results further highlight the potential benefits of combining both methods. Given the lack of research on hybrid models in this domain, we initially adapt the baseline model from another domain. However, upon observing its underperformance, we develop a novel method called the Multimodal-Learning Event Model (MLEM). MLEM treats contrastive learning and generative modeling as distinct yet complementary modalities, aligning their embeddings. The results of our study demonstrate that combining contrastive and generative approaches into one procedure with MLEM achieves superior performance across multiple metrics.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in deep generative models have greatly expanded the potential to create realistic synthetic health datasets. These synthetic datasets aim to preserve the characteristics, patterns, and overall scientific conclusions derived from sensitive health datasets without disclosing patient identity or sensitive information. Thus, synthetic data can facilitate safe data sharing that supports a range of initiatives including the development of new predictive models, advanced health IT platforms, and general project ideation and hypothesis development. However, many questions and challenges remain, including how to consistently evaluate a synthetic dataset's similarity and predictive utility in comparison to the original real dataset and risk to privacy when shared. Additional regulatory and governance issues have not been widely addressed. In this primer, we map the state of synthetic health data, including generation and evaluation methods and tools, existing examples of deployment, the regulatory and ethical landscape, access and governance options, and opportunities for further development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huayu Chen, Guande He, Lifan Yuan, Ganqu Cui, Hang Su, Jun Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: User intentions are typically formalized as evaluation rewards to be maximized when fine-tuning language models (LMs). Existing alignment methods, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), are mainly tailored for pairwise preference data where rewards are implicitly defined rather than explicitly given. In this paper, we introduce a general framework for LM alignment, leveraging Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) to bridge the gap in handling reward datasets explicitly annotated with scalar evaluations. Our framework comprises two parallel algorithms, NCA and InfoNCA, both enabling the direct extraction of an LM policy from reward data as well as preference data. Notably, we show that the DPO loss is a special case of our proposed InfoNCA objective under pairwise preference settings, thereby integrating and extending current alignment theories. By comparing NCA and InfoNCA, we demonstrate that the well-observed decreasing-likelihood trend of DPO/InfoNCA is caused by their focus on adjusting relative likelihood across different responses. In contrast, NCA optimizes the absolute likelihood for each response, thereby effectively preventing the chosen likelihood from decreasing. We evaluate our methods in both reward and preference settings with Mistral-8*7B and 7B models. Experiments suggest that InfoNCA/NCA surpasses various preference baselines when reward datasets are available. We also find NCA significantly outperforms DPO in complex reasoning tasks like math and coding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adam X. Yang, Maxime Robeyns, Thomas Coste, Zhengyan Shi, Jun Wang, Haitham Bou-Ammar, Laurence Aitchison</p>
<p>Abstract: To ensure that large language model (LLM) responses are helpful and non-toxic, a reward model trained on human preference data is usually used. LLM responses with high rewards are then selected through best-of-$n$ (BoN) sampling or the LLM is further optimized to produce responses with high rewards through reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However, these processes are susceptible to reward overoptimization or `hacking', where responses receive high rewards due to imperfections in the reward model rather than true preference, particularly as prompts or responses deviate from the training data. To address these challenges, we propose to train a Bayesian reward model, which signals higher uncertainty further from the training data distribution. We trained Bayesian reward models using Laplace approximation on LoRA weights, and found that the resulting uncertainty estimates can effectively mitigate reward overoptimization in BoN sampling.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13516">ProSparse: Introducing and Enhancing Intrinsic Activation Sparsity within Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenyang Song, Xu Han, Zhengyan Zhang, Shengding Hu, Xiyu Shi, Kuai Li, Chen Chen, Zhiyuan Liu, Guangli Li, Tao Yang, Maosong Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Activation sparsity refers to the existence of considerable weakly-contributed elements among activation outputs. As a prevalent property of the models using the ReLU activation function, activation sparsity has been proven a promising paradigm to boost model inference efficiency. Nevertheless, most large language models (LLMs) adopt activation functions without intrinsic activation sparsity (e.g., GELU and Swish). Some recent efforts have explored introducing ReLU or its variants as the substitutive activation function to help LLMs achieve activation sparsity and inference acceleration, but few can simultaneously obtain high sparsity and comparable model performance. This paper introduces a simple and effective sparsification method named "ProSparse" to push LLMs for higher activation sparsity while maintaining comparable performance. Specifically, after substituting the activation function of LLMs with ReLU, ProSparse adopts progressive sparsity regularization with a factor smoothly increasing along the multi-stage sine curves. This can enhance activation sparsity and mitigate performance degradation by avoiding radical shifts in activation distributions. With ProSparse, we obtain high sparsity of 89.32% for LLaMA2-7B, 88.80% for LLaMA2-13B, and 87.89% for end-size MiniCPM-1B, respectively, achieving comparable performance to their original Swish-activated versions. These present the most sparsely activated models among open-source LLaMA versions and competitive end-size models, considerably surpassing ReluLLaMA-7B (66.98%) and ReluLLaMA-13B (71.56%). Our inference acceleration experiments further demonstrate the significant practical acceleration potential of LLMs with higher activation sparsity, obtaining up to 4.52$\times$ inference speedup.</p>

<p>Abstract: We address the problem of stochastic combinatorial semi-bandits, where a player selects among $P$ actions from the power set of a set containing $d$ base items. Adaptivity to the problem's structure is essential in order to obtain optimal regret upper bounds. As estimating the coefficients of a covariance matrix can be manageable in practice, leveraging them should improve the regret. We design ``optimistic'' covariance-adaptive algorithms relying on online estimations of the covariance structure, called OLSUCBC and COSV (only the variances for the latter). They both yields improved gap-free regret. Although COSV can be slightly suboptimal, it improves on computational complexity by taking inspiration from Thompson Sampling approaches. It is the first sampling-based algorithm satisfying a $\sqrt{T}$ gap-free regret (up to poly-logs). We also show that in some cases, our approach efficiently leverages the semi-bandit feedback and outperforms bandit feedback approaches, not only in exponential regimes where $P\gg d$ but also when $P\leq d$, which is not covered by existing analyses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nazar Buzun, Maksim Bobrin, Dmitry V. Dylov</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a new approach for Neural Optimal Transport (NOT) training procedure, capable of accurately and efficiently estimating optimal transportation plan via specific regularization on dual Kantorovich potentials. The main bottleneck of existing NOT solvers is associated with the procedure of finding a near-exact approximation of the conjugate operator (i.e., the c-transform), which is done either by optimizing over non-convex max-min objectives or by the computationally intensive fine-tuning of the initial approximated prediction. We resolve both issues by proposing a new, theoretically justified loss in the form of expectile regularisation which enforces binding conditions on the learning process of dual potentials. Such a regularization provides the upper bound estimation over the distribution of possible conjugate potentials and makes the learning stable, completely eliminating the need for additional extensive fine-tuning. Proposed method, called Expectile-Regularised Neural Optimal Transport (ENOT), outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches on the established Wasserstein-2 benchmark tasks by a large margin (up to a 3-fold improvement in quality and up to a 10-fold improvement in runtime). Moreover, we showcase performance of ENOT for varying cost functions on different tasks such as image generation, showing robustness of proposed algorithm.

<p>Abstract: Parameter-efficient tunings (PETs) have demonstrated impressive performance and promising perspectives in training large models, while they are still confronted with a common problem: the trade-off between learning new content and protecting old knowledge, e.g., zero-shot generalization ability, and cross-modal hallucination. In this paper, we reformulate Adapter, LoRA, Prefix-tuning, and Prompt-tuning from the perspective of gradient projection, and firstly propose a unified framework called Parameter Efficient Gradient Projection (PEGP). We introduce orthogonal gradient projection into different PET paradigms and theoretically demonstrate that the orthogonal condition for the gradient can effectively resist forgetting even for large-scale models. It therefore modifies the gradient towards the direction that has less impact on the old feature space, with less extra memory space and training time. We extensively evaluate our method with different backbones, including ViT and CLIP, on diverse datasets, and experiments comprehensively demonstrate its efficiency in reducing forgetting in class, online class, domain, task, and multi-modality continual settings.

<p>Abstract: Dynamic graphs are pervasive in the real world, modeling dynamic relations between objects across various fields. For dynamic graph modeling, dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) have emerged as a mainstream technique, which are generally pre-trained on the link prediction task, leaving a significant gap from the objectives of downstream tasks such as node classification. To bridge the gap, prompt-based learning has gained traction on graphs. However, existing efforts focus on static graphs, neglecting the evolution of dynamic graphs. In this paper, we propose DyGPrompt, a novel pre-training and prompting framework for dynamic graph modeling. First, we design dual prompts to address the gap in both task objectives and dynamic variations across pre-training and downstream tasks. Second, we recognize that node and time features mutually characterize each other, and propose dual condition-nets to model the evolving node-time patterns in downstream tasks. Finally, we thoroughly evaluate and analyze DyGPrompt through extensive experiments on three public datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guillaume Couairon, Christian Lessig, Anastase Charantonis, Claire Monteleoni</p>
<p>Abstract: One of the guiding principles for designing AI-based weather forecasting systems is to embed physical constraints as inductive priors in the neural network architecture. A popular prior is locality, where the atmospheric data is processed with local neural interactions, like 3D convolutions or 3D local attention windows as in Pangu-Weather. On the other hand, some works have shown great success in weather forecasting without this locality principle, at the cost of a much higher parameter count. In this paper, we show that the 3D local processing in Pangu-Weather is computationally sub-optimal. We design ArchesWeather, a transformer model that combines 2D attention with a column-wise attention-based feature interaction module, and demonstrate that this design improves forecasting skill.
  ArchesWeather is trained at 1.5{\deg} resolution and 24h lead time, with a training budget of a few GPU-days and a lower inference cost than competing methods. An ensemble of four of our models shows better RMSE scores than the IFS HRES and is competitive with the 1.4{\deg} 50-members NeuralGCM ensemble for one to three days ahead forecasting.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marc Oedingen, Raphael C. Engelhardt, Robin Denz, Maximilian Hammer, Wolfgang Konen</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent times, large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides in generating computer code, blurring the lines between code created by humans and code produced by artificial intelligence (AI). As these technologies evolve rapidly, it is crucial to explore how they influence code generation, especially given the risk of misuse in areas like higher education. This paper explores this issue by using advanced classification techniques to differentiate between code written by humans and that generated by ChatGPT, a type of LLM. We employ a new approach that combines powerful embedding features (black-box) with supervised learning algorithms - including Deep Neural Networks, Random Forests, and Extreme Gradient Boosting - to achieve this differentiation with an impressive accuracy of 98%. For the successful combinations, we also examine their model calibration, showing that some of the models are extremely well calibrated. Additionally, we present white-box features and an interpretable Bayes classifier to elucidate critical differences between the code sources, enhancing the explainability and transparency of our approach. Both approaches work well but provide at most 85-88% accuracy. We also show that untrained humans solve the same task not better than random guessing. This study is crucial in understanding and mitigating the potential risks associated with using AI in code generation, particularly in the context of higher education, software development, and competitive programming.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiwei Tang, Jiangweizhi Peng, Jiasheng Tang, Mingyi Hong, Fan Wang, Tsung-Hui Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we focus on the alignment problem of diffusion models with a continuous reward function, which represents specific objectives for downstream tasks, such as improving human preference. The central goal of the alignment problem is to adjust the distribution learned by diffusion models such that the generated samples maximize the target reward function. We propose a novel alignment approach, named Direct Noise Optimization (DNO), that optimizes the injected noise during the sampling process of diffusion models. By design, DNO is tuning-free and prompt-agnostic, as the alignment occurs in an online fashion during generation. We rigorously study the theoretical properties of DNO and also propose variants to deal with non-differentiable reward functions. Furthermore, we identify that naive implementation of DNO occasionally suffers from the out-of-distribution reward hacking problem, where optimized samples have high rewards but are no longer in the support of the pretrained distribution. To remedy this issue, we leverage classical high-dimensional statistics theory and propose to augment the DNO loss with certain probability regularization. We conduct extensive experiments on several popular reward functions trained on human feedback data and demonstrate that the proposed DNO approach achieves state-of-the-art reward scores as well as high image quality, all within a reasonable time budget for generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Giuseppe Serra, Florian Buettner</p>
<p>Abstract: Given the ability to model more realistic and dynamic problems, Federated Continual Learning (FCL) has been increasingly investigated recently. A well-known problem encountered in this setting is the so-called catastrophic forgetting, for which the learning model is inclined to focus on more recent tasks while forgetting the previously learned knowledge. The majority of the current approaches in FCL propose generative-based solutions to solve said problem. However, this setting requires multiple training epochs over the data, implying an offline setting where datasets are stored locally and remain unchanged over time. Furthermore, the proposed solutions are tailored for vision tasks solely. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new modality-agnostic approach to deal with the online scenario where new data arrive in streams of mini-batches that can only be processed once. To solve catastrophic forgetting, we propose an uncertainty-aware memory-based approach. In particular, we suggest using an estimator based on the Bregman Information (BI) to compute the model's variance at the sample level. Through measures of predictive uncertainty, we retrieve samples with specific characteristics, and - by retraining the model on such samples - we demonstrate the potential of this approach to reduce the forgetting effect in realistic settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fan Xu, Nan Wang, Hao Wu, Xuezhi Wen, Dalin Zhang, Siyang Lu, Binyong Li, Wei Gong, Hai Wan, Xibin Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph-Level Anomaly Detection (GLAD) aims to distinguish anomalous graphs within a graph dataset. However, current methods are constrained by their receptive fields, struggling to learn global features within the graphs. Moreover, most contemporary methods are based on spatial domain and lack exploration of spectral characteristics. In this paper, we propose a multi-perspective hybrid graph-level anomaly detector namely GLADformer, consisting of two key modules. Specifically, we first design a Graph Transformer module with global spectrum enhancement, which ensures balanced and resilient parameter distributions by fusing global features and spectral distribution characteristics. Furthermore, to uncover local anomalous attributes, we customize a band-pass spectral GNN message passing module that further enhances the model's generalization capability. Through comprehensive experiments on ten real-world datasets from multiple domains, we validate the effectiveness and robustness of GLADformer. This demonstrates that GLADformer outperforms current state-of-the-art models in graph-level anomaly detection, particularly in effectively capturing global anomaly representations and spectral characteristics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Max M\"uller-Eberstein, Dianna Yee, Karren Yang, Gautam Varma Mantena, Colin Lea</p>
<p>Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) for personalizing automatic speech recognition (ASR) has recently shown promise for adapting general population models to atypical speech. However, these approaches assume a priori knowledge of the atypical speech disorder being adapted for -- the diagnosis of which requires expert knowledge that is not always available. Even given this knowledge, data scarcity and high inter/intra-speaker variability further limit the effectiveness of traditional fine-tuning. To circumvent these challenges, we first identify the minimal set of model parameters required for ASR adaptation. Our analysis of each individual parameter's effect on adaptation performance allows us to reduce Word Error Rate (WER) by half while adapting 0.03% of all weights. Alleviating the need for cohort-specific models, we next propose the novel use of a meta-learned hypernetwork to generate highly individualized, utterance-level adaptations on-the-fly for a diverse set of atypical speech characteristics. Evaluating adaptation at the global, cohort and individual-level, we show that hypernetworks generalize better to out-of-distribution speakers, while maintaining an overall relative WER reduction of 75.2% using 0.1% of the full parameter budget.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dulhan Jayalath, Gilad Landau, Brendan Shillingford, Mark Woolrich, Oiwi Parker Jones</p>
<p>Abstract: The past few years have produced a series of spectacular advances in the decoding of speech from brain activity. The engine of these advances has been the acquisition of labelled data, with increasingly large datasets acquired from single subjects. However, participants exhibit anatomical and other individual differences, and datasets use varied scanners and task designs. As a result, prior work has struggled to leverage data from multiple subjects, multiple datasets, multiple tasks, and unlabelled datasets. In turn, the field has not benefited from the rapidly growing number of open neural data repositories to exploit large-scale data and deep learning. To address this, we develop an initial set of neuroscience-inspired self-supervised objectives, together with a neural architecture, for representation learning from heterogeneous and unlabelled neural recordings. Experimental results show that representations learned with these objectives scale with data, generalise across subjects, datasets, and tasks, and are also learned faster than using only labelled data. In addition, we set new benchmarks for two foundational speech decoding tasks. Taken together, these methods now unlock the potential for training speech decoding models with orders of magnitude more existing data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Paul Whitten, Francis Wolff, Chris Papachristou</p>
<p>Abstract: Explainability is needed to establish confidence in machine learning results. Some explainable methods take a post hoc approach to explain the weights of machine learning models, others highlight areas of the input contributing to decisions. These methods do not adequately explain decisions, in plain terms. Explainable property-based systems have been shown to provide explanations in plain terms, however, they have not performed as well as leading unexplainable machine learning methods. This research focuses on the importance of metrics to explainability and contributes two methods yielding performance gains. The first method introduces a combination of explainable and unexplainable flows, proposing a metric to characterize explainability of a decision. The second method compares classic metrics for estimating the effectiveness of neural networks in the system, posing a new metric as the leading performer. Results from the new methods and examples from handwritten datasets are presented.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xihao Piao, Zheng Chen, Taichi Murayama, Yasuko Matsubara, Yasushi Sakurai</p>
<p>Abstract: The Transformer model has shown leading performance in time series forecasting. Nevertheless, in some complex scenarios, it tends to learn low-frequency features in the data and overlook high-frequency features, showing a frequency bias. This bias prevents the model from accurately capturing important high-frequency data features. In this paper, we undertook empirical analyses to understand this bias and discovered that frequency bias results from the model disproportionately focusing on frequency features with higher energy. Based on our analysis, we formulate this bias and propose Fredformer, a Transformer-based framework designed to mitigate frequency bias by learning features equally across different frequency bands. This approach prevents the model from overlooking lower amplitude features important for accurate forecasting. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our proposed approach, which can outperform other baselines in different real-world time-series datasets. Furthermore, we introduce a lightweight variant of the Fredformer with an attention matrix approximation, which achieves comparable performance but with much fewer parameters and lower computation costs.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pap M. Corea, Yongxin Liu, Jian Wang, Shuteng Niu, Houbing Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has become a widely discussed topic, the related technologies facilitate better understanding of conventional black-box models like Random Forest, Neural Networks and etc. However, domain-specific applications of XAI are still insufficient. To fill this gap, this research analyzes various machine learning models to the tasks of binary and multi-class classification for intrusion detection from network traffic on the same dataset using occlusion sensitivity. The models evaluated include Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, Decision Trees, and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP). We trained all models to the accuracy of 90\% on the UNSW-NB15 Dataset. We found that most classifiers leverage only less than three critical features to achieve such accuracies, indicating that effective feature engineering could actually be far more important for intrusion detection than applying complicated models. We also discover that Random Forest provides the best performance in terms of accuracy, time efficiency and robustness.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuchang Zhu, Jintang Li, Yatao Bian, Zibin Zheng, Liang Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies have highlighted fairness issues in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), where they produce discriminatory predictions against specific protected groups categorized by sensitive attributes such as race and age. While various efforts to enhance GNN fairness have made significant progress, these approaches are often tailored to specific sensitive attributes. Consequently, they necessitate retraining the model from scratch to accommodate changes in the sensitive attribute requirement, resulting in high computational costs. To gain deeper insights into this issue, we approach the graph fairness problem from a causal modeling perspective, where we identify the confounding effect induced by the sensitive attribute as the underlying reason. Motivated by this observation, we formulate the fairness problem in graphs from an invariant learning perspective, which aims to learn invariant representations across environments. Accordingly, we propose a graph fairness framework based on invariant learning, namely FairINV, which enables the training of fair GNNs to accommodate various sensitive attributes within a single training session. Specifically, FairINV incorporates sensitive attribute partition and trains fair GNNs by eliminating spurious correlations between the label and various sensitive attributes. Experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate that FairINV significantly outperforms state-of-the-art fairness approaches, underscoring its effectiveness.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yushun Zhang, Congliang Chen, Ziniu Li, Tian Ding, Chenwei Wu, Yinyu Ye, Zhi-Quan Luo, Ruoyu Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose Adam-mini, an optimizer that achieves on-par or better performance than AdamW with 45% to 50% less memory footprint. Adam-mini reduces memory by cutting down the learning rate resources in Adam (i.e., $1/\sqrt{v}$). We find that $\geq$ 90% of these learning rates in $v$ could be harmlessly removed if we (1) carefully partition the parameters into blocks following our proposed principle on Hessian structure; (2) assign a single but good learning rate to each parameter block. We further find that, for each of these parameter blocks, there exists a single high-quality learning rate that can outperform Adam, provided that sufficient resources are available to search it out. We then provide one cost-effective way to find good learning rates and propose Adam-mini. Empirically, we verify that Adam-mini performs on par or better than AdamW on various language models sized from 125M to 7B for pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and RLHF. The reduced memory footprint of Adam-mini also alleviates communication overheads among GPUs and CPUs, thereby increasing throughput. For instance, Adam-mini achieves 49.6% higher throughput than AdamW when pre-training Llama2-7B on $2\times$ A800-80GB GPUs, which saves 33% wall-clock time for pre-training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samuel Lanthaler</p>
<p>Abstract: Operator learning based on neural operators has emerged as a promising paradigm for the data-driven approximation of operators, mapping between infinite-dimensional Banach spaces. Despite significant empirical progress, our theoretical understanding regarding the efficiency of these approximations remains incomplete. This work addresses the parametric complexity of neural operator approximations for the general class of Lipschitz continuous operators. Motivated by recent findings on the limitations of specific architectures, termed curse of parametric complexity, we here adopt an information-theoretic perspective. Our main contribution establishes lower bounds on the metric entropy of Lipschitz operators in two approximation settings; uniform approximation over a compact set of input functions, and approximation in expectation, with input functions drawn from a probability measure. It is shown that these entropy bounds imply that, regardless of the activation function used, neural operator architectures attaining an approximation accuracy $\epsilon$ must have a size that is exponentially large in $\epsilon^{-1}$. The size of architectures is here measured by counting the number of encoded bits necessary to store the given model in computational memory. The results of this work elucidate fundamental trade-offs and limitations in operator learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenxu Wang, Haowei Ming, Jian He, Yao Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: The accurate prediction of drug molecule solubility is essential for determining their therapeutic effectiveness and safety, influencing the drug's ADME processes. Traditional solubility prediction techniques often fail to capture the complex nature of molecular tructures, leading to notable deviations between predictions and actual results. For example, the Discussion on Advanced Drug-Like Compound Structures. Lusci highlighted issues in capturing crucial cyclic structural information in molecules with ring structures. To overcome this issue, our research introduces a novel deep learning framework combining attention-based transformers, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), aimed at enhancing the precision of solubility predictions. Utilizing a training set of 9,943 compounds and testing on an anticancer compound dataset, our method achieved a correlation coefficient ($R^2$) of 0.55 and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.59, which outperforms the benchmark models' scores of 0.52 ($R^2$) and 0.61 (RMSE). Importantly, in an additional independent test, our model significantly outperformed the baseline with an RMSE of 1.05 compared to 1.28, a relative accuracy improvement of 45.9%. This research not only demonstrates the vast potential of deep learning for improving solubility prediction accuracy but also offers novel insights for drug design and selection in the future. Continued efforts will be directed towards optimizing the model architecture and extending its application to better support the drug development process, underscoring the pivotal role of deep learning in drug discovery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengbo Zhang, Yuxi Zhou, Jia Gong, Jun Liu, Zhigang Tu</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) enhances the performance of a student network by allowing it to learn the knowledge transferred from a teacher network incrementally. Existing methods dynamically adjust the temperature to enable the student network to adapt to the varying learning difficulties at different learning stages of KD. KD is a continuous process, but when adjusting the temperature, these methods consider only the immediate benefits of the operation in the current learning phase and fail to take into account its future returns. To address this issue, we formulate the adjustment of temperature as a sequential decision-making task and propose a method based on reinforcement learning, termed RLKD. Importantly, we design a novel state representation to enable the agent to make more informed action (i.e. instance temperature adjustment). To handle the problem of delayed rewards in our method due to the KD setting, we explore an instance reward calibration approach. In addition,we devise an efficient exploration strategy that enables the agent to learn valuable instance temperature adjustment policy more efficiently. Our framework can serve as a plug-and-play technique to be inserted into various KD methods easily, and we validate its effectiveness on both image classification and object detection tasks.

<p>Abstract: Online kernel selection is a fundamental problem of online kernel methods.In this paper,we study online kernel selection with memory constraint in which the memory of kernel selection and online prediction procedures is limited to a fixed budget. An essential question is what is the intrinsic relationship among online learnability, memory constraint, and data complexity? To answer the question,it is necessary to show the trade-offs between regret and memory constraint.Previous work gives a worst-case lower bound depending on the data size,and shows learning is impossible within a small memory constraint.In contrast, we present distinct results by offering data-dependent upper bounds that rely on two data complexities:kernel alignment and the cumulative losses of competitive hypothesis.We propose an algorithmic framework giving data-dependent upper bounds for two types of loss functions.For the hinge loss function,our algorithm achieves an expected upper bound depending on kernel alignment.For smooth loss functions,our algorithm achieves a high-probability upper bound depending on the cumulative losses of competitive hypothesis.We also prove a matching lower bound for smooth loss functions.Our results show that if the two data complexities are sub-linear,then learning is possible within a small memory constraint.Our algorithmic framework depends on a new buffer maintaining framework and a reduction from online kernel selection to prediction with expert advice. Finally,we empirically verify the prediction performance of our algorithms on benchmark datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose the Swish-T family, an enhancement of the existing non-monotonic activation function Swish. Swish-T is defined by adding a Tanh bias to the original Swish function. This modification creates a family of Swish-T variants, each designed to excel in different tasks, showcasing specific advantages depending on the application context. The Tanh bias allows for broader acceptance of negative values during initial training stages, offering a smoother non-monotonic curve than the original Swish. We ultimately propose the Swish-T$_{\textbf{C}}$ function, while Swish-T and Swish-T$_{\textbf{B}}$, byproducts of Swish-T$_{\textbf{C}}$, also demonstrate satisfactory performance. Furthermore, our ablation study shows that using Swish-T$_{\textbf{C}}$ as a non-parametric function can still achieve high performance. The superiority of the Swish-T family has been empirically demonstrated across various models and benchmark datasets, including MNIST, Fashion MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100.

<p>Abstract: With the advent of large models based on the Transformer architecture, researchers have observed an anomalous phenomenon in the Attention mechanism--there is a very high attention on the first element, which is prevalent across Transformer-based models. It is crucial to understand it for the development of techniques focusing on attention distribution, such as Key-Value (KV) Cache compression and infinite extrapolation; however, the latent cause leaves to be unknown. In this paper, we analyze such a phenomenon from the perspective of waiver phenomenon, which involves reducing the internal values of certain elements in the sequence, allowing them to absorb excess attention without affecting their contribution to information. In specific models, due to differences in positional encoding and attention patterns, we have found that the selection of waiver elements by the model can be categorized into two methods: positional-encoding-based and feature-distribution-within-elements-based.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongan Zhang, Zhongzhi Yu, Yonggan Fu, Cheng Wan, Yingyan Celine Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown promise in streamlining hardware design processes by encapsulating vast amounts of domain-specific data. In addition, they allow users to interact with the design processes through natural language instructions, thus making hardware design more accessible to developers. However, effectively leveraging LLMs in hardware design necessitates providing domain-specific data during inference (e.g., through in-context learning), fine-tuning, or pre-training. Unfortunately, existing publicly available hardware datasets are often limited in size, complexity, or detail, which hinders the effectiveness of LLMs in hardware design tasks. To address this issue, we first propose a set of criteria for creating high-quality hardware datasets that can effectively enhance LLM-assisted hardware design. Based on these criteria, we propose a Multi-Grained-Verilog (MG-Verilog) dataset, which encompasses descriptions at various levels of detail and corresponding code samples. To benefit the broader hardware design community, we have developed an open-source infrastructure that facilitates easy access, integration, and extension of the dataset to meet specific project needs. Furthermore, to fully exploit the potential of the MG-Verilog dataset, which varies in complexity and detail, we introduce a balanced fine-tuning scheme. This scheme serves as a unique use case to leverage the diverse levels of detail provided by the dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed dataset and fine-tuning scheme consistently improve the performance of LLMs in hardware design tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved impressive results on complex tasks but struggles in multi-task settings with different embodiments. World models offer scalability by learning a simulation of the environment, yet they often rely on inefficient gradient-free optimization methods. We introduce Policy learning with large World Models (PWM), a novel model-based RL algorithm that learns continuous control policies from large multi-task world models. By pre-training the world model on offline data and using it for first-order gradient policy learning, PWM effectively solves tasks with up to 152 action dimensions and outperforms methods using ground-truth dynamics. Additionally, PWM scales to an 80-task setting, achieving up to 27% higher rewards than existing baselines without the need for expensive online planning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gustav Grund Pihlgren, Konstantina Nikolaidou, Prakash Chandra Chhipa, Nosheen Abid, Rajkumar Saini, Fredrik Sandin, Marcus Liwicki</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, deep perceptual loss has been widely and successfully used to train machine learning models for many computer vision tasks, including image synthesis, segmentation, and autoencoding. Deep perceptual loss is a type of loss function for images that computes the error between two images as the distance between deep features extracted from a neural network. Most applications of the loss use pretrained networks called loss networks for deep feature extraction. However, despite increasingly widespread use, the effects of loss network implementation on the trained models have not been studied.
  This work rectifies this through a systematic evaluation of the effect of different pretrained loss networks on four different application areas. Specifically, the work evaluates 14 different pretrained architectures with four different feature extraction layers. The evaluation reveals that VGG networks without batch normalization have the best performance and that the choice of feature extraction layer is at least as important as the choice of architecture. The analysis also reveals that deep perceptual loss does not adhere to the transfer learning conventions that better ImageNet accuracy implies better downstream performance and that feature extraction from the later layers provides better performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multivariate networks are commonly found in real-world data-driven applications. Uncovering and understanding the relations of interest in multivariate networks is not a trivial task. This paper presents a visual analytics workflow for studying multivariate networks to extract associations between different structural and semantic characteristics of the networks (e.g., what are the combinations of attributes largely relating to the density of a social network?). The workflow consists of a neural-network-based learning phase to classify the data based on the chosen input and output attributes, a dimensionality reduction and optimization phase to produce a simplified set of results for examination, and finally an interpreting phase conducted by the user through an interactive visualization interface. A key part of our design is a composite variable construction step that remodels nonlinear features obtained by neural networks into linear features that are intuitive to interpret. We demonstrate the capabilities of this workflow with multiple case studies on networks derived from social media usage and also evaluate the workflow with qualitative feedback from experts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingxuan Liu, Subhankar Roy, Zhun Zhong, Nicu Sebe, Elisa Ricci</p>
<p>Abstract: Discovering novel concepts in unlabelled datasets and in a continuous manner is an important desideratum of lifelong learners. In the literature such problems have been partially addressed under very restricted settings, where novel classes are learned by jointly accessing a related labelled set (e.g., NCD) or by leveraging only a supervisedly pre-trained model (e.g., class-iNCD). In this work we challenge the status quo in class-iNCD and propose a learning paradigm where class discovery occurs continuously and truly unsupervisedly, without needing any related labelled set. In detail, we propose to exploit the richer priors from strong self-supervised pre-trained models (PTM). To this end, we propose simple baselines, composed of a frozen PTM backbone and a learnable linear classifier, that are not only simple to implement but also resilient under longer learning scenarios. We conduct extensive empirical evaluation on a multitude of benchmarks and show the effectiveness of our proposed baselines when compared with sophisticated state-of-the-art methods. The code is open source.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17401">A Framework For Refining Text Classification and Object Recognition from Academic Articles</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinghong Li, Koichi Ota, Wen Gu, Shinobu Hasegawa</p>
<p>Abstract: With the widespread use of the internet, it has become increasingly crucial to extract specific information from vast amounts of academic articles efficiently. Data mining techniques are generally employed to solve this issue. However, data mining for academic articles is challenging since it requires automatically extracting specific patterns in complex and unstructured layout documents. Current data mining methods for academic articles employ rule-based(RB) or machine learning(ML) approaches. However, using rule-based methods incurs a high coding cost for complex typesetting articles. On the other hand, simply using machine learning methods requires annotation work for complex content types within the paper, which can be costly. Furthermore, only using machine learning can lead to cases where patterns easily recognized by rule-based methods are mistakenly extracted. To overcome these issues, from the perspective of analyzing the standard layout and typesetting used in the specified publication, we emphasize implementing specific methods for specific characteristics in academic articles. We have developed a novel Text Block Refinement Framework (TBRF), a machine learning and rule-based scheme hybrid. We used the well-known ACL proceeding articles as experimental data for the validation experiment. The experiment shows that our approach achieved over 95% classification accuracy and 90% detection accuracy for tables and figures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Keqin Liu, Chengzhong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we consider a general observation model for restless multi-armed bandit problems. The operation of the player needs to be based on certain feedback mechanism that is error-prone due to resource constraints or environmental or intrinsic noises. By establishing a general probabilistic model for dynamics of feedback/observation, we formulate the problem as a restless bandit with a countable belief state space starting from an arbitrary initial belief (a priori information). We apply the achievable region method with partial conservation law (PCL) to the infinite-state problem and analyze its indexability and priority index (Whittle index). Finally, we propose an approximation process to transform the problem into which the AG algorithm of Ni\~no-Mora and Bertsimas for finite-state problems can be applied to. Numerical experiments show that our algorithm has an excellent performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pierre Clavier, Tom Huix, Alain Durmus</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and analyze a variant of the Thompson sampling (TS) algorithm for contextual bandits. At each round, traditional TS requires samples from the current posterior distribution, which is usually intractable. To circumvent this issue, approximate inference techniques can be used and provide samples with distribution close to the posteriors. However, current approximate techniques yield to either poor estimation (Laplace approximation) or can be computationally expensive (MCMC methods, Ensemble sampling...). In this paper, we propose a new algorithm, Varational Inference Thompson sampling VITS, based on Gaussian Variational Inference. This scheme provides powerful posterior approximations which are easy to sample from, and is computationally efficient, making it an ideal choice for TS. In addition, we show that VITS achieves a sub-linear regret bound of the same order in the dimension and number of round as traditional TS for linear contextual bandit. Finally, we demonstrate experimentally the effectiveness of VITS on both synthetic and real world datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Moshe Kimhi, Shai Kimhi, Evgenii Zheltonozhskii, Or Litany, Chaim Baskin</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a novel confidence refinement scheme that enhances pseudo labels in semi-supervised semantic segmentation. Unlike existing methods, which filter pixels with low-confidence predictions in isolation, our approach leverages the spatial correlation of labels in segmentation maps by grouping neighboring pixels and considering their pseudo labels collectively. With this contextual information, our method, named S4MC, increases the amount of unlabeled data used during training while maintaining the quality of the pseudo labels, all with negligible computational overhead. Through extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, we demonstrate that S4MC outperforms existing state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning approaches, offering a promising solution for reducing the cost of acquiring dense annotations. For example, S4MC achieves a 1.39 mIoU improvement over the prior art on PASCAL VOC 12 with 366 annotated images.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihan Zhang, Hong Chang Ji, Ramji Venkataramanan, Marco Mondelli</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of parameter estimation in a high-dimensional generalized linear model. Spectral methods obtained via the principal eigenvector of a suitable data-dependent matrix provide a simple yet surprisingly effective solution. However, despite their wide use, a rigorous performance characterization, as well as a principled way to preprocess the data, are available only for unstructured (i.i.d.\ Gaussian and Haar orthogonal) designs. In contrast, real-world data matrices are highly structured and exhibit non-trivial correlations. To address the problem, we consider correlated Gaussian designs capturing the anisotropic nature of the features via a covariance matrix $\Sigma$. Our main result is a precise asymptotic characterization of the performance of spectral estimators. This allows us to identify the optimal preprocessing that minimizes the number of samples needed for parameter estimation. Surprisingly, such preprocessing is universal across a broad set of designs, which partly addresses a conjecture on optimal spectral estimators for rotationally invariant models. Our principled approach vastly improves upon previous heuristic methods, including for designs common in computational imaging and genetics. The proposed methodology, based on approximate message passing, is broadly applicable and opens the way to the precise characterization of spiked matrices and of the corresponding spectral methods in a variety of settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vidya Sagar Sharma</p>
<p>Abstract: Causal DAGs (also known as Bayesian networks) are a popular tool for encoding conditional dependencies between random variables. In a causal DAG, the random variables are modeled as vertices in the DAG, and it is stipulated that every random variable is independent of its ancestors conditioned on its parents. It is possible, however, for two different causal DAGs on the same set of random variables to encode exactly the same set of conditional dependencies. Such causal DAGs are said to be Markov equivalent, and equivalence classes of Markov equivalent DAGs are known as Markov Equivalent Classes (MECs). Beautiful combinatorial characterizations of MECs have been developed in the past few decades, and it is known, in particular that all DAGs in the same MEC must have the same "skeleton" (underlying undirected graph) and v-structures (induced subgraph of the form $a\rightarrow b \leftarrow c$).
  These combinatorial characterizations also suggest several natural algorithmic questions. One of these is: given an undirected graph $G$ as input, how many distinct Markov equivalence classes have the skeleton $G$? Much work has been devoted in the last few years to this and other closely related problems. However, to the best of our knowledge, a polynomial time algorithm for the problem remains unknown.
  In this paper, we make progress towards this goal by giving a fixed parameter tractable algorithm for the above problem, with the parameters being the treewidth and the maximum degree of the input graph $G$. The main technical ingredient in our work is a construction we refer to as shadow, which lets us create a "local description" of long-range constraints imposed by the combinatorial characterizations of MECs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) models have achieved remarkable performance on various natural language processing tasks, and have shown great potential as backbones for audio-and-text large language models (LLMs). Previous mainstream audio-and-text LLMs use discrete audio tokens to represent both input and output audio; however, they suffer from performance degradation on tasks such as automatic speech recognition, speech-to-text translation, and speech enhancement over models using continuous speech features. In this paper, we propose LauraGPT, a novel unified audio-and-text GPT-based LLM for audio recognition, understanding, and generation. LauraGPT is a versatile LLM that can process both audio and text inputs and generate outputs in either modalities. We propose a novel data representation that combines continuous and discrete features for audio: LauraGPT encodes input audio into continuous representations using an audio encoder and generates output audio from discrete codec codes. We propose a one-step codec vocoder to overcome the prediction challenge caused by the multimodal distribution of codec tokens. We fine-tune LauraGPT using supervised multi-task learning. Extensive experiments show that LauraGPT consistently achieves comparable to superior performance compared to strong baselines on a wide range of audio tasks related to content, semantics, paralinguistics, and audio-signal analysis, such as automatic speech recognition, speech-to-text translation, text-to-speech synthesis, speech enhancement, automated audio captioning, speech emotion recognition, and spoken language understanding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ece Ozkan, Xavier Boix</p>
<p>Abstract: Current machine learning methods for medical image analysis primarily focus on developing models tailored for their specific tasks, utilizing data within their target domain. These specialized models tend to be data-hungry and often exhibit limitations in generalizing to out-of-distribution samples. In this work, we show that employing models that incorporate multiple domains instead of specialized ones significantly alleviates the limitations observed in specialized models. We refer to this approach as multi-domain model and compare its performance to that of specialized models. For this, we introduce the incorporation of diverse medical image domains, including different imaging modalities like X-ray, MRI, CT, and ultrasound images, as well as various viewpoints such as axial, coronal, and sagittal views. Our findings underscore the superior generalization capabilities of multi-domain models, particularly in scenarios characterized by limited data availability and out-of-distribution, frequently encountered in healthcare applications. The integration of diverse data allows multi-domain models to utilize information across domains, enhancing the overall outcomes substantially. To illustrate, for organ recognition, multi-domain model can enhance accuracy by up to 8% compared to conventional specialized models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenbang Du, Jiayu An, Yunlu Tu, Jiahao Hong, Dongrui Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Open Set Domain Adaptation (OSDA) aims to cope with the distribution and label shifts between the source and target domains simultaneously, performing accurate classification for known classes while identifying unknown class samples in the target domain. Most existing OSDA approaches, depending on the final image feature space of deep models, require manually-tuned thresholds, and may easily misclassify unknown samples as known classes. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) could be a remedy. Within a MoE, different experts handle distinct input features, producing unique expert routing patterns for various classes in a routing feature space. As a result, unknown class samples may display different expert routing patterns to known classes. In this paper, we propose Dual-Space Detection, which exploits the inconsistencies between the image feature space and the routing feature space to detect unknown class samples without any threshold. Graph Router is further introduced to better make use of the spatial information among image patches. Experiments on three different datasets validated the effectiveness and superiority of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qinyuan Ye, Maxamed Axmed, Reid Pryzant, Fereshte Khani</p>
<p>Abstract: Prompt engineering is a challenging yet crucial task for optimizing the performance of large language models on customized tasks. It requires complex reasoning to examine the model's errors, hypothesize what is missing or misleading in the current prompt, and communicate the task with clarity. While recent works indicate that large language models can be meta-prompted to perform automatic prompt engineering, we argue that their potential is limited due to insufficient guidance for complex reasoning in the meta-prompt. We fill this gap by infusing into the meta-prompt three key components: detailed descriptions, context specification, and a step-by-step reasoning template. The resulting method, named PE2, exhibits remarkable versatility across diverse language tasks. It finds prompts that outperform "let's think step by step" by 6.3% on MultiArith and 3.1% on GSM8K, and outperforms competitive baselines on counterfactual tasks by 6.9%. Further, we show that PE2 can make targeted and highly specific prompt edits, rectify erroneous prompts, and induce multi-step plans for complex tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Dialogue State Tracking (DST) models often employ intricate neural network architectures, necessitating substantial training data, and their inference process lacks transparency. This paper proposes a method that extracts linguistic knowledge via an unsupervised framework and subsequently utilizes this knowledge to augment BERT's performance and interpretability in DST tasks. The knowledge extraction procedure is computationally economical and does not require annotations or additional training data. The injection of the extracted knowledge can be achieved by the addition of simple neural modules. We employ the Convex Polytopic Model (CPM) as a feature extraction tool for DST tasks and illustrate that the acquired features correlate with syntactic and semantic patterns in the dialogues. This correlation facilitates a comprehensive understanding of the linguistic features influencing the DST model's decision-making process. We benchmark this framework on various DST tasks and observe a notable improvement in accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jos\'e Chelotti, Luciano Martinez-Rau, Mariano Ferrero, Leandro Vignolo, Julio Galli, Alejandra Planisich, H. Leonardo Rufiner, Leonardo Giovanini</p>
<p>Abstract: Livestock feeding behaviour is an influential research area for those involved in animal husbandry and agriculture. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in automated systems for monitoring the behaviour of ruminants. Despite the developments accomplished in the last decade, there is still much to do and learn about the methods for measuring and analysing livestock feeding behaviour. Automated monitoring systems mainly use motion, acoustic, and image sensors to collect animal behavioural data. The performance evaluation of existing methods is a complex task and direct comparisons between studies are difficult. Several factors prevent a direct comparison, starting from the diversity of data and performance metrics used in the experiments. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first tutorial-style review on the analysis of the feeding behaviour of ruminants, emphasising the relationship between sensing methodologies, signal processing, and computational intelligence methods. It assesses the main sensing methodologies (i.e. based on movement, sound, images/videos, and pressure) and the main techniques to measure and analyse the signals associated with feeding behaviour, evaluating their use in different settings and situations. It also highlights the potentiality of automated monitoring systems to provide valuable information that improves our understanding of livestock feeding behaviour. The relevance of these systems is increasingly important due to their impact on production systems and research. Finally, the paper closes by discussing future challenges and opportunities in livestock feeding behaviour monitoring.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dom Huh, Prasant Mohapatra</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) are widely prevalent and crucially important in numerous real-world applications, where multiple agents must make decisions to achieve their objectives in a shared environment. Despite their ubiquity, the development of intelligent decision-making agents in MAS poses several open challenges to their effective implementation. This survey examines these challenges, placing an emphasis on studying seminal concepts from game theory (GT) and machine learning (ML) and connecting them to recent advancements in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), i.e. the research of data-driven decision-making within MAS. Therefore, the objective of this survey is to provide a comprehensive perspective along the various dimensions of MARL, shedding light on the unique opportunities that are presented in MARL applications while highlighting the inherent challenges that accompany this potential. Therefore, we hope that our work will not only contribute to the field by analyzing the current landscape of MARL but also motivate future directions with insights for deeper integration of concepts from related domains of GT and ML. With this in mind, this work delves into a detailed exploration of recent and past efforts of MARL and its related fields and describes prior solutions that were proposed and their limitations, as well as their applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alonso Urbano, David W. Romero</p>
<p>Abstract: Group equivariance can overly constrain models if the symmetries in the group differ from those observed in data. While common methods address this by determining the appropriate level of symmetry at the dataset level, they are limited to supervised settings and ignore scenarios in which multiple levels of symmetry co-exist in the same dataset. In this paper, we propose a method able to detect the level of symmetry of each input without the need for labels. Our framework is general enough to accommodate different families of both continuous and discrete symmetry distributions, such as arbitrary unimodal, symmetric distributions and discrete groups. We validate the effectiveness of our approach on synthetic datasets with different per-class levels of symmetries, and demonstrate practical applications such as the detection of out-of-distribution symmetries.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alessandro Mastrototaro, Jimmy Olsson</p>
<p>Abstract: Being the most classical generative model for serial data, state-space models (SSM) are fundamental in AI and statistical machine learning. In SSM, any form of parameter learning or latent state inference typically involves the computation of complex latent-state posteriors. In this work, we build upon the variational sequential Monte Carlo (VSMC) method, which provides computationally efficient and accurate model parameter estimation and Bayesian latent-state inference by combining particle methods and variational inference. While standard VSMC operates in the offline mode, by re-processing repeatedly a given batch of data, we distribute the approximation of the gradient of the VSMC surrogate ELBO in time using stochastic approximation, allowing for online learning in the presence of streams of data. This results in an algorithm, online VSMC, that is capable of performing efficiently, entirely on-the-fly, both parameter estimation and particle proposal adaptation. In addition, we provide rigorous theoretical results describing the algorithm's convergence properties as the number of data tends to infinity as well as numerical illustrations of its excellent convergence properties and usefulness also in batch-processing settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiachen Zhao, Zhun Deng, David Madras, James Zou, Mengye Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: As the number of large language models (LLMs) released to the public grows, there is a pressing need to understand the safety implications associated with these models learning from third-party custom finetuning data. We explore the behavior of LLMs finetuned on noisy custom data containing unsafe content, represented by datasets that contain biases, toxicity, and harmfulness, finding that while aligned LLMs can readily learn this unsafe content, they also tend to forget it more significantly than other examples when subsequently finetuned on safer content. Drawing inspiration from the discrepancies in forgetting, we introduce the "ForgetFilter" algorithm, which filters unsafe data based on how strong the model's forgetting signal is for that data. We demonstrate that the ForgetFilter algorithm ensures safety in customized finetuning without compromising downstream task performance, unlike sequential safety finetuning. ForgetFilter outperforms alternative strategies like replay and moral self-correction in curbing LLMs' ability to assimilate unsafe content during custom finetuning, e.g. 75% lower than not applying any safety measures and 62% lower than using self-correction in toxicity score.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruoqi Wen, Jiahao Huang, Rongpeng Li, Guoru Ding, Zhifeng Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) have attracted significant attention in recent years and Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown remarkable performance in improving the autonomy of vehicles. In that regard, the widely adopted Model-Free RL (MFRL) promises to solve decision-making tasks in connected AVs (CAVs), contingent on the readiness of a significant amount of data samples for training. Nevertheless, it might be infeasible in practice and possibly lead to learning instability. In contrast, Model-Based RL (MBRL) manifests itself in sample-efficient learning, but the asymptotic performance of MBRL might lag behind the state-of-the-art MFRL algorithms. Furthermore, most studies for CAVs are limited to the decision-making of a single AV only, thus underscoring the performance due to the absence of communications. In this study, we try to address the decision-making problem of multiple CAVs with limited communications and propose a decentralized Multi-Agent Probabilistic Ensembles with Trajectory Sampling algorithm MA-PETS. In particular, in order to better capture the uncertainty of the unknown environment, MA-PETS leverages Probabilistic Ensemble (PE) neural networks to learn from communicated samples among neighboring CAVs. Afterwards, MA-PETS capably develops Trajectory Sampling (TS)-based model-predictive control for decision-making. On this basis, we derive the multi-agent group regret bound affected by the number of agents within the communication range and mathematically validate that incorporating effective information exchange among agents into the multi-agent learning scheme contributes to reducing the group regret bound in the worst case. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the superiority of MA-PETS in terms of the sample efficiency comparable to MFBL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shanshan Wang, Mamadou Diagne, Miroslav Krsti\'c</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural network approximation of nonlinear operators, commonly referred to as DeepONet, has proven capable of approximating PDE backstepping designs in which a single Goursat-form PDE governs a single feedback gain function. In boundary control of coupled PDEs, coupled Goursat-form PDEs govern two or more gain kernels-a PDE structure unaddressed thus far with DeepONet. In this paper, we explore the subject of approximating systems of gain kernel PDEs for hyperbolic PDE plants by considering a simple counter-convecting $2\times 2$ coupled system in whose control a $2\times 2$ kernel PDE system in Goursat form arises. Engineering applications include oil drilling, the Saint-Venant model of shallow water waves, and the Aw-Rascle-Zhang model of stop-and-go instability in congested traffic flow. We establish the continuity of the mapping from a total of five plant PDE functional coefficients to the kernel PDE solutions, prove the existence of an arbitrarily close DeepONet approximation to the kernel PDEs, and ensure that the DeepONet-approximated gains guarantee stabilization when replacing the exact backstepping gain kernels. Taking into account anti-collocated boundary actuation and sensing, our $L^2$-Globally-exponentially stabilizing (GES) approximate gain kernel-based output feedback design implies the deep learning of both the controller's and the observer's gains. Moreover, the encoding of the output-feedback law into DeepONet ensures semi-global practical exponential stability (SG-PES). The DeepONet operator speeds up the computation of the controller gains by multiple orders of magnitude. Its theoretically proven stabilizing capability is demonstrated through simulations.</p>

Then, Synergy maximizes the inference throughput of concurrent AI models by creating various execution plans for each app considering AI accelerator availability and intelligently selecting the best set of execution plans. Synergy further improves throughput by leveraging parallelization opportunities over multiple computation units. Our evaluations with 7 baselines and 8 models demonstrate that, on average, Synergy achieves a 23.0 times improvement in throughput, while reducing latency by 73.9% and power consumption by 15.8%, compared to the baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep learning techniques hold immense promise for advancing medical image analysis, particularly in tasks like image segmentation, where precise annotation of regions or volumes of interest within medical images is crucial but manually laborious and prone to interobserver and intraobserver biases. As such, deep learning approaches could provide automated solutions for such applications. However, the potential of these techniques is often undermined by challenges in reproducibility and generalizability, which are key barriers to their clinical adoption. This paper introduces the RIDGE checklist, a comprehensive framework designed to assess the Reproducibility, Integrity, Dependability, Generalizability, and Efficiency of deep learning-based medical image segmentation models. The RIDGE checklist is not just a tool for evaluation but also a guideline for researchers striving to improve the quality and transparency of their work. By adhering to the principles outlined in the RIDGE checklist, researchers can ensure that their developed segmentation models are robust, scientifically valid, and applicable in a clinical setting.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) leaderboards based on benchmark rankings are regularly used to guide practitioners in model selection. Often, the published leaderboard rankings are taken at face value - we show this is a (potentially costly) mistake. Under existing leaderboards, the relative performance of LLMs is highly sensitive to (often minute) details. We show that for popular multiple-choice question benchmarks (e.g., MMLU), minor perturbations to the benchmark, such as changing the order of choices or the method of answer selection, result in changes in rankings up to 8 positions. We explain this phenomenon by conducting systematic experiments over three broad categories of benchmark perturbations and identifying the sources of this behavior. Our analysis results in several best-practice recommendations, including the advantage of a hybrid scoring method for answer selection. Our study highlights the dangers of relying on simple benchmark evaluations and charts the path for more robust evaluation schemes on the existing benchmarks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anna Yoo Jeong Ha, Josephine Passananti, Ronik Bhaskar, Shawn Shan, Reid Southen, Haitao Zheng, Ben Y. Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: The advent of generative AI images has completely disrupted the art world. Distinguishing AI generated images from human art is a challenging problem whose impact is growing over time. A failure to address this problem allows bad actors to defraud individuals paying a premium for human art and companies whose stated policies forbid AI imagery. It is also critical for content owners to establish copyright, and for model trainers interested in curating training data in order to avoid potential model collapse.
  There are several different approaches to distinguishing human art from AI images, including classifiers trained by supervised learning, research tools targeting diffusion models, and identification by professional artists using their knowledge of artistic techniques. In this paper, we seek to understand how well these approaches can perform against today's modern generative models in both benign and adversarial settings. We curate real human art across 7 styles, generate matching images from 5 generative models, and apply 8 detectors (5 automated detectors and 3 different human groups including 180 crowdworkers, 4000+ professional artists, and 13 expert artists experienced at detecting AI). Both Hive and expert artists do very well, but make mistakes in different ways (Hive is weaker against adversarial perturbations while Expert artists produce higher false positives). We believe these weaknesses will remain as models continue to evolve, and use our data to demonstrate why a combined team of human and automated detectors provides the best combination of accuracy and robustness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jongwoo Ko, Sungnyun Kim, Tianyi Chen, Se-Young Yun</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is widely used for compressing a teacher model to a smaller student model, reducing its inference cost and memory footprint while preserving model capabilities. However, current KD methods for auto-regressive sequence models (e.g., large language models) suffer from missing a standardized objective function. Moreover, the recent use of student-generated outputs to address training-inference mismatches has significantly escalated computational costs. To tackle these issues, we introduce DistiLLM, a more effective and efficient KD framework for auto-regressive language models. DistiLLM comprises two components: (1) a novel skew Kullback-Leibler divergence loss, where we unveil and leverage its theoretical properties, and (2) an adaptive off-policy approach designed to enhance the efficiency in utilizing student-generated outputs. Extensive experiments, including instruction-following tasks, demonstrate the effectiveness of DistiLLM in building high-performing student models while achieving up to 4.3$\times$ speedup compared to recent KD methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinghong Li, Huy Phan, Wen Gu, Koichi Ota, Shinobu Hasegawa</p>
<p>Abstract: Research surveys have always posed a challenge for beginner researchers who lack of research training. These researchers struggle to understand the directions within their research topic, and the discovery of new research findings within a short time. One way to provide intuitive assistance to beginner researchers is by offering relevant knowledge graphs(KG) and recommending related academic papers. However, existing navigation knowledge graphs primarily rely on keywords in the research field and often fail to present the logical hierarchy among multiple related papers clearly. Moreover, most recommendation systems for academic papers simply rely on high text similarity, which can leave researchers confused as to why a particular article is being recommended. They may lack of grasp important information about the insight connection between "Issue resolved" and "Issue finding" that they hope to obtain. To address these issues, this study aims to support research insight surveys for beginner researchers by establishing a hierarchical tree-structured knowledge graph that reflects the inheritance insight of research topics and the relevance insight among the academic papers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anton Kuznietsov, Balint Gyevnar, Cheng Wang, Steven Peters, Stefano V. Albrecht</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) shows promising applications for the perception and planning tasks in autonomous driving (AD) due to its superior performance compared to conventional methods. However, inscrutable AI systems exacerbate the existing challenge of safety assurance of AD. One way to mitigate this challenge is to utilize explainable AI (XAI) techniques. To this end, we present the first comprehensive systematic literature review of explainable methods for safe and trustworthy AD. We begin by analyzing the requirements for AI in the context of AD, focusing on three key aspects: data, model, and agency. We find that XAI is fundamental to meeting these requirements. Based on this, we explain the sources of explanations in AI and describe a taxonomy of XAI. We then identify five key contributions of XAI for safe and trustworthy AI in AD, which are interpretable design, interpretable surrogate models, interpretable monitoring, auxiliary explanations, and interpretable validation. Finally, we propose a modular framework called SafeX to integrate these contributions, enabling explanation delivery to users while simultaneously ensuring the safety of AI models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arka Pal, Deep Karkhanis, Samuel Dooley, Manley Roberts, Siddartha Naidu, Colin White</p>
<p>Abstract: Direct Preference Optimisation (DPO) is effective at significantly improving the performance of large language models (LLMs) on downstream tasks such as reasoning, summarisation, and alignment. Using pairs of preferred and dispreferred data, DPO models the relative probability of picking one response over another. In this work, first we show theoretically that the standard DPO loss can lead to a reduction of the model's likelihood of the preferred examples, as long as the relative probability between the preferred and dispreferred classes increases. We then show empirically that this phenomenon occurs when fine-tuning LLMs on common datasets, especially datasets in which the edit distance between pairs of completions is low. Using these insights, we design DPO-Positive (DPOP), a new loss function and training procedure which avoids this failure mode. Surprisingly, we find that DPOP outperforms DPO and other fine-tuning procedures across a wide variety of datasets and downstream tasks, including datasets with high edit distances between completions. Furthermore, we find that the DPOP-tuned model outperforms the DPO-tuned model (all else equal) on benchmarks independent of the fine-tuning data, such as MT-Bench. Finally, using DPOP, we create and open-source Smaug-34B and Smaug-72B, with the latter becoming the first open-source LLM to surpass an average accuracy of 80% on the HuggingFace Open LLM Leaderboard.</p>

<p>Abstract: Traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) policies are typically implemented with fixed control rates, often disregarding the impact of control rate selection. This can lead to inefficiencies as the optimal control rate varies with task requirements. We propose the Multi-Objective Soft Elastic Actor-Critic (MOSEAC), an off-policy actor-critic algorithm that uses elastic time steps to dynamically adjust the control frequency. This approach minimizes computational resources by selecting the lowest viable frequency. We show that MOSEAC converges and produces stable policies at the theoretical level, and validate our findings in a real-time 3D racing game. MOSEAC significantly outperformed other variable time step approaches in terms of energy efficiency and task effectiveness. Additionally, MOSEAC demonstrated faster and more stable training, showcasing its potential for real-world RL applications in robotics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuchen Xue, Zhaoqiang Liu, Fei Chen, Shifeng Zhang, Tianyang Hu, Enze Xie, Zhenguo Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have shown remarkable performance in high-resolution image synthesis, but their sampling efficiency is still to be desired due to the typically large number of sampling steps. Recent advancements in high-order numerical ODE solvers for DPMs have enabled the generation of high-quality images with much fewer sampling steps. While this is a significant development, most sampling methods still employ uniform time steps, which is not optimal when using a small number of steps. To address this issue, we propose a general framework for designing an optimization problem that seeks more appropriate time steps for a specific numerical ODE solver for DPMs. This optimization problem aims to minimize the distance between the ground-truth solution to the ODE and an approximate solution corresponding to the numerical solver. It can be efficiently solved using the constrained trust region method, taking less than $15$ seconds. Our extensive experiments on both unconditional and conditional sampling using pixel- and latent-space DPMs demonstrate that, when combined with the state-of-the-art sampling method UniPC, our optimized time steps significantly improve image generation performance in terms of FID scores for datasets such as CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, compared to using uniform time steps.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Carlos Bermejo-Barbanoj, Beatriz Moya, Alberto Bad\'ias, Francisco Chinesta, El\'ias Cueto</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a method to increase the resolution of measurements of a physical system and subsequently predict its time evolution using thermodynamics-aware neural networks. Our method uses adversarial autoencoders, which reduce the dimensionality of the full order model to a set of latent variables that are enforced to match a prior, for example a normal distribution. Adversarial autoencoders are seen as generative models, and they can be trained to generate high-resolution samples from low-resoution inputs, meaning they can address the so-called super-resolution problem. Then, a second neural network is trained to learn the physical structure of the latent variables and predict their temporal evolution. This neural network is known as an structure-preserving neural network. It learns the metriplectic-structure of the system and applies a physical bias to ensure that the first and second principles of thermodynamics are fulfilled. The integrated trajectories are decoded to their original dimensionality, as well as to the higher dimensionality space produced by the adversarial autoencoder and they are compared to the ground truth solution. The method is tested with two examples of flow over a cylinder, where the fluid properties are varied between both examples.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00849">NeuraLUT: Hiding Neural Network Density in Boolean Synthesizable Functions</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Marta Andronic, George A. Constantinides</p>
<p>Abstract: Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) accelerators have proven successful in handling latency- and resource-critical deep neural network (DNN) inference tasks. Among the most computationally intensive operations in a neural network (NN) is the dot product between the feature and weight vectors. Thus, some previous FPGA acceleration works have proposed mapping neurons with quantized inputs and outputs directly to lookup tables (LUTs) for hardware implementation. In these works, the boundaries of the neurons coincide with the boundaries of the LUTs. We propose relaxing these boundaries and mapping entire sub-networks to a single LUT. As the sub-networks are absorbed within the LUT, the NN topology and precision within a partition do not affect the size of the lookup tables generated. Therefore, we utilize fully connected layers with floating-point precision inside each partition, which benefit from being universal function approximators, but with rigid sparsity and quantization enforced between partitions, where the NN topology becomes exposed to the circuit topology. Although cheap to implement, this approach can lead to very deep NNs, and so to tackle challenges like vanishing gradients, we also introduce skip connections inside the partitions. The resulting methodology can be seen as training DNNs with a specific FPGA hardware-inspired sparsity pattern that allows them to be mapped to much shallower circuit-level networks, thereby significantly improving latency. We validate our proposed method on a known latency-critical task, jet substructure tagging, and on the classical computer vision task, digit classification using MNIST. Our approach allows for greater function expressivity within the LUTs compared to existing work, leading to up to $4.3\times$ lower latency NNs for the same accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingzhi Gong, Tao Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Performance is arguably the most crucial attribute that reflects the quality of a configurable software system. However, given the increasing scale and complexity of modern software, modeling and predicting how various configurations can impact performance becomes one of the major challenges in software maintenance. As such, performance is often modeled without having a thorough knowledge of the software system, but relying mainly on data, which fits precisely with the purpose of deep learning.
  In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive review exclusively on the topic of deep learning for performance learning of configurable software, covering 1,206 searched papers spanning six indexing services, based on which 99 primary papers were extracted and analyzed. Our results outline key statistics, taxonomy, strengths, weaknesses, and optimal usage scenarios for techniques related to the preparation of configuration data, the construction of deep learning performance models, the evaluation of these models, and their utilization in various software configuration-related tasks.We also identify the good practices and potentially problematic phenomena from the studies surveyed, together with a comprehensive summary of actionable suggestions and insights into future opportunities within the field.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Cai, Constantinos Daskalakis, Haipeng Luo, Chen-Yu Wei, Weiqiang Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: While Online Gradient Descent and other no-regret learning procedures are known to efficiently converge to a coarse correlated equilibrium in games where each agent's utility is concave in their own strategy, this is not the case when utilities are non-concave -- a common scenario in machine learning applications involving strategies parameterized by deep neural networks, or when agents' utilities are computed by neural networks, or both. Non-concave games introduce significant game-theoretic and optimization challenges: (i) Nash equilibria may not exist; (ii) local Nash equilibria, though existing, are intractable; and (iii) mixed Nash, correlated, and coarse correlated equilibria generally have infinite support and are intractable. To sidestep these challenges, we revisit the classical solution concept of $\Phi$-equilibria introduced by Greenwald and Jafari [2003], which is guaranteed to exist for an arbitrary set of strategy modifications $\Phi$ even in non-concave games [Stoltz and Lugosi, 2007]. However, the tractability of $\Phi$-equilibria in such games remains elusive. In this paper, we initiate the study of tractable $\Phi$-equilibria in non-concave games and examine several natural families of strategy modifications. We show that when $\Phi$ is finite, there exists an efficient uncoupled learning algorithm that converges to the corresponding $\Phi$-equilibria. Additionally, we explore cases where $\Phi$ is infinite but consists of local modifications, showing that Online Gradient Descent can efficiently approximate $\Phi$-equilibria in non-trivial regimes.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present Jamba, a new base large language model based on a novel hybrid Transformer-Mamba mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture. Specifically, Jamba interleaves blocks of Transformer and Mamba layers, enjoying the benefits of both model families. MoE is added in some of these layers to increase model capacity while keeping active parameter usage manageable. This flexible architecture allows resource- and objective-specific configurations. In the particular configuration we have implemented, we end up with a powerful model that fits in a single 80GB GPU. Built at large scale, Jamba provides high throughput and small memory footprint compared to vanilla Transformers, and at the same time state-of-the-art performance on standard language model benchmarks and long-context evaluations. Remarkably, the model presents strong results for up to 256K tokens context length. We study various architectural decisions, such as how to combine Transformer and Mamba layers, and how to mix experts, and show that some of them are crucial in large scale modeling. We also describe several interesting properties of these architectures which the training and evaluation of Jamba have revealed, and plan to release checkpoints from various ablation runs, to encourage further exploration of this novel architecture. We make the weights of our implementation of Jamba publicly available under a permissive license.</p>

<p>Abstract: Comparing two samples of data, we observe a change in the distribution of an outcome variable. In the presence of multiple explanatory variables, how much of the change can be explained by each possible cause? We develop a new estimation strategy that, given a causal model, combines regression and re-weighting methods to quantify the contribution of each causal mechanism. Our proposed methodology is multiply robust, meaning that it still recovers the target parameter under partial misspecification. We prove that our estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal. Moreover, it can be incorporated into existing frameworks for causal attribution, such as Shapley values, which will inherit the consistency and large-sample distribution properties. Our method demonstrates excellent performance in Monte Carlo simulations, and we show its usefulness in an empirical application. Our method is implemented as part of the Python library DoWhy (arXiv:2011.04216, arXiv:2206.06821).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jose M. Munoz, Silviu M. Udrescu, Ronald F. Garcia Ruiz</p>
<p>Abstract: Numerous phenomenological nuclear models have been proposed to describe specific observables within different regions of the nuclear chart. However, developing a unified model that describes the complex behavior of all nuclei remains an open challenge. Here, we explore whether novel symbolic Machine Learning (ML) can rediscover traditional nuclear physics models or identify alternatives with improved simplicity, fidelity, and predictive power. To address this challenge, we developed a Multi-objective Iterated Symbolic Regression approach that handles symbolic regressions over multiple target observables, accounts for experimental uncertainties and is robust against high-dimensional problems. As a proof of principle, we applied this method to describe the nuclear binding energies and charge radii of light and medium mass nuclei. Our approach identified simple analytical relationships based on the number of protons and neutrons, providing interpretable models with precision comparable to state-of-the-art nuclear models. Additionally, we integrated this ML-discovered model with an existing complementary model to estimate the limits of nuclear stability. These results highlight the potential of symbolic ML to develop accurate nuclear models and guide our description of complex many-body problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emile van Krieken, Samy Badreddine, Robin Manhaeve, Eleonora Giunchiglia</p>
<p>Abstract: The field of neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence (NeSy), which combines learning and reasoning, has recently experienced significant growth. There now are a wide variety of NeSy frameworks, each with its own specific language for expressing background knowledge and how to relate it to neural networks. This heterogeneity hinders accessibility for newcomers and makes comparing different NeSy frameworks challenging. We propose a unified language for NeSy, which we call ULLER, a Unified Language for LEarning and Reasoning. ULLER encompasses a wide variety of settings, while ensuring that knowledge described in it can be used in existing NeSy systems. ULLER has a neuro-symbolic first-order syntax for which we provide example semantics including classical, fuzzy, and probabilistic logics. We believe ULLER is a first step towards making NeSy research more accessible and comparable, paving the way for libraries that streamline training and evaluation across a multitude of semantics, knowledge bases, and NeSy systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this article, we explore the potential of using latent diffusion models, a family of powerful generative models, for the task of reconstructing naturalistic music from electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. Unlike simpler music with limited timbres, such as MIDI-generated tunes or monophonic pieces, the focus here is on intricate music featuring a diverse array of instruments, voices, and effects, rich in harmonics and timbre. This study represents an initial foray into achieving general music reconstruction of high-quality using non-invasive EEG data, employing an end-to-end training approach directly on raw data without the need for manual pre-processing and channel selection. We train our models on the public NMED-T dataset and perform quantitative evaluation proposing neural embedding-based metrics. We additionally perform song classification based on the generated tracks. Our work contributes to the ongoing research in neural decoding and brain-computer interfaces, offering insights into the feasibility of using EEG data for complex auditory information reconstruction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexandre Pich\'e, Aristides Milios, Dzmitry Bahdanau, Chris Pal</p>
<p>Abstract: In order to be deployed safely, Large Language Models (LLMs) must be capable of dynamically adapting their behavior based on their level of knowledge and uncertainty associated with specific topics. This adaptive behavior, which we refer to as self-restraint, is non-trivial to teach since it depends on the internal knowledge of an LLM. By default, LLMs are trained to maximize the next token likelihood, which does not teach the model to modulate its answer based on its level of uncertainty. In order to learn self-restraint, we devise a utility function that can encourage the model to produce responses only when it is confident in them. This utility function can be used to score generation of different length and abstention. To optimize this function, we introduce ReSearch, a process of "self-reflection" consisting of iterative self-prompting and self-evaluation. We use the ReSearch algorithm to generate synthetic data on which we finetune our models. Compared to their original versions, our resulting models generate fewer \emph{hallucinations} overall at no additional inference cost, for both known and unknown topics, as the model learns to selectively restrain itself. In addition, our method elegantly incorporates the ability to abstain by augmenting the samples generated by the model during the search procedure with an answer expressing abstention.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lynn Chua, Badih Ghazi, Yangsibo Huang, Pritish Kamath, Ravi Kumar, Daogao Liu, Pasin Manurangsi, Amer Sinha, Chiyuan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for tackling complex tasks across diverse domains, but they also raise privacy concerns when fine-tuned on sensitive data due to potential memorization. While differential privacy (DP) offers a promising solution by ensuring models are 'almost indistinguishable' with or without any particular privacy unit, current evaluations on LLMs mostly treat each example (text record) as the privacy unit. This leads to uneven user privacy guarantees when contributions per user vary. We therefore study user-level DP motivated by applications where it necessary to ensure uniform privacy protection across users. We present a systematic evaluation of user-level DP for LLM fine-tuning on natural language generation tasks. Focusing on two mechanisms for achieving user-level DP guarantees, Group Privacy and User-wise DP-SGD, we investigate design choices like data selection strategies and parameter tuning for the best privacy-utility tradeoff.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruohan Zhan, Shichao Han, Yuchen Hu, Zhenling Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recommender systems are essential for content-sharing platforms by curating personalized content. To evaluate updates to recommender systems targeting content creators, platforms frequently rely on creator-side randomized experiments. The treatment effect measures the change in outcomes when a new algorithm is implemented compared to the status quo. We show that the standard difference-in-means estimator can lead to biased estimates due to recommender interference that arises when treated and control creators compete for exposure. We propose a "recommender choice model" that describes which item gets exposed from a pool containing both treated and control items. By combining a structural choice model with neural networks, this framework directly models the interference pathway while accounting for rich viewer-content heterogeneity. We construct a debiased estimator of the treatment effect and prove it is $\sqrt n$-consistent and asymptotically normal with potentially correlated samples. We validate our estimator's empirical performance with a field experiment on Weixin short-video platform. In addition to the standard creator-side experiment, we conduct a costly double-sided randomization design to obtain a benchmark estimate free from interference bias. We show that the proposed estimator yields results comparable to the benchmark, whereas the standard difference-in-means estimator can exhibit significant bias and even produce reversed signs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cheng-Yu Hsieh, Yung-Sung Chuang, Chun-Liang Li, Zifeng Wang, Long T. Le, Abhishek Kumar, James Glass, Alexander Ratner, Chen-Yu Lee, Ranjay Krishna, Tomas Pfister</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), even when specifically trained to process long input contexts, struggle to capture relevant information located in the middle of their input. This phenomenon has been known as the lost-in-the-middle problem. In this work, we make three contributions. First, we set out to understand the factors that cause this phenomenon. In doing so, we establish a connection between lost-in-the-middle to LLMs' intrinsic attention bias: LLMs exhibit a U-shaped attention bias where the tokens at the beginning and at the end of its input receive higher attention, regardless of their relevance. Second, we mitigate this positional bias through a calibration mechanism, found-in-the-middle, that allows the model to attend to contexts faithfully according to their relevance, even though when they are in the middle. Third, we show found-in-the-middle not only achieves better performance in locating relevant information within a long context, but also eventually leads to improved retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) performance across various tasks, outperforming existing methods by up to 15 percentage points. These findings open up future directions in understanding LLM attention bias and its potential consequences.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shane Arora, Marzena Karpinska, Hung-Ting Chen, Ipsita Bhattacharjee, Mohit Iyyer, Eunsol Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are used for long-form question answering (LFQA), which requires them to generate paragraph-length answers to complex questions. While LFQA has been well-studied in English, this research has not been extended to other languages. To bridge this gap, we introduce CaLMQA, a collection of 1.5K complex culturally specific questions spanning 23 languages and 51 culturally agnostic questions translated from English into 22 other languages. We define culturally specific questions as those uniquely or more likely to be asked by people from cultures associated with the question's language. We collect naturally-occurring questions from community web forums and hire native speakers to write questions to cover under-resourced, rarely-studied languages such as Fijian and Kirundi. Our dataset contains diverse, complex questions that reflect cultural topics (e.g. traditions, laws, news) and the language usage of native speakers. We automatically evaluate a suite of open- and closed-source models on CaLMQA by detecting incorrect language and token repetitions in answers, and observe that the quality of LLM-generated answers degrades significantly for some low-resource languages. Lastly, we perform human evaluation on a subset of models and languages. Manual evaluation reveals that model performance is significantly worse for culturally specific questions than for culturally agnostic questions. Our findings highlight the need for further research in non-English LFQA and provide an evaluation framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Liu, Yitong Wang, Chenyue Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: Effective representation learning in sequential recommendation systems is pivotal for precisely capturing user interaction patterns and enhancing recommendation accuracy. Nonetheless, current methodologies largely focus on item-to-item transitions, frequently overlooking the time intervals between interactions, which are integral to understanding behavior pattern shifts. Moreover, critical interaction attributes like item frequency are often neglected. Our research indicates that sequences with more consistent time intervals and items with higher interaction frequency result in superior predictive performance. In contrast, sequences with non-uniform intervals contribute to user interest drift, and infrequently interacted items are challenging to model due to sparse data, posing unique challenges that existing methods fail to adequately address. In this study, we introduce UFRec, an innovative bidirectional enhancement method for sequential recommendations. UFRec harnesses sequence uniformity and item frequency to boost performance, particularly improving the representation of non-uniform sequences and less-frequent items. These two components synergistically enhance each other, driving holistic performance optimization in intricate sequential recommendation scenarios. Additionally, we introduce a multidimensional time module to further augment adaptability. To the best of our knowledge, UFRec is the pioneering method to exploit the properties of uniformity and frequency for feature augmentation. Through comparisons with eleven state-of-the-art models across four datasets, we demonstrate that UFRec significantly surpasses current leading models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Wang, Vikram Ravindra, Ananth Grama</p>
<p>Abstract: Task-specific functional MRI (fMRI) images provide excellent modalities for studying the neuronal basis of cognitive processes. We use fMRI data to formulate and solve the problem of deconvolving task-specific aggregate neuronal networks into a set of basic building blocks called canonical networks, to use these networks for functional characterization, and to characterize the physiological basis of these responses by mapping them to regions of the brain. Our results show excellent task-specificity of canonical networks, i.e., the expression of a small number of canonical networks can be used to accurately predict tasks; generalizability across cohorts, i.e., canonical networks are conserved across diverse populations, studies, and acquisition protocols; and that canonical networks have strong anatomical and physiological basis. From a methods perspective, the problem of identifying these canonical networks poses challenges rooted in the high dimensionality, small sample size, acquisition variability, and noise. Our deconvolution technique is based on non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) that identifies canonical networks as factors of a suitably constructed matrix. We demonstrate that our method scales to large datasets, yields stable and accurate factors, and is robust to noise.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00599">Parm: Efficient Training of Large Sparsely-Activated Models with Dedicated Schedules</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinglin Pan, Wenxiang Lin, Shaohuai Shi, Xiaowen Chu, Weinong Sun, Bo Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Sparsely-activated Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) layers have found practical applications in enlarging the model size of large-scale foundation models, with only a sub-linear increase in computation demands. Despite the wide adoption of hybrid parallel paradigms like model parallelism, expert parallelism, and expert-sharding parallelism (i.e., MP+EP+ESP) to support MoE model training on GPU clusters, the training efficiency is hindered by communication costs introduced by these parallel paradigms. To address this limitation, we propose Parm, a system that accelerates MP+EP+ESP training by designing two dedicated schedules for placing communication tasks. The proposed schedules eliminate redundant computations and communications and enable overlaps between intra-node and inter-node communications, ultimately reducing the overall training time. As the two schedules are not mutually exclusive, we provide comprehensive theoretical analyses and derive an automatic and accurate solution to determine which schedule should be applied in different scenarios. Experimental results on an 8-GPU server and a 32-GPU cluster demonstrate that Parm outperforms the state-of-the-art MoE training system, DeepSpeed-MoE, achieving 1.13$\times$ to 5.77$\times$ speedup on 1296 manually configured MoE layers and approximately 3$\times$ improvement on two real-world MoE models based on BERT and GPT-2.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00741">Diffusion Models for Offline Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning with Safety Constraints</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianuo Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent advancements in Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), its application has extended to various safety-critical scenarios. However, most methods focus on online learning, which presents substantial risks when deployed in real-world settings. Addressing this challenge, we introduce an innovative framework integrating diffusion models within the MARL paradigm. This approach notably enhances the safety of actions taken by multiple agents through risk mitigation while modeling coordinated action. Our framework is grounded in the Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) architecture, augmented by a Diffusion Model for prediction trajectory generation. Additionally, we incorporate a specialized algorithm to further ensure operational safety. We evaluate our model against baselines on the DSRL benchmark. Experiment results demonstrate that our model not only adheres to stringent safety constraints but also achieves superior performance compared to existing methodologies. This underscores the potential of our approach in advancing the safety and efficacy of MARL in real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rafael Cerna Loli, Bruno Clerckx</p>
<p>Abstract: Optimization algorithms for wireless systems play a fundamental role in improving their performance and efficiency. However, it is known that the complexity of conventional optimization algorithms in the literature often exponentially increases with the number of transmit antennas and communication users in the wireless system. Therefore, in the large scale regime, the astronomically large complexity of these optimization algorithms prohibits their use and prevents assessing large scale wireless systems performance under optimized conditions. To overcome this limitation, this work proposes instead the use of an unsupervised meta-learning based approach to directly perform non-convex optimization at significantly reduced complexity. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed meta-learning based solution, the sum-rate (SR) maximization problem for the following three emerging 6G technologies is contemplated: hierarchical rate-splitting multiple access (H-RSMA), integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), and beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (BD-RIS). Through numerical results, it is demonstrated that the proposed meta-learning based optimization framework is able to successfully optimize the performance and also reveal unknown aspects of the operation in the large scale regime for the considered three 6G technologies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sanjoy Chowdhury, Sayan Nag, Subhrajyoti Dasgupta, Jun Chen, Mohamed Elhoseiny, Ruohan Gao, Dinesh Manocha</p>
<p>Abstract: Leveraging Large Language Models' remarkable proficiency in text-based tasks, recent works on Multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs) extend them to other modalities like vision and audio. However, the progress in these directions has been mostly focused on tasks that only require a coarse-grained understanding of the audio-visual semantics. We present Meerkat, an audio-visual LLM equipped with a fine-grained understanding of image and audio both spatially and temporally. With a new modality alignment module based on optimal transport and a cross-attention module that enforces audio-visual consistency, Meerkat can tackle challenging tasks such as audio referred image grounding, image guided audio temporal localization, and audio-visual fact-checking. Moreover, we carefully curate a large dataset AVFIT that comprises 3M instruction tuning samples collected from open-source datasets, and introduce MeerkatBench that unifies five challenging audio-visual tasks. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on all these downstream tasks with a relative improvement of up to 37.12%.</p>
