<p><b>Authors:</b> Daoyuan Li, Zuyuan Yang, Shengli Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning is essential for enabling collaborative model training across decentralized data sources while preserving data privacy and security. This approach mitigates the risks associated with centralized data collection and addresses concerns related to data ownership and compliance. Despite significant advancements in federated learning algorithms that address communication bottlenecks and enhance privacy protection, existing works overlook the impact of differences in data feature dimensions, resulting in global models that disproportionately depend on participants with large feature dimensions. Additionally, current single-view federated learning methods fail to account for the unique characteristics of multi-view data, leading to suboptimal performance in processing such data. To address these issues, we propose a Self-expressive Hypergraph Based Federated Multi-view Learning method (FedMSGL). The proposed method leverages self-expressive character in the local training to learn uniform dimension subspace with latent sample relation. At the central side, an adaptive fusion technique is employed to generate the global model, while constructing a hypergraph from the learned global and view-specific subspace to capture intricate interconnections across views. Experiments on multi-view datasets with different feature dimensions validated the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Songlin Yang, Tao Yang, Bo Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: The deployment of sensors for air quality monitoring is constrained by high costs, leading to inadequate network coverage and data deficits in some areas. Utilizing existing observations, spatio-temporal kriging is a method for estimating air quality at unobserved locations during a specific period. Inductive spatio-temporal kriging with increment training strategy has demonstrated its effectiveness using virtual nodes to simulate unobserved nodes. However, a disparity between virtual and real nodes persists, complicating the application of learning patterns derived from virtual nodes to actual unobserved ones. To address these limitations, this paper presents a Physics-Guided Increment Training Strategy (PGITS). Specifically, we design a dynamic graph generation module to incorporate the advection and diffusion processes of airborne particles as physical knowledge into the graph structure, dynamically adjusting the adjacency matrix to reflect physical interactions between nodes. By using physics principles as a bridge between virtual and real nodes, this strategy ensures the features of virtual nodes and their pseudo labels are closer to actual nodes. Consequently, the learned patterns of virtual nodes can be applied to actual unobserved nodes for effective kriging.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David P. Hofmeyr</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper we introduce a simple and intuitive adaptive k nearest neighbours classifier, and explore its utility within the context of bootstrap aggregating ("bagging"). The approach is based on finding discriminant subspaces which are computationally efficient to compute, and are motivated by enhancing the discrimination of classes through nearest neighbour classifiers. This adaptiveness promotes diversity of the individual classifiers fit across different bootstrap samples, and so further leverages the variance reducing effect of bagging. Extensive experimental results are presented documenting the strong performance of the proposed approach in comparison with Random Forest classifiers, as well as other nearest neighbours based ensembles from the literature, plus other relevant benchmarks. Code to implement the proposed approach is available in the form of an R package from https://github.com/DavidHofmeyr/BOPNN.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09656">LLM-PS: Empowering Large Language Models for Time Series Forecasting with Temporal Patterns and Semantics</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jialiang Tang, Shuo Chen, Chen Gong, Jing Zhang, Dacheng Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: Time Series Forecasting (TSF) is critical in many real-world domains like financial planning and health monitoring. Recent studies have revealed that Large Language Models (LLMs), with their powerful in-contextual modeling capabilities, hold significant potential for TSF. However, existing LLM-based methods usually perform suboptimally because they neglect the inherent characteristics of time series data. Unlike the textual data used in LLM pre-training, the time series data is semantically sparse and comprises distinctive temporal patterns. To address this problem, we propose LLM-PS to empower the LLM for TSF by learning the fundamental \textit{Patterns} and meaningful \textit{Semantics} from time series data. Our LLM-PS incorporates a new multi-scale convolutional neural network adept at capturing both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends within the time series. Meanwhile, we introduce a time-to-text module for extracting valuable semantics across continuous time intervals rather than isolated time points. By integrating these patterns and semantics, LLM-PS effectively models temporal dependencies, enabling a deep comprehension of time series and delivering accurate forecasts. Intensive experimental results demonstrate that LLM-PS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both short- and long-term forecasting tasks, as well as in few- and zero-shot settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guanchen Li, Yixing Xu, Zeping Li, Ji Liu, Xuanwu Yin, Dong Li, Emad Barsoum</p>
<p>Abstract: Structural pruning enhances hardware-agnostic inference efficiency for large language models (LLMs) but often struggles to maintain performance. Local pruning performs efficient layer-by-layer compression but ignores global topology. Global pruning has the potential to find the optimal solution although resource-intensive. However, existing methods tend to rank structural saliency uniformly, ignoring inter-structure dependencies and failing to achieve end-to-end optimization. To address these limitations, we propose T\'yr-the-Pruner, an efficient end-to-end search-based global structural pruning framework. This framework constructs a supernet by repeatedly applying local pruning across a range of sparsity ratios to each layer in an LLM, with the core goal of determining the optimal sparsity distribution under a target overall sparsity ratio. Concretely, we introduce an effective local pruning and an expectation error accumulation approach to improve supernet construction. Furthermore, we employ an iterative prune-and-search strategy with coarse-to-fine sparsity granularity to ensure efficient search convergence. Experimental results show that T\'yr-the-Pruner achieves state-of-the-art structural pruning, retaining 97% of the dense model's performance while removing a challenging 50% of Llama-3.1-70B's parameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao-Tsung Yang, Jie Gao, Bo-Yi Liu, Zhi-Xuan Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Algorithmic Recourse is a way for users to modify their attributes to align with a model's expectations, thereby improving their outcomes after receiving unfavorable decisions. In real-world scenarios, users often need to strategically adjust their attributes to compete for limited resources. However, such strategic behavior induces users to "game" algorithms, causing model collapse due to distribution shifts. These shifts arise from user competition, resource constraints, and adaptive user responses. While prior research on Algorithmic Recourse has explored its effects on both systems and users, the impact of resource constraints and competition over time remains underexplored. In this work, we develop a general framework to model user strategic behaviors and their interactions with decision-making systems under resource constraints and competitive dynamics. Through theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation, we identify three key phenomena that arise consistently in both synthetic and real-world datasets: escalating decision boundaries, non-robust model predictions, and inequitable recourse actions. Finally, we discuss the broader social implications of these findings and present two algorithmic strategies aimed at mitigating these challenges.</p>

<p>Abstract: Perinatal complications, defined as conditions that arise during pregnancy, childbirth, and the immediate postpartum period, represent a significant burden on maternal and neonatal health worldwide. Factors contributing to these disparities include limited access to quality healthcare, socioeconomic inequalities, and variations in healthcare infrastructure. Addressing these issues is crucial for improving health outcomes for mothers and newborns, particularly in underserved communities. To mitigate these challenges, we have developed an AI-enabled smartphone application designed to provide decision support at the point-of-care. This tool aims to enhance health monitoring during pregnancy by leveraging machine learning (ML) techniques. The intended use of this application is to assist midwives during routine home visits by offering real-time analysis and providing feedback based on collected data. The application integrates TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) and other Python-based algorithms within a Kotlin framework to process data in real-time. It is designed for use in low-resource settings, where traditional healthcare infrastructure may be lacking. The intended patient population includes pregnant women and new mothers in underserved areas and the developed system was piloted in rural Guatemala. This ML-based solution addresses the critical need for accessible and quality perinatal care by empowering healthcare providers with decision support tools to improve maternal and neonatal health outcomes.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09661">Towards Hardware Supported Domain Generalization in DNN-Based Edge Computing Devices for Health Monitoring</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Johnson Loh, Lyubov Dudchenko, Justus Viga, Tobias Gemmeke</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural network (DNN) models have shown remarkable success in many real-world scenarios, such as object detection and classification. Unfortunately, these models are not yet widely adopted in health monitoring due to exceptionally high requirements for model robustness and deployment in highly resource-constrained devices. In particular, the acquisition of biosignals, such as electrocardiogram (ECG), is subject to large variations between training and deployment, necessitating domain generalization (DG) for robust classification quality across sensors and patients. The continuous monitoring of ECG also requires the execution of DNN models in convenient wearable devices, which is achieved by specialized ECG accelerators with small form factor and ultra-low power consumption. However, combining DG capabilities with ECG accelerators remains a challenge. This article provides a comprehensive overview of ECG accelerators and DG methods and discusses the implication of the combination of both domains, such that multi-domain ECG monitoring is enabled with emerging algorithm-hardware co-optimized systems. Within this context, an approach based on correction layers is proposed to deploy DG capabilities on the edge. Here, the DNN fine-tuning for unknown domains is limited to a single layer, while the remaining DNN model remains unmodified. Thus, computational complexity (CC) for DG is reduced with minimal memory overhead compared to conventional fine-tuning of the whole DNN model. The DNN model-dependent CC is reduced by more than 2.5x compared to DNN fine-tuning at an average increase of F1 score by more than 20% on the generalized target domain. In summary, this article provides a novel perspective on robust DNN classification on the edge for health monitoring applications.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09679">DRESS: Disentangled Representation-based Self-Supervised Meta-Learning for Diverse Tasks</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Cui, Tongzi Wu, Jesse C. Cresswell, Yi Sui, Keyvan Golestan</p>
<p>Abstract: Meta-learning represents a strong class of approaches for solving few-shot learning tasks. Nonetheless, recent research suggests that simply pre-training a generic encoder can potentially surpass meta-learning algorithms. In this paper, we first discuss the reasons why meta-learning fails to stand out in these few-shot learning experiments, and hypothesize that it is due to the few-shot learning tasks lacking diversity. We propose DRESS, a task-agnostic Disentangled REpresentation-based Self-Supervised meta-learning approach that enables fast model adaptation on highly diversified few-shot learning tasks. Specifically, DRESS utilizes disentangled representation learning to create self-supervised tasks that can fuel the meta-training process. Furthermore, we also propose a class-partition based metric for quantifying the task diversity directly on the input space. We validate the effectiveness of DRESS through experiments on datasets with multiple factors of variation and varying complexity. The results suggest that DRESS is able to outperform competing methods on the majority of the datasets and task setups. Through this paper, we advocate for a re-examination of proper setups for task adaptation studies, and aim to reignite interest in the potential of meta-learning for solving few-shot learning tasks via disentangled representations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ping Zhang, Zheda Mai, Quang-Huy Nguyen, Wei-Lun Chao</p>
<p>Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) leverages abundant unlabeled data alongside limited labeled data to enhance learning. As vision foundation models (VFMs) increasingly serve as the backbone of vision applications, it remains unclear how SSL interacts with these pre-trained models. To address this gap, we develop new SSL benchmark datasets where frozen VFMs underperform and systematically evaluate representative SSL methods. We make a surprising observation: parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) using only labeled data often matches SSL performance, even without leveraging unlabeled data. This motivates us to revisit self-training, a conceptually simple SSL baseline, where we use the supervised PEFT model to pseudo-label unlabeled data for further training. To overcome the notorious issue of noisy pseudo-labels, we propose ensembling multiple PEFT approaches and VFM backbones to produce more robust pseudo-labels. Empirical results validate the effectiveness of this simple yet powerful approach, providing actionable insights into SSL with VFMs and paving the way for more scalable and practical semi-supervised learning in the era of foundation models.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09712">Revisiting Backdoor Attacks on Time Series Classification in the Frequency Domain</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuanmin Huang, Mi Zhang, Zhaoxiang Wang, Wenxuan Li, Min Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series classification (TSC) is a cornerstone of modern web applications, powering tasks such as financial data analysis, network traffic monitoring, and user behavior analysis. In recent years, deep neural networks (DNNs) have greatly enhanced the performance of TSC models in these critical domains. However, DNNs are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where attackers can covertly implant triggers into models to induce malicious outcomes. Existing backdoor attacks targeting DNN-based TSC models remain elementary. In particular, early methods borrow trigger designs from computer vision, which are ineffective for time series data. More recent approaches utilize generative models for trigger generation, but at the cost of significant computational complexity. In this work, we analyze the limitations of existing attacks and introduce an enhanced method, FreqBack. Drawing inspiration from the fact that DNN models inherently capture frequency domain features in time series data, we identify that improper perturbations in the frequency domain are the root cause of ineffective attacks. To address this, we propose to generate triggers both effectively and efficiently, guided by frequency analysis. FreqBack exhibits substantial performance across five models and eight datasets, achieving an impressive attack success rate of over 90%, while maintaining less than a 3% drop in model accuracy on clean data.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09719">Towards Causal Model-Based Policy Optimization</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Alberto Caron, Vasilios Mavroudis, Chris Hicks</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-world decision-making problems are often marked by complex, uncertain dynamics that can shift or break under changing conditions. Traditional Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) approaches learn predictive models of environment dynamics from queried trajectories and then use these models to simulate rollouts for policy optimization. However, such methods do not account for the underlying causal mechanisms that govern the environment, and thus inadvertently capture spurious correlations, making them sensitive to distributional shifts and limiting their ability to generalize. The same naturally holds for model-free approaches. In this work, we introduce Causal Model-Based Policy Optimization (C-MBPO), a novel framework that integrates causal learning into the MBRL pipeline to achieve more robust, explainable, and generalizable policy learning algorithms.
  Our approach centers on first inferring a Causal Markov Decision Process (C-MDP) by learning a local Structural Causal Model (SCM) of both the state and reward transition dynamics from trajectories gathered online. C-MDPs differ from classic MDPs in that we can decompose causal dependencies in the environment dynamics via specifying an associated Causal Bayesian Network. C-MDPs allow for targeted interventions and counterfactual reasoning, enabling the agent to distinguish between mere statistical correlations and causal relationships. The learned SCM is then used to simulate counterfactual on-policy transitions and rewards under hypothetical actions (or ``interventions"), thereby guiding policy optimization more effectively. The resulting policy learned by C-MBPO can be shown to be robust to a class of distributional shifts that affect spurious, non-causal relationships in the dynamics. We demonstrate this through some simple experiments involving near and far OOD dynamics drifts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manish Nagaraj, Deepak Ravikumar, Efstathia Soufleri, Kaushik Roy</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning models achieve state-of-the-art performance across domains but face scalability challenges in real-time or resource-constrained scenarios. To address this, we propose Loss Trajectory Correlation (LTC), a novel metric for coreset selection that identifies critical training samples driving generalization. $LTC$ quantifies the alignment between training sample loss trajectories and validation set loss trajectories, enabling the construction of compact, representative subsets. Unlike traditional methods with computational and storage overheads that are infeasible to scale to large datasets, $LTC$ achieves superior efficiency as it can be computed as a byproduct of training. Our results on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k show that $LTC$ consistently achieves accuracy on par with or surpassing state-of-the-art coreset selection methods, with any differences remaining under 1%. LTC also effectively transfers across various architectures, including ResNet, VGG, DenseNet, and Swin Transformer, with minimal performance degradation (<2%). Additionally, LTC offers insights into training dynamics, such as identifying aligned and conflicting sample behaviors, at a fraction of the computational cost of traditional methods. This framework paves the way for scalable coreset selection and efficient dataset optimization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Max Simchowitz, Daniel Pfrommer, Ali Jadbabaie</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the problem of imitating an expert demonstrator in a discrete-time, continuous state-and-action control system. We show that, even if the dynamics are stable (i.e. contracting exponentially quickly), and the expert is smooth and deterministic, any smooth, deterministic imitator policy necessarily suffers error on execution that is exponentially larger, as a function of problem horizon, than the error under the distribution of expert training data. Our negative result applies to both behavior cloning and offline-RL algorithms, unless they produce highly "improper" imitator policies--those which are non-smooth, non-Markovian, or which exhibit highly state-dependent stochasticity--or unless the expert trajectory distribution is sufficiently "spread." We provide experimental evidence of the benefits of these more complex policy parameterizations, explicating the benefits of today's popular policy parameterizations in robot learning (e.g. action-chunking and Diffusion Policies). We also establish a host of complementary negative and positive results for imitation in control systems.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09726">How Feasible is Augmenting Fake Nodes with Learnable Features as a Counter-strategy against Link Stealing Attacks?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Mir Imtiaz Mostafiz, Imtiaz Karim, Elisa Bertino</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely used and deployed for graph-based prediction tasks. However, as good as GNNs are for learning graph data, they also come with the risk of privacy leakage. For instance, an attacker can run carefully crafted queries on the GNNs and, from the responses, can infer the existence of an edge between a pair of nodes. This attack, dubbed as a "link-stealing" attack, can jeopardize the user's privacy by leaking potentially sensitive information. To protect against this attack, we propose an approach called "$(N)$ode $(A)$ugmentation for $(R)$estricting $(G)$raphs from $(I)$nsinuating their $(S)$tructure" ($NARGIS$) and study its feasibility. $NARGIS$ is focused on reshaping the graph embedding space so that the posterior from the GNN model will still provide utility for the prediction task but will introduce ambiguity for the link-stealing attackers. To this end, $NARGIS$ applies spectral clustering on the given graph to facilitate it being augmented with new nodes -- that have learned features instead of fixed ones. It utilizes tri-level optimization for learning parameters for the GNN model, surrogate attacker model, and our defense model (i.e. learnable node features). We extensively evaluate $NARGIS$ on three benchmark citation datasets over eight knowledge availability settings for the attackers. We also evaluate the model fidelity and defense performance on influence-based link inference attacks. Through our studies, we have figured out the best feature of $NARGIS$ -- its superior fidelity-privacy performance trade-off in a significant number of cases. We also have discovered in which cases the model needs to be improved, and proposed ways to integrate different schemes to make the model more robust against link stealing attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jacky Hao Jiang, Jerry Cai, Anastasios Kyrillidis</p>
<p>Abstract: Soccer analysis tools emphasize metrics such as expected goals, leading to an overrepresentation of attacking players' contributions and overlooking players who facilitate ball control and link attacks. Examples include Rodri from Manchester City and Palhinha who just transferred to Bayern Munich. To address this bias, we aim to identify players with pivotal roles in a soccer team, incorporating both spatial and temporal features.
  In this work, we introduce a GNN-based framework that assigns individual credit for changes in expected threat (xT), thus capturing overlooked yet vital contributions in soccer. Our pipeline encodes both spatial and temporal features in event-centric graphs, enabling fair attribution of non-scoring actions such as defensive or transitional plays. We incorporate centrality measures into the learned player embeddings, ensuring that ball-retaining defenders and defensive midfielders receive due recognition for their overall impact. Furthermore, we explore diverse GNN variants-including Graph Attention Networks and Transformer-based models-to handle long-range dependencies and evolving match contexts, discussing their relative performance and computational complexity. Experiments on real match data confirm the robustness of our approach in highlighting pivotal roles that traditional attacking metrics typically miss, underscoring the model's utility for more comprehensive soccer analytics.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents a practical application of Relative Trajectory Balance (RTB), a recently introduced off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) objective that can asymptotically solve Bayesian inverse problems optimally. We extend the original work by using RTB to train conditional diffusion model posteriors from pretrained unconditional priors for challenging linear and non-linear inverse problems in vision, and science. We use the objective alongside techniques such as off-policy backtracking exploration to improve training. Importantly, our results show that existing training-free diffusion posterior methods struggle to perform effective posterior inference in latent space due to inherent biases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guangyi Liu, Suzan Iloglu, Michael Caldara, Joseph W. Durham, Michael M. Zavlanos</p>
<p>Abstract: In Amazon robotic warehouses, the destination-to-chute mapping problem is crucial for efficient package sorting. Often, however, this problem is complicated by uncertain and dynamic package induction rates, which can lead to increased package recirculation. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a Distributionally Robust Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (DRMARL) framework that learns a destination-to-chute mapping policy that is resilient to adversarial variations in induction rates. Specifically, DRMARL relies on group distributionally robust optimization (DRO) to learn a policy that performs well not only on average but also on each individual subpopulation of induction rates within the group that capture, for example, different seasonality or operation modes of the system. This approach is then combined with a novel contextual bandit-based predictor of the worst-case induction distribution for each state-action pair, significantly reducing the cost of exploration and thereby increasing the learning efficiency and scalability of our framework. Extensive simulations demonstrate that DRMARL achieves robust chute mapping in the presence of varying induction distributions, reducing package recirculation by an average of 80\% in the simulation scenario.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luis Scoccola, Uzu Lim, Heather A. Harrington</p>
<p>Abstract: Classical unsupervised learning methods like clustering and linear dimensionality reduction parametrize large-scale geometry when it is discrete or linear, while more modern methods from manifold learning find low dimensional representation or infer local geometry by constructing a graph on the input data. More recently, topological data analysis popularized the use of simplicial complexes to represent data topology with two main methodologies: topological inference with geometric complexes and large-scale topology visualization with Mapper graphs -- central to these is the nerve construction from topology, which builds a simplicial complex given a cover of a space by subsets. While successful, these have limitations: geometric complexes scale poorly with data size, and Mapper graphs can be hard to tune and only contain low dimensional information. In this paper, we propose to study the problem of learning covers in its own right, and from the perspective of optimization. We describe a method for learning topologically-faithful covers of geometric datasets, and show that the simplicial complexes thus obtained can outperform standard topological inference approaches in terms of size, and Mapper-type algorithms in terms of representation of large-scale topology.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anmol Dwivedi, Ali Tajer</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a data-driven graphical framework for the real-time search of risky cascading fault chains (FCs) in power-grids, crucial for enhancing grid resiliency in the face of climate change. As extreme weather events driven by climate change increase, identifying risky FCs becomes crucial for mitigating cascading failures and ensuring grid stability. However, the complexity of the spatio-temporal dependencies among grid components and the exponential growth of the search space with system size pose significant challenges to modeling and risky FC search. To tackle this, we model the search process as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), which is subsequently solved via a time-varying graph recurrent neural network (GRNN). This approach captures the spatial and temporal structure induced by the system's topology and dynamics, while efficiently summarizing the system's history in the GRNN's latent space, enabling scalable and effective identification of risky FCs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> William L. Tong, Cengiz Pehlevan</p>
<p>Abstract: Equality reasoning is ubiquitous and purely abstract: sameness or difference may be evaluated no matter the nature of the underlying objects. As a result, same-different tasks (SD) have been extensively studied as a starting point for understanding abstract reasoning in humans and across animal species. With the rise of neural networks (NN) that exhibit striking apparent proficiency for abstractions, equality reasoning in NNs has also gained interest. Yet despite extensive study, conclusions about equality reasoning vary widely and with little consensus. To clarify the underlying principles in learning SD, we develop a theory of equality reasoning in multi-layer perceptrons (MLP). Following observations in comparative psychology, we propose a spectrum of behavior that ranges from conceptual to perceptual outcomes. Conceptual behavior is characterized by task-specific representations, efficient learning, and insensitivity to spurious perceptual details. Perceptual behavior is characterized by strong sensitivity to spurious perceptual details, accompanied by the need for exhaustive training to learn the task. We develop a mathematical theory to show that an MLP's behavior is driven by learning richness. Rich-regime MLPs exhibit conceptual behavior, whereas lazy-regime MLPs exhibit perceptual behavior. We validate our theoretical findings in vision SD experiments, showing that rich feature learning promotes success by encouraging hallmarks of conceptual behavior. Overall, our work identifies feature learning richness as a key parameter modulating equality reasoning, and suggests that equality reasoning in humans and animals may similarly depend on learning richness in neural circuits.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09786">Designing Graph Convolutional Neural Networks for Discrete Choice with Network Effects</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel F. Villarraga, Ricardo A. Daziano</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a novel model architecture that incorporates network effects into discrete choice problems, achieving higher predictive performance than standard discrete choice models while offering greater interpretability than general-purpose flexible model classes. Econometric discrete choice models aid in studying individual decision-making, where agents select the option with the highest reward from a discrete set of alternatives. Intuitively, the utility an individual derives from a particular choice depends on their personal preferences and characteristics, the attributes of the alternative, and the value their peers assign to that alternative or their previous choices. However, most applications ignore peer influence, and models that do consider peer or network effects often lack the flexibility and predictive performance of recently developed approaches to discrete choice, such as deep learning. We propose a novel graph convolutional neural network architecture to model network effects in discrete choices, achieving higher predictive performance than standard discrete choice models while retaining the interpretability necessary for inference--a quality often lacking in general-purpose deep learning architectures. We evaluate our architecture using revealed commuting choice data, extended with travel times and trip costs for each travel mode for work-related trips in New York City, as well as 2016 U.S. election data aggregated by county, to test its performance on datasets with highly imbalanced classes. Given the interpretability of our models, we can estimate relevant economic metrics, such as the value of travel time savings in New York City. Finally, we compare the predictive performance and behavioral insights from our architecture to those derived from traditional discrete choice and general-purpose deep learning models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joni-Kristian K\"am\"ar\"ainen</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer is the state-of-the-art model for many natural language processing, computer vision, and audio analysis problems. Transformer effectively combines information from the past input and output samples in auto-regressive manner so that each sample becomes aware of all inputs and outputs. In sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) modeling, the transformer processed samples become effective in predicting the next output. Time series forecasting is a Seq2Seq problem. The original architecture is defined for discrete input and output sequence tokens, but to adopt it for time series, the model must be adapted for continuous data. This work introduces minimal adaptations to make the original transformer architecture suitable for continuous value time series data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zachary Charles, Gabriel Teston, Lucio Dery, Keith Rush, Nova Fallen, Zachary Garrett, Arthur Szlam, Arthur Douillard</p>
<p>Abstract: As we scale to more massive machine learning models, the frequent synchronization demands inherent in data-parallel approaches create significant slowdowns, posing a critical challenge to further scaling. Recent work develops an approach (DiLoCo) that relaxes synchronization demands without compromising model quality. However, these works do not carefully analyze how DiLoCo's behavior changes with model size. In this work, we study the scaling law behavior of DiLoCo when training LLMs under a fixed compute budget. We focus on how algorithmic factors, including number of model replicas, hyperparameters, and token budget affect training in ways that can be accurately predicted via scaling laws. We find that DiLoCo scales both predictably and robustly with model size. When well-tuned, DiLoCo scales better than data-parallel training with model size, and can outperform data-parallel training even at small model sizes. Our results showcase a more general set of benefits of DiLoCo than previously documented, including increased optimal batch sizes, improved downstream generalization with scale, and improved evaluation loss for a fixed token budget.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ilias Diakonikolas, Daniel M. Kane, Sushrut Karmalkar, Sihan Liu, Thanasis Pittas</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the task of list-decodable linear regression using batches. A batch is called clean if it consists of i.i.d. samples from an unknown linear regression distribution. For a parameter $\alpha \in (0, 1/2)$, an unknown $\alpha$-fraction of the batches are clean and no assumptions are made on the remaining ones. The goal is to output a small list of vectors at least one of which is close to the true regressor vector in $\ell_2$-norm. [DJKS23] gave an efficient algorithm, under natural distributional assumptions, with the following guarantee. Assuming that the batch size $n$ satisfies $n \geq \tilde{\Omega}(\alpha^{-1})$ and the number of batches is $m = \mathrm{poly}(d, n, 1/\alpha)$, their algorithm runs in polynomial time and outputs a list of $O(1/\alpha^2)$ vectors at least one of which is $\tilde{O}(\alpha^{-1/2}/\sqrt{n})$ close to the target regressor. Here we design a new polynomial time algorithm with significantly stronger guarantees under the assumption that the low-degree moments of the covariates distribution are Sum-of-Squares (SoS) certifiably bounded. Specifically, for any constant $\delta>0$, as long as the batch size is $n \geq \Omega_{\delta}(\alpha^{-\delta})$ and the degree-$\Theta(1/\delta)$ moments of the covariates are SoS certifiably bounded, our algorithm uses $m = \mathrm{poly}((dn)^{1/\delta}, 1/\alpha)$ batches, runs in polynomial-time, and outputs an $O(1/\alpha)$-sized list of vectors one of which is $O(\alpha^{-\delta/2}/\sqrt{n})$ close to the target. That is, our algorithm achieves substantially smaller minimum batch size and final error, while achieving the optimal list size. Our approach uses higher-order moment information by carefully combining the SoS paradigm interleaved with an iterative method and a novel list pruning procedure. In the process, we give an SoS proof of the Marcinkiewicz-Zygmund inequality that may be of broader applicability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jesse Farebrother, Matteo Pirotta, Andrea Tirinzoni, R\'emi Munos, Alessandro Lazaric, Ahmed Touati</p>
<p>Abstract: Predictive models of the future are fundamental for an agent's ability to reason and plan. A common strategy learns a world model and unrolls it step-by-step at inference, where small errors can rapidly compound. Geometric Horizon Models (GHMs) offer a compelling alternative by directly making predictions of future states, avoiding cumulative inference errors. While GHMs can be conveniently learned by a generative analog to temporal difference (TD) learning, existing methods are negatively affected by bootstrapping predictions at train time and struggle to generate high-quality predictions at long horizons. This paper introduces Temporal Difference Flows (TD-Flow), which leverages the structure of a novel Bellman equation on probability paths alongside flow-matching techniques to learn accurate GHMs at over 5x the horizon length of prior methods. Theoretically, we establish a new convergence result and primarily attribute TD-Flow's efficacy to reduced gradient variance during training. We further show that similar arguments can be extended to diffusion-based methods. Empirically, we validate TD-Flow across a diverse set of domains on both generative metrics and downstream tasks including policy evaluation. Moreover, integrating TD-Flow with recent behavior foundation models for planning over pre-trained policies demonstrates substantial performance gains, underscoring its promise for long-horizon decision-making.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sarwar Saif, Md Jahirul Islam, Md. Zihad Bin Jahangir, Parag Biswas, Abdur Rashid, MD Abdullah Al Nasim, Kishor Datta Gupta</p>
<p>Abstract: The arrival of Machine Learning (ML) completely changed how we can unlock valuable information from data. Traditional methods, where everything was stored in one place, had big problems with keeping information private, handling large amounts of data, and avoiding unfair advantages. Machine Learning has become a powerful tool that uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to overcome these challenges. We started by learning the basics of Machine Learning, including the different types like supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. We also explored the important steps involved, such as preparing the data, choosing the right model, training it, and then checking its performance. Next, we examined some key challenges in Machine Learning, such as models learning too much from specific examples (overfitting), not learning enough (underfitting), and reflecting biases in the data used. Moving beyond centralized systems, we looked at decentralized Machine Learning and its benefits, like keeping data private, getting answers faster, and using a wider variety of data sources. We then focused on a specific type called federated learning, where models are trained without directly sharing sensitive information. Real-world examples from healthcare and finance were used to show how collaborative Machine Learning can solve important problems while still protecting information security. Finally, we discussed challenges like communication efficiency, dealing with different types of data, and security. We also explored using a Zero Trust framework, which provides an extra layer of protection for collaborative Machine Learning systems. This approach is paving the way for a bright future for this groundbreaking technology.</p>

This paper introduces TabNSA, a novel deep learning architecture leveraging Native Sparse Attention (NSA) specifically for efficient tabular data processing. TabNSA incorporates a dynamic hierarchical sparse strategy, combining coarse-grained feature compression with fine-grained feature selection to preserve both global context awareness and local precision. By dynamically focusing on relevant subsets of features, TabNSA effectively captures intricate feature interactions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TabNSA consistently outperforms existing methods, including both deep learning architectures and ensemble decision trees, achieving state-of-the-art performance across various benchmark datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Georg Manten, Cecilia Casolo, S{\o}ren Wengel Mogensen, Niki Kilbertus</p>
<p>Abstract: We develop the theory linking 'E-separation' in directed mixed graphs (DMGs) with conditional independence relations among coordinate processes in stochastic differential equations (SDEs), where causal relationships are determined by "which variables enter the governing equation of which other variables". We prove a global Markov property for cyclic SDEs, which naturally extends to partially observed cyclic SDEs, because our asymmetric independence model is closed under marginalization. We then characterize the class of graphs that encode the same set of independence relations, yielding a result analogous to the seminal 'same skeleton and v-structures' result for directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). In the fully observed case, we show that each such equivalence class of graphs has a greatest element as a parsimonious representation and develop algorithms to identify this greatest element from data. We conjecture that a greatest element also exists under partial observations, which we verify computationally for graphs with up to four nodes.</p>

<p>Abstract: Algorithmic fairness has received considerable attention due to the failures of various predictive AI systems that have been found to be unfairly biased against subgroups of the population. Many approaches have been proposed to mitigate such biases in predictive systems, however, they often struggle to provide accurate estimates and transparent correction mechanisms in the case where multiple sensitive variables, such as a combination of gender and race, are involved. This paper introduces a new open source Python package, EquiPy, which provides a easy-to-use and model agnostic toolbox for efficiently achieving fairness across multiple sensitive variables. It also offers comprehensive graphic utilities to enable the user to interpret the influence of each sensitive variable within a global context. EquiPy makes use of theoretical results that allow the complexity arising from the use of multiple variables to be broken down into easier-to-solve sub-problems. We demonstrate the ease of use for both mitigation and interpretation on publicly available data derived from the US Census and provide sample code for its use.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09889">Tracking the Best Expert Privately</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Aadirupa Saha, Vinod Raman, Hilal Asi</p>
<p>Abstract: We design differentially private algorithms for the problem of prediction with expert advice under dynamic regret, also known as tracking the best expert. Our work addresses three natural types of adversaries, stochastic with shifting distributions, oblivious, and adaptive, and designs algorithms with sub-linear regret for all three cases. In particular, under a shifting stochastic adversary where the distribution may shift $S$ times, we provide an $\epsilon$-differentially private algorithm whose expected dynamic regret is at most $O\left( \sqrt{S T \log (NT)} + \frac{S \log (NT)}{\epsilon}\right)$, where $T$ and $N$ are the epsilon horizon and number of experts, respectively. For oblivious adversaries, we give a reduction from dynamic regret minimization to static regret minimization, resulting in an upper bound of $O\left(\sqrt{S T \log(NT)} + \frac{S T^{1/3}\log(T/\delta) \log(NT)}{\epsilon^{2/3}}\right)$ on the expected dynamic regret, where $S$ now denotes the allowable number of switches of the best expert. Finally, similar to static regret, we establish a fundamental separation between oblivious and adaptive adversaries for the dynamic setting: while our algorithms show that sub-linear regret is achievable for oblivious adversaries in the high-privacy regime $\epsilon \le \sqrt{S/T}$, we show that any $(\epsilon, \delta)$-differentially private algorithm must suffer linear dynamic regret under adaptive adversaries for $\epsilon \le \sqrt{S/T}$. Finally, to complement this lower bound, we give an $\epsilon$-differentially private algorithm that attains sub-linear dynamic regret under adaptive adversaries whenever $\epsilon \gg \sqrt{S/T}$.</p>

<p>Abstract: The integration of machine learning (ML) has significantly enhanced the capabilities of Earth Observation (EO) systems by enabling the extraction of actionable insights from complex datasets. However, the performance of data-driven EO applications is heavily influenced by the data collection and transmission processes, where limited satellite bandwidth and latency constraints can hinder the full transmission of original data to the receivers. To address this issue, adopting the concepts of Semantic Communication (SC) offers a promising solution by prioritizing the transmission of essential data semantics over raw information. Implementing SC for EO systems requires a thorough understanding of the impact of data processing and communication channel conditions on semantic loss at the processing center. This work proposes a novel data-fitting framework to empirically model the semantic loss using real-world EO datasets and domain-specific insights. The framework quantifies two primary types of semantic loss: (1) source coding loss, assessed via a data quality indicator measuring the impact of processing on raw source data, and (2) transmission loss, evaluated by comparing practical transmission performance against the Shannon limit. Semantic losses are estimated by evaluating the accuracy of EO applications using four task-oriented ML models, EfficientViT, MobileViT, ResNet50-DINO, and ResNet8-KD, on lossy image datasets under varying channel conditions and compression ratios. These results underpin a framework for efficient semantic-loss modeling in bandwidth-constrained EO scenarios, enabling more reliable and effective operations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Constraining deep neural networks (DNNs) to learn individual logic types per node, as performed using the DiffLogic network architecture, opens the door to model-specific explanation techniques that quell the complexity inherent to DNNs. Inspired by principles of circuit analysis from computer engineering, this work presents an algorithm (eXpLogic) for producing saliency maps which explain input patterns that activate certain functions. The eXpLogic explanations: (1) show the exact set of inputs responsible for a decision, which helps interpret false negative and false positive predictions, (2) highlight common input patterns that activate certain outputs, and (3) help reduce the network size to improve class-specific inference. To evaluate the eXpLogic saliency map, we introduce a metric that quantifies how much an input changes before switching a model's class prediction (the SwitchDist) and use this metric to compare eXpLogic against the Vanilla Gradients (VG) and Integrated Gradient (IG) methods. Generally, we show that eXpLogic saliency maps are better at predicting which inputs will change the class score. These maps help reduce the network size and inference times by 87\% and 8\%, respectively, while having a limited impact (-3.8\%) on class-specific predictions. The broader value of this work to machine learning is in demonstrating how certain DNN architectures promote explainability, which is relevant to healthcare, defense, and law.</p>

<p>Abstract: Various world model frameworks are being developed today based on autoregressive frameworks that rely on discrete representations of actions and observations, and these frameworks are succeeding in constructing interactive generative models for the target environment of interest. Meanwhile, humans demonstrate remarkable generalization abilities to combine experiences in multiple environments to mentally simulate and learn to control agents in diverse environments. Inspired by this human capability, we introduce World modeling through Lie Action (WLA), an unsupervised framework that learns continuous latent action representations to simulate across environments. WLA learns a control interface with high controllability and predictive ability by simultaneously modeling the dynamics of multiple environments using Lie group theory and object-centric autoencoder. On synthetic benchmark and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that WLA can be trained using only video frames and, with minimal or no action labels, can quickly adapt to new environments with novel action sets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaqi Sun, Yujia Zheng, Xinshuai Dong, Haoyue Dai, Kun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge graphs serve as critical resources supporting intelligent systems, but they can be noisy due to imperfect automatic generation processes. Existing approaches to noise detection often rely on external facts, logical rule constraints, or structural embeddings. These methods are often challenged by imperfect entity alignment, flexible knowledge graph construction, and overfitting on structures. In this paper, we propose to exploit the consistency between entity and relation type information for noise detection, resulting a novel self-supervised knowledge graph denoising method that avoids those problems. We formalize type inconsistency noise as triples that deviate from the majority with respect to type-dependent reasoning along the topological structure. Specifically, we first extract a compact representation of a given knowledge graph via an encoder that models the type dependencies of triples. Then, the decoder reconstructs the original input knowledge graph based on the compact representation. It is worth noting that, our proposal has the potential to address the problems of knowledge graph compression and completion, although this is not our focus. For the specific task of noise detection, the discrepancy between the reconstruction results and the input knowledge graph provides an opportunity for denoising, which is facilitated by the type consistency embedded in our method. Experimental validation demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in detecting potential noise in real-world data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Ensuring Large Language Models (LLMs) align with diverse human preferences while preserving privacy and fairness remains a challenge. Existing methods, such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), rely on centralized data collection, making them computationally expensive and privacy-invasive. We introduce PluralLLM a federated learning-based approach that enables multiple user groups to collaboratively train a transformer-based preference predictor without sharing sensitive data, which can also serve as a reward model for aligning LLMs. Our method leverages Federated Averaging (FedAvg) to aggregate preference updates efficiently, achieving 46% faster convergence, a 4% improvement in alignment scores, and nearly the same group fairness measure as in centralized training. Evaluated on a Q/A preference alignment task, PluralLLM demonstrates that federated preference learning offers a scalable and privacy-preserving alternative for aligning LLMs with diverse human values.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaobo Xia, Xiaofeng Liu, Jiale Liu, Kuai Fang, Lu Lu, Samet Oymak, William S. Currie, Tongliang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Water quality is foundational to environmental sustainability, ecosystem resilience, and public health. Deep learning models, particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, offer transformative potential for large-scale water quality prediction and scientific insights generation. However, their widespread adoption in high-stakes decision-making, such as pollution mitigation and equitable resource allocation, is prevented by unresolved trustworthiness challenges including fairness, uncertainty, interpretability, robustness, generalizability, and reproducibility. In this work, we present the first comprehensive evaluation of trustworthiness in a continental-scale multi-task LSTM model predicting 20 water quality variables (encompassing physical/chemical processes, geochemical weathering, and nutrient cycling) across 482 U.S. basins. Our investigation uncovers systematic patterns of model performance disparities linked to basin characteristics, the inherent complexity of biogeochemical processes, and variable predictability, emphasizing critical performance fairness concerns. We further propose methodological frameworks for quantitatively evaluating critical aspects of trustworthiness, including uncertainty, interpretability, and robustness, identifying key limitations that could challenge reliable real-world deployment. This work serves as a timely call to action for advancing trustworthy data-driven methods for water resources management and provides a pathway to offering critical insights for researchers, decision-makers, and practitioners seeking to leverage artificial intelligence (AI) responsibly in environmental management.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Qiao, Phuong-Nam Tran, Ji Su Yoon, Loc X. Nguyen, Choong Seon Hong</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL)-based large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Grok-3, have gained significant attention for their exceptional capabilities in natural language processing and multimodal data understanding. Meanwhile, the rapid expansion of information services has driven the growing need for intelligence, efficient, and adaptable wireless networks. Wireless networks require the empowerment of RL-based LLMs while these models also benefit from wireless networks to broaden their application scenarios. Specifically, RL-based LLMs can enhance wireless communication systems through intelligent resource allocation, adaptive network optimization, and real-time decision-making. Conversely, wireless networks provide a vital infrastructure for the efficient training, deployment, and distributed inference of RL-based LLMs, especially in decentralized and edge computing environments. This mutual empowerment highlights the need for a deeper exploration of the interplay between these two domains. We first review recent advancements in wireless communications, highlighting the associated challenges and potential solutions. We then discuss the progress of RL-based LLMs, focusing on key technologies for LLM training, challenges, and potential solutions. Subsequently, we explore the mutual empowerment between these two fields, highlighting key motivations, open challenges, and potential solutions. Finally, we provide insights into future directions, applications, and their societal impact to further explore this intersection, paving the way for next-generation intelligent communication systems. Overall, this survey provides a comprehensive overview of the relationship between RL-based LLMs and wireless networks, offering a vision where these domains empower each other to drive innovations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Hassan Jamal, Abdulwahab Alazeb, Shahid Allah Bakhsh, Wadii Boulila, Syed Aziz Shah, Aizaz Ahmad Khattak, Muhammad Shahbaz Khan</p>
<p>Abstract: Fire safety practices are important to reduce the extent of destruction caused by fire. While smoke alarms help save lives, firefighters struggle with the increasing number of false alarms. This paper presents a precise and efficient Weighted ensemble model for decreasing false alarms. It estimates the density, computes weights according to the high and low-density regions, forwards the high region weights to KNN and low region weights to XGBoost and combines the predictions. The proposed model is effective at reducing response time, increasing fire safety, and minimizing the damage that fires cause. A specifically designed dataset for smoke detection is utilized to test the proposed model. In addition, a variety of ML models, such as Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Nai:ve Bayes (NB), K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Adaptive Boosting (ADAB), have also been utilized. To maximize the use of the smoke detection dataset, all the algorithms utilize the SMOTE re-sampling technique. After evaluating the assessment criteria, this paper presents a concise summary of the comprehensive findings obtained by comparing the outcomes of all models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nathan Drenkow, Mitchell Pavlak, Keith Harrigian, Ayah Zirikly, Adarsh Subbaswamy, Mathias Unberath</p>
<p>Abstract: Data-driven AI is establishing itself at the center of evidence-based medicine. However, reports of shortcomings and unexpected behavior are growing due to AI's reliance on association-based learning. A major reason for this behavior: latent bias in machine learning datasets can be amplified during training and/or hidden during testing. We present a data modality-agnostic auditing framework for generating targeted hypotheses about sources of bias which we refer to as Generalized Attribute Utility and Detectability-Induced bias Testing (G-AUDIT) for datasets. Our method examines the relationship between task-level annotations and data properties including protected attributes (e.g., race, age, sex) and environment and acquisition characteristics (e.g., clinical site, imaging protocols). G-AUDIT automatically quantifies the extent to which the observed data attributes may enable shortcut learning, or in the case of testing data, hide predictions made based on spurious associations. We demonstrate the broad applicability and value of our method by analyzing large-scale medical datasets for three distinct modalities and learning tasks: skin lesion classification in images, stigmatizing language classification in Electronic Health Records (EHR), and mortality prediction for ICU tabular data. In each setting, G-AUDIT successfully identifies subtle biases commonly overlooked by traditional qualitative methods that focus primarily on social and ethical objectives, underscoring its practical value in exposing dataset-level risks and supporting the downstream development of reliable AI systems. Our method paves the way for achieving deeper understanding of machine learning datasets throughout the AI development life-cycle from initial prototyping all the way to regulation, and creates opportunities to reduce model bias, enabling safer and more trustworthy AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanwei Jia, Du Ouyang, Yufei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Stochastic policies are widely used in continuous-time reinforcement learning algorithms. However, executing a stochastic policy and evaluating its performance in a continuous-time environment remain open challenges. This work introduces and rigorously analyzes a policy execution framework that samples actions from a stochastic policy at discrete time points and implements them as piecewise constant controls. We prove that as the sampling mesh size tends to zero, the controlled state process converges weakly to the dynamics with coefficients aggregated according to the stochastic policy. We explicitly quantify the convergence rate based on the regularity of the coefficients and establish an optimal first-order convergence rate for sufficiently regular coefficients. Additionally, we show that the same convergence rates hold with high probability concerning the sampling noise, and further establish a $1/2$-order almost sure convergence when the volatility is not controlled. Building on these results, we analyze the bias and variance of various policy evaluation and policy gradient estimators based on discrete-time observations. Our results provide theoretical justification for the exploratory stochastic control framework in [H. Wang, T. Zariphopoulou, and X.Y. Zhou, J. Mach. Learn. Res., 21 (2020), pp. 1-34].</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rohan Bhatnagar, Ling Liang, Krish Patel, Haizhao Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Motivated by the remarkable success of artificial intelligence (AI) across diverse fields, the application of AI to solve scientific problems-often formulated as partial differential equations (PDEs)-has garnered increasing attention. While most existing research concentrates on theoretical properties (such as well-posedness, regularity, and continuity) of the solutions, alongside direct AI-driven methods for solving PDEs, the challenge of uncovering symbolic relationships within these equations remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose leveraging large language models (LLMs) to learn such symbolic relationships. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can effectively predict the operators involved in PDE solutions by utilizing the symbolic information in the PDEs. Furthermore, we show that discovering these symbolic relationships can substantially improve both the efficiency and accuracy of the finite expression method for finding analytical approximation of PDE solutions, delivering a fully interpretable solution pipeline. This work opens new avenues for understanding the symbolic structure of scientific problems and advancing their solution processes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lingchan Bao, Tong Wei, Yuanyu Wan</p>
<p>Abstract: We revisit multi-agent asynchronous online optimization with delays, where only one of the agents becomes active for making the decision at each round, and the corresponding feedback is received by all the agents after unknown delays. Although previous studies have established an $O(\sqrt{dT})$ regret bound for this problem, they assume that the maximum delay $d$ is knowable or the arrival order of feedback satisfies a special property, which may not hold in practice. In this paper, we surprisingly find that when the loss functions are strongly convex, these assumptions can be eliminated, and the existing regret bound can be significantly improved to $O(d\log T)$ meanwhile. Specifically, to exploit the strong convexity of functions, we first propose a delayed variant of the classical follow-the-leader algorithm, namely FTDL, which is very simple but requires the full information of functions as feedback. Moreover, to handle the more general case with only the gradient feedback, we develop an approximate variant of FTDL by combining it with surrogate loss functions. Experimental results show that the approximate FTDL outperforms the existing algorithm in the strongly convex case.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bharat Srikishan, Daniel O'Malley, Mohamed Mehana, Nicholas Lubbers, Nikhil Muralidhar</p>
<p>Abstract: Modeling the evolution of physical systems is critical to many applications in science and engineering. As the evolution of these systems is governed by partial differential equations (PDEs), there are a number of computational simulations which resolve these systems with high accuracy. However, as these simulations incur high computational costs, they are infeasible to be employed for large-scale analysis. A popular alternative to simulators are neural network surrogates which are trained in a data-driven manner and are much more computationally efficient. However, these surrogate models suffer from high rollout error when used autoregressively, especially when confronted with training data paucity. Existing work proposes to improve surrogate rollout error by either including physical loss terms directly in the optimization of the model or incorporating computational simulators as `differentiable layers' in the neural network. Both of these approaches have their challenges, with physical loss functions suffering from slow convergence for stiff PDEs and simulator layers requiring gradients which are not always available, especially in legacy simulators. We propose the Hybrid PDE Predictor with Reinforcement Learning (HyPER) model: a model-agnostic, RL based, cost-aware model which combines a neural surrogate, RL decision model, and a physics simulator (with or without gradients) to reduce surrogate rollout error significantly. In addition to reducing in-distribution rollout error by **47%-78%**, HyPER learns an intelligent policy that is adaptable to changing physical conditions and resistant to noise corruption.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiani Fan, Lwin Khin Shar, Ruichen Zhang, Ziyao Liu, Wenzhuo Yang, Dusit Niyato, Bomin Mao, Kwok-Yan Lam</p>
<p>Abstract: Money laundering is a financial crime that obscures the origin of illicit funds, necessitating the development and enforcement of anti-money laundering (AML) policies by governments and organizations. The proliferation of mobile payment platforms and smart IoT devices has significantly complicated AML investigations. As payment networks become more interconnected, there is an increasing need for efficient real-time detection to process large volumes of transaction data on heterogeneous payment systems by different operators such as digital currencies, cryptocurrencies and account-based payments. Most of these mobile payment networks are supported by connected devices, many of which are considered loT devices in the FinTech space that constantly generate data. Furthermore, the growing complexity and unpredictability of transaction patterns across these networks contribute to a higher incidence of false positives. While machine learning solutions have the potential to enhance detection efficiency, their application in AML faces unique challenges, such as addressing privacy concerns tied to sensitive financial data and managing the real-world constraint of limited data availability due to data regulations. Existing surveys in the AML literature broadly review machine learning approaches for money laundering detection, but they often lack an in-depth exploration of advanced deep learning techniques - an emerging field with significant potential. To address this gap, this paper conducts a comprehensive review of deep learning solutions and the challenges associated with their use in AML. Additionally, we propose a novel framework that applies the least-privilege principle by integrating machine learning techniques, codifying AML red flags, and employing account profiling to provide context for predictions and enable effective fraud detection under limited data availability....</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicholas Roberts, Niladri Chatterji, Sharan Narang, Mike Lewis, Dieuwke Hupkes</p>
<p>Abstract: Scaling laws are a critical component of the LLM development pipeline, most famously as a way to forecast training decisions such as 'compute-optimally' trading-off parameter count and dataset size, alongside a more recent growing list of other crucial decisions. In this work, we ask whether compute-optimal scaling behaviour can be skill-dependent. In particular, we examine knowledge and reasoning-based skills such as knowledge-based QA and code generation, and we answer this question in the affirmative: $\textbf{scaling laws are skill-dependent}$. Next, to understand whether skill-dependent scaling is an artefact of the pretraining datamix, we conduct an extensive ablation of different datamixes and find that, also when correcting for datamix differences, $\textbf{knowledge and code exhibit fundamental differences in scaling behaviour}$. We conclude with an analysis of how our findings relate to standard compute-optimal scaling using a validation set, and find that $\textbf{a misspecified validation set can impact compute-optimal parameter count by nearly 50%,}$ depending on its skill composition.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10065">Do We Always Need the Simplicity Bias? Looking for Optimal Inductive Biases in the Wild</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Damien Teney, Liangze Jiang, Florin Gogianu, Ehsan Abbasnejad</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural architectures tend to fit their data with relatively simple functions. This "simplicity bias" is widely regarded as key to their success. This paper explores the limits of this principle. Building on recent findings that the simplicity bias stems from ReLU activations [96], we introduce a method to meta-learn new activation functions and inductive biases better suited to specific tasks.
  Findings: We identify multiple tasks where the simplicity bias is inadequate and ReLUs suboptimal. In these cases, we learn new activation functions that perform better by inducing a prior of higher complexity. Interestingly, these cases correspond to domains where neural networks have historically struggled: tabular data, regression tasks, cases of shortcut learning, and algorithmic grokking tasks. In comparison, the simplicity bias induced by ReLUs proves adequate on image tasks where the best learned activations are nearly identical to ReLUs and GeLUs.
  Implications: Contrary to popular belief, the simplicity bias of ReLU networks is not universally useful. It is near-optimal for image classification, but other inductive biases are sometimes preferable. We showed that activation functions can control these inductive biases, but future tailored architectures might provide further benefits. Advances are still needed to characterize a model's inductive biases beyond "complexity", and their adequacy with the data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kartik Tripathi, Mohamed H. Hamza, Aditi Chattopadhyay, Todd C. Henry, Asha Hall</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, there has been an interest in the incorporation of buckypaper (BP), or carbon nanotube (CNT) membranes, in composite laminates. Research has shown that using BP in contrast to nanotube doped resin enables the introduction of a higher CNT weight fraction which offers multiple benefits including higher piezo resistivity for health monitoring applications and enhanced mechanical response for structural applications. However, their impact on the deformation and failure mechanisms of composite laminates has not been investigated thoroughly. Understanding these issues experimentally would require a carefully executed test plan involving a multitude of design parameters such as BP geometry and placement, material anisotropy and variability, and laminate stacking sequence. This paper presents a deep learning (DL)-based surrogate model for studying the mechanical response of hybrid carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composite laminates with BP interleaves under various mechanical loads. The surrogate model utilizes a long short-term memory architecture implemented within a DL framework and predicts the laminate global response for a given configuration, geometry, and loading condition. The DL framework training and cross-validation are performed via data acquisition from a series of three-point bend tests conducted through finite element analysis (FEA) and in-house experiments, respectively. The model predictions show good agreement with FEA simulations and experimental results, where CFRP with two BP interleaves showed enhanced flexural strength and modulus over pristine samples. This enhancement can be attributed to the excellent crack retardation capabilities of CNTs, particularly in the interlaminar region.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianhao Peng, Xuhong Li, Haitao Yuan, Yuchen Li, Haoyi Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph contrastive learning has emerged as a powerful technique for learning graph representations that are robust and discriminative. However, traditional approaches often neglect the critical role of subgraph structures, particularly the intra-subgraph characteristics and inter-subgraph relationships, which are crucial for generating informative and diverse contrastive pairs. These subgraph features are crucial as they vary significantly across different graph types, such as social networks where they represent communities, and biochemical networks where they symbolize molecular interactions. To address this issue, our work proposes a novel subgraph-oriented learnable augmentation method for graph contrastive learning, termed SOLA-GCL, that centers around subgraphs, taking full advantage of the subgraph information for data augmentation. Specifically, SOLA-GCL initially partitions a graph into multiple densely connected subgraphs based on their intrinsic properties. To preserve and enhance the unique characteristics inherent to subgraphs, a graph view generator optimizes augmentation strategies for each subgraph, thereby generating tailored views for graph contrastive learning. This generator uses a combination of intra-subgraph and inter-subgraph augmentation strategies, including node dropping, feature masking, intra-edge perturbation, inter-edge perturbation, and subgraph swapping. Extensive experiments have been conducted on various graph learning applications, ranging from social networks to molecules, under semi-supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and transfer learning settings to demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach over the state-of-the-art in GCL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanlin Pan, Kunpeng Liu, Wanfu Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: The purpose of partial multi-label feature selection is to select the most representative feature subset, where the data comes from partial multi-label datasets that have label ambiguity issues. For label disambiguation, previous methods mainly focus on utilizing the information inside the labels and the relationship between the labels and features. However, the information existing in the feature space is rarely considered, especially in partial multi-label scenarios where the noises is considered to be concentrated in the label space while the feature information is correct. This paper proposes a method based on latent space alignment, which uses the information mined in feature space to disambiguate in latent space through the structural consistency between labels and features. In addition, previous methods overestimate the consistency of features and labels in the latent space after convergence. We comprehensively consider the similarity of latent space projections to feature space and label space, and propose new feature selection term. This method also significantly improves the positive label identification ability of the selected features. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.</p>

<p>Abstract: Efficient training of artificial neural networks remains a key challenge in deep learning. Backpropagation (BP), the standard learning algorithm, relies on gradient descent and typically requires numerous iterations for convergence. In this study, we introduce Expectation Reflection (ER), a novel learning approach that updates weights multiplicatively based on the ratio of observed to predicted outputs. Unlike traditional methods, ER maintains consistency without requiring ad hoc loss functions or learning rate hyperparameters. We extend ER to multilayer networks and demonstrate its effectiveness in performing image classification tasks. Notably, ER achieves optimal weight updates in a single iteration. Additionally, we reinterpret ER as a modified form of gradient descent incorporating the inverse mapping of target propagation. These findings suggest that ER provides an efficient and scalable alternative for training neural networks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Time series forecasting (TSF) has long been a crucial task in both industry and daily life. Most classical statistical models may have certain limitations when applied to practical scenarios in fields such as energy, healthcare, traffic, meteorology, and economics, especially when high accuracy is required. With the continuous development of deep learning, numerous new models have emerged in the field of time series forecasting in recent years. However, existing surveys have not provided a unified summary of the wide range of model architectures in this field, nor have they given detailed summaries of works in feature extraction and datasets. To address this gap, in this review, we comprehensively study the previous works and summarize the general paradigms of Deep Time Series Forecasting (DTSF) in terms of model architectures. Besides, we take an innovative approach by focusing on the composition of time series and systematically explain important feature extraction methods. Additionally, we provide an overall compilation of datasets from various domains in existing works. Finally, we systematically emphasize the significant challenges faced and future research directions in this field.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10217">Efficient Federated Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models with Layer Dropout</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shilong Wang, Jianchun Liu, Hongli Xu, Jiaming Yan, Xianjun Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning plays a crucial role in enabling pre-trained LLMs to evolve from general language comprehension to task-specific expertise. To preserve user data privacy, federated fine-tuning is often employed and has emerged as the de facto paradigm. However, federated fine-tuning is prohibitively inefficient due to the tension between LLM complexity and the resource constraint of end devices, incurring unaffordable fine-tuning overhead. Existing literature primarily utilizes parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques to mitigate communication costs, yet computational and memory burdens continue to pose significant challenges for developers. This work proposes DropPEFT, an innovative federated PEFT framework that employs a novel stochastic transformer layer dropout method, enabling devices to deactivate a considerable fraction of LLMs layers during training, thereby eliminating the associated computational load and memory footprint. In DropPEFT, a key challenge is the proper configuration of dropout ratios for layers, as overhead and training performance are highly sensitive to this setting. To address this challenge, we adaptively assign optimal dropout-ratio configurations to devices through an exploration-exploitation strategy, achieving efficient and effective fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that DropPEFT can achieve a 1.3-6.3\times speedup in model convergence and a 40%-67% reduction in memory footprint compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifeng Cai, Ziqi Zhang, Ding Li, Yao Guo, Xiangqun Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern Federated Learning (FL) has become increasingly essential for handling highly heterogeneous mobile devices. Current approaches adopt a partial model aggregation paradigm that leads to sub-optimal model accuracy and higher training overhead. In this paper, we challenge the prevailing notion of partial-model aggregation and propose a novel "full-weight aggregation" method named Moss, which aggregates all weights within heterogeneous models to preserve comprehensive knowledge. Evaluation across various applications demonstrates that Moss significantly accelerates training, reduces on-device training time and energy consumption, enhances accuracy, and minimizes network bandwidth utilization when compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

To accelerate inference in such models, we derive, for the first time, an analog of the probability-flow ODE (PF-ODE) in infinite-dimensional function spaces.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andi Nika, Jonathan N\"other, Debmalya Mandal, Parameswaran Kamalaruban, Adish Singla, Goran Radanovi\'c</p>
<p>Abstract: We study data poisoning attacks in learning from human preferences. More specifically, we consider the problem of teaching/enforcing a target policy $\pi^\dagger$ by synthesizing preference data. We seek to understand the susceptibility of different preference-based learning paradigms to poisoned preference data by analyzing the number of samples required by the attacker to enforce $\pi^\dagger$. We first propose a general data poisoning formulation in learning from human preferences and then study it for two popular paradigms, namely: (a) reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) that operates by learning a reward model using preferences; (b) direct preference optimization (DPO) that directly optimizes policy using preferences. We conduct a theoretical analysis of the effectiveness of data poisoning in a setting where the attacker is allowed to augment a pre-existing dataset and also study its special case where the attacker can synthesize the entire preference dataset from scratch. As our main results, we provide lower/upper bounds on the number of samples required to enforce $\pi^\dagger$. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results in terms of the susceptibility of these learning paradigms under such data poisoning attacks.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present a framework for modeling complex, high-dimensional distributions on convex polytopes by leveraging recent advances in discrete and continuous normalizing flows on Riemannian manifolds. We show that any full-dimensional polytope is homeomorphic to a unit ball, and our approach harnesses flows defined on the ball, mapping them back to the original polytope. Furthermore, we introduce a strategy to construct flows when only the vertex representation of a polytope is available, employing maximum entropy barycentric coordinates and Aitchison geometry. Our experiments take inspiration from applications in metabolic flux analysis and demonstrate that our methods achieve competitive density estimation, sampling accuracy, as well as fast training and inference times.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Han Wan, Qi Wang, Hao Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Simulation of spatiotemporal systems governed by partial differential equations is widely applied in fields such as biology, chemistry, aerospace dynamics, and meteorology. Traditional numerical methods incur high computational costs due to the requirement of small time steps for accurate predictions. While machine learning has reduced these costs, long-term predictions remain challenged by error accumulation, particularly in scenarios with insufficient data or varying time scales, where stability and accuracy are compromised. Existing methods often neglect the effective utilization of multi-scale data, leading to suboptimal robustness in predictions. To address these issues, we propose a novel multi-scale learning framework, namely, the Physics-Informed Multi-Scale Recurrent Learning (PIMRL), to effectively leverage multi-scale data for spatiotemporal dynamics prediction. The PIMRL framework comprises two modules: the micro-scale module embeds physical knowledge into neural networks via pretraining, and the macro-scale module adopts a data-driven approach to learn the temporal evolution of physics in the latent space. Experimental results demonstrate that the PIMRL framework consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across five benchmark datasets ranging from one to three dimensions, showing average improvements of over 9\% in both RMSE and MAE evaluation metrics, with maximum enhancements reaching up to 80%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyi Xu, Jinfan Liu, Kuangxu Chen, Ye Chen, Zhangli Hu, Bingbing Ni</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurately and efficiently simulating complex fluid dynamics is a challenging task that has traditionally relied on computationally intensive methods. Neural network-based approaches, such as convolutional and graph neural networks, have partially alleviated this burden by enabling efficient local feature extraction. However, they struggle to capture long-range dependencies due to limited receptive fields, and Transformer-based models, while providing global context, incur prohibitive computational costs. To tackle these challenges, we propose AMR-Transformer, an efficient and accurate neural CFD-solving pipeline that integrates a novel adaptive mesh refinement scheme with a Navier-Stokes constraint-aware fast pruning module. This design encourages long-range interactions between simulation cells and facilitates the modeling of global fluid wave patterns, such as turbulence and shockwaves. Experiments show that our approach achieves significant gains in efficiency while preserving critical details, making it suitable for high-resolution physical simulations with long-range dependencies. On CFDBench, PDEBench and a new shockwave dataset, our pipeline demonstrates up to an order-of-magnitude improvement in accuracy over baseline models. Additionally, compared to ViT, our approach achieves a reduction in FLOPs of up to 60 times.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samih Karroum, Saad Mazhar</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper explores the application of bandit algorithms in both stochastic and adversarial settings, with a focus on theoretical analysis and practical applications. The study begins by introducing bandit problems, distinguishing between stochastic and adversarial variants, and examining key algorithms such as Explore-Then-Commit (ETC), Upper Confidence Bound (UCB), and Exponential-Weight Algorithm for Exploration and Exploitation (EXP3). Theoretical regret bounds are analyzed to compare the performance of these algorithms. The paper then introduces a novel framework, HyperArm Bandit Optimization (HABO), which applies EXP3 to hyperparameter tuning in machine learning models. Unlike traditional methods that treat entire configurations as arms, HABO treats individual hyperparameters as super-arms, and its potential configurations as sub-arms, enabling dynamic resource allocation and efficient exploration. Experimental results demonstrate HABO's effectiveness in classification and regression tasks, outperforming Bayesian Optimization in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy. The paper concludes with insights into the convergence guarantees of HABO and its potential for scalable and robust hyperparameter optimization.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graph domain adaptation has emerged as a promising approach to facilitate knowledge transfer across different domains. Recently, numerous models have been proposed to enhance their generalization capabilities in this field. However, there is still no unified library that brings together existing techniques and simplifies their implementation. To fill this gap, we introduce PyGDA, an open-source Python library tailored for graph domain adaptation. As the first comprehensive library in this area, PyGDA covers more than 20 widely used graph domain adaptation methods together with different types of graph datasets. Specifically, PyGDA offers modular components, enabling users to seamlessly build custom models with a variety of commonly used utility functions. To handle large-scale graphs, PyGDA includes support for features such as sampling and mini-batch processing, ensuring efficient computation. In addition, PyGDA also includes comprehensive performance benchmarks and well-documented user-friendly API for both researchers and practitioners.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyu Mou, Miao Xu, Rongquan Bai, Zhuoran Yang, Chuan Yu, Jian Xu, Bo Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Many online advertising platforms provide advertisers with auto-bidding services to enhance their advertising performance. However, most existing auto-bidding algorithms fail to accurately capture the auto-bidding problem formulation that the platform truly faces, let alone solve it. Actually, we argue that the platform should try to help optimize each advertiser's performance to the greatest extent -- which makes $\epsilon$-Nash Equilibrium ($\epsilon$-NE) a necessary solution concept -- while maximizing the social welfare of all the advertisers for the platform's long-term value. Based on this, we introduce the \emph{Nash-Equilibrium Constrained Bidding} (NCB), a new formulation of the auto-bidding problem from the platform's perspective. Specifically, it aims to maximize the social welfare of all advertisers under the $\epsilon$-NE constraint. However, the NCB problem presents significant challenges due to its constrained bi-level structure and the typically large number of advertisers involved. To address these challenges, we propose a \emph{Bi-level Policy Gradient} (BPG) framework with theoretical guarantees. Notably, its computational complexity is independent of the number of advertisers, and the associated gradients are straightforward to compute. Extensive simulated and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of the BPG framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Duc Kien Doan, Bang Giang Le, Viet Cuong Ta</p>
<p>Abstract: In safe reinforcement learning, agent needs to balance between exploration actions and safety constraints. Following this paradigm, domain transfer approaches learn a prior Q-function from the related environments to prevent unsafe actions. However, because of the large number of false positives, some safe actions are never executed, leading to inadequate exploration in sparse-reward environments. In this work, we aim to learn an efficient state representation to balance the exploration and safety-prefer action in a sparse-reward environment. Firstly, the image input is mapped to latent representation by an auto-encoder. A further contrastive learning objective is employed to distinguish safe and unsafe states. In the learning phase, the latent distance is used to construct an additional safety check, which allows the agent to bias the exploration if it visits an unsafe state. To verify the effectiveness of our method, the experiment is carried out in three navigation-based MiniGrid environments. The result highlights that our method can explore the environment better while maintaining a good balance between safety and efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanis Basso-Bert, Anca Molnos, Romain Lemaire, William Guicquero, Antoine Dupret</p>
<p>Abstract: In dynamic environments where new concepts continuously emerge, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) must adapt by learning new classes while retaining previously acquired ones. This challenge is addressed by Class-Incremental Learning (CIL). This paper introduces Generative Binary Memory (GBM), a novel CIL pseudo-replay approach which generates synthetic binary pseudo-exemplars. Relying on Bernoulli Mixture Models (BMMs), GBM effectively models the multi-modal characteristics of class distributions, in a latent, binary space. With a specifically-designed feature binarizer, our approach applies to any conventional DNN. GBM also natively supports Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) for highly-constrained model sizes in embedded systems. The experimental results demonstrate that GBM achieves higher than state-of-the-art average accuracy on CIFAR100 (+2.9%) and TinyImageNet (+1.5%) for a ResNet-18 equipped with our binarizer. GBM also outperforms emerging CIL methods for BNNs, with +3.1% in final accuracy and x4.7 memory reduction, on CORE50.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Roy Friedman, Noa Moriel, Matthew Ricci, Guy Pelc, Yair Weiss, Mor Nitzan</p>
<p>Abstract: Characterizing dynamical systems given limited measurements is a common challenge throughout the physical and biological sciences. However, this task is challenging, especially due to transient variability in systems with equivalent long-term dynamics. We address this by introducing smooth prototype equivalences (SPE), a framework that fits a diffeomorphism using normalizing flows to distinct prototypes - simplified dynamical systems that define equivalence classes of behavior. SPE enables classification by comparing the deformation loss of the observed sparse, high-dimensional measurements to the prototype dynamics. Furthermore, our approach enables estimation of the invariant sets of the observed dynamics through the learned mapping from prototype space to data space. Our method outperforms existing techniques in the classification of oscillatory systems and can efficiently identify invariant structures like limit cycles and fixed points in an equation-free manner, even when only a small, noisy subset of the phase space is observed. Finally, we show how our method can be used for the detection of biological processes like the cell cycle trajectory from high-dimensional single-cell gene expression data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Online conformal prediction enables the runtime calibration of a pre-trained artificial intelligence model using feedback on its performance. Calibration is achieved through set predictions that are updated via online rules so as to ensure long-term coverage guarantees. While recent research has demonstrated the benefits of incorporating prior knowledge into the calibration process, this has come at the cost of replacing coverage guarantees with less tangible regret guarantees based on the quantile loss. This work introduces intermittent mirror online conformal prediction (IM-OCP), a novel runtime calibration framework that integrates prior knowledge, while maintaining long-term coverage and achieving sub-linear regret. IM-OCP features closed-form updates with minimal memory complexity, and is designed to operate under potentially intermittent feedback.</p>

<p>Abstract: Popular safe Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithms learn control policies for safety-critical systems in unknown environments. However, most algorithms make a smoothness assumption, which is encoded by a known bounded norm in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). The RKHS is a potentially infinite-dimensional space, and it remains unclear how to reliably obtain the RKHS norm of an unknown function. In this work, we propose a safe BO algorithm capable of estimating the RKHS norm from data. We provide statistical guarantees on the RKHS norm estimation, integrate the estimated RKHS norm into existing confidence intervals and show that we retain theoretical guarantees, and prove safety of the resulting safe BO algorithm. We apply our algorithm to safely optimize reinforcement learning policies on physics simulators and on a real inverted pendulum, demonstrating improved performance, safety, and scalability compared to the state-of-the-art.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmed El-Gazzar, Marcel van Gerven</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we propose FlowTime, a generative model for probabilistic forecasting of multivariate timeseries data. Given historical measurements and optional future covariates, we formulate forecasting as sampling from a learned conditional distribution over future trajectories. Specifically, we decompose the joint distribution of future observations into a sequence of conditional densities, each modeled via a shared flow that transforms a simple base distribution into the next observation distribution, conditioned on observed covariates. To achieve this, we leverage the flow matching (FM) framework, enabling scalable and simulation-free learning of these transformations. By combining this factorization with the FM objective, FlowTime retains the benefits of autoregressive models -- including strong extrapolation performance, compact model size, and well-calibrated uncertainty estimates -- while also capturing complex multi-modal conditional distributions, as seen in modern transport-based generative models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of FlowTime on multiple dynamical systems and real-world forecasting tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alceu Bissoto, Trung-Dung Hoang, Tim Fl\"uhmann, Susu Sun, Christian F. Baumgartner, Lisa M. Koch</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models may suffer from significant performance disparities between patient groups. Identifying such disparities by monitoring performance at a granular level is crucial for safely deploying ML to each patient. Traditional subgroup analysis based on metadata can expose performance disparities only if the available metadata (e.g., patient sex) sufficiently reflects the main reasons for performance variability, which is not common. Subgroup discovery techniques that identify cohesive subgroups based on learned feature representations appear as a potential solution: They could expose hidden stratifications and provide more granular subgroup performance reports. However, subgroup discovery is challenging to evaluate even as a standalone task, as ground truth stratification labels do not exist in real data. Subgroup discovery has thus neither been applied nor evaluated for the application of subgroup performance monitoring. Here, we apply subgroup discovery for performance monitoring in chest x-ray and skin lesion classification. We propose novel evaluation strategies and show that a simplified subgroup discovery method without access to classification labels or metadata can expose larger performance disparities than traditional metadata-based subgroup analysis. We provide the first compelling evidence that subgroup discovery can serve as an important tool for comprehensive performance validation and monitoring of trustworthy AI in medicine.</p>

<p>Abstract: We consider a good arm identification problem in a stochastic bandit setting with multi-objectives, where each arm $i\in[K]$ is associated with $M$ distributions $\mathcal{D}_i^{(1)}, \ldots, \mathcal{D}_i^{(M)}$. For each round $t$, the player/algorithm pulls one arm $i_t$ and receives a vector feedback, where each component $m$ is sampled according to $\mathcal{D}_i^{(m)}$. The target is twofold, one is finding one arm whose means are larger than the predefined thresholds $\xi_1,\ldots,\xi_M$ with a confidence bound $\delta$ and an accuracy rate $\epsilon$ with a bounded sample complexity, the other is output $\bot$ to indicate no such arm exists. We propose an algorithm with a sample complexity bound. When $M=1$ and $\epsilon = 0$, our bound is the same as the one given in the previous work when and novel bounds for $M > 1$. The proposed algorithm attains better numerical performance than other baselines in the experiments on synthetic and real datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matteo Gambella, Fabrizio Pittorino, Manuel Roveri</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has become an essential tool for designing effective and efficient neural networks. In this paper, we investigate the geometric properties of neural architecture spaces commonly used in differentiable NAS methods, specifically NAS-Bench-201 and DARTS. By defining flatness metrics such as neighborhoods and loss barriers along paths in architecture space, we reveal locality and flatness characteristics analogous to the well-known properties of neural network loss landscapes in weight space. In particular, we find that highly accurate architectures cluster together in flat regions, while suboptimal architectures remain isolated, unveiling the detailed geometrical structure of the architecture search landscape. Building on these insights, we propose Architecture-Aware Minimization (A$^2$M), a novel analytically derived algorithmic framework that explicitly biases, for the first time, the gradient of differentiable NAS methods towards flat minima in architecture space. A$^2$M consistently improves generalization over state-of-the-art DARTS-based algorithms on benchmark datasets including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet16-120, across both NAS-Bench-201 and DARTS search spaces. Notably, A$^2$M is able to increase the test accuracy, on average across different differentiable NAS methods, by +3.60\% on CIFAR-10, +4.60\% on CIFAR-100, and +3.64\% on ImageNet16-120, demonstrating its superior effectiveness in practice. A$^2$M can be easily integrated into existing differentiable NAS frameworks, offering a versatile tool for future research and applications in automated machine learning.

This work focuses on equality, inequality, and inclusion, along with the properties they satisfy, such as ir/reflexivity, a/symmetry, transitivity, and logical complexity (e.g., number of reasoning ``hops''). We propose an alternative to in-context learning that trains only the representations of newly introduced tokens, namely out-of-context representation learning. This method mitigates linguistic biases already present in a model and, differently from in-context learning, does not rely on external information or illustrations. We argue out-of-context representation learning as a better alternative to in-context learning and fine-tuning to evaluate the capabilities of LLMs on logic tasks that are the building blocks of more complex reasoning benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luyuan Xie, Tianyu Luan, Wenyuan Cai, Guochen Yan, Zhaoyu Chen, Nan Xi, Yuejian Fang, Qingni Shen, Zhonghai Wu, Junsong Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning has wide applications in the medical field. It enables knowledge sharing among different healthcare institutes while protecting patients' privacy. However, existing federated learning systems are typically centralized, requiring clients to upload client-specific knowledge to a central server for aggregation. This centralized approach would integrate the knowledge from each client into a centralized server, and the knowledge would be already undermined during the centralized integration before it reaches back to each client. Besides, the centralized approach also creates a dependency on the central server, which may affect training stability if the server malfunctions or connections are unstable. To address these issues, we propose a decentralized federated learning framework named dFLMoE. In our framework, clients directly exchange lightweight head models with each other. After exchanging, each client treats both local and received head models as individual experts, and utilizes a client-specific Mixture of Experts (MoE) approach to make collective decisions. This design not only reduces the knowledge damage with client-specific aggregations but also removes the dependency on the central server to enhance the robustness of the framework. We validate our framework on multiple medical tasks, demonstrating that our method evidently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches under both model homogeneity and heterogeneity settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenwei Wang, Ruibin Bai, Tiehua Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The application of learning based methods to vehicle routing problems has emerged as a pivotal area of research in combinatorial optimization. These problems are characterized by vast solution spaces and intricate constraints, making traditional approaches such as exact mathematical models or heuristic methods prone to high computational overhead or reliant on the design of complex heuristic operators to achieve optimal or near optimal solutions. Meanwhile, although some recent learning-based methods can produce good performance for VRP with straightforward constraint scenarios, they often fail to effectively handle hard constraints that are common in practice. This study introduces a novel end-to-end framework that combines constraint-oriented hypergraphs with reinforcement learning to address vehicle routing problems. A central innovation of this work is the development of a constraint-oriented dynamic hyperedge reconstruction strategy within an encoder, which significantly enhances hypergraph representation learning. Additionally, the decoder leverages a double-pointer attention mechanism to iteratively generate solutions. The proposed model is trained by incorporating asynchronous parameter updates informed by hypergraph constraints and optimizing a dual loss function comprising constraint loss and policy gradient loss. The experiment results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach not only eliminates the need for sophisticated heuristic operators but also achieves substantial improvements in solution quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dibyakanti Kumar, Samyak Jha, Anirbit Mukherjee</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we will establish that the Langevin Monte-Carlo algorithm can learn depth-2 neural nets of any size and for any data and we give non-asymptotic convergence rates for it. We achieve this via showing that under Total Variation distance and q-Renyi divergence, the iterates of Langevin Monte Carlo converge to the Gibbs distribution of Frobenius norm regularized losses for any of these nets, when using smooth activations and in both classification and regression settings. Most critically, the amount of regularization needed for our results is independent of the size of the net. The key observation of ours is that two layer neural loss functions can always be regularized by a constant amount such that they satisfy the Villani conditions, and thus their Gibbs measures satisfy a Poincare inequality.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose BeamLLM, a vision-aided millimeter-wave (mmWave) beam prediction framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) to address the challenges of high training overhead and latency in mmWave communication systems. By combining computer vision (CV) with LLMs' cross-modal reasoning capabilities, the framework extracts user equipment (UE) positional features from RGB images and aligns visual-temporal features with LLMs' semantic space through reprogramming techniques. Evaluated on a realistic vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) scenario, the proposed method achieves 61.01% top-1 accuracy and 97.39% top-3 accuracy in standard prediction tasks, significantly outperforming traditional deep learning models. In few-shot prediction scenarios, the performance degradation is limited to 12.56% (top-1) and 5.55% (top-3) from time sample 1 to 10, demonstrating superior prediction capability.</p>

<p>Abstract: Social media platforms are becoming the foundations of social interactions including messaging and opinion expression. In this regard, Sentiment Analysis techniques focus on providing solutions to ensure the retrieval and analysis of generated data including sentiments, emotions, and discussed topics. International competitions such as the International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval) have attracted many researchers and practitioners with a special research interest in building sentiment analysis systems. In our work, we study top-ranking systems for each SemEval edition during the 2013-2021 period, a total of 658 teams participated in these editions with increasing interest over years. We analyze the proposed systems marking the evolution of research trends with a focus on the main components of sentiment analysis systems including data acquisition, preprocessing, and classification. Our study shows an active use of preprocessing techniques, an evolution of features engineering and word representation from lexicon-based approaches to word embeddings, and the dominance of neural networks and transformers over the classification phase fostering the use of ready-to-use models. Moreover, we provide researchers with insights based on experimented systems which will allow rapid prototyping of new systems and help practitioners build for future SemEval editions.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present a novel reinforcement learning (RL) environment designed to both optimize industrial sorting systems and study agent behavior in evolving spaces. In simulating material flow within a sorting process our environment follows the idea of a digital twin, with operational parameters like belt speed and occupancy level. To reflect real-world challenges, we integrate common upgrades to industrial setups, like new sensors or advanced machinery. It thus includes two variants: a basic version focusing on discrete belt speed adjustments and an advanced version introducing multiple sorting modes and enhanced material composition observations. We detail the observation spaces, state update mechanisms, and reward functions for both environments. We further evaluate the efficiency of common RL algorithms like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Deep-Q-Networks (DQN), and Advantage Actor Critic (A2C) in comparison to a classical rule-based agent (RBA). This framework not only aids in optimizing industrial processes but also provides a foundation for studying agent behavior and transferability in evolving environments, offering insights into model performance and practical implications for real-world RL applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shriyank Somvanshi, Anannya Ghosh Tusti, Rohit Chakraborty, Subasish Das</p>
<p>Abstract: Young motorcyclists, particularly those aged 15 to 24 years old, face a heightened risk of severe crashes due to factors such as speeding, traffic violations, and helmet usage. This study aims to identify key factors influencing crash severity by analyzing 10,726 young motorcyclist crashes in Texas from 2017 to 2022. Two advanced tabular deep learning models, ARMNet and MambaNet, were employed, using an advanced resampling technique to address class imbalance. The models were trained to classify crashes into three severity levels, Fatal or Severe, Moderate or Minor, and No Injury. ARMNet achieved an accuracy of 87 percent, outperforming 86 percent of Mambanet, with both models excelling in predicting severe and no injury crashes while facing challenges in moderate crash classification. Key findings highlight the significant influence of demographic, environmental, and behavioral factors on crash outcomes. The study underscores the need for targeted interventions, including stricter helmet enforcement and educational programs customized to young motorcyclists. These insights provide valuable guidance for policymakers in developing evidence-based strategies to enhance motorcyclist safety and reduce crash severity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Evgeniia Vu, Andrei Boiarov, Dmitry Vetrov</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating co-speech gestures in real time requires both temporal coherence and efficient sampling. We introduce Accelerated Rolling Diffusion, a novel framework for streaming gesture generation that extends rolling diffusion models with structured progressive noise scheduling, enabling seamless long-sequence motion synthesis while preserving realism and diversity. We further propose Rolling Diffusion Ladder Acceleration (RDLA), a new approach that restructures the noise schedule into a stepwise ladder, allowing multiple frames to be denoised simultaneously. This significantly improves sampling efficiency while maintaining motion consistency, achieving up to a 2x speedup with high visual fidelity and temporal coherence. We evaluate our approach on ZEGGS and BEAT, strong benchmarks for real-world applicability. Our framework is universally applicable to any diffusion-based gesture generation model, transforming it into a streaming approach. Applied to three state-of-the-art methods, it consistently outperforms them, demonstrating its effectiveness as a generalizable and efficient solution for real-time, high-fidelity co-speech gesture synthesis.</p>

<p>Abstract: Continual learning algorithms aim to learn from a sequence of tasks, making the training distribution non-stationary. The majority of existing continual learning approaches in the literature rely on heuristics and do not provide learning guarantees for the continual learning setup. In this paper, we present a new method called 'Continual Pick-to-Learn' (CoP2L), which is able to retain the most representative samples for each task in an efficient way. The algorithm is adapted from the Pick-to-Learn algorithm, rooted in the sample compression theory. This allows us to provide high-confidence upper bounds on the generalization loss of the learned predictors, numerically computable after every update of the learned model. We also empirically show on several standard continual learning benchmarks that our algorithm is able to outperform standard experience replay, significantly mitigating catastrophic forgetting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sahar Admoni, Omer Ben-Porat, Ofra Amir</p>
<p>Abstract: Policies generated by Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms can be difficult to describe to users, as they result from the interplay between complex reward structures and neural network-based representations. This combination often leads to unpredictable behaviors, making policies challenging to analyze and posing significant obstacles to fostering human trust in real-world applications. Global policy summarization methods aim to describe agent behavior through a demonstration of actions in a subset of world-states. However, users can only watch a limited number of demonstrations, restricting their understanding of policies. Moreover, those methods overly rely on user interpretation, as they do not synthesize observations into coherent patterns. In this work, we present SySLLM (Synthesized Summary using LLMs), a novel method that employs synthesis summarization, utilizing large language models' (LLMs) extensive world knowledge and ability to capture patterns, to generate textual summaries of policies. Specifically, an expert evaluation demonstrates that the proposed approach generates summaries that capture the main insights generated by experts while not resulting in significant hallucinations. Additionally, a user study shows that SySLLM summaries are preferred over demonstration-based policy summaries and match or surpass their performance in objective agent identification tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hooman Shahrokhi, Devjeet Raj Roy, Yan Yan, Venera Arnaoudova, Janaradhan Rao Doppa</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of generating valid and small prediction sets by sampling outputs (e.g., software code and natural language text) from a black-box deep generative model for a given input (e.g., textual prompt). The validity of a prediction set is determined by a user-defined binary admissibility function depending on the target application. For example, requiring at least one program in the set to pass all test cases in code generation application. To address this problem, we develop a simple and effective conformal inference algorithm referred to as Generative Prediction Sets (GPS). Given a set of calibration examples and black-box access to a deep generative model, GPS can generate prediction sets with provable guarantees. The key insight behind GPS is to exploit the inherent structure within the distribution over the minimum number of samples needed to obtain an admissible output to develop a simple conformal regression approach over the minimum number of samples. Experiments on multiple datasets for code and math word problems using different large language models demonstrate the efficacy of GPS over state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuo Xie, Tianhao Wang, Sashank Reddi, Sanjiv Kumar, Zhiyuan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a novel unified analysis for a broad class of adaptive optimization algorithms with structured (e.g., layerwise, diagonal, and kronecker-factored) preconditioners for both online regret minimization and offline convex optimization. Our analysis not only provides matching rate to several important structured preconditioned algorithms including diagonal AdaGrad, full-matrix AdaGrad, and AdaGrad-Norm, but also gives an improved convergence rate for a one-sided variant of Shampoo over that of original Shampoo. Interestingly, more structured preconditioners (e.g., diagonal Adagrad, AdaGrad-Norm which use less space and compute) are often presented as computationally efficient approximations to full-matrix Adagrad, aiming for improved optimization performance through better approximations. Our unified analysis challenges this prevailing view and reveals, perhaps surprisingly, that more structured preconditioners, despite using less space and computation per step, can outperform their less structured counterparts. To demonstrate this, we show that one-sided Shampoo, which is relatively much cheaper than full-matrix AdaGrad could outperform it both theoretically and experimentally.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Reshma Rastogi, Ankush Bisht, Sanjay Kumar, Suresh Chandra</p>
<p>Abstract: Support Vector Regression (SVR) and its variants are widely used to handle regression tasks, however, since their solution involves solving an expensive quadratic programming problem, it limits its application, especially when dealing with large datasets. Additionally, SVR uses an epsilon-insensitive loss function which is sensitive to outliers and therefore can adversely affect its performance. We propose Granular Ball Support Vector Regression (GBSVR) to tackle problem of regression by using granular ball concept. These balls are useful in simplifying complex data spaces for machine learning tasks, however, to the best of our knowledge, they have not been sufficiently explored for regression problems. Granular balls group the data points into balls based on their proximity and reduce the computational cost in SVR by replacing the large number of data points with far fewer granular balls. This work also suggests a discretization method for continuous-valued attributes to facilitate the construction of granular balls. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated on several benchmark datasets and it outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arvid Frydenlund</p>
<p>Abstract: This work concerns the path-star task, a minimal example of searching over a graph. The graph, $G$, is star-shaped with $D$ arms radiating from a start node, $s$. A language model (LM) is given $G$, $s$, and a target node $t$, which ends one of the arms and is tasked with generating the arm containing $t$. The minimal nature of this task means only a single choice needs to be made: which of the $D$ arms contains $t$?
  Decoder-only LMs fail to solve this elementary task above $1/D$ chance due to a learned shortcut that absorbs training supervision. We show how this pathology is caused by excess supervision and we present a series of solutions demonstrating that the task is solvable via decoder-only LMs. We find that the task's minimal nature causes its difficulty, as it prevents task decomposition. Our solutions provide insight into the pathology and its implications for LMs trained via next-token prediction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jing Xu, Franziska Boenisch, Iyiola Emmanuel Olatunji, Adam Dziedzic</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable performance in various applications. Recently, graph prompt learning has emerged as a powerful GNN training paradigm, inspired by advances in language and vision foundation models. Here, a GNN is pre-trained on public data and then adapted to sensitive tasks using lightweight graph prompts. However, using prompts from sensitive data poses privacy risks. In this work, we are the first to investigate these practical risks in graph prompts by instantiating a membership inference attack that reveals significant privacy leakage. We also find that the standard privacy method, DP-SGD, fails to provide practical privacy-utility trade-offs in graph prompt learning, likely due to the small number of sensitive data points used to learn the prompts. As a solution, we propose DP-GPL for differentially private graph prompt learning based on the PATE framework, that generates a graph prompt with differential privacy guarantees. Our evaluation across various graph prompt learning methods, GNN architectures, and pre-training strategies demonstrates that our algorithm achieves high utility at strong privacy, effectively mitigating privacy concerns while preserving the powerful capabilities of prompted GNNs as powerful foundation models in the graph domain.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite their remarkable performance, large language models lack elementary safety features, and this makes them susceptible to numerous malicious attacks. In particular, previous work has identified the absence of an intrinsic separation between instructions and data as a root cause for the success of prompt injection attacks. In this work, we propose an architectural change, ASIDE, that allows the model to clearly separate between instructions and data by using separate embeddings for them. Instead of training the embeddings from scratch, we propose a method to convert an existing model to ASIDE form by using two copies of the original model's embeddings layer, and applying an orthogonal rotation to one of them. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by showing (1) highly increased instruction-data separation scores without a loss in model capabilities and (2) competitive results on prompt injection benchmarks, even without dedicated safety training. Additionally, we study the working mechanism behind our method through an analysis of model representations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nannan Wu, Zengqiang Yan, Nong Sang, Li Yu, Chang Wen Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Training a model that effectively handles both common and rare data-i.e., achieving performance fairness-is crucial in federated learning (FL). While existing fair FL methods have shown effectiveness, they remain vulnerable to mislabeled data. Ensuring robustness in fair FL is therefore essential. However, fairness and robustness inherently compete, which causes robust strategies to hinder fairness. In this paper, we attribute this competition to the homogeneity in loss patterns exhibited by rare and mislabeled data clients, preventing existing loss-based fair and robust FL methods from effectively distinguishing and handling these two distinct client types. To address this, we propose performance-capacity analysis, which jointly considers model performance on each client and its capacity to handle the dataset, measured by loss and a newly introduced feature dispersion score. This allows mislabeled clients to be identified by their significantly deviated performance relative to capacity while preserving rare data clients. Building on this, we introduce FedPCA, an FL method that robustly achieves fairness. FedPCA first identifies mislabeled clients via a Gaussian Mixture Model on loss-dispersion pairs, then applies fairness and robustness strategies in global aggregation and local training by adjusting client weights and selectively using reliable data. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate FedPCA's effectiveness in tackling this complex challenge. Code will be publicly available upon acceptance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Transformer models have demonstrated exceptional performance across a wide range of applications. Though forming the foundation of Transformer models, the dot-product attention does not scale well to long-context data since its time requirement grows quadratically with context length. In this work, we propose Radar, a training-free approach that accelerates inference by dynamically searching for the most important context tokens. For any pre-trained Transformer, Radar can reduce the decoding time complexity without training or heuristically evicting tokens. Moreover, we provide theoretical justification for our approach, demonstrating that Radar can reliably identify the most important tokens with high probability. We conduct extensive comparisons with the previous methods on a wide range of tasks. The results demonstrate that Radar achieves the state-of-the-art performance across different architectures with reduced time complexity, offering a practical solution for efficient long-context processing of Transformers.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the rapid evolution of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Large Language Models (LLMs) have reshaped the frontiers of various fields, spanning healthcare, public health, engineering, science, agriculture, education, arts, humanities, and mathematical reasoning. Among these advancements, DeepSeek models have emerged as noteworthy contenders, demonstrating promising capabilities that set them apart from their peers. While previous studies have conducted comparative analyses of LLMs, few have delivered a comprehensive evaluation of mathematical reasoning across a broad spectrum of LLMs. In this work, we aim to bridge this gap by conducting an in-depth comparative study, focusing on the strengths and limitations of DeepSeek models in relation to their leading counterparts. In particular, our study systematically evaluates the mathematical reasoning performance of two DeepSeek models alongside five prominent LLMs across three independent benchmark datasets. The findings reveal several key insights: 1). DeepSeek-R1 consistently achieved the highest accuracy on two of the three datasets, demonstrating strong mathematical reasoning capabilities. 2). The distilled variant of LLMs significantly underperformed compared to its peers, highlighting potential drawbacks in using distillation techniques. 3). In terms of response time, Gemini 2.0 Flash demonstrated the fastest processing speed, outperforming other models in efficiency, which is a crucial factor for real-time applications. Beyond these quantitative assessments, we delve into how architecture, training, and optimization impact LLMs' mathematical reasoning. Moreover, our study goes beyond mere performance comparison by identifying key areas for future advancements in LLM-driven mathematical reasoning. This research enhances our understanding of LLMs' mathematical reasoning and lays the groundwork for future advancements</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Justin Sahs, Ryan Pyle, Fabio Anselmi, Ankit Patel</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite classical statistical theory predicting severe overfitting, modern massively overparameterized neural networks still generalize well. This unexpected property is attributed to the network's so-called implicit bias, which describes its propensity to converge to solutions that generalize effectively, among the many possible that correctly label the training data. The aim of our research is to explore this bias from a new perspective, focusing on how non-linear activation functions contribute to shaping it. First, we introduce a reparameterization which removes a continuous weight rescaling symmetry. Second, in the kernel regime, we leverage this reparameterization to generalize recent findings that relate shallow Neural Networks to the Radon transform, deriving an explicit formula for the implicit bias induced by a broad class of activation functions. Specifically, by utilizing the connection between the Radon transform and the Fourier transform, we interpret the kernel regime's inductive bias as minimizing a spectral seminorm that penalizes high-frequency components, in a manner dependent on the activation function. Finally, in the adaptive regime, we demonstrate the existence of local dynamical attractors that facilitate the formation of clusters of hyperplanes where the input to a neuron's activation function is zero, yielding alignment between many neurons' response functions. We confirm these theoretical results with simulations. All together, our work provides a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying the generalization capabilities of overparameterized neural networks and its relation with the implicit bias, offering potential pathways for designing more efficient and robust models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Antonia van Betteray, Matthias Rottmann, Karsten Kahl</p>
<p>Abstract: The structural analogies of ResNets and Multigrid (MG) methods such as common building blocks like convolutions and poolings where already pointed out by He et al.\ in 2016. Multigrid methods are used in the context of scientific computing for solving large sparse linear systems arising from partial differential equations. MG methods particularly rely on two main concepts: smoothing and residual restriction / coarsening. Exploiting these analogies, He and Xu developed the MgNet framework, which integrates MG schemes into the design of ResNets. In this work, we introduce a novel neural network building block inspired by polynomial smoothers from MG theory. Our polynomial block from an MG perspective naturally extends the MgNet framework to Poly-Mgnet and at the same time reduces the number of weights in MgNet. We present a comprehensive study of our polynomial block, analyzing the choice of initial coefficients, the polynomial degree, the placement of activation functions, as well as of batch normalizations. Our results demonstrate that constructing (quadratic) polynomial building blocks based on real and imaginary polynomial roots enhances Poly-MgNet's capacity in terms of accuracy. Furthermore, our approach achieves an improved trade-off of model accuracy and number of weights compared to ResNet as well as compared to specific configurations of MgNet.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiachen Zhu, Xinlei Chen, Kaiming He, Yann LeCun, Zhuang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Normalization layers are ubiquitous in modern neural networks and have long been considered essential. This work demonstrates that Transformers without normalization can achieve the same or better performance using a remarkably simple technique. We introduce Dynamic Tanh (DyT), an element-wise operation $DyT($x$) = \tanh(\alpha $x$)$, as a drop-in replacement for normalization layers in Transformers. DyT is inspired by the observation that layer normalization in Transformers often produces tanh-like, $S$-shaped input-output mappings. By incorporating DyT, Transformers without normalization can match or exceed the performance of their normalized counterparts, mostly without hyperparameter tuning. We validate the effectiveness of Transformers with DyT across diverse settings, ranging from recognition to generation, supervised to self-supervised learning, and computer vision to language models. These findings challenge the conventional understanding that normalization layers are indispensable in modern neural networks, and offer new insights into their role in deep networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Subhajit Maity, Killian Hitsman, Xin Li, Aritra Dutta</p>
<p>Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) are a remarkable innovation consisting of learnable activation functions with the potential to capture more complex relationships from data. Although KANs are useful in finding symbolic representations and continual learning of one-dimensional functions, their effectiveness in diverse machine learning (ML) tasks, such as vision, remains questionable. Presently, KANs are deployed by replacing multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) in deep network architectures, including advanced architectures such as vision Transformers (ViTs). In this paper, we are the first to design a general learnable Kolmogorov-Arnold Attention (KArAt) for vanilla ViTs that can operate on any choice of basis. However, the computing and memory costs of training them motivated us to propose a more modular version, and we designed particular learnable attention, called Fourier-KArAt. Fourier-KArAt and its variants either outperform their ViT counterparts or show comparable performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-1K datasets. We dissect these architectures' performance and generalization capacity by analyzing their loss landscapes, weight distributions, optimizer path, attention visualization, and spectral behavior, and contrast them with vanilla ViTs. The goal of this paper is not to produce parameter- and compute-efficient attention, but to encourage the community to explore KANs in conjunction with more advanced architectures that require a careful understanding of learnable activations. Our open-source code and implementation details are available on: https://subhajitmaity.me/KArAt</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eliahu Horwitz, Nitzan Kurer, Jonathan Kahana, Liel Amar, Yedid Hoshen</p>
<p>Abstract: As there are now millions of publicly available neural networks, searching and analyzing large model repositories becomes increasingly important. Navigating so many models requires an atlas, but as most models are poorly documented charting such an atlas is challenging. To explore the hidden potential of model repositories, we chart a preliminary atlas representing the documented fraction of Hugging Face. It provides stunning visualizations of the model landscape and evolution. We demonstrate several applications of this atlas including predicting model attributes (e.g., accuracy), and analyzing trends in computer vision models. However, as the current atlas remains incomplete, we propose a method for charting undocumented regions. Specifically, we identify high-confidence structural priors based on dominant real-world model training practices. Leveraging these priors, our approach enables accurate mapping of previously undocumented areas of the atlas. We publicly release our datasets, code, and interactive atlas.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ho Kei Cheng, Alexander Schwing</p>
<p>Abstract: Minibatch optimal transport coupling straightens paths in unconditional flow matching. This leads to computationally less demanding inference as fewer integration steps and less complex numerical solvers can be employed when numerically solving an ordinary differential equation at test time. However, in the conditional setting, minibatch optimal transport falls short. This is because the default optimal transport mapping disregards conditions, resulting in a conditionally skewed prior distribution during training. In contrast, at test time, we have no access to the skewed prior, and instead sample from the full, unbiased prior distribution. This gap between training and testing leads to a subpar performance. To bridge this gap, we propose conditional optimal transport C^2OT that adds a conditional weighting term in the cost matrix when computing the optimal transport assignment. Experiments demonstrate that this simple fix works with both discrete and continuous conditions in 8gaussians-to-moons, CIFAR-10, ImageNet-32x32, and ImageNet-256x256. Our method performs better overall compared to the existing baselines across different function evaluation budgets. Code is available at https://hkchengrex.github.io/C2OT</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Melkamu Mersha, Khang Lam, Joseph Wood, Ali AlShami, Jugal Kalita</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence models encounter significant challenges due to their black-box nature, particularly in safety-critical domains such as healthcare, finance, and autonomous vehicles. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) addresses these challenges by providing explanations for how these models make decisions and predictions, ensuring transparency, accountability, and fairness. Existing studies have examined the fundamental concepts of XAI, its general principles, and the scope of XAI techniques. However, there remains a gap in the literature as there are no comprehensive reviews that delve into the detailed mathematical representations, design methodologies of XAI models, and other associated aspects. This paper provides a comprehensive literature review encompassing common terminologies and definitions, the need for XAI, beneficiaries of XAI, a taxonomy of XAI methods, and the application of XAI methods in different application areas. The survey is aimed at XAI researchers, XAI practitioners, AI model developers, and XAI beneficiaries who are interested in enhancing the trustworthiness, transparency, accountability, and fairness of their AI models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Melkamu Abay Mersha, Mesay Gemeda Yigezu, Jugal Kalita</p>
<p>Abstract: The black-box nature of large language models (LLMs) necessitates the development of eXplainable AI (XAI) techniques for transparency and trustworthiness. However, evaluating these techniques remains a challenge. This study presents a general evaluation framework using four key metrics: Human-reasoning Agreement (HA), Robustness, Consistency, and Contrastivity. We assess the effectiveness of six explainability techniques from five different XAI categories model simplification (LIME), perturbation-based methods (SHAP), gradient-based approaches (InputXGradient, Grad-CAM), Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), and attention mechanisms-based explainability methods (Attention Mechanism Visualization, AMV) across five encoder-based language models: TinyBERT, BERTbase, BERTlarge, XLM-R large, and DeBERTa-xlarge, using the IMDB Movie Reviews and Tweet Sentiment Extraction (TSE) datasets. Our findings show that the model simplification-based XAI method (LIME) consistently outperforms across multiple metrics and models, significantly excelling in HA with a score of 0.9685 on DeBERTa-xlarge, robustness, and consistency as the complexity of large language models increases. AMV demonstrates the best Robustness, with scores as low as 0.0020. It also excels in Consistency, achieving near-perfect scores of 0.9999 across all models. Regarding Contrastivity, LRP performs the best, particularly on more complex models, with scores up to 0.9371.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly saturating existing benchmarks, necessitating new open-ended evaluations. We introduce the Factorio Learning Environment (FLE), based on the game of Factorio, that tests agents in long-term planning, program synthesis, and resource optimization. FLE provides exponentially scaling challenges -- from basic automation to complex factories processing millions of resource units per second. We provide two settings: (1) lab-play consisting of eight structured tasks with fixed resources, and (2) open-play with the unbounded task of building the largest factory on an procedurally generated map. We demonstrate across both settings that models still lack strong spatial reasoning. In lab-play, we find that LLMs exhibit promising short-horizon skills, yet are unable to operate effectively in constrained environments, reflecting limitations in error analysis. In open-play, while LLMs discover automation strategies that improve growth (e.g electric-powered drilling), they fail to achieve complex automation (e.g electronic-circuit manufacturing).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenyang Huang, Amal S. Sebastian, Venkatasubramanian Viswanathan</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a data-driven framework for learning optimal second-order total variation diminishing (TVD) flux limiters via differentiable simulations. In our fully differentiable finite volume solvers, the limiter functions are replaced by neural networks. By representing the limiter as a pointwise convex linear combination of the Minmod and Superbee limiters, we enforce both second-order accuracy and TVD constraints at all stages of training. Our approach leverages gradient-based optimization through automatic differentiation, allowing a direct backpropagation of errors from numerical solutions to the limiter parameters. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on various hyperbolic conservation laws, including the linear advection equation, the Burgers' equation, and the one-dimensional Euler equations. Remarkably, a limiter trained solely on linear advection exhibits strong generalizability, surpassing the accuracy of most classical flux limiters across a range of problems with shocks and discontinuities. The learned flux limiters can be readily integrated into existing computational fluid dynamics codes, and the proposed methodology also offers a flexible pathway to systematically develop and optimize flux limiters for complex flow problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qi Wu, Yingguang Yang, hao liu, Hao Peng, Buyun He, Yutong Xia, Yong Liao</p>
<p>Abstract: Social bot detection is crucial for mitigating misinformation, online manipulation, and coordinated inauthentic behavior. While existing neural network-based detectors perform well on benchmarks, they struggle with generalization due to distribution shifts across datasets and frequently produce overconfident predictions for out-of-distribution accounts beyond the training data. To address this, we introduce a novel Uncertainty Estimation for Social Bot Detection (UESBD) framework, which quantifies the predictive uncertainty of detectors beyond mere classification. For this task, we propose Robust Multi-modal Neural Processes (RMNP), which aims to enhance the robustness of multi-modal neural processes to modality inconsistencies caused by social bot camouflage. RMNP first learns unimodal representations through modality-specific encoders. Then, unimodal attentive neural processes are employed to encode the Gaussian distribution of unimodal latent variables. Furthermore, to avoid social bots stealing human features to camouflage themselves thus causing certain modalities to provide conflictive information, we introduce an evidential gating network to explicitly model the reliability of modalities. The joint latent distribution is learned through the generalized product of experts, which takes the reliability of each modality into consideration during fusion. The final prediction is obtained through Monte Carlo sampling of the joint latent distribution followed by a decoder. Experiments on three real-world benchmarks show the effectiveness of RMNP in classification and uncertainty estimation, as well as its robustness to modality conflicts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Milad Rahmati</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are transforming modern transportation, but their reliability and safety are significantly challenged by harsh weather conditions such as heavy rain, fog, and snow. These environmental factors impair the performance of cameras, LiDAR, and radar, leading to reduced situational awareness and increased accident risks. Conventional cloud-based AI systems introduce communication delays, making them unsuitable for the rapid decision-making required in real-time autonomous navigation. This paper presents a novel Edge AI-driven real-time decision-making framework designed to enhance AV responsiveness under adverse weather conditions. The proposed approach integrates convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for improved perception, alongside reinforcement learning (RL)-based strategies to optimize vehicle control in uncertain environments. By processing data at the network edge, this system significantly reduces decision latency while improving AV adaptability. The framework is evaluated using simulated driving scenarios in CARLA and real-world data from the Waymo Open Dataset, covering diverse weather conditions. Experimental results indicate that the proposed model achieves a 40% reduction in processing time and a 25% enhancement in perception accuracy compared to conventional cloud-based systems. These findings highlight the potential of Edge AI in improving AV autonomy, safety, and efficiency, paving the way for more reliable self-driving technology in challenging real-world environments.</p>

As the evolution of biobanks in genetics and systems biology has proved, accessing more extensive and varied data pools leads to a faster and more robust exploration and translation of results. More widespread use of federated learning may have the same impact in bioinformatics, allowing access to many combinations of genotypic, phenotypic and environmental information that are undercovered or not included in existing biobanks. This paper reviews the methodological, infrastructural and legal issues that academic and clinical institutions must address before implementing it. Finally, we provide recommendations for the reliable use of federated learning and its effective translation into clinical practice.</p>

<p>Abstract: Traditional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are effective for handling sequential data but have limitations such as gradient vanishing and difficulty in capturing long-term dependencies, which can impact their performance in dynamic and risky environments like stock trading. To address these limitations, this study explores the usage of the newly introduced Extended Long Short Term Memory (xLSTM) network in combination with a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach for automated stock trading. Our proposed method utilizes xLSTM networks in both actor and critic components, enabling effective handling of time series data and dynamic market environments. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), with its ability to balance exploration and exploitation, is employed to optimize the trading strategy. Experiments were conducted using financial data from major tech companies over a comprehensive timeline, demonstrating that the xLSTM-based model outperforms LSTM-based methods in key trading evaluation metrics, including cumulative return, average profitability per trade, maximum earning rate, maximum pullback, and Sharpe ratio. These findings mark the potential of xLSTM for enhancing DRL-based stock trading systems.</p>

In this work, we propose a novel point signature, the power spectrum signature, a measure on $\mathbb{R}$ defined as the squared graph Fourier transform of a graph signal. Unlike eigenvectors of the Laplacian from which it is derived, the power spectrum signature is invariant under graph automorphisms. We show that the power spectrum signature is stable under perturbations of the input graph with respect to the Wasserstein metric. We focus on the signature applied to classes of indicator functions, and its applications to generating descriptive features for vertices of graphs. To demonstrate the practical value of our signature, we showcase several applications in characterizing geometry and symmetries in point cloud data, and graph regression problems.</p>

Traditional tuning methods are often time-consuming and reliant on expert input, highlighting the need for more efficient approaches. This study aims to create a simulation-based framework integrated with Reinforcement Learning (RL) to address these challenges.

As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the application of our RL approach to an accelerator control problem and highlight the improvements in efficiency and performance achieved through our methodology. We discuss how the integration of simulation tools with a Python-based RL framework provides a powerful resource for the accelerator physics community, showcasing the potential of machine learning in optimizing complex physical systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Probabilistic reasoning is a key aspect of both human and artificial intelligence that allows for handling uncertainty and ambiguity in decision-making. In this paper, we introduce a novel numerical reasoning task under uncertainty, focusing on estimating the k-anonymity of user-generated documents containing privacy-sensitive information. We propose BRANCH, which uses LLMs to factorize a joint probability distribution to estimate the k-value-the size of the population matching the given information-by modeling individual pieces of textual information as random variables. The probability of each factor occurring within a population is estimated using standalone LLMs or retrieval-augmented generation systems, and these probabilities are combined into a final k-value. Our experiments show that this method successfully estimates the correct k-value 67% of the time, an 11% increase compared to GPT-4o chain-of-thought reasoning. Additionally, we leverage LLM uncertainty to develop prediction intervals for k-anonymity, which include the correct value in nearly 92% of cases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Julia Romberg, Christopher Schr\"oder, Julius Gonsior, Katrin Tomanek, Fredrik Olsson</p>
<p>Abstract: Supervised learning relies on annotated data, which is expensive to obtain. A longstanding strategy to reduce annotation costs is active learning, an iterative process, in which a human annotates only data instances deemed informative by a model. Large language models (LLMs) have pushed the effectiveness of active learning, but have also improved methods such as few- or zero-shot learning, and text synthesis - thereby introducing potential alternatives. This raises the question: has active learning become obsolete? To answer this fully, we must look beyond literature to practical experiences. We conduct an online survey in the NLP community to collect previously intangible insights on the perceived relevance of data annotation, particularly focusing on active learning, including best practices, obstacles and expected future developments. Our findings show that annotated data remains a key factor, and active learning continues to be relevant. While the majority of active learning users find it effective, a comparison with a community survey from over a decade ago reveals persistent challenges: setup complexity, estimation of cost reduction, and tooling. We publish an anonymized version of the collected dataset</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents MoE-Gen, a high-throughput MoE inference system optimized for single-GPU execution. Existing inference systems rely on model-based or continuous batching strategies, originally designed for interactive inference, which result in excessively small batches for MoE's key modules-attention and expert modules-leading to poor throughput. To address this, we introduce module-based batching, which accumulates tokens in host memory and dynamically launches large batches on GPUs to maximize utilization. Additionally, we optimize the choice of batch sizes for each module in an MoE to fully overlap GPU computation and communication, maximizing throughput. Evaluation demonstrates that MoE-Gen achieves 8-31x higher throughput compared to state-of-the-art systems employing model-based batching (FlexGen, MoE-Lightning, DeepSpeed), and offers even greater throughput improvements over continuous batching systems (e.g., vLLM and Ollama) on popular MoE models (DeepSeek and Mixtral) across offline inference tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sara Rajaee, Kumar Pratik, Gabriele Cesa, Arash Behboodi</p>
<p>Abstract: The most promising recent methods for AI reasoning require applying variants of reinforcement learning (RL) either on rolled out trajectories from the model, even for the step-wise rewards, or large quantities of human annotated trajectory data. The reliance on the rolled-out trajectory renders the compute cost and time prohibitively high. In particular, the correctness of a reasoning trajectory can typically only be judged at its completion, leading to sparse rewards in RL or requiring expensive synthetic data generation in expert iteration-like methods. In this work, we focus on the Automatic Theorem Proving (ATP) task and propose a novel verifier-in-the-loop design, which unlike existing approaches that leverage feedback on the entire reasoning trajectory, employs an automated verifier to give intermediate feedback at each step of the reasoning process. Using Lean as the verifier, we empirically show that the step-by-step local verification produces a global improvement in the model's reasoning accuracy and efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qian Ma, Ziping Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial examples are a major problem for machine learning models, leading to a continuous search for effective defenses. One promising direction is to leverage model explanations to better understand and defend against these attacks. We looked at AmI, a method proposed by a NeurIPS 2018 spotlight paper that uses model explanations to detect adversarial examples. Our study shows that while AmI is a promising idea, its performance is too dependent on specific settings (e.g., hyperparameter) and external factors such as the operating system and the deep learning framework used, and such drawbacks limit AmI's practical usage. Our findings highlight the need for more robust defense mechanisms that are effective under various conditions. In addition, we advocate for a comprehensive evaluation framework for defense techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Timothy Laurence, Joshua Harris, Leo Loman, Amy Douglas, Yung-Wai Chan, Luke Hounsome, Lesley Larkin, Michael Borowitz</p>
<p>Abstract: Foodborne gastrointestinal (GI) illness is a common cause of ill health in the UK. However, many cases do not interact with the healthcare system, posing significant challenges for traditional surveillance methods. The growth of publicly available online restaurant reviews and advancements in large language models (LLMs) present potential opportunities to extend disease surveillance by identifying public reports of GI illness. In this study, we introduce a novel annotation schema, developed with experts in GI illness, applied to the Yelp Open Dataset of reviews. Our annotations extend beyond binary disease detection, to include detailed extraction of information on symptoms and foods. We evaluate the performance of open-weight LLMs across these three tasks: GI illness detection, symptom extraction, and food extraction. We compare this performance to RoBERTa-based classification models fine-tuned specifically for these tasks. Our results show that using prompt-based approaches, LLMs achieve micro-F1 scores of over 90% for all three of our tasks. Using prompting alone, we achieve micro-F1 scores that exceed those of smaller fine-tuned models. We further demonstrate the robustness of LLMs in GI illness detection across three bias-focused experiments. Our results suggest that publicly available review text and LLMs offer substantial potential for public health surveillance of GI illness by enabling highly effective extraction of key information. While LLMs appear to exhibit minimal bias in processing, the inherent limitations of restaurant review data highlight the need for cautious interpretation of results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pushkar Shukla, Aditya Chinchure, Emily Diana, Alexander Tolbert, Kartik Hosanagar, Vineeth N. Balasubramanian, Leonid Sigal, Matthew A. Turk</p>
<p>Abstract: The biases exhibited by Text-to-Image (TTI) models are often treated as if they are independent, but in reality, they may be deeply interrelated. Addressing bias along one dimension, such as ethnicity or age, can inadvertently influence another dimension, like gender, either mitigating or exacerbating existing disparities. Understanding these interdependencies is crucial for designing fairer generative models, yet measuring such effects quantitatively remains a challenge. In this paper, we aim to address these questions by introducing BiasConnect, a novel tool designed to analyze and quantify bias interactions in TTI models. Our approach leverages a counterfactual-based framework to generate pairwise causal graphs that reveals the underlying structure of bias interactions for the given text prompt. Additionally, our method provides empirical estimates that indicate how other bias dimensions shift toward or away from an ideal distribution when a given bias is modified. Our estimates have a strong correlation (+0.69) with the interdependency observations post bias mitigation. We demonstrate the utility of BiasConnect for selecting optimal bias mitigation axes, comparing different TTI models on the dependencies they learn, and understanding the amplification of intersectional societal biases in TTI models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Cardei, Jacob K Christopher, Thomas Hartvigsen, Brian R. Bartoldson, Bhavya Kailkhura, Ferdinando Fioretto</p>
<p>Abstract: Constraints are critical in text generation as LLM outputs are often unreliable when it comes to ensuring generated outputs adhere to user defined instruction or general safety guidelines. To address this gap, we present Constrained Discrete Diffusion (CDD), a novel method for enforcing constraints on natural language by integrating discrete diffusion models with differentiable optimization. Unlike conventional text generators, which often rely on post-hoc filtering or model retraining for controllable generation, we propose imposing constraints directly into the discrete diffusion sampling process. We illustrate how this technique can be applied to satisfy a variety of natural language constraints, including (i) toxicity mitigation by preventing harmful content from emerging, (ii) character and sequence level lexical constraints, and (iii) novel molecule sequence generation with specific property adherence. Experimental results show that our constraint-aware procedure achieves high fidelity in meeting these requirements while preserving fluency and semantic coherence, outperforming auto-regressive and existing discrete diffusion approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benjamin Towle, Xin Chen, Ke Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Pre-trained segmentation models are a powerful and flexible tool for segmenting images. Recently, this trend has extended to medical imaging. Yet, often these methods only produce a single prediction for a given image, neglecting inherent uncertainty in medical images, due to unclear object boundaries and errors caused by the annotation tool. Multiple Choice Learning is a technique for generating multiple masks, through multiple learned prediction heads. However, this cannot readily be extended to producing more outputs than its initial pre-training hyperparameters, as the sparse, winner-takes-all loss function makes it easy for one prediction head to become overly dominant, thus not guaranteeing the clinical relevancy of each mask produced. We introduce SeqSAM, a sequential, RNN-inspired approach to generating multiple masks, which uses a bipartite matching loss for ensuring the clinical relevancy of each mask, and can produce an arbitrary number of masks. We show notable improvements in quality of each mask produced across two publicly available datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/BenjaminTowle/SeqSAM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joohwan Seo, Soochul Yoo, Junwoo Chang, Hyunseok An, Hyunwoo Ryu, Soomi Lee, Arvind Kruthiventy, Jongeun CHoi, Roberto Horowitz</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning and Transformers have driven major breakthroughs in robotics by employing techniques such as imitation learning, reinforcement learning, and LLM-based multimodal perception and decision-making. However, conventional deep learning and Transformer models often struggle to process data with inherent symmetries and invariances, typically relying on large datasets or extensive data augmentation. Equivariant neural networks overcome these limitations by explicitly integrating symmetry and invariance into their architectures, leading to improved efficiency and generalization. This tutorial survey reviews a wide range of equivariant deep learning and control methods for robotics, from classic to state-of-the-art, with a focus on SE(3)-equivariant models that leverage the natural 3D rotational and translational symmetries in visual robotic manipulation and control design. Using unified mathematical notation, we begin by reviewing key concepts from group theory, along with matrix Lie groups and Lie algebras. We then introduce foundational group-equivariant neural network design and show how the group-equivariance can be obtained through their structure. Next, we discuss the applications of SE(3)-equivariant neural networks in robotics in terms of imitation learning and reinforcement learning. The SE(3)-equivariant control design is also reviewed from the perspective of geometric control. Finally, we highlight the challenges and future directions of equivariant methods in developing more robust, sample-efficient, and multi-modal real-world robotic systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> M. A. Fernandez, Elizabeth A. Barnes, Randal J. Barnes, Mark DeMaria, Marie McGraw, Galina Chirokova, Lixin Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: A new method for estimating tropical cyclone track uncertainty is presented and tested. This method uses a neural network to predict a bivariate normal distribution, which serves as an estimate for track uncertainty. We train the network and make predictions on forecasts from the National Hurricane Center (NHC), which currently uses static error distributions based on forecasts from the past five years for most applications. The neural network-based method produces uncertainty estimates that are dynamic and probabilistic. Further, the neural network-based method allows for probabilistic statements about tropical cyclone trajectories, including landfall probability, which we highlight. We show that our predictions are well calibrated using multiple metrics, that our method produces better uncertainty estimates than current NHC approaches, and that our method achieves similar performance to the Global Ensemble Forecast System. Once trained, the computational cost of predictions using this method is negligible, making it a strong candidate to improve the NHC's operational estimations of tropical cyclone track uncertainty.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have enabled remarkable control over various attributes, yet precise color specification remains a fundamental challenge. Existing approaches, such as ColorPeel, rely on model personalization, requiring additional optimization and limiting flexibility in specifying arbitrary colors. In this work, we introduce ColorWave, a novel training-free approach that achieves exact RGB-level color control in diffusion models without fine-tuning. By systematically analyzing the cross-attention mechanisms within IP-Adapter, we uncover an implicit binding between textual color descriptors and reference image features. Leveraging this insight, our method rewires these bindings to enforce precise color attribution while preserving the generative capabilities of pretrained models. Our approach maintains generation quality and diversity, outperforming prior methods in accuracy and applicability across diverse object categories. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that ColorWave establishes a new paradigm for structured, color-consistent diffusion-based image synthesis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stefan Sylvius Wagner, Stefan Harmeling</p>
<p>Abstract: Object-centric learning is fundamental to human vision and crucial for models requiring complex reasoning. Traditional approaches rely on slot-based bottlenecks to learn object properties explicitly, while recent self-supervised vision models like DINO have shown emergent object understanding. However, DINO representations primarily capture global scene features, often confounding individual object attributes. We investigate the effectiveness of DINO representations and slot-based methods for multi-object instance retrieval. Our findings reveal that DINO representations excel at capturing global object attributes such as object shape and size, but struggle with object-level details like colour, whereas slot-based representations struggle at both global and object-level understanding. To address this, we propose a method that combines global and local features by augmenting DINO representations with object-centric latent vectors from a Variational Autoencoder trained on segmented image patches that are extracted from the DINO features. This approach improves multi-object instance retrieval performance, bridging the gap between global scene understanding and fine-grained object representation without requiring full model retraining.</p>

<p>Abstract: Automated speech recognition (ASR) models have gained prominence for applications such as captioning, speech translation, and live transcription. This paper studies Whisper and two model variants: one optimized for live speech streaming and another for offline transcription. Notably, these models have been found to generate hallucinated content, reducing transcription reliability. Furthermore, larger model variants exhibit increased latency and pose challenges for deployment on resource-constrained devices. This study analyzes the similarities and differences between three Whisper models, qualitatively examining their distinct capabilities. Next, this study quantifies the impact of model quantization on latency and evaluates its viability for edge deployment. Using the open source LibriSpeech dataset, this paper evaluates the word error rate (WER) along with latency analysis of whispercpp using 3 quantization methods (INT4, INT5, INT8). Results show that quantization reduces latency by 19\% and model size by 45\%, while preserving transcription accuracy. These findings provide insights into the optimal use cases of different Whisper models and edge device deployment possibilities.

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of human trajectory forecasting, which aims to predict the inherently multi-modal future movements of humans based on their past trajectories and other contextual cues. We propose a novel motion prediction conditional flow matching model, termed MoFlow, to predict K-shot future trajectories for all agents in a given scene. We design a novel flow matching loss function that not only ensures at least one of the $K$ sets of future trajectories is accurate but also encourages all $K$ sets of future trajectories to be diverse and plausible. Furthermore, by leveraging the implicit maximum likelihood estimation (IMLE), we propose a novel distillation method for flow models that only requires samples from the teacher model. Extensive experiments on the real-world datasets, including SportVU NBA games, ETH-UCY, and SDD, demonstrate that both our teacher flow model and the IMLE-distilled student model achieve state-of-the-art performance. These models can generate diverse trajectories that are physically and socially plausible. Moreover, our one-step student model is $\textbf{100}$ times faster than the teacher flow model during sampling.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexei V. Tkachenko</p>
<p>Abstract: The fundamental thermodynamic bound is derived for the energy cost of inference in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). By applying Landauer's principle, we demonstrate that the linear operations in DNNs can, in principle, be performed reversibly, whereas the non-linear activation functions impose an unavoidable energy cost. The resulting theoretical lower bound on the inference energy is determined by the average number of neurons undergoing state transition for each inference. We also restate the thermodynamic bound in terms of negentropy, a metric which is more universal than energy for assessing thermodynamic cost of information processing. Concept of negentropy is further elaborated in the context of information processing in biological and engineered system as well as human intelligence. Our analysis provides insight into the physical limits of DNN efficiency and suggests potential directions for developing energy-efficient AI architectures that leverage reversible analog computing.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, quadruped robotics has advanced significantly, particularly in perception and motion control via reinforcement learning, enabling complex motions in challenging environments. Visual sensors like depth cameras enhance stability and robustness but face limitations, such as low operating frequencies relative to joint control and sensitivity to lighting, which hinder outdoor deployment. Additionally, deep neural networks in sensor and control systems increase computational demands. To address these issues, we introduce spiking neural networks (SNNs) and event cameras to perform a challenging quadruped parkour task. Event cameras capture dynamic visual data, while SNNs efficiently process spike sequences, mimicking biological perception. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach significantly outperforms traditional models, achieving excellent parkour performance with just 11.7% of the energy consumption of an artificial neural network (ANN)-based model, yielding an 88.3% energy reduction. By integrating event cameras with SNNs, our work advances robotic reinforcement learning and opens new possibilities for applications in demanding environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiwon Kim, Dongjun Hwang, Sungwon Woo, Rita Singh</p>
<p>Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) aims to continuously adapt to emerging classes while retaining knowledge of previously learned ones. Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) presents an even greater challenge which requires the model to learn incremental classes with only a limited number of samples. In conventional CIL, joint training is widely considered the upper bound, serving as both a benchmark and a methodological guide. However, we find that joint training fails to be a meaningful upper bound in FSCIL due to the inherent difficulty of inter-task class separation (ICS) caused by severe class imbalance. In this work, we introduce a new joint training benchmark tailored for FSCIL by integrating imbalance-aware techniques, effectively bridging the performance gap between base and incremental classes. Furthermore, we point out inconsistencies in the experimental setup and evaluation of existing FSCIL methods. To ensure fair comparisons between different FSCIL approaches and joint training, we standardize training conditions and propose a unified evaluation protocol that simultaneously considers the validation set and computational complexity. By establishing a reliable upper bound and a standardized evaluation framework for FSCIL, our work provides a clear benchmark and a practical foundation for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongqi Li, Xiaowei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Training deep neural networks is challenging. To accelerate training and enhance performance, we propose PadamP, a novel optimization algorithm. PadamP is derived by applying the adaptive estimation of the p-th power of the second-order moments under scale invariance, enhancing projection adaptability by modifying the projection discrimination condition. It is integrated into Adam-type algorithms, accelerating training, boosting performance, and improving generalization in deep learning. Combining projected gradient benefits with adaptive moment estimation, PadamP tackles unconstrained non-convex problems. Convergence for the non-convex case is analyzed, focusing on the decoupling of first-order moment estimation coefficients and second-order moment estimation coefficients. Unlike prior work relying on , our proof generalizes the convergence theorem, enhancing practicality. Experiments using VGG-16 and ResNet-18 on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 show PadamP's effectiveness, with notable performance on CIFAR-10/100, especially for VGG-16. The results demonstrate that PadamP outperforms existing algorithms in terms of convergence speed and generalization ability, making it a valuable addition to the field of deep learning optimization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Berk Iskender, Sushan Nakarmi, Nitin Daphalapurkar, Marc L. Klasky, Yoram Bresler</p>
<p>Abstract: Dynamic imaging involves the reconstruction of a spatio-temporal object at all times using its undersampled measurements. In particular, in dynamic computed tomography (dCT), only a single projection at one view angle is available at a time, making the inverse problem very challenging. Moreover, ground-truth dynamic data is usually either unavailable or too scarce to be used for supervised learning techniques. To tackle this problem, we propose RSR-NF, which uses a neural field (NF) to represent the dynamic object and, using the Regularization-by-Denoising (RED) framework, incorporates an additional static deep spatial prior into a variational formulation via a learned restoration operator. We use an ADMM-based algorithm with variable splitting to efficiently optimize the variational objective. We compare RSR-NF to three alternatives: NF with only temporal regularization; a recent method combining a partially-separable low-rank representation with RED using a denoiser pretrained on static data; and a deep-image prior-based model. The first comparison demonstrates the reconstruction improvements achieved by combining the NF representation with static restoration priors, whereas the other two demonstrate the improvement over state-of-the art techniques for dCT.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali Abedi, Q. M. Jonathan Wu, Ning Zhang, Farhad Pourpanah</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a promising approach for privacy-preserving collaborative learning. However, it faces significant challenges when dealing with domain shifts, especially when each client has access only to its source data and cannot share it during target domain adaptation. Moreover, FL methods often require high communication overhead due to multiple rounds of model updates between clients and the server. We propose a one-shot Federated Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (FUDA) method to address these limitations. Specifically, we introduce Scaled Entropy Attention (SEA) for model aggregation and Multi-Source Pseudo Labeling (MSPL) for target domain adaptation. SEA uses scaled prediction entropy on target domain to assign higher attention to reliable models. This improves the global model quality and ensures balanced weighting of contributions. MSPL distills knowledge from multiple source models to generate pseudo labels and manage noisy labels using smoothed soft-label cross-entropy (SSCE). Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods across four standard benchmarks while reducing communication and computation costs, making it highly suitable for real-world applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chang-Ock Lee, Byungeun Ryoo</p>
<p>Abstract: Extreme learning machines (ELMs), which preset hidden layer parameters and solve for last layer coefficients via a least squares method, can typically solve partial differential equations faster and more accurately than Physics Informed Neural Networks. However, they remain computationally expensive when high accuracy requires large least squares problems to be solved. Domain decomposition methods (DDMs) for ELMs have allowed parallel computation to reduce training times of large systems. This paper constructs a coarse space for ELMs, which enables further acceleration of their training. By partitioning interface variables into coarse and non-coarse variables, selective elimination introduces a Schur complement system on the non-coarse variables with the coarse problem embedded. Key to the performance of the proposed method is a Neumann-Neumann acceleration that utilizes the coarse space. Numerical experiments demonstrate significant speedup compared to a previous DDM method for ELMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongik Lee, Valentin Stanev, Xiaohang Zhang, Mijeong Kang, Ichiro Takeuchi, Seunghun Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Delineating the superconducting order parameters is a pivotal task in investigating superconductivity for probing pairing mechanisms, as well as their symmetry and topology. Point-contact Andreev reflection (PCAR) measurement is a simple yet powerful tool for identifying the order parameters. The PCAR spectra exhibit significant variations depending on the type of the order parameter in a superconductor, including its magnitude ($\mathit{\Delta}$), as well as temperature, interfacial quality, Fermi velocity mismatch, and other factors. The information on the order parameter can be obtained by finding the combination of these parameters, generating a theoretical spectrum that fits a measured experimental spectrum. However, due to the complexity of the spectra and the high dimensionality of parameters, extracting the fitting parameters is often time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this study, we employ a convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm to create models for rapid and automated analysis of PCAR spectra of various superconductors with different pairing symmetries (conventional $s$-wave, chiral $p_x+ip_y$-wave, and $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave). The training datasets are generated based on the Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk (BTK) theory and further modified and augmented by selectively incorporating noise and peaks according to the bias voltages. This approach not only replicates the experimental spectra but also brings the model's attention to important features within the spectra. The optimized models provide fitting parameters for experimentally measured spectra in less than 100 ms per spectrum. Our approaches and findings pave the way for rapid and automated spectral analysis which will help accelerate research on superconductors with complex order parameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haiqin Cui, Yifu Yuan, Yan Zheng, Jianye Hao</p>
<p>Abstract: Navigation and manipulation in open-world environments remain unsolved challenges in the Embodied AI. The high cost of commercial mobile manipulation robots significantly limits research in real-world scenes. To address this issue, we propose AhaRobot, a low-cost and fully open-source dual-arm mobile manipulation robot system with a hardware cost of only $1,000 (excluding optional computational resources), which is less than 1/15 of the cost of popular mobile robots. The AhaRobot system consists of three components: (1) a novel low-cost hardware architecture primarily composed of off-the-shelf components, (2) an optimized control solution to enhance operational precision integrating dual-motor backlash control and static friction compensation, and (3) a simple remote teleoperation method RoboPilot. We use handles to control the dual arms and pedals for whole-body movement. The teleoperation process is low-burden and easy to operate, much like piloting. RoboPilot is designed for remote data collection in embodied scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that RoboPilot significantly enhances data collection efficiency in complex manipulation tasks, achieving a 30% increase compared to methods using 3D mouse and leader-follower systems. It also excels at completing extremely long-horizon tasks in one go. Furthermore, AhaRobot can be used to learn end-to-end policies and autonomously perform complex manipulation tasks, such as pen insertion and cleaning up the floor. We aim to build an affordable yet powerful platform to promote the development of embodied tasks on real devices, advancing more robust and reliable embodied AI.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiawei Zhang, Ziyuan Liu, Leon Yan, Gen Li, Yuantao Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance in modeling complex data priors, catalyzing their widespread adoption in solving various inverse problems. However, the inherently iterative nature of diffusion-based inverse algorithms often requires hundreds to thousands of steps, with performance degradation occurring under fewer steps which limits their practical applicability. While high-order diffusion ODE solvers have been extensively explored for efficient diffusion sampling without observations, their application to inverse problems remains underexplored due to the diverse forms of inverse algorithms and their need for repeated trajectory correction based on observations. To address this gap, we first introduce a canonical form that decomposes existing diffusion-based inverse algorithms into three modules to unify their analysis. Inspired by the linear subspace search strategy in the design of high-order diffusion ODE solvers, we propose the Learnable Linear Extrapolation (LLE) method, a lightweight approach that universally enhances the performance of any diffusion-based inverse algorithm that fits the proposed canonical form. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent improvements of the proposed LLE method across multiple algorithms and tasks, indicating its potential for more efficient solutions and boosted performance of diffusion-based inverse algorithms with limited steps.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiyang Ling, Karan Owalekar, Oluwatobiloba Adesanya, Erdem B{\i}y{\i}k, Daniel Seita</p>
<p>Abstract: Motion planning involves determining a sequence of robot configurations to reach a desired pose, subject to movement and safety constraints. Traditional motion planning finds collision-free paths, but this is overly restrictive in clutter, where it may not be possible for a robot to accomplish a task without contact. In addition, contacts range from relatively benign (e.g., brushing a soft pillow) to more dangerous (e.g., toppling a glass vase). Due to this diversity, it is difficult to characterize which contacts may be acceptable or unacceptable. In this paper, we propose IMPACT, a novel motion planning framework that uses Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to infer environment semantics, identifying which parts of the environment can best tolerate contact based on object properties and locations. Our approach uses the VLM's outputs to produce a dense 3D "cost map" that encodes contact tolerances and seamlessly integrates with standard motion planners. We perform experiments using 20 simulation and 10 real-world scenes and assess using task success rate, object displacements, and feedback from human evaluators. Our results over 3620 simulation and 200 real-world trials suggest that IMPACT enables efficient contact-rich motion planning in cluttered settings while outperforming alternative methods and ablations.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lu Shi, Yuxuan Xu, Shiyu Wang, Jinhao Huang, Wenhao Zhao, Yufei Jia, Zike Yan, Weibin Gu, Guyue Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: The sim-to-real gap remains a critical challenge in robotics, hindering the deployment of algorithms trained in simulation to real-world systems. This paper introduces a novel Real-Sim-Real (RSR) loop framework leveraging differentiable simulation to address this gap by iteratively refining simulation parameters, aligning them with real-world conditions, and enabling robust and efficient policy transfer. A key contribution of our work is the design of an informative cost function that encourages the collection of diverse and representative real-world data, minimizing bias and maximizing the utility of each data point for simulation refinement. This cost function integrates seamlessly into existing reinforcement learning algorithms (e.g., PPO, SAC) and ensures a balanced exploration of critical regions in the real domain. Furthermore, our approach is implemented on the versatile Mujoco MJX platform, and our framework is compatible with a wide range of robotic systems. Experimental results on several robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that our method significantly reduces the sim-to-real gap, achieving high task performance and generalizability across diverse scenarios of both explicit and implicit environmental uncertainties.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinze Li, Yixing Xu, Haiduo Huang, Xuanwu Yin, Dong Li, Edith C. H. Ngai, Emad Barsoum</p>
<p>Abstract: Speculative decoding (SPD) aims to accelerate the auto-regressive token generation process of a target Large Language Model (LLM). Some approaches employ a draft model with multiple heads to predict a sequence of future tokens, where each head handles a token in the sequence. The target LLM verifies the predicted sequence and accepts aligned tokens, enabling efficient multi-token generation. However, existing methods assume that all tokens within a sequence are equally important, employing identical head structures and relying on a single-generation paradigm, either serial or parallel. To this end, we theoretically demonstrate that initial tokens in the draft sequence are more important than later ones. Building on this insight, we propose Gumiho, a hybrid model combining serial and parallel heads. Specifically, given the critical importance of early tokens, we employ a sophisticated Transformer architecture for the early draft heads in a serial configuration to improve accuracy. For later tokens, we utilize multiple lightweight MLP heads operating in parallel to enhance efficiency. By allocating more advanced model structures and longer running times to the early heads, Gumiho achieves improved overall performance. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches, fully validating its effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guy Barzilai, Ohad Shamir</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we study when we might expect the optimization curve induced by gradient descent to be \emph{convex} -- precluding, for example, an initial plateau followed by a sharp decrease, making it difficult to decide when optimization should stop. Although such undesirable behavior can certainly occur when optimizing general functions, might it also occur in the benign and well-studied case of smooth convex functions? As far as we know, this question has not been tackled in previous work. We show, perhaps surprisingly, that the answer crucially depends on the choice of the step size. In particular, for the range of step sizes which are known to result in monotonic convergence to an optimal value, there is a regime where the optimization curve will be provably convex, and there is a regime where the curve can be non-convex. We also extend our results to gradient flow, and to the closely-related but different question of whether the gradient norm decreases monotonically.</p>

<p>Abstract: Identifying model parameters from observed configurations poses a fundamental challenge in data science, especially with limited data. Recently, diffusion models have emerged as a novel paradigm in generative machine learning, capable of producing new samples that closely mimic observed data. These models learn the gradient of model probabilities, bypassing the need for cumbersome calculations of partition functions across all possible configurations. We explore whether diffusion models can enhance parameter inference by augmenting small datasets. Our findings demonstrate this potential through a synthetic task involving inverse Ising inference and a real-world application of reconstructing missing values in neural activity data. This study serves as a proof-of-concept for using diffusion models for data augmentation in physics-related problems, thereby opening new avenues in data science.</p>

<p>Abstract: This article addresses Second Language (L2) writing development through an investigation of new grammatical and structural complexity metrics. We explore the paradigmatic production in learner English by linking language functions to specific grammatical paradigms. Using the EFCAMDAT as a gold standard and a corpus of French learners as an external test set, we employ a supervised learning framework to operationalise and evaluate seven microsystems. We show that learner levels are associated with the seven microsystems (MS). Using ordinal regression modelling for evaluation, the results show that all MS are significant but yield a low impact if taken individually. However, their influence is shown to be impactful if taken as a group. These microsystems and their measurement method suggest that it is possible to use them as part of broader-purpose CALL systems focused on proficiency assessment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bogdan Chornomaz, Shay Moran, Tom Waknine</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce and study the spherical dimension, a natural topological relaxation of the VC dimension that unifies several results in learning theory where topology plays a key role in the proofs. The spherical dimension is defined by extending the set of realizable datasets (used to define the VC dimension) to the continuous space of realizable distributions. In this space, a shattered set of size d (in the VC sense) is completed into a continuous object, specifically a d-dimensional sphere of realizable distributions. The spherical dimension is then defined as the dimension of the largest sphere in this space. Thus, the spherical dimension is at least the VC dimension.
  The spherical dimension serves as a common foundation for leveraging the Borsuk-Ulam theorem and related topological tools. We demonstrate the utility of the spherical dimension in diverse applications, including disambiguations of partial concept classes, reductions from classification to stochastic convex optimization, stability and replicability, and sample compression schemes. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that the open question posed by Alon, Hanneke, Holzman, and Moran (FOCS 2021) of whether there exist non-trivial disambiguations for halfspaces with margin is equivalent to the basic open question of whether the VC and spherical dimensions are finite together.</p>

<p>Abstract: Protecting the use of audio datasets is a major concern for data owners, particularly with the recent rise of audio deep learning models. While watermarks can be used to protect the data itself, they do not allow to identify a deep learning model trained on a protected dataset. In this paper, we adapt to audio data the recently introduced data taggants approach. Data taggants is a method to verify if a neural network was trained on a protected image dataset with top-$k$ predictions access to the model only. This method relies on a targeted data poisoning scheme by discreetly altering a small fraction (1%) of the dataset as to induce a harmless behavior on out-of-distribution data called keys. We evaluate our method on the Speechcommands and the ESC50 datasets and state of the art transformer models, and show that we can detect the use of the dataset with high confidence without loss of performance. We also show the robustness of our method against common data augmentation techniques, making it a practical method to protect audio datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Islands are diversity hotspots and vulnerable to environmental degradation, climate variations, land use changes and societal crises. These factors can exhibit interactive impacts on ecosystem services. The study reviewed a large number of papers on the climate change-islands-ecosystem services topic worldwide. Potential inclusion of land use changes and other drivers of impacts on ecosystem services were sequentially also recorded. The study sought to investigate the impacts of climate change, land use change, and other non-climatic driver changes on island ecosystem services. Explanatory variables examined were divided into two categories: environmental variables and methodological ones. Environmental variables include sea zone geographic location, ecosystem, ecosystem services, climate, land use, other driver variables, Methodological variables include consideration of policy interventions, uncertainty assessment, cumulative effects of climate change, synergistic effects of climate change with land use change and other anthropogenic and environmental drivers, and the diversity of variables used in the analysis. Machine learning and statistical methods were used to analyze their effects on island ecosystem services. Negative climate change impacts on ecosystem services are better quantified by land use change or other non-climatic driver variables than by climate variables. The synergy of land use together with climate changes is modulating the impact outcome and critical for a better impact assessment. Analyzed together, there is little evidence of more pronounced for a specific sea zone, ecosystem, or ecosystem service. Climate change impacts may be underestimated due to the use of a single climate variable deployed in most studies. Policy interventions exhibit low classification accuracy in quantifying impacts indicating insufficient efficacy or integration in the studies.</p>

<p>Abstract: Massive MIMO is considered a key enabler to support massive machine-type communication (mMTC). While massive access schemes have been extensively analyzed for co-located massive MIMO arrays, this paper explores activity detection in grant-free random access for mMTC within the context of cell-free massive MIMO systems, employing distributed antenna arrays. This sparse support recovery of device activity status is performed by a finite cluster of access points (APs) from a large number of geographically distributed APs collaborating to serve a larger number of devices. Active devices transmit non-orthogonal pilot sequences to APs, which forward the received signals to a central processing unit (CPU) for collaborative activity detection. This paper proposes a simple and efficient data-driven algorithm tailored for device activity detection, implemented centrally at the CPU. Furthermore, the study assesses the algorithm's robustness to input perturbations and examines the effects of adopting fixed-point representation on its performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shin Yoo, Robert Feldt, Somin Kim, Naryeong Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: ML-based systems are software systems that incorporates machine learning components such as Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) or Large Language Models (LLMs). While such systems enable advanced features such as high performance computer vision, natural language processing, and code generation, their internal behaviour remain largely opaque to traditional dynamic analysis such as testing: existing analysis typically concern only what is observable from the outside, such as input similarity or class label changes. We propose semantic flow, a concept designed to capture the internal behaviour of ML-based system and to provide a platform for traditional dynamic analysis techniques to be adapted to. Semantic flow combines the idea of control flow with internal states taken from executions of ML-based systems, such as activation values of a specific layer in a DNN, or embeddings of LLM responses at a specific inference step of LLM agents. The resulting representation, summarised as semantic flow graphs, can capture internal decisions that are not explicitly represented in the traditional control flow of ML-based systems. We propose the idea of semantic flow, introduce two examples using a DNN and an LLM agent, and finally sketch its properties and how it can be used to adapt existing dynamic analysis techniques for use in ML-based software systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luyao Gao, Jianchun Liu, Hongli Xu, Liusheng Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Speculative inference is a promising paradigm employing small speculative models (SSMs) as drafters to generate draft tokens, which are subsequently verified in parallel by the target large language model (LLM). This approach enhances the efficiency of inference serving by reducing LLM inference latency and costs while preserving generation quality. However, existing speculative methods face critical challenges, including inefficient resource utilization and limited draft acceptance, which constrain their scalability and overall effectiveness. To overcome these obstacles, we present CoSine, a novel speculative inference system that decouples sequential speculative decoding from parallel verification, enabling efficient collaboration among multiple nodes. Specifically, CoSine routes inference requests to specialized drafters based on their expertise and incorporates a confidence-based token fusion mechanism to synthesize outputs from cooperating drafters, ensuring high-quality draft generation. Additionally, CoSine dynamically orchestrates the execution of speculative decoding and verification in a pipelined manner, employing batch scheduling to selectively group requests and adaptive speculation control to minimize idle periods. By optimizing parallel workflows through heterogeneous node collaboration, CoSine balances draft generation and verification throughput in real-time, thereby maximizing resource utilization. Experimental results demonstrate that CoSine achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art speculative approaches. Notably, with equivalent resource costs, CoSine achieves up to a 23.2% decrease in latency and a 32.5% increase in throughput compared to baseline methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion customization methods have achieved impressive results with only a minimal number of user-provided images. However, existing approaches customize concepts collectively, whereas real-world applications often require sequential concept integration. This sequential nature can lead to catastrophic forgetting, where previously learned concepts are lost. In this paper, we investigate concept forgetting and concept confusion in the continual customization. To tackle these challenges, we present ConceptGuard, a comprehensive approach that combines shift embedding, concept-binding prompts and memory preservation regularization, supplemented by a priority queue which can adaptively update the importance and occurrence order of different concepts. These strategies can dynamically update, unbind and learn the relationship of the previous concepts, thus alleviating concept forgetting and confusion. Through comprehensive experiments, we show that our approach outperforms all the baseline methods consistently and significantly in both quantitative and qualitative analyses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruggero G. Bettinardi, Mohamed Rahmouni, Ulysse Gimenez</p>
<p>Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) serves as an essential diagnostic tool in neurology; however, its accurate manual interpretation is a time-intensive process that demands highly specialized expertise, which remains relatively scarce and not consistently accessible. To address these limitations, the implementation of automated pre-screening and analysis systems for EEG data holds considerable promise. Advances in self-supervised learning made it possible to pre-train complex deep learning architectures on large volumes of unlabeled EEG data to learn generalizable representations, that can later be used to enhance performance on multiple tasks while needing less downstream data. In the present paper, we introduce BioSerenity-E1, the first of a family of self-supervised foundation models for clinical EEG applications that combines spectral tokenization with masked prediction to achieve state-of-the-art performance across relevant diagnostic tasks. The two-phase self-supervised pretraining framework initially acquires compressed EEG representations via a transformer-based VQ-VAE architecture designed to reconstruct log-multitaper spectral projections, then implements extensive (70% block) masked token prediction to force the model to learn complex spatiotemporal dependencies in EEG signals. BioSerenity-E1 achieves strong performance across three clinical tasks, either in line or above state-of-the-art methods: seizure detection (AUROC = 0.926, Sensitivity = 0.909), normal/abnormal classification (AUPRC = 0.970 on proprietary data; 0.910 on TUH-Abnormal), and multiclass pathology differentiation on unbalanced data (Weighted F1 = 0.730). The utility of BioSerenity-E1 is further confirmed in low-data regimes scenarios, showing clear improvements in AUPRC (from +2% to 17%) when trained on less than 10% of the available data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Iman Nematollahi, Branton DeMoss, Akshay L Chandra, Nick Hawes, Wolfram Burgard, Ingmar Posner</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce LUMOS, a language-conditioned multi-task imitation learning framework for robotics. LUMOS learns skills by practicing them over many long-horizon rollouts in the latent space of a learned world model and transfers these skills zero-shot to a real robot. By learning on-policy in the latent space of the learned world model, our algorithm mitigates policy-induced distribution shift which most offline imitation learning methods suffer from. LUMOS learns from unstructured play data with fewer than 1% hindsight language annotations but is steerable with language commands at test time. We achieve this coherent long-horizon performance by combining latent planning with both image- and language-based hindsight goal relabeling during training, and by optimizing an intrinsic reward defined in the latent space of the world model over multiple time steps, effectively reducing covariate shift. In experiments on the difficult long-horizon CALVIN benchmark, LUMOS outperforms prior learning-based methods with comparable approaches on chained multi-task evaluations. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to learn a language-conditioned continuous visuomotor control for a real-world robot within an offline world model.

<p>Abstract: Algorithmic detection of facial palsy offers the potential to improve current practices, which usually involve labor-intensive and subjective assessments by clinicians. In this paper, we present a multimodal fusion-based deep learning model that utilizes an MLP mixer-based model to process unstructured data (i.e. RGB images or images with facial line segments) and a feed-forward neural network to process structured data (i.e. facial landmark coordinates, features of facial expressions, or handcrafted features) for detecting facial palsy. We then contribute to a study to analyze the effect of different data modalities and the benefits of a multimodal fusion-based approach using videos of 20 facial palsy patients and 20 healthy subjects. Our multimodal fusion model achieved 96.00 F1, which is significantly higher than the feed-forward neural network trained on handcrafted features alone (82.80 F1) and an MLP mixer-based model trained on raw RGB images (89.00 F1).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bennet van den Broek, Javad Pourmostafa Roshan Sharami</p>
<p>Abstract: The improper disposal and mismanagement of medical waste pose severe environmental and public health risks, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and the spread of infectious diseases. Efficient and accurate medical waste classification is crucial for mitigating these risks. We explore the integration of capsule networks with a pretrained DenseNet model to improve medical waste classification. To the best of our knowledge, capsule networks have not yet been applied to this task, making this study the first to assess their effectiveness.
  A diverse dataset of medical waste images collected from multiple public sources, is used to evaluate three model configurations: (1) a pretrained DenseNet model as a baseline, (2) a pretrained DenseNet with frozen layers combined with a capsule network, and (3) a pretrained DenseNet with unfrozen layers combined with a capsule network. Experimental results demonstrate that incorporating capsule networks improves classification performance, with F1 scores increasing from 0.89 (baseline) to 0.92 (hybrid model with unfrozen layers). This highlights the potential of capsule networks to address the spatial limitations of traditional convolutional models and improve classification robustness.
  While the capsule-enhanced model demonstrated improved classification performance, direct comparisons with prior studies were challenging due to differences in dataset size and diversity. Previous studies relied on smaller, domain-specific datasets, which inherently yielded higher accuracy. In contrast, our study employs a significantly larger and more diverse dataset, leading to better generalization but introducing additional classification challenges. This highlights the trade-off between dataset complexity and model performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generating human-like and adaptive trajectories is essential for autonomous driving in dynamic environments. While generative models have shown promise in synthesizing feasible trajectories, they often fail to capture the nuanced variability of human driving styles due to dataset biases and distributional shifts. To address this, we introduce TrajHF, a human feedback-driven finetuning framework for generative trajectory models, designed to align motion planning with diverse driving preferences. TrajHF incorporates multi-conditional denoiser and reinforcement learning with human feedback to refine multi-modal trajectory generation beyond conventional imitation learning. This enables better alignment with human driving preferences while maintaining safety and feasibility constraints. TrajHF achieves PDMS of 93.95 on NavSim benchmark, significantly exceeding other methods. TrajHF sets a new paradigm for personalized and adaptable trajectory generation in autonomous driving.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gustav Schmidt, Holger Heidrich, Philipp Berens, Sarah M\"uller</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning from noisy ordinal labels is a key challenge in medical imaging. In this work, we ask whether ordinal disease progression labels (better, worse, or stable) can be used to learn a representation allowing to classify disease state. For neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD), we cast the problem of modeling disease progression between medical visits as a classification task with ordinal ranks. To enhance generalization, we tailor our model to the problem setting by (1) independent image encoding, (2) antisymmetric logit space equivariance, and (3) ordinal scale awareness. In addition, we address label noise by learning an uncertainty estimate for loss re-weighting. Our approach learns an interpretable disease representation enabling strong few-shot performance for the related task of nAMD activity classification from single images, despite being trained only on image pairs with ordinal disease progression labels.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents our work on the Light-R1 series, with models, data, and code all released.
  We first focus on training long COT models from scratch, specifically starting from models initially lacking long COT capabilities. Using a curriculum training recipe consisting of two-stage SFT and semi-on-policy DPO, we train our model Light-R1-32B from Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, resulting in superior math performance compared to DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B. Despite being trained exclusively on math data, Light-R1-32B shows strong generalization across other domains. In the subsequent phase of this work, we highlight the significant benefit of the 3k dataset constructed for the second SFT stage on enhancing other models. By fine-tuning DeepSeek-R1-Distilled models using this dataset, we obtain new SOTA models in 7B and 14B, while the 32B model, Light-R1-32B-DS performed comparably to QwQ-32B and DeepSeek-R1.
  Furthermore, we extend our work by applying reinforcement learning, specifically GRPO, on long-COT models to further improve reasoning performance. We successfully train our final Light-R1-14B-DS with RL, achieving SOTA performance among 14B parameter models in math. With AIME24 & 25 scores of 74.0 and 60.2 respectively, Light-R1-14B-DS surpasses even many 32B models and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B. Its RL training also exhibits well expected behavior, showing simultaneous increase in response length and reward score.
  The Light-R1 series of work validates training long-COT models from scratch, showcases the art in SFT data and releases SOTA models from RL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifeng Yang, Lin Zhu, Zewen Sun, Hengyu Liu, Qinying Gu, Nanyang Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection remains challenging for deep learning models, particularly when test-time OOD samples differ significantly from training outliers. We propose OODD, a novel test-time OOD detection method that dynamically maintains and updates an OOD dictionary without fine-tuning. Our approach leverages a priority queue-based dictionary that accumulates representative OOD features during testing, combined with an informative inlier sampling strategy for in-distribution (ID) samples. To ensure stable performance during early testing, we propose a dual OOD stabilization mechanism that leverages strategically generated outliers derived from ID data. To our best knowledge, extensive experiments on the OpenOOD benchmark demonstrate that OODD significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving a 26.0% improvement in FPR95 on CIFAR-100 Far OOD detection compared to the state-of-the-art approach. Furthermore, we present an optimized variant of the KNN-based OOD detection framework that achieves a 3x speedup while maintaining detection performance.</p>

Then, using an auxiliary system of algebraic equations, [Q_2, Q_3] = 0, and the numerical value of the Hamiltonian obtained via deep learning as a seed, we reconstruct the entire Hamiltonian family, forming an algebraic variety. We illustrate our presentation with three- and four-dimensional spin chains of difference form with local interactions. Remarkably, all discovered Hamiltonian families form rational varieties.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuqi Lu, Xiaohong Ji, Bohang Zhang, Lin Yao, Siyuan Liu, Zhifeng Gao, Linfeng Zhang, Guolin Ke</p>
<p>Abstract: Molecular pretrained representations (MPR) has emerged as a powerful approach for addressing the challenge of limited supervised data in applications such as drug discovery and material design. While early MPR methods relied on 1D sequences and 2D graphs, recent advancements have incorporated 3D conformational information to capture rich atomic interactions. However, these prior models treat molecules merely as discrete atom sets, overlooking the space surrounding them. We argue from a physical perspective that only modeling these discrete points is insufficient. We first present a simple yet insightful observation: naively adding randomly sampled virtual points beyond atoms can surprisingly enhance MPR performance. In light of this, we propose a principled framework that incorporates the entire 3D space spanned by molecules. We implement the framework via a novel Transformer-based architecture, dubbed SpaceFormer, with three key components: (1) grid-based space discretization; (2) grid sampling/merging; and (3) efficient 3D positional encoding. Extensive experiments show that SpaceFormer significantly outperforms previous 3D MPR models across various downstream tasks with limited data, validating the benefit of leveraging the additional 3D space beyond atoms in MPR models.</p>

<p>Abstract: While machine learning holds great promise for quantum technologies, most current methods focus on predicting or controlling a specific quantum system. Meta-learning approaches, however, can adapt to new systems for which little data is available, by leveraging knowledge obtained from previous data associated with similar systems. In this paper, we meta-learn dynamics and characteristics of closed and open two-level systems, as well as the Heisenberg model. Based on experimental data of a Loss-DiVincenzo spin-qubit hosted in a Ge/Si core/shell nanowire for different gate voltage configurations, we predict qubit characteristics i.e. $g$-factor and Rabi frequency using meta-learning. The algorithm we introduce improves upon previous state-of-the-art meta-learning methods for physics-based systems by introducing novel techniques such as adaptive learning rates and a global optimizer for improved robustness and increased computational efficiency. We benchmark our method against other meta-learning methods, a vanilla transformer, and a multilayer perceptron, and demonstrate improved performance.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10496">Explainable Bayesian deep learning through input-skip Latent Binary Bayesian Neural Networks</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Eirik H{\o}yheim, Lars Skaaret-Lund, Solve S{\ae}b{\o}, Aliaksandr Hubin</p>
<p>Abstract: Modeling natural phenomena with artificial neural networks (ANNs) often provides highly accurate predictions. However, ANNs often suffer from over-parameterization, complicating interpretation and raising uncertainty issues. Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) address the latter by representing weights as probability distributions, allowing for predictive uncertainty evaluation. Latent binary Bayesian neural networks (LBBNNs) further handle structural uncertainty and sparsify models by removing redundant weights. This article advances LBBNNs by enabling covariates to skip to any succeeding layer or be excluded, simplifying networks and clarifying input impacts on predictions. Ultimately, a linear model or even a constant can be found to be optimal for a specific problem at hand. Furthermore, the input-skip LBBNN approach reduces network density significantly compared to standard LBBNNs, achieving over 99% reduction for small networks and over 99.9% for larger ones, while still maintaining high predictive accuracy and uncertainty measurement. For example, on MNIST, we reached 97% accuracy and great calibration with just 935 weights, reaching state-of-the-art for compression of neural networks. Furthermore, the proposed method accurately identifies the true covariates and adjusts for system non-linearity. The main contribution is the introduction of active paths, enhancing directly designed global and local explanations within the LBBNN framework, that have theoretical guarantees and do not require post hoc external tools for explanations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rajiv Krishnakumar, Julien Baglio, Frederik F. Fl\"other, Christian Ruiz, Stefan Habringer, Nicole H. Romano</p>
<p>Abstract: Whole-slide image classification represents a key challenge in computational pathology and medicine. Attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) has emerged as an effective approach for this problem. However, the effect of attention mechanism architecture on model performance is not well-documented for biomedical imagery. In this work, we compare different methods and implementations of MIL, including deep learning variants. We introduce a new method using higher-dimensional feature spaces for deep MIL. We also develop a novel algorithm for whole-slide image classification where extreme machine learning is combined with attention-based MIL to improve sensitivity and reduce training complexity. We apply our algorithms to the problem of detecting circulating rare cells (CRCs), such as erythroblasts, in peripheral blood. Our results indicate that nonlinearities play a key role in the classification, as removing them leads to a sharp decrease in stability in addition to a decrease in average area under the curve (AUC) of over 4%. We also demonstrate a considerable increase in robustness of the model with improvements of over 10% in average AUC when higher-dimensional feature spaces are leveraged. In addition, we show that extreme learning machines can offer clear improvements in terms of training efficiency by reducing the number of trained parameters by a factor of 5 whilst still maintaining the average AUC to within 1.5% of the deep MIL model. Finally, we discuss options of enriching the classical computing framework with quantum algorithms in the future. This work can thus help pave the way towards more accurate and efficient single-cell diagnostics, one of the building blocks of precision medicine.</p>

<p>Abstract: Quality control of medical images is a critical component of digital pathology, ensuring that diagnostic images meet required standards. A pre-analytical task within this process is the verification of the number of specimen fragments, a process that ensures that the number of fragments on a slide matches the number documented in the macroscopic report. This step is important to ensure that the slides contain the appropriate diagnostic material from the grossing process, thereby guaranteeing the accuracy of subsequent microscopic examination and diagnosis. Traditionally, this assessment is performed manually, requiring significant time and effort while being subject to significant variability due to its subjective nature. To address these challenges, this study explores an automated approach to fragment counting using the YOLOv9 and Vision Transformer models. Our results demonstrate that the automated system achieves a level of performance comparable to expert assessments, offering a reliable and efficient alternative to manual counting. Additionally, we present findings on interobserver variability, showing that the automated approach achieves an accuracy of 86%, which falls within the range of variation observed among experts (82-88%), further supporting its potential for integration into routine pathology workflows.</p>

<p>Abstract: Audio and music generation have emerged as crucial tasks in many applications, yet existing approaches face significant limitations: they operate in isolation without unified capabilities across modalities, suffer from scarce high-quality, multi-modal training data, and struggle to effectively integrate diverse inputs. In this work, we propose AudioX, a unified Diffusion Transformer model for Anything-to-Audio and Music Generation. Unlike previous domain-specific models, AudioX can generate both general audio and music with high quality, while offering flexible natural language control and seamless processing of various modalities including text, video, image, music, and audio. Its key innovation is a multi-modal masked training strategy that masks inputs across modalities and forces the model to learn from masked inputs, yielding robust and unified cross-modal representations. To address data scarcity, we curate two comprehensive datasets: vggsound-caps with 190K audio captions based on the VGGSound dataset, and V2M-caps with 6 million music captions derived from the V2M dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AudioX not only matches or outperforms state-of-the-art specialized models, but also offers remarkable versatility in handling diverse input modalities and generation tasks within a unified architecture.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nina Vesseron, Louis B\'ethune, Marco Cuturi</p>
<p>Abstract: A common approach to generative modeling is to split model-fitting into two blocks: define first how to sample noise (e.g. Gaussian) and choose next what to do with it (e.g. using a single map or flows). We explore in this work an alternative route that ties sampling and mapping. We find inspiration in moment measures, a result that states that for any measure $\rho$ supported on a compact convex set of $\mathbb{R}^d$, there exists a unique convex potential $u$ such that $\rho=\nabla u\,\sharp\,e^{-u}$. While this does seem to tie effectively sampling (from log-concave distribution $e^{-u}$) and action (pushing particles through $\nabla u$), we observe on simple examples (e.g., Gaussians or 1D distributions) that this choice is ill-suited for practical tasks. We study an alternative factorization, where $\rho$ is factorized as $\nabla w^*\,\sharp\,e^{-w}$, where $w^*$ is the convex conjugate of $w$. We call this approach conjugate moment measures, and show far more intuitive results on these examples. Because $\nabla w^*$ is the Monge map between the log-concave distribution $e^{-w}$ and $\rho$, we rely on optimal transport solvers to propose an algorithm to recover $w$ from samples of $\rho$, and parameterize $w$ as an input-convex neural network.</p>

Our proof is simple and does not rely on any explicit geometric or chaining arguments. Instead, it follows from a simple application of the PAC-Bayesian lemma, a tool that has proven effective at controlling the suprema of certain ``smooth'' empirical processes in recent years. Our bound strictly improves a very recent result of Bandeira, Gopi, Jiang, Lucca, and Rothvoss. In the Euclidean case ($p=2$), our bound sharpens a result of Lata{\l}a that was central to proving his estimates on the moments of Gaussian chaoses.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mert Albaba, Chenhao Li, Markos Diomataris, Omid Taheri, Andreas Krause, Michael Black</p>
<p>Abstract: Acquiring physically plausible motor skills across diverse and unconventional morphologies-including humanoid robots, quadrupeds, and animals-is essential for advancing character simulation and robotics. Traditional methods, such as reinforcement learning (RL) are task- and body-specific, require extensive reward function engineering, and do not generalize well. Imitation learning offers an alternative but relies heavily on high-quality expert demonstrations, which are difficult to obtain for non-human morphologies. Video diffusion models, on the other hand, are capable of generating realistic videos of various morphologies, from humans to ants. Leveraging this capability, we propose a data-independent approach for skill acquisition that learns 3D motor skills from 2D-generated videos, with generalization capability to unconventional and non-human forms. Specifically, we guide the imitation learning process by leveraging vision transformers for video-based comparisons by calculating pair-wise distance between video embeddings. Along with video-encoding distance, we also use a computed similarity between segmented video frames as a guidance reward. We validate our method on locomotion tasks involving unique body configurations. In humanoid robot locomotion tasks, we demonstrate that 'No-data Imitation Learning' (NIL) outperforms baselines trained on 3D motion-capture data. Our results highlight the potential of leveraging generative video models for physically plausible skill learning with diverse morphologies, effectively replacing data collection with data generation for imitation learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianjiao Yu, Vedant Shah, Muntasir Wahed, Kiet A. Nguyen, Adheesh Juvekar, Tal August, Ismini Lourentzou</p>
<p>Abstract: Expressing confidence is challenging for embodied agents navigating dynamic multimodal environments, where uncertainty arises from both perception and decision-making processes. We present the first work investigating embodied confidence elicitation in open-ended multimodal environments. We introduce Elicitation Policies, which structure confidence assessment across inductive, deductive, and abductive reasoning, along with Execution Policies, which enhance confidence calibration through scenario reinterpretation, action sampling, and hypothetical reasoning. Evaluating agents in calibration and failure prediction tasks within the Minecraft environment, we show that structured reasoning approaches, such as Chain-of-Thoughts, improve confidence calibration. However, our findings also reveal persistent challenges in distinguishing uncertainty, particularly under abductive settings, underscoring the need for more sophisticated embodied confidence elicitation methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaoyi Li, Xiaohan Zhao, Dong-Dong Wu, Jiacheng Cui, Zhiqiang Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite promising performance on open-source large vision-language models (LVLMs), transfer-based targeted attacks often fail against black-box commercial LVLMs. Analyzing failed adversarial perturbations reveals that the learned perturbations typically originate from a uniform distribution and lack clear semantic details, resulting in unintended responses. This critical absence of semantic information leads commercial LVLMs to either ignore the perturbation entirely or misinterpret its embedded semantics, thereby causing the attack to fail. To overcome these issues, we notice that identifying core semantic objects is a key objective for models trained with various datasets and methodologies. This insight motivates our approach that refines semantic clarity by encoding explicit semantic details within local regions, thus ensuring interoperability and capturing finer-grained features, and by concentrating modifications on semantically rich areas rather than applying them uniformly. To achieve this, we propose a simple yet highly effective solution: at each optimization step, the adversarial image is cropped randomly by a controlled aspect ratio and scale, resized, and then aligned with the target image in the embedding space. Experimental results confirm our hypothesis. Our adversarial examples crafted with local-aggregated perturbations focused on crucial regions exhibit surprisingly good transferability to commercial LVLMs, including GPT-4.5, GPT-4o, Gemini-2.0-flash, Claude-3.5-sonnet, Claude-3.7-sonnet, and even reasoning models like o1, Claude-3.7-thinking and Gemini-2.0-flash-thinking. Our approach achieves success rates exceeding 90% on GPT-4.5, 4o, and o1, significantly outperforming all prior state-of-the-art attack methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoming Zhao, Alexander G. Schwing</p>
<p>Abstract: Classifier-free guidance has become a staple for conditional generation with denoising diffusion models. However, a comprehensive understanding of classifier-free guidance is still missing. In this work, we carry out an empirical study to provide a fresh perspective on classifier-free guidance. Concretely, instead of solely focusing on classifier-free guidance, we trace back to the root, i.e., classifier guidance, pinpoint the key assumption for the derivation, and conduct a systematic study to understand the role of the classifier. We find that both classifier guidance and classifier-free guidance achieve conditional generation by pushing the denoising diffusion trajectories away from decision boundaries, i.e., areas where conditional information is usually entangled and is hard to learn. Based on this classifier-centric understanding, we propose a generic postprocessing step built upon flow-matching to shrink the gap between the learned distribution for a pre-trained denoising diffusion model and the real data distribution, majorly around the decision boundaries. Experiments on various datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yujie Yang, Zhilong Zheng, Shengbo Eben Li, Wei Xu, Jingjing Liu, Xianyuan Zhan, Ya-Qin Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Safety is the priority concern when applying reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to real-world control problems. While policy iteration provides a fundamental algorithm for standard RL, an analogous theoretical algorithm for safe RL remains absent. In this paper, we propose feasible policy iteration (FPI), the first foundational dynamic programming algorithm for safe RL. FPI alternates between policy evaluation, region identification and policy improvement. This follows actor-critic-scenery (ACS) framework where scenery refers to a feasibility function that represents a feasible region. A region-wise update rule is developed for the policy improvement step, which maximizes state-value function inside the feasible region and minimizes feasibility function outside it. With this update rule, FPI guarantees monotonic expansion of feasible region, monotonic improvement of state-value function, and geometric convergence to the optimal safe policy. Experimental results demonstrate that FPI achieves strictly zero constraint violation on low-dimensional tasks and outperforms existing methods in constraint adherence and reward performance on high-dimensional tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have excelled in various graph learning tasks, particularly node classification. However, their performance is often hampered by noisy measurements in real-world graphs, which can corrupt critical patterns in the data. To address this, we propose a novel uncertainty-aware graph learning framework inspired by distributionally robust optimization. Specifically, we use a graph neural network-based encoder to embed the node features and find the optimal node embeddings by minimizing the worst-case risk through a minimax formulation. Such an uncertainty-aware learning process leads to improved node representations and a more robust graph predictive model that effectively mitigates the impact of uncertainty arising from data noise. Our experimental results demonstrate superior predictive performance over baselines across noisy scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuyuan Li, Jiaming Zhang, Yixiu Liu, Chaochao Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Privacy concerns associated with machine learning models have driven research into machine unlearning, which aims to erase the memory of specific target training data from already trained models. This issue also arises in federated learning, creating the need to address the federated unlearning problem. However, federated unlearning remains a challenging task. On the one hand, current research primarily focuses on unlearning all data from a client, overlooking more fine-grained unlearning targets, e.g., class-wise and sample-wise removal. On the other hand, existing methods suffer from imprecise estimation of data influence and impose significant computational or storage burden. To address these issues, we propose a neuro-inspired federated unlearning framework based on active forgetting, which is independent of model architectures and suitable for fine-grained unlearning targets. Our framework distinguishes itself from existing methods by utilizing new memories to overwrite old ones. These new memories are generated through teacher-student learning. We further utilize refined elastic weight consolidation to mitigate catastrophic forgetting of non-target data. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our method, achieving satisfactory unlearning completeness against backdoor attacks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased impressive capabilities in handling straightforward programming tasks. However, their performance tends to falter when confronted with more challenging programming problems. We observe that conventional models often generate solutions as monolithic code blocks, restricting their effectiveness in tackling intricate questions. To overcome this limitation, we present Modular-of-Thought Coder (MoTCoder). We introduce a pioneering framework for MoT instruction tuning, designed to promote the decomposition of tasks into logical sub-tasks and sub-modules. Our investigations reveal that, through the cultivation and utilization of sub-modules, MoTCoder significantly improves both the modularity and correctness of the generated solutions, leading to substantial relative pass@1 improvements of 12.9% on APPS and 9.43% on CodeContests.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leyang Xue, Yao Fu, Zhan Lu, Luo Mai, Mahesh Marina</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents MoE-Infinity, an efficient MoE inference system designed for personal machines with limited GPU memory capacity. The key idea for MoE-Infinity is that on personal machines, which are often single-user environments, MoE-based LLMs typically operate with a batch size of one. In this setting, MoE models exhibit a high degree of activation sparsity, meaning a small number of experts are frequently reused in generating tokens during the decode phase. Leveraging this idea, we design a sparsity-aware expert cache, which can trace the sparse activation of experts during inference and carefully select the trace that represents the sparsity pattern. By analyzing these selected traces, MoE-Infinity guides the replacement and prefetching of the expert cache, providing 3.1-16.7x per-token latency improvements over numerous state-of-the-art systems, including vLLM, Ollama, DeepSpeed and BrainStorm across various MoE models (DeepSeek and Mixtral) when handling different LLM tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weibin Liao, Yinghao Zhu, Zhongji Zhang, Yuhang Wang, Zixiang Wang, Xu Chu, Yasha Wang, Liantao Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Analyzing the health status of patients based on Electronic Health Records (EHR) is a fundamental research problem in medical informatics. The presence of extensive missing values in EHR makes it challenging for deep neural networks (DNNs) to directly model the patient's health status. Existing DNNs training protocols, including Impute-then-Regress Procedure and Jointly Optimizing of Impute-n-Regress Procedure, require the additional imputation models to reconstruction missing values. However, Impute-then-Regress Procedure introduces the risk of injecting imputed, non-real data into downstream clinical prediction tasks, resulting in power loss, biased estimation, and poorly performing models, while Jointly Optimizing of Impute-n-Regress Procedure is also difficult to generalize due to the complex optimization space and demanding data requirements. Inspired by the recent advanced literature of learnable prompt in the fields of NLP and CV, in this work, we rethought the necessity of the imputation model in downstream clinical tasks, and proposed Learnable Prompt as Pseudo-Imputation (PAI) as a new training protocol to assist EHR analysis. PAI no longer introduces any imputed data but constructs a learnable prompt to model the implicit preferences of the downstream model for missing values, resulting in a significant performance improvement for all state-of-the-arts EHR analysis models on four real-world datasets across two clinical prediction tasks. Further experimental analysis indicates that PAI exhibits higher robustness in situations of data insufficiency and high missing rates. More importantly, as a plug-and-play protocol, PAI can be easily integrated into any existing or even imperceptible future EHR analysis models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cassidy Laidlaw, Shivam Singhal, Anca Dragan</p>
<p>Abstract: Because it is difficult to precisely specify complex objectives, reinforcement learning policies are often optimized using proxy reward functions that only approximate the true goal. However, optimizing proxy rewards frequently leads to reward hacking: the optimized reward function ceases to be a good proxy and the resulting policy performs poorly with respect to the unspecified true reward. Principled solutions to reward hacking have been impeded by the lack of a good definition for the problem. To address this gap, we introduce a definition of reward hacking based on the correlation between proxy and true rewards for states and actions seen by a "reference policy" that breaks down under optimization. We show that this definition captures reward hacking behavior across several realistic settings, including in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Using our formulation, we show theoretically that regularization to the reference policy can effectively prevent reward hacking. While the current practice in RLHF applies a KL penalty between action distributions for this purpose, our theory suggests regularizing the $\chi^2$ divergence between the policies' occupancy measures can be more effective. We intuitively show the benefits of this type of regularization and demonstrate that it better mitigates reward hacking in practice across four realistic settings, including RLHF.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zuguang Li, Wen Wu, Shaohua Wu, Wei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Split learning (SL) is a promising approach for training artificial intelligence (AI) models, in which devices collaborate with a server to train an AI model in a distributed manner, based on a same fixed split point. However, due to the device heterogeneity and variation of channel conditions, this way is not optimal in training delay and energy consumption. In this paper, we design an adaptive split learning (ASL) scheme which can dynamically select split points for devices and allocate computing resource for the server in wireless edge networks. We formulate an optimization problem to minimize the average training latency subject to long-term energy consumption constraint. The difficulties in solving this problem are the lack of future information and mixed integer programming (MIP). To solve it, we propose an online algorithm leveraging the Lyapunov theory, named OPEN, which decomposes it into a new MIP problem only with the current information. Then, a two-layer optimization method is proposed to solve the MIP problem. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the ASL scheme can reduce the average training delay and energy consumption by 53.7% and 22.1%, respectively, as compared to the existing SL schemes.</p>

They are also increasingly leveraged in scientific machine learning, where samples from the implied data distribution are expected to adhere to specific governing equations. We present a framework that unifies generative modeling and partial differential equation fulfillment by introducing a first-principle-based loss term that enforces generated samples to fulfill the underlying physical constraints. Our approach reduces the residual error by up to two orders of magnitude compared to previous work in a fluid flow case study and outperforms task-specific frameworks in relevant metrics for structural topology optimization. We also present numerical evidence that our extended training objective acts as a natural regularization mechanism against overfitting. Our framework is simple to implement and versatile in its applicability for imposing equality and inequality constraints as well as auxiliary optimization objectives.</p>

<p>Abstract: As distributed learning applications such as Federated Learning, the Internet of Things (IoT), and Edge Computing grow, it is critical to address the shortcomings of such technologies from a theoretical perspective. As an abstraction, we consider decentralized learning over a network of communicating clients or nodes and tackle two major challenges: data heterogeneity and adversarial robustness. We propose a decentralized minimax optimization method that employs two important modules: local updates and gradient tracking. Minimax optimization is the key tool to enable adversarial training for ensuring robustness. Having local updates is essential in Federated Learning (FL) applications to mitigate the communication bottleneck, and utilizing gradient tracking is essential to proving convergence in the case of data heterogeneity. We analyze the performance of the proposed algorithm, Dec-FedTrack, in the case of nonconvex-strongly concave minimax optimization, and prove that it converges a stationary point. We also conduct numerical experiments to support our theoretical findings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joseph Janssen, Ardalan Tootchi, Ali A. Ameli</p>
<p>Abstract: Spatial patterns of water table depth (WTD) play a crucial role in shaping ecological resilience, hydrological connectivity, and human-centric systems. Generally, a large-scale (e.g., continental or global) continuous map of static WTD can be simulated using either physically-based (PB) or machine learning-based (ML) models. We construct three fine-resolution (500 m) ML simulations of WTD, using the XGBoost algorithm and more than 20 million real and proxy observations of WTD, across the United States and Canada. The three ML models were constrained using known physical relations between WTD's drivers and WTD and were trained by sequentially adding real and proxy observations of WTD. Through an extensive (pixel-by-pixel) evaluation across the study region and within ten major ecoregions of North America, we demonstrate that our models (corr=0.6-0.75) can more accurately predict unseen real and proxy observations of WTD compared to two available PB simulations of WTD (corr=0.21-0.40). However, we still argue that currently-available large-scale simulations of static WTD could be uncertain within data-scarce regions such as steep mountainous regions. We reason that biased observational data mainly collected from low-elevation floodplains and the over-flexibility of available models can negatively affect the verifiability of large-scale simulations of WTD. Ultimately, we thoroughly discuss future directions that may help hydrogeologists decide how to improve machine learning-based WTD estimations. In particular, we advocate for the use of proxy satellite data, the incorporation of physical laws, the implementation of better model verification standards, the development of novel globally-available emergent indices, and the collection of more reliable observations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Methods with adaptive stepsizes, such as AdaGrad and Adam, are essential for training modern Deep Learning models, especially Large Language Models. Typically, the noise in the stochastic gradients is heavy-tailed for the later ones. Gradient clipping provably helps to achieve good high-probability convergence for such noises. However, despite the similarity between AdaGrad/Adam and Clip-SGD, the current understanding of the high-probability convergence of AdaGrad/Adam-type methods is limited in this case. In this work, we prove that AdaGrad/Adam (and their delayed version) can have provably bad high-probability convergence if the noise is heavy-tailed. We also show that gradient clipping fixes this issue, i.e., we derive new high-probability convergence bounds with polylogarithmic dependence on the confidence level for AdaGrad-Norm and Adam-Norm with clipping and with/without delay for smooth convex/non-convex stochastic optimization with heavy-tailed noise. Our empirical evaluations highlight the superiority of clipped versions of AdaGrad/Adam-Norm in handling the heavy-tailed noise.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Viet-Hoang Tran, Thieu N. Vo, Tho H. Tran, An T. Nguyen, Tan M. Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural functional networks (NFNs) have recently gained significant attention due to their diverse applications, ranging from predicting network generalization and network editing to classifying implicit neural representation. Previous NFN designs often depend on permutation symmetries in neural networks' weights, which traditionally arise from the unordered arrangement of neurons in hidden layers. However, these designs do not take into account the weight scaling symmetries of $\ReLU$ networks, and the weight sign flipping symmetries of $\sin$ or $\Tanh$ networks. In this paper, we extend the study of the group action on the network weights from the group of permutation matrices to the group of monomial matrices by incorporating scaling/sign-flipping symmetries. Particularly, we encode these scaling/sign-flipping symmetries by designing our corresponding equivariant and invariant layers. We name our new family of NFNs the Monomial Matrix Group Equivariant Neural Functional Networks (Monomial-NFN). Because of the expansion of the symmetries, Monomial-NFN has much fewer independent trainable parameters compared to the baseline NFNs in the literature, thus enhancing the model's efficiency. Moreover, for fully connected and convolutional neural networks, we theoretically prove that all groups that leave these networks invariant while acting on their weight spaces are some subgroups of the monomial matrix group. We provide empirical evidence to demonstrate the advantages of our model over existing baselines, achieving competitive performance and efficiency.</p>

We assume the bandit tasks are adjacently similar in the sense that the difference between the mean rewards of the arms for any two consecutive tasks is bounded by a parameter. We propose two algorithms (one assumes the parameter is known while the other does not) based on UCB to transfer reward samples from preceding tasks to improve the overall regret across all tasks. Our analysis shows that transferring samples reduces the regret as compared to the case of no transfer. We provide empirical results for our algorithms, which show performance improvement over the standard UCB algorithm without transfer and a naive transfer algorithm.</p>

<p>Abstract: Knowledge tracing (KT) is a popular approach for modeling students' learning progress over time, which can enable more personalized and adaptive learning. However, existing KT approaches face two major limitations: (1) they rely heavily on expert-defined knowledge concepts (KCs) in questions, which is time-consuming and prone to errors; and (2) KT methods tend to overlook the semantics of both questions and the given KCs. In this work, we address these challenges and present KCQRL, a framework for automated knowledge concept annotation and question representation learning that can improve the effectiveness of any existing KT model. First, we propose an automated KC annotation process using large language models (LLMs), which generates question solutions and then annotates KCs in each solution step of the questions. Second, we introduce a contrastive learning approach to generate semantically rich embeddings for questions and solution steps, aligning them with their associated KCs via a tailored false negative elimination approach. These embeddings can be readily integrated into existing KT models, replacing their randomly initialized embeddings. We demonstrate the effectiveness of KCQRL across 15 KT algorithms on two large real-world Math learning datasets, where we achieve consistent performance improvements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Viet-Hoang Tran, Thieu N. Vo, Tho Tran Huu, Tan Minh Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: Designing neural network architectures that can handle data symmetry is crucial. This is especially important for geometric graphs whose properties are equivariance under Euclidean transformations. Current equivariant graph neural networks (EGNNs), particularly those using message passing, have a limitation in expressive power. Recent high-order graph neural networks can overcome this limitation, yet they lack equivariance properties, representing a notable drawback in certain applications in chemistry and physical sciences. In this paper, we introduce the Clifford Group Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (CG-EGNNs), a novel EGNN that enhances high-order message passing by integrating high-order local structures in the context of Clifford algebras. As a key benefit of using Clifford algebras, CG-EGNN can learn functions that capture equivariance from positional features. By adopting the high-order message passing mechanism, CG-EGNN gains richer information from neighbors, thus improving model performance. Furthermore, we establish the universality property of the $k$-hop message passing framework, showcasing greater expressive power of CG-EGNNs with additional $k$-hop message passing mechanism. We empirically validate that CG-EGNNs outperform previous methods on various benchmarks including n-body, CMU motion capture, and MD17, highlighting their effectiveness in geometric deep learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> {\L}ukasz Staniszewski, Katarzyna Zaleska, Kamil Deja</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent personalization methods for diffusion models, such as Dreambooth and LoRA, allow fine-tuning pre-trained models to generate new concepts. However, applying these techniques across consecutive tasks in order to include, e.g., new objects or styles, leads to a forgetting of previous knowledge due to mutual interference between their adapters. In this work, we tackle the problem of continual customization under a rigorous regime with no access to past tasks' adapters. In such a scenario, we investigate how different adapters' initialization and merging methods can improve the quality of the final model. To that end, we evaluate the naive continual fine-tuning of customized models and compare this approach with three methods for consecutive adapters' training: sequentially merging new adapters, merging orthogonally initialized adapters, and updating only relevant task-specific weights. In our experiments, we show that the proposed techniques mitigate forgetting when compared to the naive approach. In our studies, we show different traits of selected techniques and their effect on the plasticity and stability of the continually adapted model.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ayano Hiranaka, Shang-Fu Chen, Chieh-Hsin Lai, Dongjun Kim, Naoki Murata, Takashi Shibuya, Wei-Hsiang Liao, Shao-Hua Sun, Yuki Mitsufuji</p>
<p>Abstract: Controllable generation through Stable Diffusion (SD) fine-tuning aims to improve fidelity, safety, and alignment with human guidance. Existing reinforcement learning from human feedback methods usually rely on predefined heuristic reward functions or pretrained reward models built on large-scale datasets, limiting their applicability to scenarios where collecting such data is costly or difficult. To effectively and efficiently utilize human feedback, we develop a framework, HERO, which leverages online human feedback collected on the fly during model learning. Specifically, HERO features two key mechanisms: (1) Feedback-Aligned Representation Learning, an online training method that captures human feedback and provides informative learning signals for fine-tuning, and (2) Feedback-Guided Image Generation, which involves generating images from SD's refined initialization samples, enabling faster convergence towards the evaluator's intent. We demonstrate that HERO is 4x more efficient in online feedback for body part anomaly correction compared to the best existing method. Additionally, experiments show that HERO can effectively handle tasks like reasoning, counting, personalization, and reducing NSFW content with only 0.5K online feedback.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiashun Liu, Johan Obando-Ceron, Aaron Courville, Ling Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: The loss of plasticity in learning agents, analogous to the solidification of neural pathways in biological brains, significantly impedes learning and adaptation in reinforcement learning due to its non-stationary nature. To address this fundamental challenge, we propose a novel approach, {\it Neuroplastic Expansion} (NE), inspired by cortical expansion in cognitive science. NE maintains learnability and adaptability throughout the entire training process by dynamically growing the network from a smaller initial size to its full dimension. Our method is designed with three key components: (\textit{1}) elastic topology generation based on potential gradients, (\textit{2}) dormant neuron pruning to optimize network expressivity, and (\textit{3}) neuron consolidation via experience review to strike a balance in the plasticity-stability dilemma. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NE effectively mitigates plasticity loss and outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various tasks in MuJoCo and DeepMind Control Suite environments. NE enables more adaptive learning in complex, dynamic environments, which represents a crucial step towards transitioning deep reinforcement learning from static, one-time training paradigms to more flexible, continually adapting models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongyi Yang, Core Francisco Park, Ekdeep Singh Lubana, Maya Okawa, Wei Hu, Hidenori Tanaka</p>
<p>Abstract: Prior work has shown that text-conditioned diffusion models can learn to identify and manipulate primitive concepts underlying a compositional data-generating process, enabling generalization to entirely novel, out-of-distribution compositions. Beyond performance evaluations, these studies develop a rich empirical phenomenology of learning dynamics, showing that models generalize sequentially, respecting the compositional hierarchy of the data-generating process. Moreover, concept-centric structures within the data significantly influence a model's speed of learning the ability to manipulate a concept. In this paper, we aim to better characterize these empirical results from a theoretical standpoint. Specifically, we propose an abstraction of prior work's compositional generalization problem by introducing a structured identity mapping (SIM) task, where a model is trained to learn the identity mapping on a Gaussian mixture with structurally organized centroids. We mathematically analyze the learning dynamics of neural networks trained on this SIM task and show that, despite its simplicity, SIM's learning dynamics capture and help explain key empirical observations on compositional generalization with diffusion models identified in prior work. Our theory also offers several new insights -- e.g., we find a novel mechanism for non-monotonic learning dynamics of test loss in early phases of training. We validate our new predictions by training a text-conditioned diffusion model, bridging our simplified framework and complex generative models. Overall, this work establishes the SIM task as a meaningful theoretical abstraction of concept learning dynamics in modern generative models.</p>

<p>Abstract: The Kalman filter (KF) and its variants are among the most celebrated algorithms in signal processing. These methods are used for state estimation of dynamic systems by relying on mathematical representations in the form of simple state-space (SS) models, which may be crude and inaccurate descriptions of the underlying dynamics. Emerging data-centric artificial intelligence (AI) techniques tackle these tasks using deep neural networks (DNNs), which are model-agnostic. Recent developments illustrate the possibility of fusing DNNs with classic Kalman-type filtering, obtaining systems that learn to track in partially known dynamics. This article provides a tutorial-style overview of design approaches for incorporating AI in aiding KF-type algorithms. We review both generic and dedicated DNN architectures suitable for state estimation, and provide a systematic presentation of techniques for fusing AI tools with KFs and for leveraging partial SS modeling and data, categorizing design approaches into task-oriented and SS model-oriented. The usefulness of each approach in preserving the individual strengths of model-based KFs and data-driven DNNs is investigated in a qualitative and quantitative study, whose code is publicly available, illustrating the gains of hybrid model-based/data-driven designs. We also discuss existing challenges and future research directions that arise from fusing AI and Kalman-type algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daiqi Gao, Hsin-Yu Lai, Predrag Klasnja, Susan A. Murphy</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider reinforcement learning (RL) for a class of problems with bagged decision times. A bag contains a finite sequence of consecutive decision times. The transition dynamics are non-Markovian and non-stationary within a bag. All actions within a bag jointly impact a single reward, observed at the end of the bag. For example, in mobile health, multiple activity suggestions in a day collectively affect a user's daily commitment to being active. Our goal is to develop an online RL algorithm to maximize the discounted sum of the bag-specific rewards. To handle non-Markovian transitions within a bag, we utilize an expert-provided causal directed acyclic graph (DAG). Based on the DAG, we construct states as a dynamical Bayesian sufficient statistic of the observed history, which results in Markov state transitions within and across bags. We then formulate this problem as a periodic Markov decision process (MDP) that allows non-stationarity within a period. An online RL algorithm based on Bellman equations for stationary MDPs is generalized to handle periodic MDPs. We show that our constructed state achieves the maximal optimal value function among all state constructions for a periodic MDP. Finally, we evaluate the proposed method on testbed variants built from real data in a mobile health clinical trial.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marlon Tobaben, Talal Alrawajfeh, Marcus Klasson, Mikko Heikkil\"a, Arno Solin, Antti Honkela</p>
<p>Abstract: The goal of continual learning (CL) is to retain knowledge across tasks, but this conflicts with strict privacy required for sensitive training data that prevents storing or memorising individual samples. This work explores the intersection of CL and differential privacy (DP). We advance the theoretical understanding and introduce methods for combining CL and DP. We formulate and clarify the theory for DP CL focusing on composition over tasks. We introduce different variants of choosing classifiers' output label space, show that choosing the output label space directly based on the task data is not DP, and offer a DP alternative. We propose a method for combining pre-trained models with DP prototype classifiers and parameter-efficient adapters learned under DP to address the trade-offs between privacy and utility in a CL setting. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods for varying degrees of domain shift, for blurry tasks, and with different output label settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanyang Wang, Juergen Branke, Matthias Poloczek</p>
<p>Abstract: In many real-world optimization problems, we have prior information about what objective function values are achievable. In this paper, we study the scenario that we have either exact knowledge of the minimum value or a, possibly inexact, lower bound on its value. We propose bound-aware Bayesian optimization (BABO), a Bayesian optimization method that uses a new surrogate model and acquisition function to utilize such prior information. We present SlogGP, a new surrogate model that incorporates bound information and adapts the Expected Improvement (EI) acquisition function accordingly. Empirical results on a variety of benchmarks demonstrate the benefit of taking prior information about the optimal value into account, and that the proposed approach significantly outperforms existing techniques. Furthermore, we notice that even in the absence of prior information on the bound, the proposed SlogGP surrogate model still performs better than the standard GP model in most cases, which we explain by its larger expressiveness.</p>

<p>Abstract: Prevalent in biomedical applications (e.g., human phenotype research), multimodal datasets can provide valuable insights into the underlying physiological mechanisms. However, current machine learning (ML) models designed to analyze these datasets often lack interpretability and identifiability guarantees, which are essential for biomedical research. Recent advances in causal representation learning have shown promise in identifying interpretable latent causal variables with formal theoretical guarantees. Unfortunately, most current work on multimodal distributions either relies on restrictive parametric assumptions or yields only coarse identification results, limiting their applicability to biomedical research that favors a detailed understanding of the mechanisms.
  In this work, we aim to develop flexible identification conditions for multimodal data and principled methods to facilitate the understanding of biomedical datasets. Theoretically, we consider a nonparametric latent distribution (c.f., parametric assumptions in previous work) that allows for causal relationships across potentially different modalities. We establish identifiability guarantees for each latent component, extending the subspace identification results from previous work. Our key theoretical contribution is the structural sparsity of causal connections between modalities, which, as we will discuss, is natural for a large collection of biomedical systems. Empirically, we present a practical framework to instantiate our theoretical insights. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on both numerical and synthetic datasets. Results on a real-world human phenotype dataset are consistent with established biomedical research, validating our theoretical and methodological framework.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06635">scMEDAL for the interpretable analysis of single-cell transcriptomics data with batch effect visualization using a deep mixed effects autoencoder</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Aixa X. Andrade, Son Nguyen, Albert Montillo</p>
<p>Abstract: scRNA-seq data has the potential to provide new insights into cellular heterogeneity and data acquisition; however, a major challenge is unraveling confounding from technical and biological batch effects. Existing batch correction algorithms suppress and discard these effects, rather than quantifying and modeling them. Here, we present scMEDAL, a framework for single-cell Mixed Effects Deep Autoencoder Learning, which separately models batch-invariant and batch-specific effects using two complementary autoencoder networks. One network is trained through adversarial learning to capture a batch-invariant representation, while a Bayesian autoencoder learns a batch-specific representation. Comprehensive evaluations spanning conditions (e.g., autism, leukemia, and cardiovascular), cell types, and technical and biological effects demonstrate that scMEDAL suppresses batch effects while modeling batch-specific variation, enhancing accuracy and interpretability. Unlike prior approaches, the framework's fixed- and random-effects autoencoders enable retrospective analyses, including predicting a cell's expression as if it had been acquired in a different batch via genomap projections at the cellular level, revealing the impact of biological (e.g., diagnosis) and technical (e.g., acquisition) effects. By combining scMEDAL's batch-agnostic and batch-specific latent spaces, it enables more accurate predictions of disease status, donor group, and cell type, making scMEDAL a valuable framework for gaining deeper insight into data acquisition and cellular heterogeneity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nabeel Seedat, Caterina Tozzi, Andrea Hita Ardiaca, Mihaela van der Schaar, James Weatherall, Adam Taylor</p>
<p>Abstract: The reuse of historical clinical trial data has significant potential to accelerate medical research and drug development. However, interoperability challenges, particularly with missing medical codes, hinders effective data integration across studies. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising solution for automated coding without labeled data, current approaches face challenges on complex coding tasks. We introduce ALIGN, a novel compositional LLM-based system for automated, zero-shot medical coding. ALIGN follows a three-step process: (1) diverse candidate code generation; (2) self-evaluation of codes and (3) confidence scoring and uncertainty estimation enabling human deferral to ensure reliability. We evaluate ALIGN on harmonizing medication terms into Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) and medical history terms into Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) codes extracted from 22 immunology trials. ALIGN outperformed the LLM baselines, while also providing capabilities for trustworthy deployment. For MedDRA coding, ALIGN achieved high accuracy across all levels, matching RAG and excelling at the most specific levels (87-90% for HLGT). For ATC coding, ALIGN demonstrated superior performance, particularly at lower hierarchy levels (ATC Level 4), with 72-73% overall accuracy and 86-89% accuracy for common medications, outperforming baselines by 7-22%. ALIGN's uncertainty-based deferral improved accuracy by 17% to 90% accuracy with 30% deferral, notably enhancing performance on uncommon medications. ALIGN achieves this cost-efficiently at \$0.0007 and \$0.02 per code for GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4o, reducing barriers to clinical adoption. ALIGN advances automated medical coding for clinical trial data, contributing to enhanced data interoperability and reusability, positioning it as a promising tool to improve clinical research and accelerate drug development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jieming Bian, Lei Wang, Letian Zhang, Jie Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) achieve strong performance across diverse tasks with task-specific fine-tuning, yet full parameter fine-tuning is often computationally prohibitive for large models. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) reduce this cost by introducing low-rank matrices for tuning fewer parameters. While LoRA allows for efficient fine-tuning, it requires significant data for adaptation, making Federated Learning (FL) an appealing solution due to its privacy-preserving collaborative framework. However, combining LoRA with FL introduces two key challenges: the \textbf{Server-Side Aggregation Bias}, where server-side averaging of LoRA matrices diverges from the ideal global update, and the \textbf{Client-Side Initialization Lag}, emphasizing the need for consistent initialization across rounds. Existing approaches address these challenges individually, limiting their effectiveness. We propose LoRA-FAIR, a novel method that tackles both issues by introducing a correction term on the server, enhancing aggregation efficiency and accuracy. LoRA-FAIR maintains computational and communication efficiency, yielding superior performance over state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results on ViT and MLP-Mixer models across large-scale datasets demonstrate that LoRA-FAIR consistently achieves performance improvements in FL settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaosi Gu, Tomoyuki Obuchi</p>
<p>Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) is a machine learning methodology that leverages unlabeled data in conjunction with a limited amount of labeled data. Although SSL has been applied in various applications and its effectiveness has been empirically demonstrated, it is still not fully understood when and why SSL performs well. Some existing theoretical studies have attempted to address this issue by modeling classification problems using the so-called Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). These studies provide notable and insightful interpretations. However, their analyses are focused on specific purposes, and a thorough investigation of the properties of GMM in the context of SSL has been lacking. In this paper, we conduct such a detailed analysis of the properties of the high-dimensional GMM for binary classification in the SSL setting. To this end, we employ the approximate message passing and state evolution methods, which are widely used in high-dimensional settings and originate from statistical mechanics. We deal with two estimation approaches: the Bayesian one and the $\ell_2$-regularized maximum likelihood estimation (RMLE). We conduct a comprehensive comparison between these two approaches, examining aspects such as the global phase diagram, estimation error for the parameters, and prediction error for the labels. A specific comparison is made between the Bayes-optimal (BO) estimator and RMLE, as the BO setting provides optimal estimation performance and is ideal as a benchmark. Our analysis shows that with appropriate regularizations, RMLE can achieve near-optimal performance in terms of both the estimation error and prediction error, especially when there is a large amount of unlabeled data. These results demonstrate that the $\ell_2$ regularization term plays an effective role in estimation and prediction in SSL approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tejaswini Medi, Julia Grabinski, Margret Keuper</p>
<p>Abstract: While being very successful in solving many downstream tasks, the application of deep neural networks is limited in real-life scenarios because of their susceptibility to domain shifts such as common corruptions, and adversarial attacks. The existence of adversarial examples and data corruption significantly reduces the performance of deep classification models. Researchers have made strides in developing robust neural architectures to bolster decisions of deep classifiers. However, most of these works rely on effective adversarial training methods, and predominantly focus on overall model robustness, disregarding class-wise differences in robustness, which are critical. Exploiting weakly robust classes is a potential avenue for attackers to fool the image recognition models. Therefore, this study investigates class-to-class biases across adversarially trained robust classification models to understand their latent space structures and analyze their strong and weak class-wise properties. We further assess the robustness of classes against common corruptions and adversarial attacks, recognizing that class vulnerability extends beyond the number of correct classifications for a specific class. We find that the number of false positives of classes as specific target classes significantly impacts their vulnerability to attacks. Through our analysis on the Class False Positive Score, we assess a fair evaluation of how susceptible each class is to misclassification.</p>

<p>Abstract: Tabular data plays a critical role in real-world financial scenarios. Traditionally, tree models have dominated in handling tabular data. However, financial datasets in the industry often encounter some challenges, such as data heterogeneity, the predominance of numerical features and the large scale of the data, which can range from tens of millions to hundreds of millions of records. These challenges can lead to significant memory and computational issues when using tree-based models. Consequently, there is a growing need for neural network-based solutions that can outperform these models. In this paper, we introduce TKGMLP, an hybrid network for tabular data that combines shallow Kolmogorov Arnold Networks with Gated Multilayer Perceptron. This model leverages the strengths of both architectures to improve performance and scalability. We validate TKGMLP on a real-world credit scoring dataset, where it achieves state-of-the-art results and outperforms current benchmarks. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that the model continues to improve as the dataset size increases, making it highly scalable. Additionally, we propose a novel feature encoding method for numerical data, specifically designed to address the predominance of numerical features in financial datasets. The integration of this feature encoding method within TKGMLP significantly improves prediction accuracy. This research not only advances table prediction technology but also offers a practical and effective solution for handling large-scale numerical tabular data in various industrial applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: While Transformers and other sequence-parallelizable neural network architectures seem like the current state of the art in sequence modeling, they specifically lack state-tracking capabilities. These are important for time-series tasks and logical reasoning. Traditional RNNs like LSTMs and GRUs, as well as modern variants like sLSTM do have these capabilities at the cost of strictly sequential processing. While this is often seen as a strong limitation, we show how fast these networks can get with our hardware-optimization FlashRNN in Triton and CUDA, optimizing kernels to the register level on modern GPUs. We extend traditional RNNs with a parallelization variant that processes multiple RNNs of smaller hidden state in parallel, similar to the head-wise processing in Transformers. To enable flexibility on different GPU variants, we introduce a new optimization framework for hardware-internal cache sizes, memory and compute handling. It models the hardware in a setting using polyhedral-like constraints, including the notion of divisibility. This speeds up the solution process in our ConstrINT library for general integer constraint satisfaction problems (integer CSPs). We show that our kernels can achieve 50x speed-ups over a vanilla PyTorch implementation and allow 40x larger hidden sizes compared to our Triton implementation. Our open-source kernels and the optimization library are released here to boost research in the direction of state-tracking enabled RNNs and sequence modeling: https://github.com/NX-AI/flashrnn</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated significant potential in time series forecasting, offering impressive capabilities in handling complex temporal data. However, their robustness and reliability in real-world applications remain under-explored, particularly concerning their susceptibility to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we introduce a targeted adversarial attack framework for LLM-based time series forecasting. By employing both gradient-free and black-box optimization methods, we generate minimal yet highly effective perturbations that significantly degrade the forecasting accuracy across multiple datasets and LLM architectures. Our experiments, which include models like LLMTime with GPT-3.5, GPT-4, LLaMa, and Mistral, TimeGPT, and TimeLLM show that adversarial attacks lead to much more severe performance degradation than random noise, and demonstrate the broad effectiveness of our attacks across different LLMs. The results underscore the critical vulnerabilities of LLMs in time series forecasting, highlighting the need for robust defense mechanisms to ensure their reliable deployment in practical applications.

To enable efficient and reliable simulation of extreme weather events, it is crucial to achieve rapid turnaround, dynamical consistency, and accurate spatio-temporal spectral recovery. We propose an efficient correction diffusion model, TAUDiff, that combines a deterministic spatio-temporal model for mean field downscaling with a smaller generative diffusion model for recovering the fine-scale stochastic features. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach on downscaling atmospheric wind velocity fields obtained from coarse GCM simulations. We then extend TAUDiff for computationally efficient kilometer-scale downscaling of atmospheric wind velocity fields. Owing to low inference times, our approach can ensure quicker simulation of extreme events necessary for estimating associated risks and economic losses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Changchang Sun, Ren Wang, Yihua Zhang, Jinghan Jia, Jiancheng Liu, Gaowen Liu, Sijia Liu, Yan Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU), which seeks to erase the influence of specific unwanted data from already-trained models, is becoming increasingly vital in model editing, particularly to comply with evolving data regulations like the ``right to be forgotten''. Conventional approaches are predominantly model-based, typically requiring retraining or fine-tuning the model's weights to meet unlearning requirements. In this work, we approach the MU problem from a novel input perturbation-based perspective, where the model weights remain intact throughout the unlearning process. We demonstrate the existence of a proactive input-based unlearning strategy, referred to forget vector, which can be generated as an input-agnostic data perturbation and remains as effective as model-based approximate unlearning approaches. We also explore forget vector arithmetic, whereby multiple class-specific forget vectors are combined through simple operations (e.g., linear combinations) to generate new forget vectors for unseen unlearning tasks, such as forgetting arbitrary subsets across classes. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and adaptability of the forget vector, showcasing its competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art model-based methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi-Ping Chen, Vispi Karkaria, Ying-Kuan Tsai, Faith Rolark, Daniel Quispe, Robert X. Gao, Jian Cao, Wei Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Digital Twin -- a virtual replica of a physical system enabling real-time monitoring, model updating, prediction, and decision-making -- combined with recent advances in machine learning, offers new opportunities for proactive control strategies in autonomous manufacturing. However, achieving real-time decision-making with Digital Twins requires efficient optimization driven by accurate predictions of highly nonlinear manufacturing systems. This paper presents a simultaneous multi-step Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework for real-time decision-making, using a multivariate deep neural network, named Time-Series Dense Encoder (TiDE), as the surrogate model. Unlike conventional MPC models which only provide one-step ahead prediction, TiDE is capable of predicting future states within the prediction horizon in one shot (multi-step), significantly accelerating the MPC. Using Directed Energy Deposition (DED) additive manufacturing as a case study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MPC in achieving melt pool temperature tracking to ensure part quality, while reducing porosity defects by regulating laser power to maintain melt pool depth constraints. In this work, we first show that TiDE is capable of accurately predicting melt pool temperature and depth. Second, we demonstrate that the proposed MPC achieves precise temperature tracking while satisfying melt pool depth constraints within a targeted dilution range (10\%-30\%), reducing potential porosity defects. Compared to PID controller, the MPC results in smoother and less fluctuating laser power profiles with competitive or superior melt pool temperature control performance. This demonstrates the MPC's proactive control capabilities, leveraging time-series prediction and real-time optimization, positioning it as a powerful tool for future Digital Twin applications and real-time process optimization in manufacturing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengyang Song, Han Feng, Shreyashi Shukla, Jue Wang, Tao Hong</p>
<p>Abstract: Load forecasting is a fundamental task in smart grid. Many techniques have been applied to developing load forecasting models. Due to the challenges such as the Curse of Dimensionality, overfitting, and limited computing resources, multivariate higher-order polynomial models have received limited attention in load forecasting, despite their desirable mathematical foundations and optimization properties. In this paper, we propose low rank approximation and self-supervised dimension reduction to address the aforementioned issues. To further improve computational efficiency, we also utilize a fast Conjugate Gradient based algorithm for the proposed polynomial models. Based on the load datasets from the ISO New England, the proposed method high-order polynomials with self-supervised dimension reduction (HOPS) demonstrates higher forecasting accuracy over several competitive models. Additionally, experimental results indicate that our approach alleviates redundant variable construction, achieving better forecasts with fewer input variables.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Oliver Goldstein, Emanuele La Malfa, Felix Drinkall, Samuele Marro, Michael Wooldridge</p>
<p>Abstract: We discuss the ``Infinitely Many Paraphrases'' attacks (IMP), a category of jailbreaks that leverages the increasing capabilities of a model to handle paraphrases and encoded communications to bypass their defensive mechanisms. IMPs' viability pairs and grows with a model's capabilities to handle and bind the semantics of simple mappings between tokens and work extremely well in practice, posing a concrete threat to the users of the most powerful LLMs in commerce. We show how one can bypass the safeguards of the most powerful open- and closed-source LLMs and generate content that explicitly violates their safety policies. One can protect against IMPs by improving the guardrails and making them scale with the LLMs' capabilities. For two categories of attacks that are straightforward to implement, i.e., bijection and encoding, we discuss two defensive strategies, one in token and the other in embedding space. We conclude with some research questions we believe should be prioritised to enhance the defensive mechanisms of LLMs and our understanding of their safety.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ehsan Aminian, Rita P. Ribeiro, Joao Gama</p>
<p>Abstract: Imbalanced domains pose a significant challenge in real-world predictive analytics, particularly in the context of regression. While existing research has primarily focused on batch learning from static datasets, limited attention has been given to imbalanced regression in online learning scenarios. Intending to address this gap, in prior work, we proposed sampling strategies based on Chebyshevs inequality as the first methodologies designed explicitly for data streams. However, these approaches operated under the restrictive assumption that rare instances exclusively reside at distribution extremes. This study introduces histogram-based sampling strategies to overcome this constraint, proposing flexible solutions for imbalanced regression in evolving data streams. The proposed techniques -- Histogram-based Undersampling (HistUS) and Histogram-based Oversampling (HistOS) -- employ incremental online histograms to dynamically detect and prioritize rare instances across arbitrary regions of the target distribution to improve predictions in the rare cases. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that HistUS and HistOS substantially improve rare-case prediction accuracy, outperforming baseline models while maintaining competitiveness with Chebyshev-based approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas Jiralerspong, Berton Earnshaw, Jason Hartford, Yoshua Bengio, Luca Scimeca</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) are powerful generative models that have achieved unparalleled success in a number of generative tasks. In this work, we aim to build inductive biases into the training and sampling of diffusion models to better accommodate the target distribution of the data to model. For topologically structured data, we devise a frequency-based noising operator to purposefully manipulate, and set, these inductive biases. We first show that appropriate manipulations of the noising forward process can lead DPMs to focus on particular aspects of the distribution to learn. We show that different datasets necessitate different inductive biases, and that appropriate frequency-based noise control induces increased generative performance compared to standard diffusion. Finally, we demonstrate the possibility of ignoring information at particular frequencies while learning. We show this in an image corruption and recovery task, where we train a DPM to recover the original target distribution after severe noise corruption.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18548">What is the Alignment Objective of GRPO?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Milan Vojnovic, Se-Young Yun</p>
<p>Abstract: In this note, we examine the aggregation of preferences achieved by the Group Policy Optimisation (GRPO) algorithm, a reinforcement learning method used to train advanced artificial intelligence models such as DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeekMath. The GRPO algorithm trains a policy using a reward preference model, which is computed by sampling a set of outputs for a given context, observing the corresponding rewards, and applying shift-and-scale normalisation to these reward values. Additionally, it incorporates a penalty function to discourage deviations from a reference policy.
  We present a framework that enables us to characterise the stationary policies of the GRPO algorithm. This analysis reveals that the aggregation of preferences differs fundamentally from standard logarithmic pooling, which is implemented by other approaches such as RLHF. The precise form of preference aggregation arises from the way the reward preference model is defined and from the penalty function, which we show to essentially correspond to the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the aggregation policy and the reference policy.
  Interestingly, we demonstrate that for groups of size two, the reward preference model corresponds to pairwise comparison preferences, similar to those in other alignment methods based on pairwise comparison feedback. We provide explicit characterisations of the aggregate preference for binary questions, for groups of size two, and in the limit of large group size. This provides insights into the dependence of the aggregate preference on parameters such as the regularisation constant and the confidence margin of question answers.
  Finally, we discuss the aggregation of preferences obtained by modifying the GRPO algorithm to use direct KL divergence as the penalty or to use rewards without scale normalisation.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20167">Similarity-Distance-Magnitude Universal Verification</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Allen Schmaltz</p>
<p>Abstract: We address the neural network robustness problem by adding Similarity (i.e., correctly predicted depth-matches into training)-awareness and Distance-to-training-distribution-awareness to the existing output Magnitude (i.e., decision-boundary)-awareness of the softmax function. The resulting sdm activation function provides strong signals of the relative epistemic (reducible) predictive uncertainty. We use this novel behavior to further address the complementary HCI problem of mapping the output to human-interpretable summary statistics over relevant partitions of a held-out calibration set. Estimates of prediction-conditional uncertainty are obtained via a parsimonious learned transform over the class-conditional empirical CDFs of the output of a final-layer sdm activation function. For decision-making and as an intrinsic model check, estimates of class-conditional accuracy are obtained by further partitioning the high-probability regions of this calibrated output into class-conditional, region-specific CDFs. The uncertainty estimates from sdm calibration are remarkably robust to test-time distribution shifts and out-of-distribution inputs; incorporate awareness of the effective sample size; provide estimates of uncertainty from the learning and data splitting processes; and are well-suited for selective classification and conditional branching for additional test-time compute based on the predictive uncertainty, as for selective LLM generation, routing, and composition over multiple models and retrieval. Finally, we construct sdm networks, LLMs with uncertainty-aware verification and interpretability-by-exemplar as intrinsic properties. We provide open-source software implementing these results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jayden Teoh, Pradeep Varakantham, Peter Vamplew</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-world sequential decision-making tasks often require balancing trade-offs between multiple conflicting objectives, making Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) an increasingly prominent field of research. Despite recent advances, existing MORL literature has narrowly focused on performance within static environments, neglecting the importance of generalizing across diverse settings. Conversely, existing research on generalization in RL has always assumed scalar rewards, overlooking the inherent multi-objectivity of real-world problems. Generalization in the multi-objective context is fundamentally more challenging, as it requires learning a Pareto set of policies addressing varying preferences across multiple objectives. In this paper, we formalize the concept of generalization in MORL and how it can be evaluated. We then contribute a novel benchmark featuring diverse multi-objective domains with parameterized environment configurations to facilitate future studies in this area. Our baseline evaluations of state-of-the-art MORL algorithms on this benchmark reveals limited generalization capabilities, suggesting significant room for improvement. Our empirical findings also expose limitations in the expressivity of scalar rewards, emphasizing the need for multi-objective specifications to achieve effective generalization. We further analyzed the algorithmic complexities within current MORL approaches that could impede the transfer in performance from the single- to multiple-environment settings. This work fills a critical gap and lays the groundwork for future research that brings together two key areas in reinforcement learning: solving multi-objective decision-making problems and generalizing across diverse environments.

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01224">CE-U: Cross Entropy Unlearning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Bo Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models inadvertently memorize sensitive data from their massive pretraining corpora \cite{jang2022knowledge}. In this work, we propose CE-U (Cross Entropy Unlearning), a novel loss function for unlearning. CE-U addresses fundamental limitations of gradient ascent approaches which suffer from instability due to vanishing gradients when model confidence is high and gradient exploding when confidence is low. We also unify standard cross entropy supervision and cross entropy unlearning into a single framework. Notably, on the TOFU benchmark for unlearning \cite{maini2024tofu}, CE-U achieves state-of-the-art results on LLaMA2-7B forgetting, even without the use of any extra reference model or additional positive samples. Our theoretical analysis further reveals that the gradient instability issues also exist in popular reinforcement learning algorithms like DPO \cite{rafailov2023direct} and GRPO \cite{Shao2024DeepSeekMath}, as they include a gradient ascent component. This suggests that applying CE-U principles to reinforcement learning could be a promising direction for improving stability and convergence.</p>

This study proposes a theoretically grounded setup to define the notion of task and to compute the {\bf inclusion} between two tasks from a statistical deficiency point of view. We propose a tractable proxy as information sufficiency to estimate the degree of inclusion between tasks, show its soundness on synthetic data, and use it to reconstruct empirically the classic NLP pipeline.</p>

<p>Abstract: We address the problem of active logistic regression in the realizable setting. It is well known that active learning can require exponentially fewer label queries compared to passive learning, in some cases using $\log \frac{1}{\eps}$ rather than $\poly(1/\eps)$ labels to get error $\eps$ larger than the optimum.
  We present the first algorithm that is polynomially competitive with the optimal algorithm on every input instance, up to factors polylogarithmic in the error and domain size. In particular, if any algorithm achieves label complexity polylogarithmic in $\eps$, so does ours. Our algorithm is based on efficient sampling and can be extended to learn more general class of functions. We further support our theoretical results with experiments demonstrating performance gains for logistic regression compared to existing active learning algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuan-May Le, Ling Luo, Uwe Aickelin, Minh-Tuan Tran, David Berlowitz, Mark Howard</p>
<p>Abstract: Patient-ventilator asynchrony (PVA) is a common and critical issue during mechanical ventilation, affecting up to 85% of patients. PVA can result in clinical complications such as discomfort, sleep disruption, and potentially more severe conditions like ventilator-induced lung injury and diaphragm dysfunction. Traditional PVA management, which relies on manual adjustments by healthcare providers, is often inadequate due to delays and errors. While various computational methods, including rule-based, statistical, and deep learning approaches, have been developed to detect PVA events, they face challenges related to dataset imbalances and lack of interpretability. In this work, we propose a shapelet-based approach SHIP for PVA detection, utilizing shapelets - discriminative subsequences in time-series data - to enhance detection accuracy and interpretability. Our method addresses dataset imbalances through shapelet-based data augmentation and constructs a shapelet pool to transform the dataset for more effective classification. The combined shapelet and statistical features are then used in a classifier to identify PVA events. Experimental results on medical datasets show that SHIP significantly improves PVA detection while providing interpretable insights into model decisions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengcheng Yan, Jiawei Xu, Qingsong Wang, Zheng Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: The stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm has achieved remarkable success in training deep learning models. However, it has several limitations, including susceptibility to vanishing gradients, sensitivity to input data, and a lack of robust theoretical guarantees. In recent years, alternating minimization (AM) methods have emerged as a promising alternative for model training by employing gradient-free approaches to iteratively update model parameters. Despite their potential, these methods often exhibit slow convergence rates. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Triple-Inertial Accelerated Alternating Minimization (TIAM) framework for neural network training. The TIAM approach incorporates a triple-inertial acceleration strategy with a specialized approximation method, facilitating targeted acceleration of different terms in each sub-problem optimization. This integration improves the efficiency of convergence, achieving superior performance with fewer iterations. Additionally, we provide a convergence analysis of the TIAM algorithm, including its global convergence properties and convergence rate. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the TIAM method, showing significant improvements in generalization capability and computational efficiency compared to existing approaches, particularly when applied to the rectified linear unit (ReLU) and its variants.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ankur Singha, Elia Cellini, Kim A. Nicoli, Karl Jansen, Stefan K\"uhn, Shinichi Nakajima</p>
<p>Abstract: Investigating critical phenomena or phase transitions is of high interest in physics and chemistry, for which Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, a crucial tool for numerically analyzing macroscopic properties of given systems, are often hindered by an emerging divergence of correlation length -- known as scale invariance at criticality (SIC) in the renormalization group theory. SIC causes the system to behave the same at any length scale, from which many existing sampling methods suffer: long-range correlations cause critical slowing down in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), and require intractably large receptive fields for generative samplers. In this paper, we propose a Renormalization-informed Generative Critical Sampler (RiGCS) -- a novel sampler specialized for near-critical systems, where SIC is leveraged as an advantage rather than a nuisance. Specifically, RiGCS builds on MultiLevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) with Heat Bath (HB) algorithms, which perform ancestral sampling from low-resolution to high-resolution lattice configurations with site-wise-independent conditional HB sampling. Although MLMC-HB is highly efficient under exact SIC, it suffers from a low acceptance rate under slight SIC violation. Notably, SIC violation always occurs in finite-size systems, and may induce long-range and higher-order interactions in the renormalized distributions, which are not considered by independent HB samplers. RiGCS enhances MLMC-HB by replacing a part of the conditional HB sampler with generative models that capture those residual interactions and improve the sampling efficiency. Our experiments show that the effective sample size of RiGCS is a few orders of magnitude higher than state-of-the-art generative model baselines in sampling configurations for 128x128 two-dimensional Ising systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qi Xu, Annie Qu</p>
<p>Abstract: In the era of big data, large-scale, multi-modal datasets are increasingly ubiquitous, offering unprecedented opportunities for predictive modeling and scientific discovery. However, these datasets often exhibit complex heterogeneity, such as covariate shift, posterior drift, and missing modalities, that can hinder the accuracy of existing prediction algorithms. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Representation Retrieval ($R^2$) framework, which integrates a representation learning module (the representer) with a sparsity-induced machine learning model (the learner). Moreover, we introduce the notion of "integrativeness" for representers, characterized by the effective data sources used in learning representers, and propose a Selective Integration Penalty (SIP) to explicitly improve the property. Theoretically, we demonstrate that the $R^2$ framework relaxes the conventional full-sharing assumption in multi-task learning, allowing for partially shared structures, and that SIP can improve the convergence rate of the excess risk bound. Extensive simulation studies validate the empirical performance of our framework, and applications to two real-world datasets further confirm its superiority over existing approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are a popular technique for interpreting language model activations, and there is extensive recent work on improving SAE effectiveness. However, most prior work evaluates progress using unsupervised proxy metrics with unclear practical relevance. We introduce SAEBench, a comprehensive evaluation suite that measures SAE performance across seven diverse metrics, spanning interpretability, feature disentanglement and practical applications like unlearning. To enable systematic comparison, we open-source a suite of over 200 SAEs across eight recently proposed SAE architectures and training algorithms. Our evaluation reveals that gains on proxy metrics do not reliably translate to better practical performance. For instance, while Matryoshka SAEs slightly underperform on existing proxy metrics, they substantially outperform other architectures on feature disentanglement metrics; moreover, this advantage grows with SAE scale. By providing a standardized framework for measuring progress in SAE development, SAEBench enables researchers to study scaling trends and make nuanced comparisons between different SAE architectures and training methodologies. Our interactive interface enables researchers to flexibly visualize relationships between metrics across hundreds of open-source SAEs at: https://saebench.xyz</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nguyen Thach, Fei Liu, Houyu Zhou, Hau Chan</p>
<p>Abstract: Designing strategyproof mechanisms for multi-facility location that optimize social costs based on agent preferences had been challenging due to the extensive domain knowledge required and poor worst-case guarantees. Recently, deep learning models have been proposed as alternatives. However, these models require some domain knowledge and extensive hyperparameter tuning as well as lacking interpretability, which is crucial in practice when transparency of the learned mechanisms is mandatory. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, named LLMMech, that addresses these limitations by incorporating large language models (LLMs) into an evolutionary framework for generating interpretable, hyperparameter-free, empirically strategyproof, and nearly optimal mechanisms. Our experimental results, evaluated on various problem settings where the social cost is arbitrarily weighted across agents and the agent preferences may not be uniformly distributed, demonstrate that the LLM-generated mechanisms generally outperform existing handcrafted baselines and deep learning models. Furthermore, the mechanisms exhibit impressive generalizability to out-of-distribution agent preferences and to larger instances with more agents.</p>

<p>Abstract: Gaussian process (GP) models that combine both categorical and continuous input variables have found use in analysis of longitudinal data and computer experiments. However, standard inference for these models has the typical cubic scaling, and common scalable approximation schemes for GPs cannot be applied since the covariance function is non-continuous. In this work, we derive a basis function approximation scheme for mixed-domain covariance functions, which scales linearly with respect to the number of observations and total number of basis functions. The proposed approach is naturally applicable to also Bayesian GP regression with discrete observation models. We demonstrate the scalability of the approach and compare model reduction techniques for additive GP models in a longitudinal data context. We confirm that we can approximate the exact GP model accurately in a fraction of the runtime compared to fitting the corresponding exact model. In addition, we demonstrate a scalable model reduction workflow for obtaining smaller and more interpretable models when dealing with a large number of candidate predictors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Patrick Benjamin, Alessandro Abate</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce networked communication to the mean-field game framework, in particular to oracle-free settings where $N$ decentralised agents learn along a single, non-episodic run of the empirical system. We prove that our architecture has sample guarantees bounded between those of the centralised- and independent-learning cases. We provide the order of the difference in these bounds in terms of network structure and number of communication rounds, and also contribute a policy-update stability guarantee. We discuss how the sample guarantees of the three theoretical algorithms do not actually result in practical convergence. We therefore show that in practical settings where the theoretical parameters are not observed (leading to poor estimation of the Q-function), our communication scheme considerably accelerates learning over the independent case, often performing similarly to a centralised learner while removing the restrictive assumption of the latter. We contribute further practical enhancements to all three theoretical algorithms, allowing us to present their first empirical demonstrations. Our experiments confirm that we can remove several of the theoretical assumptions of the algorithms, and display the empirical convergence benefits brought by our new networked communication. We additionally show that our networked approach has significant advantages over both alternatives in terms of robustness to update failures and to changes in population size.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongdong Li, Zhongliang Zeng, Zhe Wang, Hai Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Towards practical applications of Electroencephalography (EEG), lightweight acquisition devices garner significant attention. However, EEG channel selection methods are commonly data-sensitive and cannot establish a unified sound paradigm for EEG acquisition devices. Through reverse conceptualisation, we formulated EEG applications in an EEG super-resolution (SR) manner, but suffered from high computation costs, extra interpolation bias, and few insights into spatiotemporal dependency modelling. To this end, we propose ESTformer, an EEG SR framework that utilises spatiotemporal dependencies based on the transformer. ESTformer applies positional encoding methods and a multihead self-attention mechanism to the space and time dimensions, which can learn spatial structural correlations and temporal functional variations. ESTformer, with the fixed mask strategy, adopts a mask token to upsample low-resolution (LR) EEG data in the case of disturbance from mathematical interpolation methods. On this basis, we designed various transformer blocks to construct a spatial interpolation module (SIM) and a temporal reconstruction module (TRM). Finally, ESTformer cascades the SIM and TRM to capture and model the spatiotemporal dependencies for EEG SR with fidelity. Extensive experimental results on two EEG datasets show the effectiveness of ESTformer against previous state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating the versatility of the Transformer for EEG SR tasks. The superiority of the SR data was verified in an EEG-based person identification and emotion recognition task, achieving a 2% to 38% improvement compared with the LR data at different sampling scales.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zehao Wang, Yuping Wang, Zhuoyuan Wu, Hengbo Ma, Zhaowei Li, Hang Qiu, Jiachen Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The confluence of the advancement of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) and the maturity of Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication has enabled the capability of cooperative connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). Building on top of cooperative perception, this paper explores the feasibility and effectiveness of cooperative motion prediction. Our method, CMP, takes LiDAR signals as model input to enhance tracking and prediction capabilities. Unlike previous work that focuses separately on either cooperative perception or motion prediction, our framework, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to address the unified problem where CAVs share information in both perception and prediction modules. Incorporated into our design is the unique capability to tolerate realistic V2X transmission delays, while dealing with bulky perception representations. We also propose a prediction aggregation module, which unifies the predictions obtained by different CAVs and generates the final prediction. Through extensive experiments and ablation studies on the OPV2V and V2V4Real datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in cooperative perception, tracking, and motion prediction. In particular, CMP reduces the average prediction error by 12.3% compared with the strongest baseline. Our work marks a significant step forward in the cooperative capabilities of CAVs, showcasing enhanced performance in complex scenarios.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Javier Marin</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding how consumers respond to business advertising efforts is essential for optimizing marketing investment. This research introduces a new modeling approach based on the concepts of symmetries and scaling laws in physics to describe consumer response to advertising dynamics. Drawing from mathematical frameworks used in physics and social sciences, we propose a model that accounts for a key aspect: the saturation effect. The model is validated against commonly used models, including the Michaelis-Menten and Hill equations, showing its ability to better capture nonlinearities in advertising effects. We introduce new key parameters like Marketing Sensitivity, Response Sensitivity, and Behavioral Sensitivit, that offer additional insights into the drivers of audience engagement and advertising performance. Our model provides a rigorous yet practical tool for understanding audience behavior, contributing to the improvement of budget allocation strategies.</p>

<p>Abstract: Soft, porous mechanical metamaterials exhibit pattern transformations that may have important applications in soft robotics, sound reduction and biomedicine. To design these innovative materials, it is important to be able to simulate them accurately and quickly, in order to tune their mechanical properties. Since conventional simulations using the finite element method entail a high computational cost, in this article we aim to develop a machine learning-based approach that scales favorably to serve as a surrogate model. To ensure that the model is also able to handle various microstructures, including those not encountered during training, we include the microstructure as part of the network input. Therefore, we introduce a graph neural network that predicts global quantities (energy, stress stiffness) as well as the pattern transformations that occur (the kinematics). To make our model as accurate and data-efficient as possible, various symmetries are incorporated into the model. The starting point is an E(n)-equivariant graph neural network (which respects translation, rotation and reflection) that has periodic boundary conditions (i.e., it is in-/equivariant with respect to the choice of RVE), is scale in-/equivariant, can simulate large deformations, and can predict scalars, vectors as well as second and fourth order tensors (specifically energy, stress and stiffness). The incorporation of scale equivariance makes the model equivariant with respect to the similarities group, of which the Euclidean group E(n) is a subgroup. We show that this network is more accurate and data-efficient than graph neural networks with fewer symmetries. To create an efficient graph representation of the finite element discretization, we use only the internal geometrical hole boundaries from the finite element mesh to achieve a better speed-up and scaling with the mesh size.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep learning has shown incredible potential across a wide array of tasks, and accompanied by this growth has been an insatiable appetite for data. However, a large amount of data needed for enabling deep learning is stored on personal devices, and recent concerns on privacy have further highlighted challenges for accessing such data. As a result, federated learning (FL) has emerged as an important privacy-preserving technology that enables collaborative training of machine learning models without the need to send the raw, potentially sensitive, data to a central server. However, the fundamental premise that sending model updates to a server is privacy-preserving only holds if the updates cannot be "reverse engineered" to infer information about the private training data. It has been shown under a wide variety of settings that this privacy premise does not hold. In this survey paper, we provide a comprehensive literature review of the different privacy attacks and defense methods in FL. We identify the current limitations of these attacks and highlight the settings in which the privacy of ann FL client can be broken. We further dissect some of the successful industry applications of FL and draw lessons for future successful adoption. We survey the emerging landscape of privacy regulation for FL and conclude with future directions for taking FL toward the cherished goal of generating accurate models while preserving the privacy of the data from its participants.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Heng Yim Nicole Oo, Min Hun Lee, Jeong Hoon Lim</p>
<p>Abstract: Algorithmic detection of facial palsy offers the potential to improve current practices, which usually involve labor-intensive and subjective assessment by clinicians. In this paper, we present a multimodal fusion-based deep learning model that utilizes unstructured data (i.e. an image frame with facial line segments) and structured data (i.e. features of facial expressions) to detect facial palsy. We then contribute to a study to analyze the effect of different data modalities and the benefits of a multimodal fusion-based approach using videos of 21 facial palsy patients. Our experimental results show that among various data modalities (i.e. unstructured data - RGB images and images of facial line segments and structured data - coordinates of facial landmarks and features of facial expressions), the feed-forward neural network using features of facial expression achieved the highest precision of 76.22 while the ResNet-based model using images of facial line segments achieved the highest recall of 83.47. When we leveraged both images of facial line segments and features of facial expressions, our multimodal fusion-based deep learning model slightly improved the precision score to 77.05 at the expense of a decrease in the recall score.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arun Balajee Vasudevan, Neehar Peri, Jeff Schneider, Deva Ramanan</p>
<p>Abstract: Motion planning is crucial for safe navigation in complex urban environments. Historically, motion planners (MPs) have been evaluated with procedurally-generated simulators like CARLA. However, such synthetic benchmarks do not capture real-world multi-agent interactions. nuPlan, a recently released MP benchmark, addresses this limitation by augmenting real-world driving logs with closed-loop simulation logic, effectively turning the fixed dataset into a reactive simulator. We analyze the characteristics of nuPlan's recorded logs and find that each city has its own unique driving behaviors, suggesting that robust planners must adapt to different environments. We learn to model such unique behaviors with BehaviorNet, a graph convolutional neural network (GCNN) that predicts reactive agent behaviors using features derived from recently-observed agent histories; intuitively, some aggressive agents may tailgate lead vehicles, while others may not. To model such phenomena, BehaviorNet predicts the parameters of an agent's motion controller rather than directly predicting its spacetime trajectory (as most forecasters do). Finally, we present AdaptiveDriver, a model-predictive control (MPC) based planner that unrolls different world models conditioned on BehaviorNet's predictions. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that AdaptiveDriver achieves state-of-the-art results on the nuPlan closed-loop planning benchmark, improving over prior work by 2% on Test-14 Hard R-CLS, and generalizes even when evaluated on never-before-seen cities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stefan Sylvius Wagner, Maike Behrendt, Marc Ziegele, Stefan Harmeling</p>
<p>Abstract: Stance detection holds great potential to improve online political discussions through its deployment in discussion platforms for purposes such as content moderation, topic summarization or to facilitate more balanced discussions. Typically, transformer-based models are employed directly for stance detection, requiring vast amounts of data. However, the wide variety of debate topics in online political discussions makes data collection particularly challenging. LLMs have revived stance detection, but their online deployment in online political discussions faces challenges like inconsistent outputs, biases, and vulnerability to adversarial attacks. We show how LLM-generated synthetic data can improve stance detection for online political discussions by using reliable traditional stance detection models for online deployment, while leveraging the text generation capabilities of LLMs for synthetic data generation in a secure offline environment. To achieve this, (i) we generate synthetic data for specific debate questions by prompting a Mistral-7B model and show that fine-tuning with the generated synthetic data can substantially improve the performance of stance detection, while remaining interpretable and aligned with real world data. (ii) Using the synthetic data as a reference, we can improve performance even further by identifying the most informative samples in an unlabelled dataset, i.e., those samples which the stance detection model is most uncertain about and can benefit from the most. By fine-tuning with both synthetic data and the most informative samples, we surpass the performance of the baseline model that is fine-tuned on all true labels, while labelling considerably less data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yarden Cohen, Alexandre Khae Wu Navarro, Jes Frellsen, Richard E. Turner, Raziel Riemer, Ari Pakman</p>
<p>Abstract: The need for regression models to predict circular values arises in many scientific fields. In this work we explore a family of expressive and interpretable distributions over circle-valued random functions related to Gaussian processes targeting two Euclidean dimensions conditioned on the unit circle. The probability model has connections with continuous spin models in statistical physics. Moreover, its density is very simple and has maximum-entropy, unlike previous Gaussian process-based approaches, which use wrapping or radial marginalization. For posterior inference, we introduce a new Stratonovich-like augmentation that lends itself to fast Gibbs sampling. We argue that transductive learning in these models favors a Bayesian approach to the parameters and apply our sampling scheme to the Double Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. We present experiments applying this model to the prediction of (i) wind directions and (ii) the percentage of the running gait cycle as a function of joint angles.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elizabeth L. Baker, Moritz Schauer, Stefan Sommer</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a new algorithm for learning bridged diffusion processes using score-matching methods. Our method relies on reversing the dynamics of the forward process and using this to learn a score function, which, via Doob's $h$-transform, yields a bridged diffusion process; that is, a process conditioned on an endpoint. In contrast to prior methods, we learn the score term $\nabla_x \log p(t, x; T, y)$ directly, for given $t, y$, completely avoiding first learning a time-reversal. We compare the performance of our algorithm with existing methods and see that it outperforms using the (learned) time-reversals to learn the score term.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hunmin Yang, Jongoh Jeong, Kuk-Jin Yoon</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent vision-language foundation models, such as CLIP, have demonstrated superior capabilities in learning representations that can be transferable across diverse range of downstream tasks and domains. With the emergence of such powerful models, it has become crucial to effectively leverage their capabilities in tackling challenging vision tasks. On the other hand, only a few works have focused on devising adversarial examples that transfer well to both unknown domains and model architectures. In this paper, we propose a novel transfer attack method called PDCL-Attack, which leverages the CLIP model to enhance the transferability of adversarial perturbations generated by a generative model-based attack framework. Specifically, we formulate an effective prompt-driven feature guidance by harnessing the semantic representation power of text, particularly from the ground-truth class labels of input images. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce prompt learning to enhance the transferable generative attacks. Extensive experiments conducted across various cross-domain and cross-model settings empirically validate our approach, demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adam Lechowicz, Nicolas Christianson, Bo Sun, Noman Bashir, Mohammad Hajiesmaili, Adam Wierman, Prashant Shenoy</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce and study spatiotemporal online allocation with deadline constraints ($\mathsf{SOAD}$), a new online problem motivated by emerging challenges in sustainability and energy. In $\mathsf{SOAD}$, an online player completes a workload by allocating and scheduling it on the points of a metric space $(X, d)$ while subject to a deadline $T$. At each time step, a service cost function is revealed that represents the cost of servicing the workload at each point, and the player must irrevocably decide the current allocation of work to points. Whenever the player moves this allocation, they incur a movement cost defined by the distance metric $d(\cdot, \ \cdot)$ that captures, e.g., an overhead cost. $\mathsf{SOAD}$ formalizes the open problem of combining general metrics and deadline constraints in the online algorithms literature, unifying problems such as metrical task systems and online search. We propose a competitive algorithm for $\mathsf{SOAD}$ along with a matching lower bound establishing its optimality. Our main algorithm, \textsc{ST-CLIP}, is a learning-augmented algorithm that takes advantage of predictions (e.g., forecasts of relevant costs) and achieves an optimal consistency-robustness trade-off. We evaluate our proposed algorithms in a simulated case study of carbon-aware spatiotemporal workload management, an application in sustainable computing that schedules a delay-tolerant batch compute job on a distributed network of data centers. In these experiments, we show that \textsc{ST-CLIP} substantially improves on heuristic baseline methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Patrick Benjamin, Alessandro Abate</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent algorithms allow decentralised agents, possibly connected via a communication network, to learn equilibria in Mean-Field Games from a non-episodic run of the empirical system. However, these algorithms are for tabular settings: this computationally limits the size of agents' observation space, meaning the algorithms cannot handle anything but small state spaces, nor generalise beyond policies depending only on the agent's local state to so-called 'population-dependent' policies. We address this limitation by introducing function approximation to the existing setting, drawing on the Munchausen Online Mirror Descent method that has previously been employed only in finite-horizon, episodic, centralised settings. While this permits us to include the mean field in the observation for players' policies, it is unrealistic to assume decentralised agents have access to this global information: we therefore also provide new algorithms allowing agents to locally estimate the global empirical distribution, and to improve this estimate via inter-agent communication. We show theoretically that exchanging policy information helps networked agents outperform both independent and even centralised agents in function-approximation settings. Our experiments demonstrate this happening empirically, by an even greater margin than in tabular settings, and show that the communication network allows decentralised agents to estimate the mean field for population-dependent policies.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generative models aim to simulate realistic effects of various actions across different contexts, from text generation to visual effects. Despite significant efforts to build real-world simulators, the application of generative models to virtual worlds, like financial markets, remains under-explored. In financial markets, generative models can simulate complex market effects of participants with various behaviors, enabling interaction under different market conditions, and training strategies without financial risk. This simulation relies on the finest structured data in financial market like orders thus building the finest realistic simulation. We propose Large Market Model (LMM), an order-level generative foundation model, for financial market simulation, akin to language modeling in the digital world. Our financial Market Simulation engine (MarS), powered by LMM, addresses the domain-specific need for realistic, interactive and controllable order generation. Key observations include LMM's strong scalability across data size and model complexity, and MarS's robust and practicable realism in controlled generation with market impact. We showcase MarS as a forecast tool, detection system, analysis platform, and agent training environment, thus demonstrating MarS's "paradigm shift" potential for a variety of financial applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyi Liao, Lingbo Mo, Chejian Xu, Mintong Kang, Jiawei Zhang, Chaowei Xiao, Yuan Tian, Bo Li, Huan Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Generalist web agents have demonstrated remarkable potential in autonomously completing a wide range of tasks on real websites, significantly boosting human productivity. However, web tasks, such as booking flights, usually involve users' PII, which may be exposed to potential privacy risks if web agents accidentally interact with compromised websites, a scenario that remains largely unexplored in the literature. In this work, we narrow this gap by conducting the first study on the privacy risks of generalist web agents in adversarial environments. First, we present a realistic threat model for attacks on the website, where we consider two adversarial targets: stealing users' specific PII or the entire user request. Then, we propose a novel attack method, termed Environmental Injection Attack (EIA). EIA injects malicious content designed to adapt well to environments where the agents operate and our work instantiates EIA specifically for privacy scenarios in web environments. We collect 177 action steps that involve diverse PII categories on realistic websites from the Mind2Web, and conduct experiments using one of the most capable generalist web agent frameworks to date. The results demonstrate that EIA achieves up to 70% ASR in stealing specific PII and 16% ASR for full user request. Additionally, by accessing the stealthiness and experimenting with a defensive system prompt, we indicate that EIA is hard to detect and mitigate. Notably, attacks that are not well adapted for a webpage can be detected via human inspection, leading to our discussion about the trade-off between security and autonomy. However, extra attackers' efforts can make EIA seamlessly adapted, rendering such supervision ineffective. Thus, we further discuss the defenses at the pre- and post-deployment stages of the websites without relying on human supervision and call for more advanced defense strategies.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diabetes is a chronic disease with a significant global health burden, requiring multi-stakeholder collaboration for optimal management. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in various healthcare scenarios, but their effectiveness across diverse diabetes tasks remains unproven. Our study introduced a framework to train and validate diabetes-specific LLMs. We first developed a comprehensive data processing pipeline that includes data collection, filtering, augmentation and refinement. This created a high-quality, diabetes-specific dataset and evaluation benchmarks from scratch. Fine-tuned on the collected training dataset, our diabetes-specific LLM family demonstrated state-of-the-art proficiency in processing various diabetes tasks compared to other LLMs. Furthermore, clinical studies revealed the potential applications of our models in diabetes care, including providing personalized healthcare, assisting medical education, and streamlining clinical tasks. Generally, our introduced framework helps develop diabetes-specific LLMs and highlights their potential to enhance clinical practice and provide personalized, data-driven support for diabetes management across different end users.

<p>Abstract: Language models (LMs) possess a strong capability to comprehend natural language, making them effective in translating human instructions into detailed plans for simple robot tasks. Nevertheless, it remains a significant challenge to handle long-horizon tasks, especially in subtask identification and allocation for cooperative heterogeneous robot teams. To address this issue, we propose a Language Model-Driven Multi-Agent PDDL Planner (LaMMA-P), a novel multi-agent task planning framework that achieves state-of-the-art performance on long-horizon tasks. LaMMA-P integrates the strengths of the LMs' reasoning capability and the traditional heuristic search planner to achieve a high success rate and efficiency while demonstrating strong generalization across tasks. Additionally, we create MAT-THOR, a comprehensive benchmark that features household tasks with two different levels of complexity based on the AI2-THOR environment. The experimental results demonstrate that LaMMA-P achieves a 105% higher success rate and 36% higher efficiency than existing LM-based multiagent planners.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyi Mai, Zhenyu Liao</p>
<p>Abstract: The assumption of Gaussian or Gaussian mixture data has been extensively exploited in a long series of precise performance analyses of machine learning (ML) methods, on large datasets having comparably numerous samples and features. To relax this restrictive assumption, subsequent efforts have been devoted to establish "Gaussian equivalent principles" by studying scenarios of Gaussian universality where the asymptotic performance of ML methods on non-Gaussian data remains unchanged when replaced with Gaussian data having the same mean and covariance. Beyond the realm of Gaussian universality, there are few exact results on how the data distribution affects the learning performance.
  In this article, we provide a precise high-dimensional characterization of empirical risk minimization, for classification under a general mixture data setting of linear factor models that extends Gaussian mixtures. The Gaussian universality is shown to break down under this setting, in the sense that the asymptotic learning performance depends on the data distribution beyond the class means and covariances. To clarify the limitations of Gaussian universality in the classification of mixture data and to understand the impact of its breakdown, we specify conditions for Gaussian universality and discuss their implications for the choice of loss function.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zaid Khan, Elias Stengel-Eskin, Jaemin Cho, Mohit Bansal</p>
<p>Abstract: The process of creating training data to teach models is currently driven by humans, who manually analyze model weaknesses and plan how to create data that improves a student model. Approaches using LLMs as annotators reduce human effort, but still require humans to interpret feedback from evaluations and control the LLM to produce data the student needs. Automating this labor-intensive process by creating autonomous data generation agents - or teachers - is desirable, but requires environments that can simulate the feedback-driven, iterative, closed loop of data creation. To enable rapid, scalable testing for such agents and their modules, we introduce DataEnvGym, a testbed of teacher environments for data generation agents. DataEnvGym frames data generation as a sequential decision-making task, involving an agent consisting of a data generation policy (which generates a plan for creating training data) and a data generation engine (which transforms the plan into data), inside an environment that provides student feedback. The agent's goal is to improve student performance. Students are iteratively trained and evaluated on generated data, and their feedback (in the form of errors or weak skills) is reported to the agent after each iteration. DataEnvGym includes multiple teacher environment instantiations across 3 levels of structure in the state representation and action space. More structured environments are based on inferred skills and offer more interpretability and curriculum control. We support 4 domains (math, code, VQA, and tool-use) and test multiple students and teachers. Example agents in our teaching environments can iteratively improve students across tasks and settings. Moreover, we show that environments teach different skill levels and test variants of key modules, pointing to future work in improving data generation agents, engines, and feedback mechanisms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mutian He, Philip N. Garner</p>
<p>Abstract: Architectures such as Linformer and Mamba have recently emerged as competitive linear time replacements for transformers. However, corresponding large pretrained models are often unavailable, especially in non-text domains. To remedy this, we present a Cross-Architecture Layerwise Distillation (CALD) approach that jointly converts a transformer model to a linear time substitute and fine-tunes it to a target task. We also compare several means to guide the fine-tuning to optimally retain the desired inference capability from the original model. The methods differ in their use of the target model and the trajectory of the parameters. In a series of empirical studies on language processing, language modeling, and speech processing, we show that CALD can effectively recover the result of the original model, and that the guiding strategy contributes to the result. Some reasons for the variation are suggested.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jacopo Iollo, Christophe Heinkel\'e, Pierre Alliez, Florence Forbes</p>
<p>Abstract: Bayesian Optimal Experimental Design (BOED) is a powerful tool to reduce the cost of running a sequence of experiments. When based on the Expected Information Gain (EIG), design optimization corresponds to the maximization of some intractable expected contrast between prior and posterior distributions. Scaling this maximization to high dimensional and complex settings has been an issue due to BOED inherent computational complexity. In this work, we introduce a pooled posterior distribution with cost-effective sampling properties and provide a tractable access to the EIG contrast maximization via a new EIG gradient expression. Diffusion-based samplers are used to compute the dynamics of the pooled posterior and ideas from bi-level optimization are leveraged to derive an efficient joint sampling-optimization loop. The resulting efficiency gain allows to extend BOED to the well-tested generative capabilities of diffusion models. By incorporating generative models into the BOED framework, we expand its scope and its use in scenarios that were previously impractical. Numerical experiments and comparison with state-of-the-art methods show the potential of the approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siu Lun Chau, Antonin Schrab, Arthur Gretton, Dino Sejdinovic, Krikamol Muandet</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce credal two-sample testing, a new hypothesis testing framework for comparing credal sets -- convex sets of probability measures where each element captures aleatoric uncertainty and the set itself represents epistemic uncertainty that arises from the modeller's partial ignorance. Compared to classical two-sample tests, which focus on comparing precise distributions, the proposed framework provides a broader and more versatile set of hypotheses. This approach enables the direct integration of epistemic uncertainty, effectively addressing the challenges arising from partial ignorance in hypothesis testing. By generalising two-sample test to compare credal sets, our framework enables reasoning for equality, inclusion, intersection, and mutual exclusivity, each offering unique insights into the modeller's epistemic beliefs. As the first work on nonparametric hypothesis testing for comparing credal sets, we focus on finitely generated credal sets derived from i.i.d. samples from multiple distributions -- referred to as credal samples. We formalise these tests as two-sample tests with nuisance parameters and introduce the first permutation-based solution for this class of problems, significantly improving existing methods. Our approach properly incorporates the modeller's epistemic uncertainty into hypothesis testing, leading to more robust and credible conclusions, with kernel-based implementations for real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiming Wang, Pei Zhang, Baosong Yang, Derek F. Wong, Rui Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: LLM self-evaluation relies on the LLM's own ability to estimate response correctness, which can greatly improve its deployment reliability. In this research track, we propose the Chain-of-Embedding (CoE) in the latent space to enable LLMs to perform output-free self-evaluation. CoE consists of all progressive hidden states produced during the inference time, which can be treated as the latent thinking path of LLMs. We find that when LLMs respond correctly and incorrectly, their CoE features differ, these discrepancies assist us in estimating LLM response correctness. Experiments in four diverse domains and seven LLMs fully demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Meanwhile, its label-free design intent without any training and millisecond-level computational cost ensures real-time feedback in large-scale scenarios. More importantly, we provide interesting insights into LLM response correctness from the perspective of hidden state changes inside LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiarui Lu, Xiaoyin Chen, Stephen Zhewen Lu, Chence Shi, Hongyu Guo, Yoshua Bengio, Jian Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Proteins adopt multiple structural conformations to perform their diverse biological functions, and understanding these conformations is crucial for advancing drug discovery. Traditional physics-based simulation methods often struggle with sampling equilibrium conformations and are computationally expensive. Recently, deep generative models have shown promise in generating protein conformations as a more efficient alternative. However, these methods predominantly rely on the diffusion process within a 3D geometric space, which typically centers around the vicinity of metastable states and is often inefficient in terms of runtime. In this paper, we introduce Structure Language Modeling (SLM) as a novel framework for efficient protein conformation generation. Specifically, the protein structures are first encoded into a compact latent space using a discrete variational auto-encoder, followed by conditional language modeling that effectively captures sequence-specific conformation distributions. This enables a more efficient and interpretable exploration of diverse ensemble modes compared to existing methods. Based on this general framework, we instantiate SLM with various popular LM architectures as well as proposing the ESMDiff, a novel BERT-like structure language model fine-tuned from ESM3 with masked diffusion. We verify our approach in various scenarios, including the equilibrium dynamics of BPTI, conformational change pairs, and intrinsically disordered proteins. SLM provides a highly efficient solution, offering a 20-100x speedup than existing methods in generating diverse conformations, shedding light on promising avenues for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyu Chen, Vansh Bansal, James G. Scott</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural posterior estimation (NPE), a simulation-based computational approach for Bayesian inference, has shown great success in approximating complex posterior distributions. Existing NPE methods typically rely on normalizing flows, which approximate a distribution by composing many simple, invertible transformations. But flow-based models, while state of the art for NPE, are known to suffer from several limitations, including training instability and sharp trade-offs between representational power and computational cost. In this work, we demonstrate the effectiveness of conditional diffusions coupled with high-capacity summary networks for amortized NPE. Conditional diffusions address many of the challenges faced by flow-based methods. Our results show that, across a highly varied suite of benchmarking problems for NPE architectures, diffusions offer improved stability, superior accuracy, and faster training times, even with simpler, shallower models. Building on prior work on diffusions for NPE, we show that these gains persist across a variety of different summary network architectures.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Brendan Leigh Ross, Hamidreza Kamkari, Tongzi Wu, Rasa Hosseinzadeh, Zhaoyan Liu, George Stein, Jesse C. Cresswell, Gabriel Loaiza-Ganem</p>
<p>Abstract: As deep generative models have progressed, recent work has shown them to be capable of memorizing and reproducing training datapoints when deployed. These findings call into question the usability of generative models, especially in light of the legal and privacy risks brought about by memorization. To better understand this phenomenon, we propose the manifold memorization hypothesis (MMH), a geometric framework which leverages the manifold hypothesis into a clear language in which to reason about memorization. We propose to analyze memorization in terms of the relationship between the dimensionalities of (i) the ground truth data manifold and (ii) the manifold learned by the model. This framework provides a formal standard for "how memorized" a datapoint is and systematically categorizes memorized data into two types: memorization driven by overfitting and memorization driven by the underlying data distribution. By analyzing prior work in the context of the MMH, we explain and unify assorted observations in the literature. We empirically validate the MMH using synthetic data and image datasets up to the scale of Stable Diffusion, developing new tools for detecting and preventing generation of memorized samples in the process.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ya\c{s}ar Utku Al\c{c}alar, Merve G\"ulle, Mehmet Ak\c{c}akaya</p>
<p>Abstract: Physics-driven deep learning (PD-DL) approaches have become popular for improved reconstruction of fast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Though PD-DL offers higher acceleration rates than existing clinical fast MRI techniques, their use has been limited outside specialized MRI centers. A key challenge is generalization to underrepresented pathologies or populations, noted in multiple studies, with fine-tuning on target populations suggested for improvement. However, current approaches for PD-DL training require access to raw k-space measurements, which is typically only available at specialized MRI centers that have research agreements for such data access. This is especially an issue for rural and underserved areas, where commercial MRI scanners only provide access to a final reconstructed image. To tackle these challenges, we propose Compressibility-inspired Unsupervised Learning via Parallel Imaging Fidelity (CUPID) for high-quality PD-DL training using only routine clinical reconstructed images exported from an MRI scanner. CUPID evaluates output quality with a compressibility-based approach while ensuring that the output stays consistent with the clinical parallel imaging reconstruction through well-designed perturbations. Our results show CUPID achieves similar quality to established PD-DL training that requires k-space data while outperforming compressed sensing (CS) and diffusion-based generative methods. We further demonstrate its effectiveness in a zero-shot training setup for retrospectively and prospectively sub-sampled acquisitions, attesting to its minimal training burden. As an approach that radically deviates from existing strategies, CUPID presents an opportunity to provide equitable access to fast MRI for underserved populations in an attempt to reduce the inequalities associated with this expensive imaging modality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dingyuan Shi, Yong Wang, Hangyu Li, Xiangxiang Chu</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable success in text-to-image generation, making preference alignment for these models increasingly important. The preference labels are typically available only at the terminal of denoising trajectories, which poses challenges in optimizing the intermediate denoising steps. In this paper, we propose to conduct Denoised Distribution Estimation (DDE) that explicitly connects intermediate steps to the terminal denoised distribution. Therefore, preference labels can be used for the entire trajectory optimization. To this end, we design two estimation strategies for our DDE. The first is stepwise estimation, which utilizes the conditional denoised distribution to estimate the model denoised distribution. The second is single-shot estimation, which converts the model output into the terminal denoised distribution via DDIM modeling. Analytically and empirically, we reveal that DDE equipped with two estimation strategies naturally derives a novel credit assignment scheme that prioritizes optimizing the middle part of the denoising trajectory. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance, both quantitatively and qualitatively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahao Cui, Hui Li, Yun Zhan, Hanlin Shang, Kaihui Cheng, Yuqi Ma, Shan Mu, Hang Zhou, Jingdong Wang, Siyu Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing methodologies for animating portrait images face significant challenges, particularly in handling non-frontal perspectives, rendering dynamic objects around the portrait, and generating immersive, realistic backgrounds. In this paper, we introduce the first application of a pretrained transformer-based video generative model that demonstrates strong generalization capabilities and generates highly dynamic, realistic videos for portrait animation, effectively addressing these challenges. The adoption of a new video backbone model makes previous U-Net-based methods for identity maintenance, audio conditioning, and video extrapolation inapplicable. To address this limitation, we design an identity reference network consisting of a causal 3D VAE combined with a stacked series of transformer layers, ensuring consistent facial identity across video sequences. Additionally, we investigate various speech audio conditioning and motion frame mechanisms to enable the generation of continuous video driven by speech audio. Our method is validated through experiments on benchmark and newly proposed wild datasets, demonstrating substantial improvements over prior methods in generating realistic portraits characterized by diverse orientations within dynamic and immersive scenes.

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04653">Hidden in the Noise: Two-Stage Robust Watermarking for Images</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Kasra Arabi, Benjamin Feuer, R. Teal Witter, Chinmay Hegde, Niv Cohen</p>
<p>Abstract: As the quality of image generators continues to improve, deepfakes become a topic of considerable societal debate. Image watermarking allows responsible model owners to detect and label their AI-generated content, which can mitigate the harm. Yet, current state-of-the-art methods in image watermarking remain vulnerable to forgery and removal attacks. This vulnerability occurs in part because watermarks distort the distribution of generated images, unintentionally revealing information about the watermarking techniques.
  In this work, we first demonstrate a distortion-free watermarking method for images, based on a diffusion model's initial noise. However, detecting the watermark requires comparing the initial noise reconstructed for an image to all previously used initial noises. To mitigate these issues, we propose a two-stage watermarking framework for efficient detection. During generation, we augment the initial noise with generated Fourier patterns to embed information about the group of initial noises we used. For detection, we (i) retrieve the relevant group of noises, and (ii) search within the given group for an initial noise that might match our image. This watermarking approach achieves state-of-the-art robustness to forgery and removal against a large battery of attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangyu Han, Zhen Jia, Boyi Li, Yan Wang, Boris Ivanovic, Yurong You, Lingjie Liu, Yue Wang, Marco Pavone, Chen Feng, Yiming Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Photorealistic simulators are essential for the training and evaluation of vision-centric autonomous vehicles (AVs). At their core is Novel View Synthesis (NVS), a crucial capability that generates diverse unseen viewpoints to accommodate the broad and continuous pose distribution of AVs. Recent advances in radiance fields, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting, achieve photorealistic rendering at real-time speeds and have been widely used in modeling large-scale driving scenes. However, their performance is commonly evaluated using an interpolated setup with highly correlated training and test views. In contrast, extrapolation, where test views largely deviate from training views, remains underexplored, limiting progress in generalizable simulation technology. To address this gap, we leverage publicly available AV datasets with multiple traversals, multiple vehicles, and multiple cameras to build the first Extrapolated Urban View Synthesis (EUVS) benchmark. Meanwhile, we conduct both quantitative and qualitative evaluations of state-of-the-art NVS methods across different evaluation settings. Our results show that current NVS methods are prone to overfitting to training views. Besides, incorporating diffusion priors and improving geometry cannot fundamentally improve NVS under large view changes, highlighting the need for more robust approaches and large-scale training. We will release the data to help advance self-driving and urban robotics simulation technology.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jordan Lekeufack, Michael I. Jordan</p>
<p>Abstract: We study Online Convex Optimization (OCO) with adversarial constraints, where an online algorithm must make sequential decisions to minimize both convex loss functions and cumulative constraint violations. We focus on a setting where the algorithm has access to predictions of the loss and constraint functions. Our results show that we can improve the current best bounds of $ O(\sqrt{T}) $ regret and $ \tilde{O}(\sqrt{T}) $ cumulative constraint violations to $ O(\sqrt{E_T(f)}) $ and $ \tilde{O}(\sqrt{E_T(g^+)}) $, respectively, where $ E_T(f) $ and $E_T(g^+)$ represent the cumulative prediction errors of the loss and constraint functions. In the worst case, where $E_T(f) = O(T) $ and $ E_T(g^+) = O(T) $ (assuming bounded gradients of the loss and constraint functions), our rates match the prior $ O(\sqrt{T}) $ results. However, when the loss and constraint predictions are accurate, our approach yields significantly smaller regret and cumulative constraint violations. Finally, we apply this to the setting of adversarial contextual bandits with sequential risk constraints, obtaining optimistic bounds $O (\sqrt{E_T(f)} T^{1/3})$ regret and $O(\sqrt{E_T(g^+)} T^{1/3})$ constraints violation, yielding better performance than existing results when prediction quality is sufficiently high.</p>

<p>Abstract: Integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare diagnosis demands systematic frameworks that can handle complex medical scenarios while maintaining specialized expertise. We present KG4Diagnosis, a novel hierarchical multi-agent framework that combines LLMs with automated knowledge graph construction, encompassing 362 common diseases across medical specialties. Our framework mirrors real-world medical systems through a two-tier architecture: a general practitioner (GP) agent for initial assessment and triage, coordinating with specialized agents for in-depth diagnosis in specific domains. The core innovation lies in our end-to-end knowledge graph generation methodology, incorporating: (1) semantic-driven entity and relation extraction optimized for medical terminology, (2) multi-dimensional decision relationship reconstruction from unstructured medical texts, and (3) human-guided reasoning for knowledge expansion. KG4Diagnosis serves as an extensible foundation for specialized medical diagnosis systems, with capabilities to incorporate new diseases and medical knowledge. The framework's modular design enables seamless integration of domain-specific enhancements, making it valuable for developing targeted medical diagnosis systems.

<p>Abstract: The enhancement of generalization in robots by large vision-language models (LVLMs) is increasingly evident. Therefore, the embodied cognitive abilities of LVLMs based on egocentric videos are of great interest. However, current datasets for embodied video question answering lack comprehensive and systematic evaluation frameworks. Critical embodied cognitive issues, such as robotic self-cognition, dynamic scene perception, and hallucination, are rarely addressed. To tackle these challenges, we propose ECBench, a high-quality benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the embodied cognitive abilities of LVLMs. ECBench features a diverse range of scene video sources, open and varied question formats, and 30 dimensions of embodied cognition. To ensure quality, balance, and high visual dependence, ECBench uses class-independent meticulous human annotation and multi-round question screening strategies. Additionally, we introduce ECEval, a comprehensive evaluation system that ensures the fairness and rationality of the indicators. Utilizing ECBench, we conduct extensive evaluations of proprietary, open-source, and task-specific LVLMs. ECBench is pivotal in advancing the embodied cognitive capabilities of LVLMs, laying a solid foundation for developing reliable core models for embodied agents.

<p>Abstract: Procedural Content Generation (PCG) is widely used to create scalable and diverse environments in games. However, existing methods, such as the Wave Function Collapse (WFC) algorithm, are often limited to static scenarios and lack the adaptability required for dynamic, narrative-driven applications, particularly in augmented reality (AR) games. This paper presents a reinforcement learning-enhanced WFC framework designed for mobile AR environments. By integrating environment-specific rules and dynamic tile weight adjustments informed by reinforcement learning (RL), the proposed method generates maps that are both contextually coherent and responsive to gameplay needs. Comparative evaluations and user studies demonstrate that the framework achieves superior map quality and delivers immersive experiences, making it well-suited for narrative-driven AR games. Additionally, the method holds promise for broader applications in education, simulation training, and immersive extended reality (XR) experiences, where dynamic and adaptive environments are critical.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jae Yong Lee, Sungmin Kang, Shin Yoo</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are machine learning models that have seen widespread adoption due to their capability of handling previously difficult tasks. LLMs, due to their training, are sensitive to how exactly a question is presented, also known as prompting. However, prompting well is challenging, as it has been difficult to uncover principles behind prompting -- generally, trial-and-error is the most common way of improving prompts, despite its significant computational cost. In this context, we argue it would be useful to perform `predictive prompt analysis', in which an automated technique would perform a quick analysis of a prompt and predict how the LLM would react to it, relative to a goal provided by the user. As a demonstration of the concept, we present Syntactic Prevalence Analyzer (SPA), a predictive prompt analysis approach based on sparse autoencoders (SAEs). SPA accurately predicted how often an LLM would generate target syntactic structures during code synthesis, with up to 0.994 Pearson correlation between the predicted and actual prevalence of the target structure. At the same time, SPA requires only 0.4\% of the time it takes to run the LLM on a benchmark. As LLMs are increasingly used during and integrated into modern software development, our proposed predictive prompt analysis concept has the potential to significantly ease the use of LLMs for both practitioners and researchers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shubham Malhotra, Fnu Yashu, Muhammad Saqib, Dipkumar Mehta, Jagdish Jangid, Sachin Dixit</p>
<p>Abstract: This report investigates the application of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms for dynamic resource allocation in wireless communication systems. An environment that includes a base station, multiple antennas, and user equipment is created. Using the RLlib library, various DRL algorithms such as Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) are then applied. These algorithms are compared based on their ability to optimize resource allocation, focusing on the impact of different learning rates and scheduling policies. The findings demonstrate that the choice of algorithm and learning rate significantly influences system performance, with DRL providing more efficient resource allocation compared to traditional methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiyoon Kim, Kang Eun Jeon, Yulhwa Kim, Jong Hwan Ko</p>
<p>Abstract: Compute-in-memory (CIM) is an efficient method for implementing deep neural networks (DNNs) but suffers from substantial overhead from analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), especially as ADC precision increases. Low-precision ADCs can reduce this overhead but introduce partial-sum quantization errors degrading accuracy. Additionally, low-bit weight constraints, imposed by cell limitations and the need for multiple cells for higher-bit weights, present further challenges. While fine-grained partial-sum quantization has been studied to lower ADC resolution effectively, weight granularity, which limits overall partial-sum quantized accuracy, remains underexplored. This work addresses these challenges by aligning weight and partial-sum quantization granularities at the column-wise level. Our method improves accuracy while maintaining dequantization overhead, simplifies training by removing two-stage processes, and ensures robustness to memory cell variations via independent column-wise scale factors. We also propose an open-source CIM-oriented convolution framework to handle fine-grained weights and partial-sums efficiently, incorporating a novel tiling method and group convolution. Experimental results on ResNet-20 (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100) and ResNet-18 (ImageNet) show accuracy improvements of 0.99%, 2.69%, and 1.01%, respectively, compared to the best-performing related works. Additionally, variation analysis reveals the robustness of our method against memory cell variations. These findings highlight the effectiveness of our quantization scheme in enhancing accuracy and robustness while maintaining hardware efficiency in CIM-based DNN implementations.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ivan Skorokhodov, Sharath Girish, Benran Hu, Willi Menapace, Yanyu Li, Rameen Abdal, Sergey Tulyakov, Aliaksandr Siarohin</p>
<p>Abstract: Latent diffusion models have emerged as the leading approach for generating high-quality images and videos, utilizing compressed latent representations to reduce the computational burden of the diffusion process. While recent advancements have primarily focused on scaling diffusion backbones and improving autoencoder reconstruction quality, the interaction between these components has received comparatively less attention. In this work, we perform a spectral analysis of modern autoencoders and identify inordinate high-frequency components in their latent spaces, which are especially pronounced in the autoencoders with a large bottleneck channel size. We hypothesize that this high-frequency component interferes with the coarse-to-fine nature of the diffusion synthesis process and hinders the generation quality. To mitigate the issue, we propose scale equivariance: a simple regularization strategy that aligns latent and RGB spaces across frequencies by enforcing scale equivariance in the decoder. It requires minimal code changes and only up to 20K autoencoder fine-tuning steps, yet significantly improves generation quality, reducing FID by 19% for image generation on ImageNet-1K 256x256 and FVD by at least 44% for video generation on Kinetics-700 17x256x256.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Harsh Gupta, Yuchen Mo, Shengmiao Jin, Wenzhen Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: High-resolution tactile sensors have become critical for embodied perception and robotic manipulation. However, a key challenge in the field is the lack of transferability between sensors due to design and manufacturing variations, which result in significant differences in tactile signals. This limitation hinders the ability to transfer models or knowledge learned from one sensor to another. To address this, we introduce a novel method for extracting Sensor-Invariant Tactile Representations (SITR), enabling zero-shot transfer across optical tactile sensors. Our approach utilizes a transformer-based architecture trained on a diverse dataset of simulated sensor designs, allowing it to generalize to new sensors in the real world with minimal calibration. Experimental results demonstrate the method's effectiveness across various tactile sensing applications, facilitating data and model transferability for future advancements in the field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenyu Li, Zhengjia Zhu, Jiyan He, Xiu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Internal threat detection (IDT) aims to address security threats within organizations or enterprises by identifying potential or already occurring malicious threats within vast amounts of logs. Although organizations or enterprises have dedicated personnel responsible for reviewing these logs, it is impossible to manually examine all logs entirely.In response to the vast number of logs, we propose a system called RedChronos, which is a Large Language Model-Based Log Analysis System. This system incorporates innovative improvements over previous research by employing Query-Aware Weighted Voting and a Semantic Expansion-based Genetic Algorithm with LLM-driven Mutations. On the public datasets CERT 4.2 and 5.2, RedChronos outperforms or matches existing approaches in terms of accuracy, precision, and detection rate. Moreover, RedChronos reduces the need for manual intervention in security log reviews by approximately 90% in the Xiaohongshu Security Operation Center. Therefore, our RedChronos system demonstrates exceptional performance in handling IDT tasks, providing innovative solutions for these challenges. We believe that future research can continue to enhance the system's performance in IDT tasks while also reducing the response time to internal risk events.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present a generic video super-resolution algorithm in this paper, based on the Diffusion Posterior Sampling framework with an unconditional video generation model in latent space. The video generation model, a diffusion transformer, functions as a space-time model. We argue that a powerful model, which learns the physics of the real world, can easily handle various kinds of motion patterns as prior knowledge, thus eliminating the need for explicit estimation of optical flows or motion parameters for pixel alignment. Furthermore, a single instance of the proposed video diffusion transformer model can adapt to different sampling conditions without re-training. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method has strong capabilities to address video super-resolution challenges.</p>

<p>Abstract: There is an increasing imperative to anticipate and understand the performance and safety of generative AI systems in real-world deployment contexts. However, the current evaluation ecosystem is insufficient: Commonly used static benchmarks face validity challenges, and ad hoc case-by-case audits rarely scale. In this piece, we advocate for maturing an evaluation science for generative AI systems. While generative AI creates unique challenges for system safety engineering and measurement science, the field can draw valuable insights from the development of safety evaluation practices in other fields, including transportation, aerospace, and pharmaceutical engineering. In particular, we present three key lessons: Evaluation metrics must be applicable to real-world performance, metrics must be iteratively refined, and evaluation institutions and norms must be established. Applying these insights, we outline a concrete path toward a more rigorous approach for evaluating generative AI systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: We explore how scalable robot data can address real-world challenges for generalized robotic manipulation. Introducing AgiBot World, a large-scale platform comprising over 1 million trajectories across 217 tasks in five deployment scenarios, we achieve an order-of-magnitude increase in data scale compared to existing datasets. Accelerated by a standardized collection pipeline with human-in-the-loop verification, AgiBot World guarantees high-quality and diverse data distribution. It is extensible from grippers to dexterous hands and visuo-tactile sensors for fine-grained skill acquisition. Building on top of data, we introduce Genie Operator-1 (GO-1), a novel generalist policy that leverages latent action representations to maximize data utilization, demonstrating predictable performance scaling with increased data volume. Policies pre-trained on our dataset achieve an average performance improvement of 30% over those trained on Open X-Embodiment, both in in-domain and out-of-distribution scenarios. GO-1 exhibits exceptional capability in real-world dexterous and long-horizon tasks, achieving over 60% success rate on complex tasks and outperforming prior RDT approach by 32%. By open-sourcing the dataset, tools, and models, we aim to democratize access to large-scale, high-quality robot data, advancing the pursuit of scalable and general-purpose intelligence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yusuke Hashimoto, Xue Jia, Hao Li, Takaaki Tomai</p>
<p>Abstract: Materials informatics (MI), which emerges from the integration of materials science and data science, is expected to greatly streamline the material discovery and development. The data used for MI are obtained from both computational and experimental studies, while their integration remains challenging. In our previous study, we reported the integration of these datasets by applying a machine learning model that captures trends hidden in the experimental datasets to compositional data stored in the computational database. In this study, we use the obtained data to construct materials maps, which visualize the relation in the structural features of materials, aiming to support study by the experimental researchers. The map is constructed using the MatDeepLearn (MDL) framework, which implements the graph-based representation of material structures, deep learning, and dimensional reduction for the map construction. We evaluate the obtained materials maps through statistical analysis and found that the MDL using message passing neural network (MPNN) enables efficient extraction of features that reflect the structural complexity of materials. Moreover, we found that this advantage does not necessarily translate into improved accuracy in predicting material properties. We attribute this unexpected outcome to the high learning performance inherent in MPNN, which can contribute to the structuring of data points within the materials map.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sanghyuk Chun, Sangdoo Yun</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, Probabilistic Language-Image Pre-Training (ProLIP) has been proposed to tackle the multiplicity issue of vision-language (VL) tasks. Despite their success in probabilistic representation learning at a scale, the ProLIP models cannot handle long context texts longer than 64 context length, which limits their ability to capture rich contextual information from longer text sequences. To address this issue, this paper proposes a fine-tuning strategy for ProLIP to accept longer texts, e.g., 256 text tokens. Experimental results on Urban-1k and the DataComp evaluation suite show that the proposed LongProLIP recipe can improve understanding of long contexts while minimizing the negative effect of fine-tuning.We also observe a trade-off between the long context understanding (measured by Urban-1k) and general zero-shot capability (measured by evaluation datasets by DataComp).

<p><b>Authors:</b> DongHeun Han, Byungmin Kim, RoUn Lee, KyeongMin Kim, Hyoseok Hwang, HyeongYeop Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: Realistic hand manipulation is a key component of immersive virtual reality (VR), yet existing methods often rely on a kinematic approach or motion-capture datasets that omit crucial physical attributes such as contact forces and finger torques. Consequently, these approaches prioritize tight, one-size-fits-all grips rather than reflecting users' intended force levels. We present ForceGrip, a deep learning agent that synthesizes realistic hand manipulation motions, faithfully reflecting the user's grip force intention. Instead of mimicking predefined motion datasets, ForceGrip uses generated training scenarios-randomizing object shapes, wrist movements, and trigger input flows-to challenge the agent with a broad spectrum of physical interactions. To effectively learn from these complex tasks, we employ a three-phase curriculum learning framework comprising Finger Positioning, Intention Adaptation, and Dynamic Stabilization. This progressive strategy ensures stable hand-object contact, adaptive force control based on user inputs, and robust handling under dynamic conditions. Additionally, a proximity reward function enhances natural finger motions and accelerates training convergence. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations reveal ForceGrip's superior force controllability and plausibility compared to state-of-the-art methods.

<p>Abstract: Progress in Embodied AI has made it possible for end-to-end-trained agents to navigate in photo-realistic environments with high-level reasoning and zero-shot or language-conditioned behavior, but benchmarks are still dominated by simulation. In this work, we focus on the fine-grained behavior of fast-moving real robots and present a large-scale experimental study involving \numepisodes{} navigation episodes in a real environment with a physical robot, where we analyze the type of reasoning emerging from end-to-end training. In particular, we study the presence of realistic dynamics which the agent learned for open-loop forecasting, and their interplay with sensing. We analyze the way the agent uses latent memory to hold elements of the scene structure and information gathered during exploration. We probe the planning capabilities of the agent, and find in its memory evidence for somewhat precise plans over a limited horizon. Furthermore, we show in a post-hoc analysis that the value function learned by the agent relates to long-term planning. Put together, our experiments paint a new picture on how using tools from computer vision and sequential decision making have led to new capabilities in robotics and control.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Iv\'an Arcuschin, Jett Janiak, Robert Krzyzanowski, Senthooran Rajamanoharan, Neel Nanda, Arthur Conmy</p>
<p>Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has significantly advanced state-of-the-art AI capabilities. However, recent studies have shown that CoT reasoning is not always faithful, i.e. CoT reasoning does not always reflect how models arrive at conclusions. So far, most of these studies have focused on unfaithfulness in unnatural contexts where an explicit bias has been introduced. In contrast, we show that unfaithful CoT can occur on realistic prompts with no artificial bias. Our results reveal non-negligible rates of several forms of unfaithful reasoning in frontier models: Sonnet 3.7 (16.3%), DeepSeek R1 (5.3%) and ChatGPT-4o (7.0%) all answer a notable proportion of question pairs unfaithfully. Specifically, we find that models rationalize their implicit biases in answers to binary questions ("implicit post-hoc rationalization"). For example, when separately presented with the questions "Is X bigger than Y?" and "Is Y bigger than X?", models sometimes produce superficially coherent arguments to justify answering Yes to both questions or No to both questions, despite such responses being logically contradictory. We also investigate restoration errors (Dziri et al., 2023), where models make and then silently correct errors in their reasoning, and unfaithful shortcuts, where models use clearly illogical reasoning to simplify solving problems in Putnam questions (a hard benchmark). Our findings raise challenges for AI safety work that relies on monitoring CoT to detect undesired behavior.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marvin Heidinger, Snehal Jauhri, Vignesh Prasad, Georgia Chalvatzaki</p>
<p>Abstract: When interacting with objects, humans effectively reason about which regions of objects are viable for an intended action, i.e., the affordance regions of the object. They can also account for subtle differences in object regions based on the task to be performed and whether one or two hands need to be used. However, current vision-based affordance prediction methods often reduce the problem to naive object part segmentation. In this work, we propose a framework for extracting affordance data from human activity video datasets. Our extracted 2HANDS dataset contains precise object affordance region segmentations and affordance class-labels as narrations of the activity performed. The data also accounts for bimanual actions, i.e., two hands co-ordinating and interacting with one or more objects. We present a VLM-based affordance prediction model, 2HandedAfforder, trained on the dataset and demonstrate superior performance over baselines in affordance region segmentation for various activities. Finally, we show that our predicted affordance regions are actionable, i.e., can be used by an agent performing a task, through demonstration in robotic manipulation scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiwei Chen, Amir Aghabiglou, Shijie Chen, Motahare Torki, Chao Tang, Ruud B. van Heeswijk, Yves Wiaux</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce the R2D2 Deep Neural Network (DNN) series paradigm for fast and scalable image reconstruction from highly-accelerated non-Cartesian k-space acquisitions in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). While unrolled DNN architectures provide a robust image formation approach via data-consistency layers, embedding non-uniform fast Fourier transform operators in a DNN can become impractical to train at large scale, e.g in 2D MRI with a large number of coils, or for higher-dimensional imaging. Plug-and-play approaches that alternate a learned denoiser blind to the measurement setting with a data-consistency step are not affected by this limitation but their highly iterative nature implies slow reconstruction. To address this scalability challenge, we leverage the R2D2 paradigm that was recently introduced to enable ultra-fast reconstruction for large-scale Fourier imaging in radio astronomy. R2D2's reconstruction is formed as a series of residual images iteratively estimated as outputs of DNN modules taking the previous iteration's data residual as input. The method can be interpreted as a learned version of the Matching Pursuit algorithm. A series of R2D2 DNN modules were sequentially trained in a supervised manner on the fastMRI dataset and validated for 2D multi-coil MRI in simulation and on real data, targeting highly under-sampled radial k-space sampling. Results suggest that a series with only few DNNs achieves superior reconstruction quality over its unrolled incarnation R2D2-Net (whose training is also much less scalable), and over the state-of-the-art diffusion-based "Decomposed Diffusion Sampler" approach (also characterised by a slower reconstruction process).</p>
