<p><b>Authors:</b> Nam Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: In lossy compression, the classical tradeoff between compression rate and reconstruction distortion has traditionally guided algorithm design. However, Blau and Michaeli [5] introduced a generalized framework, known as the rate-distortion-perception (RDP) function, incorporating perceptual quality as an additional dimension of evaluation. More recently, the rate-distortion-classification (RDC) function was investigated in [19], evaluating compression performance by considering classification accuracy alongside distortion. In this paper, we explore universal representations, where a single encoder is developed to achieve multiple decoding objectives across various distortion and classification (or perception) constraints. This universality avoids retraining encoders for each specific operating point within these tradeoffs. Our experimental validation on the MNIST dataset indicates that a universal encoder incurs only minimal performance degradation compared to individually optimized encoders for perceptual image compression tasks, aligning with prior results from [23]. Nonetheless, we also identify that in the RDC setting, reusing an encoder optimized for one specific classification-distortion tradeoff leads to a significant distortion penalty when applied to alternative points.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haomin Zuo, Zhengyang Li, Jiangchuan Gong, Zhen Tian</p>
<p>Abstract: As urbanization speeds up and traffic flow increases, the issue of pavement distress is becoming increasingly pronounced, posing a severe threat to road safety and service life. Traditional methods of pothole detection rely on manual inspection, which is not only inefficient but also costly. This paper proposes an intelligent road crack detection and analysis system, based on the enhanced YOLOv8 deep learning framework. A target segmentation model has been developed through the training of 4029 images, capable of efficiently and accurately recognizing and segmenting crack regions in roads. The model also analyzes the segmented regions to precisely calculate the maximum and minimum widths of cracks and their exact locations. Experimental results indicate that the incorporation of ECA and CBAM attention mechanisms substantially enhances the model's detection accuracy and efficiency, offering a novel solution for road maintenance and safety monitoring.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Subin Kim, Hoonrae Kim, Jihyun Lee, Yejin Jeon, Gary Geunbae Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies have explored the use of large language models (LLMs) in psychotherapy; however, text-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) models often struggle with client resistance, which can weaken therapeutic alliance. To address this, we propose a multimodal approach that incorporates nonverbal cues, allowing the AI therapist to better align its responses with the client's negative emotional state. Specifically, we introduce a new synthetic dataset, Multimodal Interactive Rolling with Resistance (Mirror), which is a novel synthetic dataset that pairs client statements with corresponding facial images. Using this dataset, we train baseline Vision-Language Models (VLMs) that can analyze facial cues, infer emotions, and generate empathetic responses to effectively manage resistance. They are then evaluated in terms of both the therapist's counseling skills and the strength of the therapeutic alliance in the presence of client resistance. Our results demonstrate that Mirror significantly enhances the AI therapist's ability to handle resistance, which outperforms existing text-based CBT approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrew Kiruluta</p>
<p>Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are powerful generative models capable of learning compact latent representations. However, conventional VAEs often generate relatively blurry images due to their assumption of an isotropic Gaussian latent space and constraints in capturing high-frequency details. In this paper, we explore a novel wavelet-based approach (Wavelet-VAE) in which the latent space is constructed using multi-scale Haar wavelet coefficients. We propose a comprehensive method to encode the image features into multi-scale detail and approximation coefficients and introduce a learnable noise parameter to maintain stochasticity. We thoroughly discuss how to reformulate the reparameterization trick, address the KL divergence term, and integrate wavelet sparsity principles into the training objective. Our experimental evaluation on CIFAR-10 and other high-resolution datasets demonstrates that the Wavelet-VAE improves visual fidelity and recovers higher-resolution details compared to conventional VAEs. We conclude with a discussion of advantages, potential limitations, and future research directions for wavelet-based generative modeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ummay Maria Muna, Md. Mehedi Hasan Shawon, Md Jobayer, Sumaiya Akter, Saifur Rahman Sabuj</p>
<p>Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) in electroencephalography (EEG)-based motor imagery classification offer promising solutions in neurorehabilitation and assistive technologies by enabling communication between the brain and external devices. However, the non-stationary nature of EEG signals and significant inter-subject variability cause substantial challenges for developing robust cross-subject classification models. This paper introduces a novel Spatial-Spectral-Temporal Attention Fusion (SSTAF) Transformer specifically designed for upper-limb motor imagery classification. Our architecture consists of a spectral transformer and a spatial transformer, followed by a transformer block and a classifier network. Each module is integrated with attention mechanisms that dynamically attend to the most discriminative patterns across multiple domains, such as spectral frequencies, spatial electrode locations, and temporal dynamics. The short-time Fourier transform is incorporated to extract features in the time-frequency domain to make it easier for the model to obtain a better feature distinction. We evaluated our SSTAF Transformer model on two publicly available datasets, the EEGMMIDB dataset, and BCI Competition IV-2a. SSTAF Transformer achieves an accuracy of 76.83% and 68.30% in the data sets, respectively, outperforms traditional CNN-based architectures and a few existing transformer-based approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fuwei Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating multi-subject stylized images remains a significant challenge due to the ambiguity in defining style attributes (e.g., color, texture, atmosphere, and structure) and the difficulty in consistently applying them across multiple subjects. Although recent diffusion-based text-to-image models have achieved remarkable progress, existing methods typically rely on computationally expensive inversion procedures or large-scale stylized datasets. Moreover, these methods often struggle with maintaining multi-subject semantic fidelity and are limited by high inference costs. To address these limitations, we propose ICAS (IP-Adapter and ControlNet-based Attention Structure), a novel framework for efficient and controllable multi-subject style transfer. Instead of full-model tuning, ICAS adaptively fine-tunes only the content injection branch of a pre-trained diffusion model, thereby preserving identity-specific semantics while enhancing style controllability. By combining IP-Adapter for adaptive style injection with ControlNet for structural conditioning, our framework ensures faithful global layout preservation alongside accurate local style synthesis. Furthermore, ICAS introduces a cyclic multi-subject content embedding mechanism, which enables effective style transfer under limited-data settings without the need for extensive stylized corpora. Extensive experiments show that ICAS achieves superior performance in structure preservation, style consistency, and inference efficiency, establishing a new paradigm for multi-subject style transfer in real-world applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Rapid information access is vital during wildfires, yet traditional data sources are slow and costly. Social media offers real-time updates, but extracting relevant insights remains a challenge. We present WildFireCan-MMD, a new multimodal dataset of X posts from recent Canadian wildfires, annotated across 13 key themes. Evaluating both Vision Language Models and custom-trained classifiers, we show that while zero-shot prompting offers quick deployment, even simple trained models outperform them when labelled data is available, by up to 23%. Our findings highlight the enduring importance of tailored datasets and task-specific training. Importantly, such datasets should be localized, as disaster response requirements vary across regions and contexts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Ahmad, Manuel Mazzara, Salvatore Distefano, Adil Mehmood Khan</p>
<p>Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification remains a challenging task due to the intricate spatial-spectral correlations. Existing transformer models excel in capturing long-range dependencies but often suffer from information redundancy and attention inefficiencies, limiting their ability to model fine-grained relationships crucial for HSI classification. To overcome these limitations, this work proposes MemFormer, a lightweight and memory-enhanced transformer. MemFormer introduces a memory-enhanced multi-head attention mechanism that iteratively refines a dynamic memory module, enhancing feature extraction while reducing redundancy across layers. Additionally, a dynamic memory enrichment strategy progressively captures complex spatial and spectral dependencies, leading to more expressive feature representations. To further improve structural consistency, we incorporate a spatial-spectral positional encoding (SSPE) tailored for HSI data, ensuring continuity without the computational burden of convolution-based approaches. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that MemFormer achieves superior classification accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: The ability to interpret and explain complex information from visual data in charts is crucial for data-driven decision-making. In this work, we address the challenge of providing explanations alongside answering questions about chart images. We present ChartQA-X, a comprehensive dataset comprising various chart types with 28,299 contextually relevant questions, answers, and detailed explanations. These explanations are generated by prompting six different models and selecting the best responses based on metrics such as faithfulness, informativeness, coherence, and perplexity. Our experiments show that models fine-tuned on our dataset for explanation generation achieve superior performance across various metrics and demonstrate improved accuracy in question-answering tasks on new datasets. By integrating answers with explanatory narratives, our approach enhances the ability of intelligent agents to convey complex information effectively, improve user understanding, and foster trust in the generated responses.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13282">LIFT+: Lightweight Fine-Tuning for Long-Tail Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiang-Xin Shi, Tong Wei, Yu-Feng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The fine-tuning paradigm has emerged as a prominent approach for addressing long-tail learning tasks in the era of foundation models. However, the impact of fine-tuning strategies on long-tail learning performance remains unexplored. In this work, we disclose that existing paradigms exhibit a profound misuse of fine-tuning methods, leaving significant room for improvement in both efficiency and accuracy. Specifically, we reveal that heavy fine-tuning (fine-tuning a large proportion of model parameters) can lead to non-negligible performance deterioration on tail classes, whereas lightweight fine-tuning demonstrates superior effectiveness. Through comprehensive theoretical and empirical validation, we identify this phenomenon as stemming from inconsistent class conditional distributions induced by heavy fine-tuning. Building on this insight, we propose LIFT+, an innovative lightweight fine-tuning framework to optimize consistent class conditions. Furthermore, LIFT+ incorporates semantic-aware initialization, minimalist data augmentation, and test-time ensembling to enhance adaptation and generalization of foundation models. Our framework provides an efficient and accurate pipeline that facilitates fast convergence and model compactness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LIFT+ significantly reduces both training epochs (from $\sim$100 to $\leq$15) and learned parameters (less than 1%), while surpassing state-of-the-art approaches by a considerable margin.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andreas Lau Hansen, Lukas Wanzeck, Dim P. Papadopoulos</p>
<p>Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection is an essential task in computer vision, and it has several applications in robotics and virtual reality. However, 3D object detectors are typically trained in a fully supervised way, relying extensively on 3D labeled data, which is labor-intensive and costly to annotate. This work focuses on weakly-supervised 3D detection to reduce data needs using a monocular method that leverages a singlecamera system over expensive LiDAR sensors or multi-camera setups. We propose a general model Weak Cube R-CNN, which can predict objects in 3D at inference time, requiring only 2D box annotations for training by exploiting the relationship between 2D projections of 3D cubes. Our proposed method utilizes pre-trained frozen foundation 2D models to estimate depth and orientation information on a training set. We use these estimated values as pseudo-ground truths during training. We design loss functions that avoid 3D labels by incorporating information from the external models into the loss. In this way, we aim to implicitly transfer knowledge from these large foundation 2D models without having access to 3D bounding box annotations. Experimental results on the SUN RGB-D dataset show increased performance in accuracy compared to an annotation time equalized Cube R-CNN baseline. While not precise for centimetre-level measurements, this method provides a strong foundation for further research.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13310">SAR Object Detection with Self-Supervised Pretraining and Curriculum-Aware Sampling</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yasin Almalioglu, Andrzej Kucik, Geoffrey French, Dafni Antotsiou, Alexander Adam, Cedric Archambeau</p>
<p>Abstract: Object detection in satellite-borne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery holds immense potential in tasks such as urban monitoring and disaster response. However, the inherent complexities of SAR data and the scarcity of annotations present significant challenges in the advancement of object detection in this domain. Notably, the detection of small objects in satellite-borne SAR images poses a particularly intricate problem, because of the technology's relatively low spatial resolution and inherent noise. Furthermore, the lack of large labelled SAR datasets hinders the development of supervised deep learning-based object detection models. In this paper, we introduce TRANSAR, a novel self-supervised end-to-end vision transformer-based SAR object detection model that incorporates masked image pre-training on an unlabeled SAR image dataset that spans more than $25,700$ km\textsuperscript{2} ground area. Unlike traditional object detection formulation, our approach capitalises on auxiliary binary semantic segmentation, designed to segregate objects of interest during the post-tuning, especially the smaller ones, from the background. In addition, to address the innate class imbalance due to the disproportion of the object to the image size, we introduce an adaptive sampling scheduler that dynamically adjusts the target class distribution during training based on curriculum learning and model feedback. This approach allows us to outperform conventional supervised architecture such as DeepLabv3 or UNet, and state-of-the-art self-supervised learning-based arhitectures such as DPT, SegFormer or UperNet, as shown by extensive evaluations on benchmark SAR datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Long Li, Jiajia Li, Dong Chen, Lina Pu, Haibo Yao, Yanbo Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: In modern smart agriculture, object detection plays a crucial role by enabling automation, precision farming, and monitoring of resources. From identifying crop health and pest infestations to optimizing harvesting processes, accurate object detection enhances both productivity and sustainability. However, training object detection models often requires large-scale data collection and raises privacy concerns, particularly when sensitive agricultural data is distributed across farms. To address these challenges, we propose VLLFL, a vision-language model-based lightweight federated learning framework (VLLFL). It harnesses the generalization and context-aware detection capabilities of the vision-language model (VLM) and leverages the privacy-preserving nature of federated learning. By training a compact prompt generator to boost the performance of the VLM deployed across different farms, VLLFL preserves privacy while reducing communication overhead. Experimental results demonstrate that VLLFL achieves 14.53% improvement in the performance of VLM while reducing 99.3% communication overhead. Spanning tasks from identifying a wide variety of fruits to detecting harmful animals in agriculture, the proposed framework offers an efficient, scalable, and privacy-preserving solution specifically tailored to agricultural applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Evans Xu Han, Alice Qian Zhang, Hong Shen, Haiyi Zhu, Paul Pu Liang, Jane Hsieh</p>
<p>Abstract: State-of-the-art visual generative AI tools hold immense potential to assist users in the early ideation stages of creative tasks -- offering the ability to generate (rather than search for) novel and unprecedented (instead of existing) images of considerable quality that also adhere to boundless combinations of user specifications. However, many large-scale text-to-image systems are designed for broad applicability, yielding conventional output that may limit creative exploration. They also employ interaction methods that may be difficult for beginners. Given that creative end users often operate in diverse, context-specific ways that are often unpredictable, more variation and personalization are necessary. We introduce POET, a real-time interactive tool that (1) automatically discovers dimensions of homogeneity in text-to-image generative models, (2) expands these dimensions to diversify the output space of generated images, and (3) learns from user feedback to personalize expansions. An evaluation with 28 users spanning four creative task domains demonstrated POET's ability to generate results with higher perceived diversity and help users reach satisfaction in fewer prompts during creative tasks, thereby prompting them to deliberate and reflect more on a wider range of possible produced results during the co-creative process. Focusing on visual creativity, POET offers a first glimpse of how interaction techniques of future text-to-image generation tools may support and align with more pluralistic values and the needs of end users during the ideation stages of their work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> S M Rayeed, Alyson East, Samuel Stevens, Sydne Record, Charles V Stewart</p>
<p>Abstract: Ground beetles are a highly sensitive and speciose biological indicator, making them vital for monitoring biodiversity. However, they are currently an underutilized resource due to the manual effort required by taxonomic experts to perform challenging species differentiations based on subtle morphological differences, precluding widespread applications. In this paper, we evaluate 12 vision models on taxonomic classification across four diverse, long-tailed datasets spanning over 230 genera and 1769 species, with images ranging from controlled laboratory settings to challenging field-collected (in-situ) photographs. We further explore taxonomic classification in two important real-world contexts: sample efficiency and domain adaptation. Our results show that the Vision and Language Transformer combined with an MLP head is the best performing model, with 97\% accuracy at genus and 94\% at species level. Sample efficiency analysis shows that we can reduce train data requirements by up to 50\% with minimal compromise in performance. The domain adaptation experiments reveal significant challenges when transferring models from lab to in-situ images, highlighting a critical domain gap. Overall, our study lays a foundation for large-scale automated taxonomic classification of beetles, and beyond that, advances sample-efficient learning and cross-domain adaptation for diverse long-tailed ecological datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shashank Shriram, Srinivasa Perisetla, Aryan Keskar, Harsha Krishnaswamy, Tonko Emil Westerhof Bossen, Andreas M{\o}gelmose, Ross Greer</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting anomalous hazards in visual data, particularly in video streams, is a critical challenge in autonomous driving. Existing models often struggle with unpredictable, out-of-label hazards due to their reliance on predefined object categories. In this paper, we propose a multimodal approach that integrates vision-language reasoning with zero-shot object detection to improve hazard identification and explanation. Our pipeline consists of a Vision-Language Model (VLM), a Large Language Model (LLM), in order to detect hazardous objects within a traffic scene. We refine object detection by incorporating OpenAI's CLIP model to match predicted hazards with bounding box annotations, improving localization accuracy. To assess model performance, we create a ground truth dataset by denoising and extending the foundational COOOL (Challenge-of-Out-of-Label) anomaly detection benchmark dataset with complete natural language descriptions for hazard annotations. We define a means of hazard detection and labeling evaluation on the extended dataset using cosine similarity. This evaluation considers the semantic similarity between the predicted hazard description and the annotated ground truth for each video. Additionally, we release a set of tools for structuring and managing large-scale hazard detection datasets. Our findings highlight the strengths and limitations of current vision-language-based approaches, offering insights into future improvements in autonomous hazard detection systems.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vedrana Ivezi\'c, Ashwath Radhachandran, Ekaterina Redekop, Shreeram Athreya, Dongwoo Lee, Vivek Sant, Corey Arnold, William Speier</p>
<p>Abstract: Cytology is essential for cancer diagnostics and screening due to its minimally invasive nature. However, the development of robust deep learning models for digital cytology is challenging due to the heterogeneity in staining and preparation methods of samples, differences across organs, and the limited availability of large, diverse, annotated datasets. Developing a task-specific model for every cytology application is impractical and non-cytology-specific foundation models struggle to generalize to tasks in this domain where the emphasis is on cell morphology. To address these challenges, we introduce CytoFM, the first cytology self-supervised foundation model. Using iBOT, a self-supervised Vision Transformer (ViT) training framework incorporating masked image modeling and self-distillation, we pretrain CytoFM on a diverse collection of cytology datasets to learn robust, transferable representations. We evaluate CytoFM on multiple downstream cytology tasks, including breast cancer classification and cell type identification, using an attention-based multiple instance learning framework. Our results demonstrate that CytoFM performs better on two out of three downstream tasks than existing foundation models pretrained on histopathology (UNI) or natural images (iBOT-Imagenet). Visualizations of learned representations demonstrate our model is able to attend to cytologically relevant features. Despite a small pre-training dataset, CytoFM's promising results highlight the ability of task-agnostic pre-training approaches to learn robust and generalizable features from cytology data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shengqin Jiang, Linfei Li, Haokui Zhang, Qingshan Liu, Amin Beheshti, Jian Yang, Anton van den Hengel, Quan Z. Sheng, Yuankai Qi</p>
<p>Abstract: As the number of individuals in a crowd grows, enumeration-based techniques become increasingly infeasible and their estimates increasingly unreliable. We propose instead an estimation-based version of the problem: we label Rough Crowd Counting that delivers better accuracy on the basis of training data that is easier to acquire. Rough crowd counting requires only rough annotations of the number of targets in an image, instead of the more traditional, and far more expensive, per-target annotations. We propose an approach to the rough crowd counting problem based on CLIP, termed ProgRoCC. Specifically, we introduce a progressive estimation learning strategy that determines the object count through a coarse-to-fine approach. This approach delivers answers quickly, outperforms the state-of-the-art in semi- and weakly-supervised crowd counting. In addition, we design a vision-language matching adapter that optimizes key-value pairs by mining effective matches of two modalities to refine the visual features, thereby improving the final performance. Extensive experimental results on three widely adopted crowd counting datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shimou Ling, Liang Zhang, Jiangwei Zhao, Lili Pan, Hongliang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: LoRA-based continual learning represents a promising avenue for leveraging pre-trained models in downstream continual learning tasks. Recent studies have shown that orthogonal LoRA tuning effectively mitigates forgetting. However, this work unveils that under orthogonal LoRA tuning, the critical parameters for pre-tasks still change notably after learning post-tasks. To address this problem, we directly propose freezing the most critical parameter matrices in the Vision Transformer (ViT) for pre-tasks before learning post-tasks. In addition, building on orthogonal LoRA tuning, we propose orthogonal LoRA composition (LoRAC) based on QR decomposition, which may further enhance the plasticity of our method. Elaborate ablation studies and extensive comparisons demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Our results indicate that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on several well-known continual learning benchmarks. For instance, on the Split CIFAR-100 dataset, our method shows a 6.35\% improvement in accuracy and a 3.24\% reduction in forgetting compared to previous methods.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13412">How Learnable Grids Recover Fine Detail in Low Dimensions: A Neural Tangent Kernel Analysis of Multigrid Parametric Encodings</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Samuel Audia, Soheil Feizi, Matthias Zwicker, Dinesh Manocha</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural networks that map between low dimensional spaces are ubiquitous in computer graphics and scientific computing; however, in their naive implementation, they are unable to learn high frequency information. We present a comprehensive analysis comparing the two most common techniques for mitigating this spectral bias: Fourier feature encodings (FFE) and multigrid parametric encodings (MPE). FFEs are seen as the standard for low dimensional mappings, but MPEs often outperform them and learn representations with higher resolution and finer detail. FFE's roots in the Fourier transform, make it susceptible to aliasing if pushed too far, while MPEs, which use a learned grid structure, have no such limitation. To understand the difference in performance, we use the neural tangent kernel (NTK) to evaluate these encodings through the lens of an analogous kernel regression. By finding a lower bound on the smallest eigenvalue of the NTK, we prove that MPEs improve a network's performance through the structure of their grid and not their learnable embedding. This mechanism is fundamentally different from FFEs, which rely solely on their embedding space to improve performance. Results are empirically validated on a 2D image regression task using images taken from 100 synonym sets of ImageNet and 3D implicit surface regression on objects from the Stanford graphics dataset. Using peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and multiscale structural similarity (MS-SSIM) to evaluate how well fine details are learned, we show that the MPE increases the minimum eigenvalue by 8 orders of magnitude over the baseline and 2 orders of magnitude over the FFE. The increase in spectrum corresponds to a 15 dB (PSNR) / 0.65 (MS-SSIM) increase over baseline and a 12 dB (PSNR) / 0.33 (MS-SSIM) increase over the FFE.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenyu Li, Sidun Liu, Peng Qiao, Yong Dou</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in data-driven geometric multi-view 3D reconstruction foundation models (e.g., DUSt3R) have shown remarkable performance across various 3D vision tasks, facilitated by the release of large-scale, high-quality 3D datasets. However, as we observed, constrained by their matching-based principles, the reconstruction quality of existing models suffers significant degradation in challenging regions with limited matching cues, particularly in weakly textured areas and low-light conditions. To mitigate these limitations, we propose to harness the inherent robustness of monocular geometry estimation to compensate for the inherent shortcomings of matching-based methods. Specifically, we introduce a monocular-guided refinement module that integrates monocular geometric priors into multi-view reconstruction frameworks. This integration substantially enhances the robustness of multi-view reconstruction systems, leading to high-quality feed-forward reconstructions. Comprehensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves substantial improvements in both mutli-view camera pose estimation and point cloud accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qi'ao Xu, Pengfei Wang, Yanjun Li, Tianwen Qian, Xiaoling Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Semi-supervised change detection (SSCD) aims to detect changes between bi-temporal remote sensing images by utilizing limited labeled data and abundant unlabeled data. Existing methods struggle in complex scenarios, exhibiting poor performance when confronted with noisy data. They typically neglect intra-layer multi-scale features while emphasizing inter-layer fusion, harming the integrity of change objects with different scales. In this paper, we propose HSACNet, a Hierarchical Scale-Aware Consistency regularized Network for SSCD. Specifically, we integrate Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2), using its Hiera backbone as the encoder to extract inter-layer multi-scale features and applying adapters for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Moreover, we design a Scale-Aware Differential Attention Module (SADAM) that can precisely capture intra-layer multi-scale change features and suppress noise. Additionally, a dual-augmentation consistency regularization strategy is adopted to effectively utilize the unlabeled data. Extensive experiments across four CD benchmarks demonstrate that our HSACNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, with reduced parameters and computational cost.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chu Chen, Han Zhang, Lok Ming Lui</p>
<p>Abstract: The presence of inhomogeneous media between optical sensors and objects leads to distorted imaging outputs, significantly complicating downstream image-processing tasks. A key challenge in image restoration is the lack of high-quality, paired-label images required for training supervised models. In this paper, we introduce the Circular Quasi-Conformal Deturbulence (CQCD) framework, an unsupervised approach for removing image distortions through a circular architecture. This design ensures that the restored image remains both geometrically accurate and visually faithful while preventing the accumulation of incorrect estimations.The circular restoration process involves both forward and inverse mapping. To ensure the bijectivity of the estimated non-rigid deformations, computational quasi-conformal geometry theories are leveraged to regularize the mapping, enforcing its homeomorphic properties. This guarantees a well-defined transformation that preserves structural integrity and prevents unwanted artifacts. Furthermore, tight-frame blocks are integrated to encode distortion-sensitive features for precise recovery. To validate the performance of our approach, we conduct evaluations on various synthetic and real-world captured images. Experimental results demonstrate that CQCD not only outperforms existing state-of-the-art deturbulence methods in terms of image restoration quality but also provides highly accurate deformation field estimations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cheng Yuan, Yutong Ban</p>
<p>Abstract: Surgical scene segmentation is crucial for robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery understanding. Current approaches face two challenges: (i) static image limitations including ambiguous local feature similarities and fine-grained structural details, and (ii) dynamic video complexities arising from rapid instrument motion and persistent visual occlusions. While existing methods mainly focus on spatial feature extraction, they fundamentally overlook temporal dependencies in surgical video streams. To address this, we present temporal asymmetric feature propagation network, a bidirectional attention architecture enabling cross-frame feature propagation. The proposed method contains a temporal query propagator that integrates multi-directional consistency constraints to enhance frame-specific feature representation, and an aggregated asymmetric feature pyramid module that preserves discriminative features for anatomical structures and surgical instruments. Our framework uniquely enables both temporal guidance and contextual reasoning for surgical scene understanding. Comprehensive evaluations on two public benchmarks show the proposed method outperforms the current SOTA methods by a large margin, with +16.4\% mIoU on EndoVis2018 and +3.3\% mAP on Endoscapes2023. The code will be publicly available after paper acceptance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenyu Yu, Mohd. Yamani Idna Idris, Pei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantitative remote sensing inversion plays a critical role in environmental monitoring, enabling the estimation of key ecological variables such as vegetation indices, canopy structure, and carbon stock. Although vision foundation models have achieved remarkable progress in classification and segmentation tasks, their application to physically interpretable regression remains largely unexplored. Furthermore, the multi-spectral nature and geospatial heterogeneity of remote sensing data pose significant challenges for generalization and transferability. To address these issues, we introduce SatelliteCalculator, the first vision foundation model tailored for quantitative remote sensing inversion. By leveraging physically defined index formulas, we automatically construct a large-scale dataset of over one million paired samples across eight core ecological indicators. The model integrates a frozen Swin Transformer backbone with a prompt-guided architecture, featuring cross-attentive adapters and lightweight task-specific MLP decoders. Experiments on the Open-Canopy benchmark demonstrate that SatelliteCalculator achieves competitive accuracy across all tasks while significantly reducing inference cost. Our results validate the feasibility of applying foundation models to quantitative inversion, and provide a scalable framework for task-adaptive remote sensing estimation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juliette Bertrand, Sophie Giffard-Roisin, James Hollingsworth, Julien Mairal</p>
<p>Abstract: Dense ground displacement measurements are crucial for geological studies but are impractical to collect directly. Traditionally, displacement fields are estimated using patch matching on optical satellite images from different acquisition times. While deep learning-based optical flow models are promising, their adoption in ground deformation analysis is hindered by challenges such as the absence of real ground truth, the need for sub-pixel precision, and temporal variations due to geological or anthropogenic changes. In particular, we identify that deep learning models relying on explicit correlation layers struggle at estimating small displacements in real-world conditions. Instead, we propose a model that employs iterative refinements with explicit warping layers and a correlation-independent backbone, enabling sub-pixel precision. Additionally, a non-convex variant of Total Variation regularization preserves fault-line sharpness while maintaining smoothness elsewhere. Our model significantly outperforms widely used geophysics methods on semi-synthetic benchmarks and generalizes well to challenging real-world scenarios captured by both medium- and high-resolution sensors.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haley M. So, Gordon Wetzstein</p>
<p>Abstract: Inspired by the data-efficient spiking mechanism of neurons in the human eye, event cameras were created to achieve high temporal resolution with minimal power and bandwidth requirements by emitting asynchronous, per-pixel intensity changes rather than conventional fixed-frame rate images. Unlike retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in the human eye, however, which integrate signals from multiple photoreceptors within a receptive field to extract spatio-temporal features, conventional event cameras do not leverage local spatial context when deciding which events to fire. Moreover, the eye contains around 20 different kinds of RGCs operating in parallel, each attuned to different features or conditions. Inspired by this biological design, we introduce Neural Ganglion Sensors, an extension of traditional event cameras that learns task-specific spatio-temporal retinal kernels (i.e., RGC "events"). We evaluate our design on two challenging tasks: video interpolation and optical flow. Our results demonstrate that our biologically inspired sensing improves performance relative to conventional event cameras while reducing overall event bandwidth. These findings highlight the promise of RGC-inspired event sensors for edge devices and other low-power, real-time applications requiring efficient, high-resolution visual streams.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wang Liu, Zhiyu Wang, Xin Guo, Puhong Duan, Xudong Kang, Shutao Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Semantic segmentation of SAR images has garnered significant attention in remote sensing due to the immunity of SAR sensors to cloudy weather and light conditions. Nevertheless, SAR imagery lacks detailed information and is plagued by significant speckle noise, rendering the annotation or segmentation of SAR images a formidable task. Recent efforts have resorted to annotating paired optical-SAR images to generate pseudo-labels through the utilization of an optical image segmentation network. However, these pseudo-labels are laden with noise, leading to suboptimal performance in SAR image segmentation. In this study, we introduce a more precise method for generating pseudo-labels by incorporating semi-supervised learning alongside a novel image resolution alignment augmentation. Furthermore, we introduce a symmetric cross-entropy loss to mitigate the impact of noisy pseudo-labels. Additionally, a bag of training and testing tricks is utilized to generate better land-cover mapping results. Our experiments on the GRSS data fusion contest indicate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which achieves first place.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongwei Ji, Wulian Yun, Mengshi Qi, Huadong Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional temporal action localization (TAL) methods rely on large amounts of detailed annotated data, whereas few-shot TAL reduces this dependence by using only a few training samples to identify unseen action categories. However, existing few-shot TAL methods typically focus solely on video-level information, neglecting textual information, which can provide valuable semantic support for the localization task. Therefore, we propose a new few-shot temporal action localization method by Chain-of-Thought textual reasoning to improve localization performance. Specifically, we design a novel few-shot learning framework that leverages textual semantic information to enhance the model's ability to capture action commonalities and variations, which includes a semantic-aware text-visual alignment module designed to align the query and support videos at different levels. Meanwhile, to better express the temporal dependencies and causal relationships between actions at the textual level to assist action localization, we design a Chain of Thought (CoT)-like reasoning method that progressively guides the Vision Language Model (VLM) and Large Language Model (LLM) to generate CoT-like text descriptions for videos. The generated texts can capture more variance of action than visual features. We conduct extensive experiments on the publicly available ActivityNet1.3 and THUMOS14 datasets. We introduce the first dataset named Human-related Anomaly Localization and explore the application of the TAL task in human anomaly detection. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms existing methods in single-instance and multi-instance scenarios.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joowon Kim, Ziseok Lee, Donghyeon Cho, Sanghyun Jo, Yeonsung Jung, Kyungsu Kim, Eunho Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite recent advances in diffusion models, achieving reliable image generation and editing remains challenging due to the inherent diversity induced by stochastic noise in the sampling process. Instruction-guided image editing with diffusion models offers user-friendly capabilities, yet editing failures, such as background distortion, frequently occur. Users often resort to trial and error, adjusting seeds or prompts to achieve satisfactory results, which is inefficient. While seed selection methods exist for Text-to-Image (T2I) generation, they depend on external verifiers, limiting applicability, and evaluating multiple seeds increases computational complexity. To address this, we first establish a multiple-seed-based image editing baseline using background consistency scores, achieving Best-of-N performance without supervision. Building on this, we introduce ELECT (Early-timestep Latent Evaluation for Candidate Selection), a zero-shot framework that selects reliable seeds by estimating background mismatches at early diffusion timesteps, identifying the seed that retains the background while modifying only the foreground. ELECT ranks seed candidates by a background inconsistency score, filtering unsuitable samples early based on background consistency while preserving editability. Beyond standalone seed selection, ELECT integrates into instruction-guided editing pipelines and extends to Multimodal Large-Language Models (MLLMs) for joint seed and prompt selection, further improving results when seed selection alone is insufficient. Experiments show that ELECT reduces computational costs (by 41 percent on average and up to 61 percent) while improving background consistency and instruction adherence, achieving around 40 percent success rates in previously failed cases - without any external supervision or training.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have become the most popular approach for high-quality image generation, but their high computational cost still remains a significant challenge. To address this problem, we propose U-Shape Mamba (USM), a novel diffusion model that leverages Mamba-based layers within a U-Net-like hierarchical structure. By progressively reducing sequence length in the encoder and restoring it in the decoder through Mamba blocks, USM significantly lowers computational overhead while maintaining strong generative capabilities. Experimental results against Zigma, which is currently the most efficient Mamba-based diffusion model, demonstrate that USM achieves one-third the GFlops, requires less memory and is faster, while outperforming Zigma in image quality. Frechet Inception Distance (FID) is improved by 15.3, 0.84 and 2.7 points on AFHQ, CelebAHQ and COCO datasets, respectively. These findings highlight USM as a highly efficient and scalable solution for diffusion-based generative models, making high-quality image synthesis more accessible to the research community while reducing computational costs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Oracle bone inscriptions (OBIs) are the earliest known form of Chinese characters and serve as a valuable resource for research in anthropology and archaeology. However, most excavated fragments are severely degraded due to thousands of years of natural weathering, corrosion, and man-made destruction, making automatic OBI recognition extremely challenging. Previous methods either focus on pixel-level information or utilize vanilla transformers for glyph-based OBI denoising, which leads to tremendous computational overhead. Therefore, this paper proposes a fast attentive denoising framework for oracle bone inscriptions, i.e., OBIFormer. It leverages channel-wise self-attention, glyph extraction, and selective kernel feature fusion to reconstruct denoised images precisely while being computationally efficient. Our OBIFormer achieves state-of-the-art denoising performance for PSNR and SSIM metrics on synthetic and original OBI datasets. Furthermore, comprehensive experiments on a real oracle dataset demonstrate the great potential of our OBIFormer in assisting automatic OBI recognition.

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we explore an open research problem concerning the reconstruction of 3D scenes from images. Recent methods have adopt 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to produce 3D scenes due to its efficient training process. However, these methodologies may generate incomplete 3D scenes or blurred multiviews. This is because of (1) inaccurate 3DGS point initialization and (2) the tendency of 3DGS to flatten 3D Gaussians with the sparse-view input. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework EG-Gaussian, which utilizes epipolar geometry and graph networks for 3D scene reconstruction. Initially, we integrate epipolar geometry into the 3DGS initialization phase to enhance initial 3DGS point construction. Then, we specifically design a graph learning module to refine 3DGS spatial features, in which we incorporate both spatial coordinates and angular relationships among neighboring points. Experiments on indoor and outdoor benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves reconstruction accuracy compared to 3DGS-based methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyang Luo, Linwei Tao, Minjing Dong, Chang Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Model calibration seeks to ensure that models produce confidence scores that accurately reflect the true likelihood of their predictions being correct. However, existing calibration approaches are fundamentally tied to datasets of one-hot labels implicitly assuming full certainty in all the annotations. Such datasets are effective for classification but provides insufficient knowledge of uncertainty for model calibration, necessitating the curation of datasets with numerically rich ground-truth confidence values. However, due to the scarcity of uncertain visual examples, such samples are not easily available as real datasets. In this paper, we introduce calibration-aware data augmentation to create synthetic datasets of diverse samples and their ground-truth uncertainty. Specifically, we present Calibration-aware Semantic Mixing (CSM), a novel framework that generates training samples with mixed class characteristics and annotates them with distinct confidence scores via diffusion models. Based on this framework, we propose calibrated reannotation to tackle the misalignment between the annotated confidence score and the mixing ratio during the diffusion reverse process. Besides, we explore the loss functions that better fit the new data representation paradigm. Experimental results demonstrate that CSM achieves superior calibration compared to the state-of-the-art calibration approaches. Code is available at github.com/E-Galois/CSM.</p>

We propose Image-Aware Prompt Anomaly Segmentation (IAP-AS), which enhances anomaly segmentation by generating dynamic, context-aware prompts using an image tagging model and a large language model (LLM). IAP-AS extracts object attributes from images to generate context-aware prompts, improving adaptability and generalization in dynamic and unstructured industrial environments. In our experiments, IAP-AS improves the F1-max metric by up to 10%, demonstrating superior adaptability and generalization. It provides a scalable solution for anomaly segmentation across industries</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Wu, Yun Zhu, Kaihua Zhang, Jianjun Qian, Jin Xie, Jian Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D scene perception demands a large amount of adverse-weather LiDAR data, yet the cost of LiDAR data collection presents a significant scaling-up challenge. To this end, a series of LiDAR simulators have been proposed. Yet, they can only simulate a single adverse weather with a single physical model, and the fidelity of the generated data is quite limited. This paper presents WeatherGen, the first unified diverse-weather LiDAR data diffusion generation framework, significantly improving fidelity. Specifically, we first design a map-based data producer, which can provide a vast amount of high-quality diverse-weather data for training purposes. Then, we utilize the diffusion-denoising paradigm to construct a diffusion model. Among them, we propose a spider mamba generator to restore the disturbed diverse weather data gradually. The spider mamba models the feature interactions by scanning the LiDAR beam circle or central ray, excellently maintaining the physical structure of the LiDAR data. Subsequently, following the generator to transfer real-world knowledge, we design a latent feature aligner. Afterward, we devise a contrastive learning-based controller, which equips weather control signals with compact semantic knowledge through language supervision, guiding the diffusion model to generate more discriminative data. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the high generation quality of WeatherGen. Through WeatherGen, we construct the mini-weather dataset, promoting the performance of the downstream task under adverse weather conditions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuobin Wei, Zhuang Zhou, Zhengan Lu, Zizhao Yuan, Binghua Su</p>
<p>Abstract: In RGB-D semantic segmentation for indoor scenes, a key challenge is effectively integrating the rich color information from RGB images with the spatial distance information from depth images. However, most existing methods overlook the inherent differences in how RGB and depth images express information. Properly distinguishing the processing of RGB and depth images is essential to fully exploiting their unique and significant characteristics. To address this, we propose a novel heterogeneous dual-branch framework called HDBFormer, specifically designed to handle these modality differences. For RGB images, which contain rich detail, we employ both a basic and detail encoder to extract local and global features. For the simpler depth images, we propose LDFormer, a lightweight hierarchical encoder that efficiently extracts depth features with fewer parameters. Additionally, we introduce the Modality Information Interaction Module (MIIM), which combines transformers with large kernel convolutions to interact global and local information across modalities efficiently. Extensive experiments show that HDBFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on the NYUDepthv2 and SUN-RGBD datasets. The code is available at: https://github.com/Weishuobin/HDBFormer.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuchen Rao, Stefan Ainetter, Sinisa Stekovic, Vincent Lepetit, Friedrich Fraundorfer</p>
<p>Abstract: High-level 3D scene understanding is essential in many applications. However, the challenges of generating accurate 3D annotations make development of deep learning models difficult. We turn to recent advancements in automatic retrieval of synthetic CAD models, and show that data generated by such methods can be used as high-quality ground truth for training supervised deep learning models. More exactly, we employ a pipeline akin to the one previously used to automatically annotate objects in ScanNet scenes with their 9D poses and CAD models. This time, we apply it to the recent ScanNet++ v1 dataset, which previously lacked such annotations. Our findings demonstrate that it is not only possible to train deep learning models on these automatically-obtained annotations but that the resulting models outperform those trained on manually annotated data. We validate this on two distinct tasks: point cloud completion and single-view CAD model retrieval and alignment. Our results underscore the potential of automatic 3D annotations to enhance model performance while significantly reducing annotation costs. To support future research in 3D scene understanding, we will release our annotations, which we call SCANnotate++, along with our trained models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Traditional 3D scene understanding techniques are generally predicated on hand-annotated label sets, but in recent years a new class of open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding techniques has emerged. Despite the success of this paradigm on small scenes, existing approaches cannot scale efficiently to city-scale 3D datasets. In this paper, we present Hierarchical vocab-Agnostic Expert Clustering (HAEC), after the latin word for 'these', a superpoint graph clustering based approach which utilizes a novel mixture of experts graph transformer for its backbone. We administer this highly scalable approach to the first application of open-vocabulary scene understanding on the SensatUrban city-scale dataset. We also demonstrate a synthetic labeling pipeline which is derived entirely from the raw point clouds with no hand-annotation. Our technique can help unlock complex operations on dense urban 3D scenes and open a new path forward in the processing of digital twins.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13593">KAN or MLP? Point Cloud Shows the Way Forward</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yan Shi, Qingdong He, Yijun Liu, Xiaoyu Liu, Jingyong Su</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) have become one of the fundamental architectural component in point cloud analysis due to its effective feature learning mechanism. However, when processing complex geometric structures in point clouds, MLPs' fixed activation functions struggle to efficiently capture local geometric features, while suffering from poor parameter efficiency and high model redundancy. In this paper, we propose PointKAN, which applies Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) to point cloud analysis tasks to investigate their efficacy in hierarchical feature representation. First, we introduce a Geometric Affine Module (GAM) to transform local features, improving the model's robustness to geometric variations. Next, in the Local Feature Processing (LFP), a parallel structure extracts both group-level features and global context, providing a rich representation of both fine details and overall structure. Finally, these features are combined and processed in the Global Feature Processing (GFP). By repeating these operations, the receptive field gradually expands, enabling the model to capture complete geometric information of the point cloud. To overcome the high parameter counts and computational inefficiency of standard KANs, we develop Efficient-KANs in the PointKAN-elite variant, which significantly reduces parameters while maintaining accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that PointKAN outperforms PointMLP on benchmark datasets such as ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN, and ShapeNetPart, with particularly strong performance in Few-shot Learning task. Additionally, PointKAN achieves substantial reductions in parameter counts and computational complexity (FLOPs). This work highlights the potential of KANs-based architectures in 3D vision and opens new avenues for research in point cloud understanding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shanshuai Yuan, Julong Wei, Muer Tie, Xiangyun Ren, Zhongxue Gan, Wenchao Ding</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-based 3D semantic occupancy prediction is critical for autonomous driving, enabling unified modeling of static infrastructure and dynamic agents. In practice, autonomous vehicles may repeatedly traverse identical geographic locations under varying environmental conditions, such as weather fluctuations and illumination changes. Existing methods in 3D occupancy prediction predominantly integrate adjacent temporal contexts. However, these works neglect to leverage perceptual information, which is acquired from historical traversals of identical geographic locations. In this paper, we propose Longterm Memory Prior Occupancy (LMPOcc), the first 3D occupancy prediction methodology that exploits long-term memory priors derived from historical traversal perceptual outputs. We introduce a plug-and-play architecture that integrates long-term memory priors to enhance local perception while simultaneously constructing global occupancy representations. To adaptively aggregate prior features and current features, we develop an efficient lightweight Current-Prior Fusion module. Moreover, we propose a model-agnostic prior format to ensure compatibility across diverse occupancy prediction baselines. LMPOcc achieves state-of-the-art performance validated on the Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark, especially on static semantic categories. Additionally, experimental results demonstrate LMPOcc's ability to construct global occupancy through multi-vehicle crowdsourcing.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13604">FocusTrack: A Self-Adaptive Local Sampling Algorithm for Efficient Anti-UAV Tracking</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ying Wang, Tingfa Xu, Jianan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Anti-UAV tracking poses significant challenges, including small target sizes, abrupt camera motion, and cluttered infrared backgrounds. Existing tracking paradigms can be broadly categorized into global- and local-based methods. Global-based trackers, such as SiamDT, achieve high accuracy by scanning the entire field of view but suffer from excessive computational overhead, limiting real-world deployment. In contrast, local-based methods, including OSTrack and ROMTrack, efficiently restrict the search region but struggle when targets undergo significant displacements due to abrupt camera motion. Through preliminary experiments, it is evident that a local tracker, when paired with adaptive search region adjustment, can significantly enhance tracking accuracy, narrowing the gap between local and global trackers. To address this challenge, we propose FocusTrack, a novel framework that dynamically refines the search region and strengthens feature representations, achieving an optimal balance between computational efficiency and tracking accuracy. Specifically, our Search Region Adjustment (SRA) strategy estimates the target presence probability and adaptively adjusts the field of view, ensuring the target remains within focus. Furthermore, to counteract feature degradation caused by varying search regions, the Attention-to-Mask (ATM) module is proposed. This module integrates hierarchical information, enriching the target representations with fine-grained details. Experimental results demonstrate that FocusTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance, obtaining 67.7% AUC on AntiUAV and 62.8% AUC on AntiUAV410, outperforming the baseline tracker by 8.5% and 9.1% AUC, respectively. In terms of efficiency, FocusTrack surpasses global-based trackers, requiring only 30G MACs and achieving 143 fps with FocusTrack (SRA) and 44 fps with the full version, both enabling real-time tracking.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengxiang Gao, Yihao Liang, Yanzhi Song, Zhouwang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) aims to categorize closely related subclasses, a task complicated by minimal inter-class differences and significant intra-class variance. Existing methods often rely on additional annotations for image classification, overlooking the valuable information embedded in Tree Hierarchies that depict hierarchical label relationships. To leverage this knowledge to improve classification accuracy and consistency, we propose a novel Cross-Hierarchical Bidirectional Consistency Learning (CHBC) framework. The CHBC framework extracts discriminative features across various hierarchies using a specially designed module to decompose and enhance attention masks and features. We employ bidirectional consistency loss to regulate the classification outcomes across different hierarchies, ensuring label prediction consistency and reducing misclassification. Experiments on three widely used FGVC datasets validate the effectiveness of the CHBC framework. Ablation studies further investigate the application strategies of feature enhancement and consistency constraints, underscoring the significant contributions of the proposed modules.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13617">Compile Scene Graphs with Reinforcement Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zuyao Chen, Jinlin Wu, Zhen Lei, Marc Pollefeys, Chang Wen Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Next token prediction is the fundamental principle for training large language models (LLMs), and reinforcement learning (RL) further enhances their reasoning performance. As an effective way to model language, image, video, and other modalities, the use of LLMs for end-to-end extraction of structured visual representations, such as scene graphs, remains underexplored. It requires the model to accurately produce a set of objects and relationship triplets, rather than generating text token by token. To achieve this, we introduce R1-SGG, a multimodal LLM (M-LLM) initially trained via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the scene graph dataset and subsequently refined using reinforcement learning to enhance its ability to generate scene graphs in an end-to-end manner. The SFT follows a conventional prompt-response paradigm, while RL requires the design of effective reward signals. Given the structured nature of scene graphs, we design a graph-centric reward function that integrates node-level rewards, edge-level rewards, and a format consistency reward. Our experiments demonstrate that rule-based RL substantially enhances model performance in the SGG task, achieving a zero failure rate--unlike supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which struggles to generalize effectively.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengzhan Sun, Junbin Xiao, Tze Ho Elden Tse, Yicong Li, Arjun Akula, Angela Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual grounding associates textual descriptions with objects in an image. Conventional methods target third-person image inputs and named object queries. In applications such as AI assistants, the perspective shifts -- inputs are egocentric, and objects may be referred to implicitly through needs and intentions. To bridge this gap, we introduce EgoIntention, the first dataset for egocentric visual intention grounding. EgoIntention challenges multimodal LLMs to 1) understand and ignore unintended contextual objects and 2) reason about uncommon object functionalities. Benchmark results show that current models misidentify context objects and lack affordance understanding in egocentric views. We also propose Reason-to-Ground (RoG) instruction tuning; it enables hybrid training with normal descriptions and egocentric intentions with a chained intention reasoning and object grounding mechanism. RoG significantly outperforms naive finetuning and hybrid training on EgoIntention, while maintaining or slightly improving naive description grounding. This advancement enables unified visual grounding for egocentric and exocentric visual inputs while handling explicit object queries and implicit human intentions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Zhang, Jingyi Cao, Yanan You, Yuanyuan Qiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision Transformer (ViT) has achieved remarkable results in object detection for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, owing to its exceptional ability to extract global features. However, it struggles with the extraction of multi-scale local features, leading to limited performance in detecting small targets, especially when they are densely arranged. Therefore, we propose Density-Sensitive Vision Transformer with Adaptive Tokens (DenSe-AdViT) for dense SAR target detection. We design a Density-Aware Module (DAM) as a preliminary component that generates a density tensor based on target distribution. It is guided by a meticulously crafted objective metric, enabling precise and effective capture of the spatial distribution and density of objects. To integrate the multi-scale information enhanced by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with the global features derived from the Transformer, Density-Enhanced Fusion Module (DEFM) is proposed. It effectively refines attention toward target-survival regions with the assist of density mask and the multiple sources features. Notably, our DenSe-AdViT achieves 79.8% mAP on the RSDD dataset and 92.5% on the SIVED dataset, both of which feature a large number of densely distributed vehicle targets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Numan Saeed, Shahad Hardan, Muhammad Ridzuan, Nada Saadi, Karthik Nandakumar, Mohammad Yaqub</p>
<p>Abstract: Cancer detection and prognosis relies heavily on medical imaging, particularly CT and PET scans. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have shown promise in tumor segmentation by fusing information from these modalities. However, a critical bottleneck exists: the dependency on CT-PET data concurrently for training and inference, posing a challenge due to the limited availability of PET scans. Hence, there is a clear need for a flexible and efficient framework that can be trained with the widely available CT scans and can be still adapted for PET scans when they become available. In this work, we propose a parameter-efficient multi-modal adaptation (PEMMA) framework for lightweight upgrading of a transformer-based segmentation model trained only on CT scans such that it can be efficiently adapted for use with PET scans when they become available. This framework is further extended to perform prognosis task maintaining the same efficient cross-modal fine-tuning approach. The proposed approach is tested with two well-known segementation backbones, namely UNETR and Swin UNETR. Our approach offers two main advantages. Firstly, we leverage the inherent modularity of the transformer architecture and perform low-rank adaptation (LoRA) as well as decomposed low-rank adaptation (DoRA) of the attention weights to achieve parameter-efficient adaptation. Secondly, by minimizing cross-modal entanglement, PEMMA allows updates using only one modality without causing catastrophic forgetting in the other. Our method achieves comparable performance to early fusion, but with only 8% of the trainable parameters, and demonstrates a significant +28% Dice score improvement on PET scans when trained with a single modality. Furthermore, in prognosis, our method improves the concordance index by +10% when adapting a CT-pretrained model to include PET scans, and by +23% when adapting for both PET and EHR data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Uthman Baroudi, Alala BaHamid, Yasser Elalfy, Ziad Al Alami</p>
<p>Abstract: Road anomaly detection plays a crucial role in road maintenance and in enhancing the safety of both drivers and vehicles. Recent machine learning approaches for road anomaly detection have overcome the tedious and time-consuming process of manual analysis and anomaly counting; however, they often fall short in providing a complete characterization of road potholes. In this paper, we leverage transfer learning by adopting a pre-trained YOLOv8-seg model for the automatic characterization of potholes using digital images captured from a dashboard-mounted camera. Our work includes the creation of a novel dataset, comprising both images and their corresponding depth maps, collected from diverse road environments in Al-Khobar city and the KFUPM campus in Saudi Arabia. Our approach performs pothole detection and segmentation to precisely localize potholes and calculate their area. Subsequently, the segmented image is merged with its depth map to extract detailed depth information about the potholes. This integration of segmentation and depth data offers a more comprehensive characterization compared to previous deep learning-based road anomaly detection systems. Overall, this method not only has the potential to significantly enhance autonomous vehicle navigation by improving the detection and characterization of road hazards but also assists road maintenance authorities in responding more effectively to road damage.</p>

<p>Abstract: Medical Large Vision-Language Models (Med-LVLMs) demonstrate significant potential in healthcare, but their reliance on general medical data and coarse-grained global visual understanding limits them in intelligent ophthalmic diagnosis. Currently, intelligent ophthalmic diagnosis faces three major challenges: (i) Data. The lack of deeply annotated, high-quality, multi-modal ophthalmic visual instruction data; (ii) Benchmark. The absence of a comprehensive and systematic benchmark for evaluating diagnostic performance; (iii) Model. The difficulty of adapting holistic visual architectures to fine-grained, region-specific ophthalmic lesion identification. In this paper, we propose the Eyecare Kit, which systematically tackles the aforementioned three key challenges with the tailored dataset, benchmark and model: First, we construct a multi-agent data engine with real-life ophthalmology data to produce Eyecare-100K, a high-quality ophthalmic visual instruction dataset. Subsequently, we design Eyecare-Bench, a benchmark that comprehensively evaluates the overall performance of LVLMs on intelligent ophthalmic diagnosis tasks across multiple dimensions. Finally, we develop the EyecareGPT, optimized for fine-grained ophthalmic visual understanding thoroughly, which incorporates an adaptive resolution mechanism and a layer-wise dense connector. Extensive experimental results indicate that the EyecareGPT achieves state-of-the-art performance in a range of ophthalmic tasks, underscoring its significant potential for the advancement of open research in intelligent ophthalmic diagnosis.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengyuan Li, Changhong Fu, Ziyu Lu, Zijie Zhang, Haobo Zuo, Liangliang Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: Thermal imaging can greatly enhance the application of intelligent unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) in challenging environments. However, the inherent low resolution of thermal sensors leads to insufficient details and blurred boundaries. Super-resolution (SR) offers a promising solution to address this issue, while most existing SR methods are designed for fixed-scale SR. They are computationally expensive and inflexible in practical applications. To address above issues, this work proposes a novel any-scale thermal SR method (AnyTSR) for UAV within a single model. Specifically, a new image encoder is proposed to explicitly assign specific feature code to enable more accurate and flexible representation. Additionally, by effectively embedding coordinate offset information into the local feature ensemble, an innovative any-scale upsampler is proposed to better understand spatial relationships and reduce artifacts. Moreover, a novel dataset (UAV-TSR), covering both land and water scenes, is constructed for thermal SR tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all scaling factors as well as generates more accurate and detailed high-resolution images.

<p>Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in understanding and reasoning about visual and textual content. However, their robustness to common image corruptions remains under-explored. In this work, we present the first comprehensive analysis of VLM robustness across 19 corruption types from the ImageNet-C benchmark, spanning four categories: noise, blur, weather, and digital distortions. We introduce two new benchmarks, TextVQA-C and GQA-C, to systematically evaluate how corruptions affect scene text understanding and object-based reasoning, respectively. Our analysis reveals that transformer-based VLMs exhibit distinct vulnerability patterns across tasks: text recognition deteriorates most severely under blur and snow corruptions, while object reasoning shows higher sensitivity to corruptions such as frost and impulse noise. We connect these observations to the frequency-domain characteristics of different corruptions, revealing how transformers' inherent bias toward low-frequency processing explains their differential robustness patterns. Our findings provide valuable insights for developing more corruption-robust vision-language models for real-world applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Zebrafish share a high degree of homology with human genes and are commonly used as model organism in biomedical research. For medical laboratories, counting zebrafish is a daily task. Due to the tiny size of zebrafish, manual visual counting is challenging. Existing counting methods are either not applicable to small fishes or have too many limitations. The paper proposed a zebrafish counting algorithm based on the event stream data. Firstly, an event camera is applied for data acquisition. Secondly, camera calibration and image fusion were preformed successively. Then, the trajectory information was used to improve the counting accuracy. Finally, the counting results were averaged over an empirical of period and rounded up to get the final results. To evaluate the accuracy of the algorithm, 20 zebrafish were put in a four-liter breeding tank. Among 100 counting trials, the average accuracy reached 97.95%. As compared with traditional algorithms, the proposed one offers a simpler implementation and achieves higher accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gianluca Carloni</p>
<p>Abstract: This work aligns deep learning (DL) with human reasoning capabilities and needs to enable more efficient, interpretable, and robust image classification. We approach this from three perspectives: explainability, causality, and biological vision. Introduction and background open this work before diving into operative chapters. First, we assess neural networks' visualization techniques for medical images and validate an explainable-by-design method for breast mass classification. A comprehensive review at the intersection of XAI and causality follows, where we introduce a general scaffold to organize past and future research, laying the groundwork for our second perspective. In the causality direction, we propose novel modules that exploit feature co-occurrence in medical images, leading to more effective and explainable predictions. We further introduce CROCODILE, a general framework that integrates causal concepts, contrastive learning, feature disentanglement, and prior knowledge to enhance generalization. Lastly, we explore biological vision, examining how humans recognize objects, and propose CoCoReco, a connectivity-inspired network with context-aware attention mechanisms. Overall, our key findings include: (i) simple activation maximization lacks insight for medical imaging DL models; (ii) prototypical-part learning is effective and radiologically aligned; (iii) XAI and causal ML are deeply connected; (iv) weak causal signals can be leveraged without a priori information to improve performance and interpretability; (v) our framework generalizes across medical domains and out-of-distribution data; (vi) incorporating biological circuit motifs improves human-aligned recognition. This work contributes toward human-aligned DL and highlights pathways to bridge the gap between research and clinical adoption, with implications for improved trust, diagnostic accuracy, and safe deployment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lin Yuan, Xiaowan Li, Yan Zhang, Jiawei Zhang, Hongbo Li, Xinbo Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Advancements in image generation technologies have raised significant concerns about their potential misuse, such as producing misinformation and deepfakes. Therefore, there is an urgent need for effective methods to detect AI-generated images (AIGI). Despite progress in AIGI detection, achieving reliable performance across diverse generation models and scenes remains challenging due to the lack of source-invariant features and limited generalization capabilities in existing methods. In this work, we explore the potential of using image entropy as a cue for AIGI detection and propose Multi-granularity Local Entropy Patterns (MLEP), a set of entropy feature maps computed across shuffled small patches over multiple image scaled. MLEP comprehensively captures pixel relationships across dimensions and scales while significantly disrupting image semantics, reducing potential content bias. Leveraging MLEP, a robust CNN-based classifier for AIGI detection can be trained. Extensive experiments conducted in an open-world scenario, evaluating images synthesized by 32 distinct generative models, demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and generalization.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13736">LimitNet: Progressive, Content-Aware Image Offloading for Extremely Weak Devices &amp; Networks</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali Hojjat, Janek Haberer, Tayyaba Zainab, Olaf Landsiedel</p>
<p>Abstract: IoT devices have limited hardware capabilities and are often deployed in remote areas. Consequently, advanced vision models surpass such devices' processing and storage capabilities, requiring offloading of such tasks to the cloud. However, remote areas often rely on LPWANs technology with limited bandwidth, high packet loss rates, and extremely low duty cycles, which makes fast offloading for time-sensitive inference challenging. Today's approaches, which are deployable on weak devices, generate a non-progressive bit stream, and therefore, their decoding quality suffers strongly when data is only partially available on the cloud at a deadline due to limited bandwidth or packet losses.
  In this paper, we introduce LimitNet, a progressive, content-aware image compression model designed for extremely weak devices and networks. LimitNet's lightweight progressive encoder prioritizes critical data during transmission based on the content of the image, which gives the cloud the opportunity to run inference even with partial data availability.
  Experimental results demonstrate that LimitNet, on average, compared to SOTA, achieves 14.01 p.p. (percentage point) higher accuracy on ImageNet1000, 18.01 pp on CIFAR100, and 0.1 higher mAP@0.5 on COCO. Also, on average, LimitNet saves 61.24% bandwidth on ImageNet1000, 83.68% on CIFAR100, and 42.25% on the COCO dataset compared to SOTA, while it only has 4% more encoding time compared to JPEG (with a fixed quality) on STM32F7 (Cortex-M7).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrea Rigo, Luca Stornaiuolo, Mauro Martino, Bruno Lepri, Nicu Sebe</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have revolutionized text-to-image (T2I) synthesis, producing high-quality, photorealistic images. However, they still struggle to properly render the spatial relationships described in text prompts. To address the lack of spatial information in T2I generations, existing methods typically use external network conditioning and predefined layouts, resulting in higher computational costs and reduced flexibility. Our approach builds upon a curated dataset of spatially explicit prompts, meticulously extracted and synthesized from LAION-400M to ensure precise alignment between textual descriptions and spatial layouts. Alongside this dataset, we present ESPLoRA, a flexible fine-tuning framework based on Low-Rank Adaptation, specifically designed to enhance spatial consistency in generative models without increasing generation time or compromising the quality of the outputs. In addition to ESPLoRA, we propose refined evaluation metrics grounded in geometric constraints, capturing 3D spatial relations such as \textit{in front of} or \textit{behind}. These metrics also expose spatial biases in T2I models which, even when not fully mitigated, can be strategically exploited by our TORE algorithm to further improve the spatial consistency of generated images. Our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art framework, CoMPaSS, by 13.33% on established spatial consistency benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongjia Chen, Xin Xu, Fangling Pu</p>
<p>Abstract: Change detection (CD) in remote sensing imagery plays a crucial role in various applications such as urban planning, damage assessment, and resource management. While deep learning approaches have significantly advanced CD performance, current methods suffer from poor domain adaptability, requiring extensive labeled data for retraining when applied to new scenarios. This limitation severely restricts their practical applications across different datasets. In this work, we propose DAM-Net: a Domain Adaptation Network with Micro-Labeled Fine-Tuning for CD. Our network introduces adversarial domain adaptation to CD for, utilizing a specially designed segmentation-discriminator and alternating training strategy to enable effective transfer between domains. Additionally, we propose a novel Micro-Labeled Fine-Tuning approach that strategically selects and labels a minimal amount of samples (less than 1%) to enhance domain adaptation. The network incorporates a Multi-Temporal Transformer for feature fusion and optimized backbone structure based on previous research. Experiments conducted on the LEVIR-CD and WHU-CD datasets demonstrate that DAM-Net significantly outperforms existing domain adaptation methods, achieving comparable performance to semi-supervised approaches that require 10% labeled data while using only 0.3% labeled samples. Our approach significantly advances cross-dataset CD applications and provides a new paradigm for efficient domain adaptation in remote sensing. The source code of DAM-Net will be made publicly available upon publication.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhu Zhu, Shuo Jiang, Jingyuan Zheng, Yawen Li, Yifei Chen, Manli Zhao, Weizhong Gu, Feiwei Qin, Jinhu Wang, Gang Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Neuroblastoma, adrenal-derived, is among the most common pediatric solid malignancies, characterized by significant clinical heterogeneity. Timely and accurate pathological diagnosis from hematoxylin and eosin-stained whole slide images is critical for patient prognosis. However, current diagnostic practices primarily rely on subjective manual examination by pathologists, leading to inconsistent accuracy. Existing automated whole slide image classification methods encounter challenges such as poor interpretability, limited feature extraction capabilities, and high computational costs, restricting their practical clinical deployment. To overcome these limitations, we propose CMSwinKAN, a contrastive-learning-based multi-scale feature fusion model tailored for pathological image classification, which enhances the Swin Transformer architecture by integrating a Kernel Activation Network within its multilayer perceptron and classification head modules, significantly improving both interpretability and accuracy. By fusing multi-scale features and leveraging contrastive learning strategies, CMSwinKAN mimics clinicians' comprehensive approach, effectively capturing global and local tissue characteristics. Additionally, we introduce a heuristic soft voting mechanism guided by clinical insights to seamlessly bridge patch-level predictions to whole slide image-level classifications. We validate CMSwinKAN on the PpNTs dataset, which was collaboratively established with our partner hospital and the publicly accessible BreakHis dataset. Results demonstrate that CMSwinKAN performs better than existing state-of-the-art pathology-specific models pre-trained on large datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Davide Ghiani, Jefferson David Rodriguez Chivata, Stefano Lilliu, Simone Maurizio La Cava, Marco Micheletto, Giulia Orr\`u, Federico Lama, Gian Luca Marcialis</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern identity verification systems increasingly rely on facial images embedded in biometric documents such as electronic passports. To ensure global interoperability and security, these images must comply with strict standards defined by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), which specify acquisition, quality, and format requirements. However, once issued, these images may undergo unintentional degradations (e.g., compression, resizing) or malicious manipulations (e.g., morphing) and deceive facial recognition systems. In this study, we explore fragile watermarking, based on deep steganographic embedding as a proactive mechanism to certify the authenticity of ICAO-compliant facial images. By embedding a hidden image within the official photo at the time of issuance, we establish an integrity marker that becomes sensitive to any post-issuance modification. We assess how a range of image manipulations affects the recovered hidden image and show that degradation artifacts can serve as robust forensic cues. Furthermore, we propose a classification framework that analyzes the revealed content to detect and categorize the type of manipulation applied. Our experiments demonstrate high detection accuracy, including cross-method scenarios with multiple deep steganography-based models. These findings support the viability of fragile watermarking via steganographic embedding as a valuable tool for biometric document integrity verification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ryota Takatsuki, Sonia Joseph, Ippei Fujisawa, Ryota Kanai</p>
<p>Abstract: Logit Lens is a widely adopted method for mechanistic interpretability of transformer-based language models, enabling the analysis of how internal representations evolve across layers by projecting them into the output vocabulary space. Although applying Logit Lens to Vision Transformers (ViTs) is technically straightforward, its direct use faces limitations in capturing the richness of visual representations. Building on the work of Toker et al. (2024)~\cite{Toker2024-ve}, who introduced Diffusion Lens to visualize intermediate representations in the text encoders of text-to-image diffusion models, we demonstrate that while Diffusion Lens can effectively visualize residual stream representations in image encoders, it fails to capture the direct contributions of individual submodules. To overcome this limitation, we propose \textbf{Diffusion Steering Lens} (DSL), a novel, training-free approach that steers submodule outputs and patches subsequent indirect contributions. We validate our method through interventional studies, showing that DSL provides an intuitive and reliable interpretation of the internal processing in ViTs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aman Agarwal, James Gearon, Raksha Rank, Etienne Chenevert</p>
<p>Abstract: Wildfires are increasing in intensity, frequency, and duration across large parts of the world as a result of anthropogenic climate change. Modern hazard detection and response systems that deal with wildfires are under-equipped for sustained wildfire seasons. Recent work has proved automated wildfire detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained on satellite imagery are capable of high-accuracy results. However, CNNs are computationally expensive to train and only incorporate local image context. Recently, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have gained popularity for their efficient training and their ability to include both local and global contextual information. In this work, we show that ViT can outperform well-trained and specialized CNNs to detect wildfires on a previously published dataset of LandSat-8 imagery. One of our ViTs outperforms the baseline CNN comparison by 0.92%. However, we find our own implementation of CNN-based UNet to perform best in every category, showing their sustained utility in image tasks. Overall, ViTs are comparably capable in detecting wildfires as CNNs, though well-tuned CNNs are still the best technique for detecting wildfire with our UNet providing an IoU of 93.58%, better than the baseline UNet by some 4.58%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yixuan Yang, Jinyu Yang, Zixiang Zhao, Victor Sanchez, Feng Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: The unpaired point cloud completion task aims to complete a partial point cloud by using models trained with no ground truth. Existing unpaired point cloud completion methods are class-aware, i.e., a separate model is needed for each object class. Since they have limited generalization capabilities, these methods perform poorly in real-world scenarios when confronted with a wide range of point clouds of generic 3D objects. In this paper, we propose a novel unpaired point cloud completion framework, namely the Reference-guided Completion (RefComp) framework, which attains strong performance in both the class-aware and class-agnostic training settings. The RefComp framework transforms the unpaired completion problem into a shape translation problem, which is solved in the latent feature space of the partial point clouds. To this end, we introduce the use of partial-complete point cloud pairs, which are retrieved by using the partial point cloud to be completed as a template. These point cloud pairs are used as reference data to guide the completion process. Our RefComp framework uses a reference branch and a target branch with shared parameters for shape fusion and shape translation via a Latent Shape Fusion Module (LSFM) to enhance the structural features along the completion pipeline. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the RefComp framework achieves not only state-of-the-art performance in the class-aware training setting but also competitive results in the class-agnostic training setting on both virtual scans and real-world datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Yue, Yulin Wang, Chenxin Tao, Pan Liu, Shiji Song, Gao Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Humans can develop internal world models that encode common sense knowledge, telling them how the world works and predicting the consequences of their actions. This concept has emerged as a promising direction for establishing general-purpose machine-learning models in recent preliminary works, e.g., for visual representation learning. In this paper, we present CheXWorld, the first effort towards a self-supervised world model for radiographic images. Specifically, our work develops a unified framework that simultaneously models three aspects of medical knowledge essential for qualified radiologists, including 1) local anatomical structures describing the fine-grained characteristics of local tissues (e.g., architectures, shapes, and textures); 2) global anatomical layouts describing the global organization of the human body (e.g., layouts of organs and skeletons); and 3) domain variations that encourage CheXWorld to model the transitions across different appearance domains of radiographs (e.g., varying clarity, contrast, and exposure caused by collecting radiographs from different hospitals, devices, or patients). Empirically, we design tailored qualitative and quantitative analyses, revealing that CheXWorld successfully captures these three dimensions of medical knowledge. Furthermore, transfer learning experiments across eight medical image classification and segmentation benchmarks showcase that CheXWorld significantly outperforms existing SSL methods and large-scale medical foundation models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saurabh Pandey, Luca Magri, Federica Arrigoni, Vladislav Golyanik</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-model fitting (MMF) presents a significant challenge in Computer Vision, particularly due to its combinatorial nature. While recent advancements in quantum computing offer promise for addressing NP-hard problems, existing quantum-based approaches for model fitting are either limited to a single model or consider multi-model scenarios within outlier-free datasets. This paper introduces a novel approach, the robust quantum multi-model fitting (R-QuMF) algorithm, designed to handle outliers effectively. Our method leverages the intrinsic capabilities of quantum hardware to tackle combinatorial challenges inherent in MMF tasks, and it does not require prior knowledge of the exact number of models, thereby enhancing its practical applicability. By formulating the problem as a maximum set coverage task for adiabatic quantum computers (AQC), R-QuMF outperforms existing quantum techniques, demonstrating superior performance across various synthetic and real-world 3D datasets. Our findings underscore the potential of quantum computing in addressing the complexities of MMF, especially in real-world scenarios with noisy and outlier-prone data.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of deep learning (DL) has transformed healthcare, particularly in cancer detection and diagnosis. DL surpasses traditional machine learning and human accuracy, making it a critical tool for identifying diseases. Despite numerous reviews on DL in healthcare, a comprehensive analysis of its role in cancer detection remains limited. Existing studies focus on specific aspects, leaving gaps in understanding its broader impact. This paper addresses these gaps by reviewing advanced DL techniques, including transfer learning (TL), reinforcement learning (RL), federated learning (FL), Transformers, and large language models (LLMs). These approaches enhance accuracy, tackle data scarcity, and enable decentralized learning while maintaining data privacy. TL adapts pre-trained models to new datasets, improving performance with limited labeled data. RL optimizes diagnostic pathways and treatment strategies, while FL fosters collaborative model development without sharing sensitive data. Transformers and LLMs, traditionally used in natural language processing, are now applied to medical data for improved interpretability. Additionally, this review examines these techniques' efficiency in cancer diagnosis, addresses challenges like data imbalance, and proposes solutions. It serves as a resource for researchers and practitioners, providing insights into current trends and guiding future research in advanced DL for cancer detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Mahdi Danesh Pajouh</p>
<p>Abstract: Cancer remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, and among its many forms, brain tumors are particularly notorious due to their aggressive nature and the critical challenges involved in early diagnosis. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have shown great promise in assisting medical professionals with precise tumor segmentation, a key step in timely diagnosis and treatment planning. However, many state-of-the-art segmentation methods require extensive computational resources and prolonged training times, limiting their practical application in resource-constrained settings. In this work, we present a novel dual-decoder U-Net architecture enhanced with attention-gated skip connections, designed specifically for brain tumor segmentation from MRI scans. Our approach balances efficiency and accuracy by achieving competitive segmentation performance while significantly reducing training demands. Evaluated on the BraTS 2020 dataset, the proposed model achieved Dice scores of 85.06% for Whole Tumor (WT), 80.61% for Tumor Core (TC), and 71.26% for Enhancing Tumor (ET) in only 50 epochs, surpassing several commonly used U-Net variants. Our model demonstrates that high-quality brain tumor segmentation is attainable even under limited computational resources, thereby offering a viable solution for researchers and clinicians operating with modest hardware. This resource-efficient model has the potential to improve early detection and diagnosis of brain tumors, ultimately contributing to better patient outcomes</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> John R. Bennett</p>
<p>Abstract: To improve ATR identification of ships at sea requires an advanced ISAR processor - one that not only provides focused images but can also determine the pose of the ship. This tells us whether the image shows a profile (vertical plane) view, a plan (horizontal plane) view or some view in between. If the processor can provide this information, then the ATR processor can try to match the images with known vertical or horizontal features of ships and, in conjunction with estimated ship length, narrow the set of possible identifications. This paper extends the work of Melendez and Bennett [M-B, Ref. 1] by combining a focus algorithm with a method that models the angles of the ship relative to the radar. In M-B the algorithm was limited to a single angle and the plane of rotation was not determined. This assumption may be fine for a short time image where there is limited data available to determine the pose. However, the present paper models the ship rotation with two angles - aspect angle, representing rotation in the horizontal plane, and tilt angle, representing variations in the effective grazing angle to the ship.</p>

<p>Abstract: Depression is a complex mental disorder characterized by a diverse range of observable and measurable indicators that go beyond traditional subjective assessments. Recent research has increasingly focused on objective, passive, and continuous monitoring using wearable devices to gain more precise insights into the physiological and behavioral aspects of depression. However, most existing studies primarily distinguish between healthy and depressed individuals, adopting a binary classification that fails to capture the heterogeneity of depressive disorders. In this study, we leverage wearable devices to predict depression subtypes-specifically unipolar and bipolar depression-aiming to identify distinctive biomarkers that could enhance diagnostic precision and support personalized treatment strategies. To this end, we introduce the CALYPSO dataset, designed for non-invasive detection of depression subtypes and symptomatology through physiological and behavioral signals, including blood volume pulse, electrodermal activity, body temperature, and three-axis acceleration. Additionally, we establish a benchmark on the dataset using well-known features and standard machine learning methods. Preliminary results indicate that features related to physical activity, extracted from accelerometer data, are the most effective in distinguishing between unipolar and bipolar depression, achieving an accuracy of $96.77\%$. Temperature-based features also showed high discriminative power, reaching an accuracy of $93.55\%$. These findings highlight the potential of physiological and behavioral monitoring for improving the classification of depressive subtypes, paving the way for more tailored clinical interventions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Oliver Mills, Philip Conaghan, Nishant Ravikumar, Samuel Relton</p>
<p>Abstract: Menisci are cartilaginous tissue found within the knee that contribute to joint lubrication and weight dispersal. Damage to menisci can lead to onset and progression of knee osteoarthritis (OA), a condition that is a leading cause of disability, and for which there are few effective therapies. Accurate automated segmentation of menisci would allow for earlier detection and treatment of meniscal abnormalities, as well as shedding more light on the role the menisci play in OA pathogenesis. Focus in this area has mainly used variants of convolutional networks, but there has been no attempt to utilise recent large vision transformer segmentation models. The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is a so-called foundation segmentation model, which has been found useful across a range of different tasks due to the large volume of data used for training the model. In this study, SAM was adapted to perform fully-automated segmentation of menisci from 3D knee magnetic resonance images. A 3D U-Net was also trained as a baseline. It was found that, when fine-tuning only the decoder, SAM was unable to compete with 3D U-Net, achieving a Dice score of $0.81\pm0.03$, compared to $0.87\pm0.03$, on a held-out test set. When fine-tuning SAM end-to-end, a Dice score of $0.87\pm0.03$ was achieved. The performance of both the end-to-end trained SAM configuration and the 3D U-Net were comparable to the winning Dice score ($0.88\pm0.03$) in the IWOAI Knee MRI Segmentation Challenge 2019. Performance in terms of the Hausdorff Distance showed that both configurations of SAM were inferior to 3D U-Net in matching the meniscus morphology. Results demonstrated that, despite its generalisability, SAM was unable to outperform a basic 3D U-Net in meniscus segmentation, and may not be suitable for similar 3D medical image segmentation tasks also involving fine anatomical structures with low contrast and poorly-defined boundaries.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingxiao Tu, Shuchang Ye, Hoijoon Jung, Jinman Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating high-quality, photorealistic textures for 3D human avatars remains a fundamental yet challenging task in computer vision and multimedia field. However, real paired front and back images of human subjects are rarely available with privacy, ethical and cost of acquisition, which restricts scalability of the data. Additionally, learning priors from image inputs using deep generative models, such as GANs or diffusion models, to infer unseen regions such as the human back often leads to artifacts, structural inconsistencies, or loss of fine-grained detail. To address these issues, we present SMPL-GPTexture (skinned multi-person linear model - general purpose Texture), a novel pipeline that takes natural language prompts as input and leverages a state-of-the-art text-to-image generation model to produce paired high-resolution front and back images of a human subject as the starting point for texture estimation. Using the generated paired dual-view images, we first employ a human mesh recovery model to obtain a robust 2D-to-3D SMPL alignment between image pixels and the 3D model's UV coordinates for each views. Second, we use an inverted rasterization technique that explicitly projects the observed colour from the input images into the UV space, thereby producing accurate, complete texture maps. Finally, we apply a diffusion-based inpainting module to fill in the missing regions, and the fusion mechanism then combines these results into a unified full texture map. Extensive experiments shows that our SMPL-GPTexture can generate high resolution texture aligned with user's prompts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Radek Dan\v{e}\v{c}ek, Carolin Schmitt, Senya Polikovsky, Michael J. Black</p>
<p>Abstract: In order to be widely applicable, speech-driven 3D head avatars must articulate their lips in accordance with speech, while also conveying the appropriate emotions with dynamically changing facial expressions. The key problem is that deterministic models produce high-quality lip-sync but without rich expressions, whereas stochastic models generate diverse expressions but with lower lip-sync quality. To get the best of both, we seek a stochastic model with accurate lip-sync. To that end, we develop a new approach based on the following observation: if a method generates realistic 3D lip motions, it should be possible to infer the spoken audio from the lip motion. The inferred speech should match the original input audio, and erroneous predictions create a novel supervision signal for training 3D talking head avatars with accurate lip-sync. To demonstrate this effect, we propose THUNDER (Talking Heads Under Neural Differentiable Elocution Reconstruction), a 3D talking head avatar framework that introduces a novel supervision mechanism via differentiable sound production. First, we train a novel mesh-to-speech model that regresses audio from facial animation. Then, we incorporate this model into a diffusion-based talking avatar framework. During training, the mesh-to-speech model takes the generated animation and produces a sound that is compared to the input speech, creating a differentiable analysis-by-audio-synthesis supervision loop. Our extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that THUNDER significantly improves the quality of the lip-sync of talking head avatars while still allowing for generation of diverse, high-quality, expressive facial animations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mahrokh Najaf, Gregory Ongie</p>
<p>Abstract: Inspired by their success in solving challenging inverse problems in computer vision, implicit neural representations (INRs) have been recently proposed for reconstruction in low-dose/sparse-view X-ray computed tomography (CT). An INR represents a CT image as a small-scale neural network that takes spatial coordinates as inputs and outputs attenuation values. Fitting an INR to sinogram data is similar to classical model-based iterative reconstruction methods. However, training INRs with losses and gradient-based algorithms can be prohibitively slow, taking many thousands of iterations to converge. This paper investigates strategies to accelerate the optimization of INRs for CT reconstruction. In particular, we propose two approaches: (1) using a modified loss function with improved conditioning, and (2) an algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers. We illustrate that both of these approaches significantly accelerate INR-based reconstruction of a synthetic breast CT phantom in a sparse-view setting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Racheal Mukisa, Arvind K. Bansal</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated noninvasive cardiac diagnosis plays a critical role in the early detection of cardiac disorders and cost-effective clinical management. Automated diagnosis involves the automated segmentation and analysis of cardiac images. Precise delineation of cardiac substructures and extraction of their morphological attributes are essential for evaluating the cardiac function, and diagnosing cardiovascular disease such as cardiomyopathy, valvular diseases, abnormalities related to septum perforations, and blood-flow rate. Semantic segmentation labels the CMR image at the pixel level, and localizes its subcomponents to facilitate the detection of abnormalities, including abnormalities in cardiac wall motion in an aging heart with muscle abnormalities, vascular abnormalities, and valvular abnormalities. In this paper, we describe a model to improve semantic segmentation of CMR images. The model extracts edge-attributes and context information during down-sampling of the U-Net and infuses this information during up-sampling to localize three major cardiac structures: left ventricle cavity (LV); right ventricle cavity (RV); and LV myocardium (LMyo). We present an algorithm and performance results. A comparison of our model with previous leading models, using similarity metrics between actual image and segmented image, shows that our approach improves Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) by 2%-11% and lowers Hausdorff distance (HD) by 1.6 to 5.7 mm.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multi-agent collaboration holds great promise for enhancing the safety, reliability, and mobility of autonomous driving systems by enabling information sharing among multiple connected agents. However, existing multi-agent communication approaches are hindered by limitations of existing communication media, including high bandwidth demands, agent heterogeneity, and information loss. To address these challenges, we introduce LangCoop, a new paradigm for collaborative autonomous driving that leverages natural language as a compact yet expressive medium for inter-agent communication. LangCoop features two key innovations: Mixture Model Modular Chain-of-thought (M$^3$CoT) for structured zero-shot vision-language reasoning and Natural Language Information Packaging (LangPack) for efficiently packaging information into concise, language-based messages. Through extensive experiments conducted in the CARLA simulations, we demonstrate that LangCoop achieves a remarkable 96\% reduction in communication bandwidth (< 2KB per message) compared to image-based communication, while maintaining competitive driving performance in the closed-loop evaluation.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose an enhanced deep learning-based model for image segmentation of the left and right ventricles and myocardium scar tissue from cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images. The proposed technique integrates UNet, channel and spatial attention, edge-detection based skip-connection and deep supervised learning to improve the accuracy of the CMR image-segmentation. Images are processed using multiple channels to generate multiple feature-maps. We built a dual attention-based model to integrate channel and spatial attention. The use of extracted edges in skip connection improves the reconstructed images from feature-maps. The use of deep supervision reduces vanishing gradient problems inherent in classification based on deep neural networks. The algorithms for dual attention-based model, corresponding implementation and performance results are described. The performance results show that this approach has attained high accuracy: 98% Dice Similarity Score (DSC) and significantly lower Hausdorff Distance (HD). The performance results outperform other leading techniques both in DSC and HD.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiadong Lou, Bingqing Liu, Yuanheng Xiong, Xiaodong Zhang, Xu Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Phytoplankton absorb and scatter light in unique ways, subtly altering the color of water, changes that are often minor for human eyes to detect but can be captured by sensitive ocean color instruments onboard satellites from space. Hyperspectral sensors, paired with advanced algorithms, are expected to significantly enhance the characterization of phytoplankton community composition, especially in coastal waters where ocean color remote sensing applications have historically encountered significant challenges. This study presents novel machine learning-based solutions for NASA's hyperspectral missions, including EMIT and PACE, tackling high-fidelity retrievals of phytoplankton absorption coefficient and chlorophyll a from their hyperspectral remote sensing reflectance. Given that a single Rrs spectrum may correspond to varied combinations of inherent optical properties and associated concentrations, the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is used as a backbone in this study to handle such multi-distribution prediction problems. We first time tailor the VAE model with innovative designs to achieve hyperspectral retrievals of aphy and of Chl-a from hyperspectral Rrs in optically complex estuarine-coastal waters. Validation with extensive experimental observation demonstrates superior performance of the VAE models with high precision and low bias. The in-depth analysis of VAE's advanced model structures and learning designs highlights the improvement and advantages of VAE-based solutions over the mixture density network (MDN) approach, particularly on high-dimensional data, such as PACE. Our study provides strong evidence that current EMIT and PACE hyperspectral data as well as the upcoming Surface Biology Geology mission will open new pathways toward a better understanding of phytoplankton community dynamics in aquatic ecosystems when integrated with AI technologies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yipeng Sun, Linda-Sophie Schneider, Mingxuan Gu, Siyuan Mei, Chengze Ye, Fabian Wagner, Siming Bayer, Andreas Maier</p>
<p>Abstract: Effective denoising is crucial in low-dose CT to enhance subtle structures and low-contrast lesions while preventing diagnostic errors. Supervised methods struggle with limited paired datasets, and self-supervised approaches often require multiple noisy images and rely on deep networks like U-Net, offering little insight into the denoising mechanism. To address these challenges, we propose an interpretable self-supervised single-image denoising framework -- Filter2Noise (F2N). Our approach introduces an Attention-Guided Bilateral Filter that adapted to each noisy input through a lightweight module that predicts spatially varying filter parameters, which can be visualized and adjusted post-training for user-controlled denoising in specific regions of interest. To enable single-image training, we introduce a novel downsampling shuffle strategy with a new self-supervised loss function that extends the concept of Noise2Noise to a single image and addresses spatially correlated noise. On the Mayo Clinic 2016 low-dose CT dataset, F2N outperforms the leading self-supervised single-image method (ZS-N2N) by 4.59 dB PSNR while improving transparency, user control, and parametric efficiency. These features provide key advantages for medical applications that require precise and interpretable noise reduction. Our code is demonstrated at https://github.com/sypsyp97/Filter2Noise.git .</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihao Ouyang, Xunheng Kuang, Mengjia Xiong, Zhida Wang, Yuanquan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate retinal vessel segmentation provides essential structural information for ophthalmic image analysis. However, existing methods struggle with challenges such as multi-scale vessel variability, complex curvatures, and ambiguous boundaries. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Transformer-based models and Mamba-based architectures have advanced the field, they often suffer from vascular discontinuities or edge feature ambiguity. To address these limitations, we propose a novel hybrid framework that synergistically integrates CNNs and Mamba for high-precision retinal vessel segmentation. Our approach introduces three key innovations: 1) The proposed High-Resolution Edge Fuse Network is a high-resolution preserving hybrid segmentation framework that combines a multi-scale backbone with the Multi-scale Retina Edge Fusion (MREF) module to enhance edge features, ensuring accurate and robust vessel segmentation. 2) The Dynamic Snake Visual State Space block combines Dynamic Snake Convolution with Mamba to adaptively capture vessel curvature details and long-range dependencies. An improved eight-directional 2D Snake-Selective Scan mechanism and a dynamic weighting strategy enhance the perception of complex vascular topologies. 3) The MREF module enhances boundary precision through multi-scale edge feature aggregation, suppressing noise while emphasizing critical vessel structures across scales. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in maintaining vascular continuity and effectively segmenting vessels in low-contrast regions. This work provides a robust method for clinical applications requiring accurate retinal vessel analysis. The code is available at https://github.com/frank-oy/HREFNet.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenkai Qin, Feng Zhu, Huan Zeng, Xunyi Nong</p>
<p>Abstract: The demand for lightweight models in image classification tasks under resource-constrained environments necessitates a balance between computational efficiency and robust feature representation. Traditional attention mechanisms, despite their strong feature modeling capability, often struggle with high computational complexity and structural rigidity, limiting their applicability in scenarios with limited computational resources (e.g., edge devices or real-time systems). To address this, we propose the Multi-Agent Aggregation Module (MAAM), a lightweight attention architecture integrated with the MindSpore framework. MAAM employs three parallel agent branches with independently parameterized operations to extract heterogeneous features, adaptively fused via learnable scalar weights, and refined through a convolutional compression layer. Leveraging MindSpore's dynamic computational graph and operator fusion, MAAM achieves 87.0% accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset, significantly outperforming conventional CNN (58.3%) and MLP (49.6%) models, while improving training efficiency by 30%. Ablation studies confirm the critical role of agent attention (accuracy drops to 32.0% if removed) and compression modules (25.5% if omitted), validating their necessity for maintaining discriminative feature learning. The framework's hardware acceleration capabilities and minimal memory footprint further demonstrate its practicality, offering a deployable solution for image classification in resource-constrained scenarios without compromising accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Colonoscopy is vital in the early diagnosis of colorectal polyps. Regular screenings can effectively prevent benign polyps from progressing to CRC. While deep learning has made impressive strides in polyp segmentation, most existing models are trained on single-modality and single-center data, making them less effective in real-world clinical environments. To overcome these limitations, we propose FocusNet, a Transformer-enhanced focus attention network designed to improve polyp segmentation. FocusNet incorporates three essential modules: the Cross-semantic Interaction Decoder Module (CIDM) for generating coarse segmentation maps, the Detail Enhancement Module (DEM) for refining shallow features, and the Focus Attention Module (FAM), to balance local detail and global context through local and pooling attention mechanisms. We evaluate our model on PolypDB, a newly introduced dataset with multi-modality and multi-center data for building more reliable segmentation methods. Extensive experiments showed that FocusNet consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches with a high dice coefficients of 82.47% on the BLI modality, 88.46% on FICE, 92.04% on LCI, 82.09% on the NBI and 93.42% on WLI modality, demonstrating its accuracy and robustness across five different modalities.

<p>Abstract: Accurate vascular segmentation is essential for coronary visualization and the diagnosis of coronary heart disease. This task involves the extraction of sparse tree-like vascular branches from the volumetric space. However, existing methods have faced significant challenges due to discontinuous vascular segmentation and missing endpoints. To address this issue, a 3D vision graph neural network framework, named ViG3D-UNet, was introduced. This method integrates 3D graph representation and aggregation within a U-shaped architecture to facilitate continuous vascular segmentation. The ViG3D module captures volumetric vascular connectivity and topology, while the convolutional module extracts fine vascular details. These two branches are combined through channel attention to form the encoder feature. Subsequently, a paperclip-shaped offset decoder minimizes redundant computations in the sparse feature space and restores the feature map size to match the original input dimensions. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for continuous vascular segmentation, evaluations were performed on two public datasets, ASOCA and ImageCAS. The segmentation results show that the ViG3D-UNet surpassed competing methods in maintaining vascular segmentation connectivity while achieving high segmentation accuracy. Our code will be available soon.</p>

<p>Abstract: Service mobile robots are often required to avoid dynamic objects while performing their tasks, but they usually have only limited computational resources. So we present a lightweight multi-modal framework for 3D object detection and trajectory prediction. Our system synergistically integrates LiDAR and camera inputs to achieve real-time perception of pedestrians, vehicles, and riders in 3D space. The framework proposes two novel modules: 1) a Cross-Modal Deformable Transformer (CMDT) for object detection with high accuracy and acceptable amount of computation, and 2) a Reference Trajectory-based Multi-Class Transformer (RTMCT) for efficient and diverse trajectory prediction of mult-class objects with flexible trajectory lengths. Evaluations on the CODa benchmark demonstrate superior performance over existing methods across detection (+2.03% in mAP) and trajectory prediction (-0.408m in minADE5 of pedestrians) metrics. Remarkably, the system exhibits exceptional deployability - when implemented on a wheelchair robot with an entry-level NVIDIA 3060 GPU, it achieves real-time inference at 13.2 fps. To facilitate reproducibility and practical deployment, we release the related code of the method at https://github.com/TossherO/3D_Perception and its ROS inference version at https://github.com/TossherO/ros_packages.</p>

<p>Abstract: Realizing green communication in robotic mixed reality (RoboMR) systems presents a challenge, due to the necessity of uploading high-resolution images at high frequencies through wireless channels. This paper proposes Gaussian splatting (GS) RoboMR (GSRMR), which achieves a lower energy consumption and makes a concrete step towards green RoboMR. The crux to GSRMR is to build a GS model which enables the simulator to opportunistically render a photo-realistic view from the robot's pose, thereby reducing the need for excessive image uploads. Since the GS model may involve discrepancies compared to the actual environments, a GS cross-layer optimization (GSCLO) framework is further proposed, which jointly optimizes content switching (i.e., deciding whether to upload image or not) and power allocation across different frames. The GSCLO problem is solved by an accelerated penalty optimization (APO) algorithm. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed GSRMR reduces the communication energy by over 10x compared with RoboMR. Furthermore, the proposed GSRMR with APO outperforms extensive baseline schemes, in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index measure (SSIM).</p>

<p>Abstract: Models and methods originally developed for novel view synthesis and scene rendering, such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting, are increasingly being adopted as representations in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). However, existing datasets fail to include the specific challenges of both fields, such as multimodality and sequentiality in SLAM or generalization across viewpoints and illumination conditions in neural rendering. To bridge this gap, we introduce SLAM&Render, a novel dataset designed to benchmark methods in the intersection between SLAM and novel view rendering. It consists of 40 sequences with synchronized RGB, depth, IMU, robot kinematic data, and ground-truth pose streams. By releasing robot kinematic data, the dataset also enables the assessment of novel SLAM strategies when applied to robot manipulators. The dataset sequences span five different setups featuring consumer and industrial objects under four different lighting conditions, with separate training and test trajectories per scene, as well as object rearrangements. Our experimental results, obtained with several baselines from the literature, validate SLAM&Render as a relevant benchmark for this emerging research area.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Steffen Hagedorn, Aron Distelzweig, Marcel Hallgarten, Alexandru P. Condurache</p>
<p>Abstract: In automated driving, predicting trajectories of surrounding vehicles supports reasoning about scene dynamics and enables safe planning for the ego vehicle. However, existing models handle predictions as an instantaneous task of forecasting future trajectories based on observed information. As time proceeds, the next prediction is made independently of the previous one, which means that the model cannot correct its errors during inference and will repeat them. To alleviate this problem and better leverage temporal data, we propose a novel retrospection technique. Through training on closed-loop rollouts the model learns to use aggregated feedback. Given new observations it reflects on previous predictions and analyzes its errors to improve the quality of subsequent predictions. Thus, the model can learn to correct systematic errors during inference. Comprehensive experiments on nuScenes and Argoverse demonstrate a considerable decrease in minimum Average Displacement Error of up to 31.9% compared to the state-of-the-art baseline without retrospection. We further showcase the robustness of our technique by demonstrating a better handling of out-of-distribution scenarios with undetected road-users.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Yue, Zhiqi Chen, Rui Lu, Andrew Zhao, Zhaokai Wang, Yang Yue, Shiji Song, Gao Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently demonstrated notable success in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, particularly in mathematics and programming tasks. It is widely believed that RLVR enables LLMs to continuously self-improve, thus acquiring novel reasoning abilities that exceed corresponding base models' capacity. In this study, however, we critically re-examines this assumption by measuring the pass@\textit{k} metric with large values of \textit{k} to explore the reasoning capability boundary of the models across a wide range of model families and benchmarks. Surprisingly, the RL does \emph{not}, in fact, elicit fundamentally new reasoning patterns. While RL-trained models outperform their base models at smaller values of $k$ (\eg, $k$=1), base models can achieve a comparable or even higher pass@$k$ score compared to their RL counterparts at large $k$ values. The reasoning paths generated by RL-trained models are already included in the base models' sampling distribution, suggesting that most reasoning abilities manifested in RL-trained models are already obtained by base models. Further analysis shows that RL training boosts the performance by biasing the model's output distribution toward paths that are more likely to yield rewards, therefore sampling correct responses more efficiently. But this also results in a narrower reasoning capability boundary compared to base models. Similar results are observed in visual reasoning tasks trained with RLVR. Moreover, we find that distillation can genuinely introduce new knowledge into the model, different from RLVR. These findings underscore a critical limitation of RLVR in advancing LLM reasoning abilities which requires us to fundamentally rethink the impact of RL training in reasoning LLMs and the need of a better paradigm.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hubert Leterme, K\'evin Polisano, Val\'erie Perrier, Karteek Alahari</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper focuses on improving the mathematical interpretability of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in the context of image classification. Specifically, we tackle the instability issue arising in their first layer, which tends to learn parameters that closely resemble oriented band-pass filters when trained on datasets like ImageNet. Subsampled convolutions with such Gabor-like filters are prone to aliasing, causing sensitivity to small input shifts. In this context, we establish conditions under which the max pooling operator approximates a complex modulus, which is nearly shift invariant. We then derive a measure of shift invariance for subsampled convolutions followed by max pooling. In particular, we highlight the crucial role played by the filter's frequency and orientation in achieving stability. We experimentally validate our theory by considering a deterministic feature extractor based on the dual-tree complex wavelet packet transform, a particular case of discrete Gabor-like decomposition.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaosi Hu, Zhenzhong Chen, Chong Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: The video generation field has witnessed rapid improvements with the introduction of recent diffusion models. While these models have successfully enhanced appearance quality, they still face challenges in generating coherent and natural movements while efficiently sampling videos. In this paper, we propose to condense video generation into a problem of motion generation, to improve the expressiveness of motion and make video generation more manageable. This can be achieved by breaking down the video generation process into latent motion generation and video reconstruction. Specifically, we present a latent motion diffusion (LaMD) framework, which consists of a motion-decomposed video autoencoder and a diffusion-based motion generator, to implement this idea. Through careful design, the motion-decomposed video autoencoder can compress patterns in movement into a concise latent motion representation. Consequently, the diffusion-based motion generator is able to efficiently generate realistic motion on a continuous latent space under multi-modal conditions, at a cost that is similar to that of image diffusion models. Results show that LaMD generates high-quality videos on various benchmark datasets, including BAIR, Landscape, NATOPS, MUG and CATER-GEN, that encompass a variety of stochastic dynamics and highly controllable movements on multiple image-conditional video generation tasks, while significantly decreases sampling time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiang Wen, Zhefan Rao, Yazhou Xing, Qifeng Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Enhancing a low-light noisy RAW image into a well-exposed and clean sRGB image is a significant challenge for modern digital cameras. Prior approaches have difficulties in recovering fine-grained details and true colors of the scene under extremely low-light environments due to near-to-zero SNR. Meanwhile, diffusion models have shown significant progress towards general domain image generation. In this paper, we propose to leverage the pre-trained latent diffusion model to perform the neural ISP for enhancing extremely low-light images. Specifically, to tailor the pre-trained latent diffusion model to operate on the RAW domain, we train a set of lightweight taming modules to inject the RAW information into the diffusion denoising process via modulating the intermediate features of UNet. We further observe different roles of UNet denoising and decoder reconstruction in the latent diffusion model, which inspires us to decompose the low-light image enhancement task into latent-space low-frequency content generation and decoding-phase high-frequency detail maintenance. Through extensive experiments on representative datasets, we demonstrate our simple design not only achieves state-of-the-art performance in quantitative evaluations but also shows significant superiority in visual comparisons over strong baselines, which highlight the effectiveness of powerful generative priors for neural ISP under extremely low-light environments.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiao Wang, Yao Rong, Shiao Wang, Yuan Chen, Zhe Wu, Bo Jiang, Yonghong Tian, Jin Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Pattern recognition based on RGB-Event data is a newly arising research topic and previous works usually learn their features using CNN or Transformer. As we know, CNN captures the local features well and the cascaded self-attention mechanisms are good at extracting the long-range global relations. It is intuitive to combine them for high-performance RGB-Event based video recognition, however, existing works fail to achieve a good balance between the accuracy and model parameters, as shown in Fig.~\ref{firstimage}. In this work, we propose a novel RGB-Event based recognition framework termed TSCFormer, which is a relatively lightweight CNN-Transformer model. Specifically, we mainly adopt the CNN as the backbone network to first encode both RGB and Event data. Meanwhile, we initialize global tokens as the input and fuse them with RGB and Event features using the BridgeFormer module. It captures the global long-range relations well between both modalities and maintains the simplicity of the whole model architecture at the same time. The enhanced features will be projected and fused into the RGB and Event CNN blocks, respectively, in an interactive manner using F2E and F2V modules. Similar operations are conducted for other CNN blocks to achieve adaptive fusion and local-global feature enhancement under different resolutions. Finally, we concatenate these three features and feed them into the classification head for pattern recognition. Extensive experiments on two large-scale RGB-Event benchmark datasets (PokerEvent and HARDVS) fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed TSCFormer. The source code and pre-trained models will be released at https://github.com/Event-AHU/TSCFormer.</p>

<p>Abstract: Cancer subtyping is one of the most challenging tasks in digital pathology, where Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) by processing gigapixel whole slide images (WSIs) has been in the spotlight of recent research. However, MIL approaches do not take advantage of inter- and intra-magnification information contained in WSIs. In this work, we present GRASP, a novel lightweight graph-structured multi-magnification framework for processing WSIs in digital pathology. Our approach is designed to dynamically emulate the pathologist's behavior in handling WSIs and benefits from the hierarchical structure of WSIs. GRASP, which introduces a convergence-based node aggregation mechanism replacing traditional pooling mechanisms, outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a high margin in terms of balanced accuracy, while being significantly smaller than the closest-performing state-of-the-art models in terms of the number of parameters. Our results show that GRASP is dynamic in finding and consulting with different magnifications for subtyping cancers, is reliable and stable across different hyperparameters, and can generalize when using features from different backbones. The model's behavior has been evaluated by two expert pathologists confirming the interpretability of the model's dynamic. We also provide a theoretical foundation, along with empirical evidence, for our work, explaining how GRASP interacts with different magnifications and nodes in the graph to make predictions. We believe that the strong characteristics yet simple structure of GRASP will encourage the development of interpretable, structure-based designs for WSI representation in digital pathology.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Miles Everett, Mingjun Zhong, Georgios Leontidis</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose Masked Capsule Autoencoders (MCAE), the first Capsule Network that utilises pretraining in a modern self-supervised paradigm, specifically the masked image modelling framework. Capsule Networks have emerged as a powerful alternative to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). They have shown favourable properties when compared to Vision Transformers (ViT), but have struggled to effectively learn when presented with more complex data. This has led to Capsule Network models that do not scale to modern tasks. Our proposed MCAE model alleviates this issue by reformulating the Capsule Network to use masked image modelling as a pretraining stage before finetuning in a supervised manner. Across several experiments and ablations studies we demonstrate that similarly to CNNs and ViTs, Capsule Networks can also benefit from self-supervised pretraining, paving the way for further advancements in this neural network domain. For instance, by pretraining on the Imagenette dataset-consisting of 10 classes of Imagenet-sized images-we achieve state-of-the-art results for Capsule Networks, demonstrating a 9% improvement compared to our baseline model. Thus, we propose that Capsule Networks benefit from and should be trained within a masked image modelling framework, using a novel capsule decoder, to enhance a Capsule Network's performance on realistically sized images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Alkhalefi, Georgios Leontidis, Mingjun Zhong</p>
<p>Abstract: Contrastive instance discrimination methods outperform supervised learning in downstream tasks such as image classification and object detection. However, these methods rely heavily on data augmentation during representation learning, which can lead to suboptimal results if not implemented carefully. A common augmentation technique in contrastive learning is random cropping followed by resizing. This can degrade the quality of representation learning when the two random crops contain distinct semantic content. To tackle this issue, we introduce LeOCLR (Leveraging Original Images for Contrastive Learning of Visual Representations), a framework that employs a novel instance discrimination approach and an adapted loss function. This method prevents the loss of important semantic features caused by mapping different object parts during representation learning. Our experiments demonstrate that LeOCLR consistently improves representation learning across various datasets, outperforming baseline models. For instance, LeOCLR surpasses MoCo-v2 by 5.1% on ImageNet-1K in linear evaluation and outperforms several other methods on transfer learning and object detection tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minbin Huang, Yanxin Long, Xinchi Deng, Ruihang Chu, Jiangfeng Xiong, Xiaodan Liang, Hong Cheng, Qinglin Lu, Wei Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation models have significantly advanced in recent years. However, effective interaction with these models is challenging for average users due to the need for specialized prompt engineering knowledge and the inability to perform multi-turn image generation, hindering a dynamic and iterative creation process. Recent attempts have tried to equip Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with T2I models to bring the user's natural language instructions into reality. Hence, the output modality of MLLMs is extended, and the multi-turn generation quality of T2I models is enhanced thanks to the strong multi-modal comprehension ability of MLLMs. However, many of these works face challenges in identifying correct output modalities and generating coherent images accordingly as the number of output modalities increases and the conversations go deeper. Therefore, we propose DialogGen, an effective pipeline to align off-the-shelf MLLMs and T2I models to build a Multi-modal Interactive Dialogue System (MIDS) for multi-turn Text-to-Image generation. It is composed of drawing prompt alignment, careful training data curation, and error correction. Moreover, as the field of MIDS flourishes, comprehensive benchmarks are urgently needed to evaluate MIDS fairly in terms of output modality correctness and multi-modal output coherence. To address this issue, we introduce the Multi-modal Dialogue Benchmark (DialogBen), a comprehensive bilingual benchmark designed to assess the ability of MLLMs to generate accurate and coherent multi-modal content that supports image editing. It contains two evaluation metrics to measure the model's ability to switch modalities and the coherence of the output images. Our extensive experiments on DialogBen and user study demonstrate the effectiveness of DialogGen compared with other State-of-the-Art models.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel latent 3D diffusion model for the generation of neural voxel fields, aiming to achieve accurate part-aware structures. Compared to existing methods, there are two key designs to ensure high-quality and accurate part-aware generation. On one hand, we introduce a latent 3D diffusion process for neural voxel fields, enabling generation at significantly higher resolutions that can accurately capture rich textural and geometric details. On the other hand, a part-aware shape decoder is introduced to integrate the part codes into the neural voxel fields, guiding the accurate part decomposition and producing high-quality rendering results. Through extensive experimentation and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, we evaluate our approach across four different classes of data. The results demonstrate the superior generative capabilities of our proposed method in part-aware shape generation, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alessio Mazzucchelli, Adrian Garcia-Garcia, Elena Garces, Fernando Rivas-Manzaneque, Francesc Moreno-Noguer, Adrian Penate-Sanchez</p>
<p>Abstract: Advances in NERFs have allowed for 3D scene reconstructions and novel view synthesis. Yet, efficiently editing these representations while retaining photorealism is an emerging challenge. Recent methods face three primary limitations: they're slow for interactive use, lack precision at object boundaries, and struggle to ensure multi-view consistency. We introduce IReNe to address these limitations, enabling swift, near real-time color editing in NeRF. Leveraging a pre-trained NeRF model and a single training image with user-applied color edits, IReNe swiftly adjusts network parameters in seconds. This adjustment allows the model to generate new scene views, accurately representing the color changes from the training image while also controlling object boundaries and view-specific effects. Object boundary control is achieved by integrating a trainable segmentation module into the model. The process gains efficiency by retraining only the weights of the last network layer. We observed that neurons in this layer can be classified into those responsible for view-dependent appearance and those contributing to diffuse appearance. We introduce an automated classification approach to identify these neuron types and exclusively fine-tune the weights of the diffuse neurons. This further accelerates training and ensures consistent color edits across different views. A thorough validation on a new dataset, with edited object colors, shows significant quantitative and qualitative advancements over competitors, accelerating speeds by 5x to 500x.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyu Zhang, Suyuchen Wang, Lu Li, Ge Zhang, Perouz Taslakian, Sai Rajeswar, Jie Fu, Bang Liu, Yoshua Bengio</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Visual Caption Restoration (VCR), a novel vision-language task that challenges models to accurately restore partially obscured texts using pixel-level hints within images. This task stems from the observation that text embedded in images is intrinsically different from common visual elements and natural language due to the need to align the modalities of vision, text, and text embedded in images. While numerous works have integrated text embedded in images into visual question-answering tasks, approaches to these tasks generally rely on optical character recognition or masked language modeling, thus reducing the task to mainly text-based processing. However, text-based processing becomes ineffective in VCR as accurate text restoration depends on the combined information from provided images, context, and subtle cues from the tiny exposed areas of masked texts. We develop a pipeline to generate synthetic images for the VCR task using image-caption pairs, with adjustable caption visibility to control the task difficulty. With this pipeline, we construct a dataset for VCR called VCR-Wiki using images with captions from Wikipedia, comprising 2.11M English and 346K Chinese entities in both easy and hard split variants. Our results reveal that current vision language models significantly lag behind human performance in the VCR task, and merely fine-tuning the models on our dataset does not lead to notable improvements. We release VCR-Wiki and the data construction code to facilitate future research.</p>

<p>Abstract: In laparoscopic and robotic surgery, precise tool instance segmentation is an essential technology for advanced computer-assisted interventions. Although publicly available procedures of routine surgeries exist, they often lack comprehensive annotations for tool instance segmentation.

To address this gap, we introduce CholecInstanceSeg, the largest open-access tool instance segmentation dataset to date. Derived from the existing CholecT50 and Cholec80 datasets, CholecInstanceSeg provides novel annotations for laparoscopic cholecystectomy procedures in patients. Our dataset comprises 41.9k annotated frames extracted from 85 clinical procedures and 64.4k tool instances, each labelled with semantic masks and instance IDs. To ensure the reliability of our annotations, we perform extensive quality control, conduct label agreement statistics, and benchmark the segmentation results with various instance segmentation baselines.

<p>Abstract: Mapping the extent of flood events is a necessary and important aspect of disaster management. In recent years, deep learning methods have evolved as an effective tool to quickly label high resolution imagery and provide necessary flood extent mappings. These methods, though, require large amounts of annotated training data to create models that are accurate and robust to new flooded imagery. In this work, we present FloodTrace, a web-based application that enables effective crowdsourcing of flooded region annotation for machine learning applications. To create this application, we conducted extensive interviews with domain experts to produce a set of formal requirements. Our work brings topological segmentation tools to the web and greatly improves annotation efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art. The user-friendliness of our solution allows researchers to outsource annotations to non-experts and utilize them to produce training data with equal quality to fully expert-labeled data. We conducted a user study to confirm the effectiveness of our application in which 266 graduate students annotated high-resolution aerial imagery from Hurricane Matthew in North Carolina. Experimental results show the efficiency benefits of our application for untrained users, with median annotation time less than half the state-of-the-art annotation method. In addition, using our aggregation and correction framework, flood detection models trained on crowdsourced annotations were able to achieve performance equal to models trained on fully expert-labeled annotations, while requiring a fraction of the time on the part of the expert.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fenghe Tang, Bingkun Nian, Yingtai Li, Zihang Jiang, Jie Yang, Wei Liu, S. Kevin Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, the state space model Mamba has demonstrated efficient long-sequence modeling capabilities, particularly for addressing long-sequence visual tasks in 3D medical imaging. However, existing generative self-supervised learning methods have not yet fully unleashed Mamba's potential for handling long-range dependencies because they overlook the inherent causal properties of state space sequences in masked modeling. To address this challenge, we propose a general-purpose pre-training framework called MambaMIM, a masked image modeling method based on a novel TOKen-Interpolation strategy (TOKI) for the selective structure state space sequence, which learns causal relationships of state space within the masked sequence. Further, MambaMIM introduces a bottom-up 3D hybrid masking strategy to maintain a masking consistency across different architectures and can be used on any single or hybrid Mamba architecture to enhance its multi-scale and long-range representation capability. We pre-train MambaMIM on a large-scale dataset of 6.8K CT scans and evaluate its performance across eight public medical segmentation benchmarks. Extensive downstream experiments reveal the feasibility and advancement of using Mamba for medical image pre-training. In particular, when we apply the MambaMIM to a customized architecture that hybridizes MedNeXt and Vision Mamba, we consistently obtain the state-of-the-art segmentation performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junhwa Hur, Charles Herrmann, Saurabh Saxena, Janne Kontkanen, Wei-Sheng Lai, Yichang Shih, Michael Rubinstein, David J. Fleet, Deqing Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the recent progress, existing frame interpolation methods still struggle with processing extremely high resolution input and handling challenging cases such as repetitive textures, thin objects, and large motion. To address these issues, we introduce a patch-based cascaded pixel diffusion model for high resolution frame interpolation, HIFI, that excels in these scenarios while achieving competitive performance on standard benchmarks. Cascades, which generate a series of images from low to high resolution, can help significantly with large or complex motion that require both global context for a coarse solution and detailed context for high resolution output. However, contrary to prior work on cascaded diffusion models which perform diffusion on increasingly large resolutions, we use a single model that always performs diffusion at the same resolution and upsamples by processing patches of the inputs and the prior solution. At inference time, this drastically reduces memory usage and allows a single model, solving both frame interpolation (base model's task) and spatial up-sampling, saving training cost as well. HIFI excels at high-resolution images and complex repeated textures that require global context, achieving comparable or state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks (Vimeo, Xiph, X-Test, and SEPE-8K). We further introduce a new dataset, LaMoR, that focuses on particularly challenging cases, and HIFI significantly outperforms other baselines.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qishun Wang, Zhengzheng Tu, Kunpeng Wang, Le Gu, Chuanwang Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing RGB-Thermal Video Object Detection (RGBT VOD) methods predominantly rely on the manual alignment of image pairs, that is both labor-intensive and time-consuming. This dependency significantly restricts the scalability and practical applicability of these methods in real-world scenarios. To address this critical limitation, we propose a novel framework termed the Mixture of Scale Experts Network (MSENet). MSENet integrates multiple experts trained at different perceptual scales, enabling the capture of scale discrepancies between RGB and thermal image pairs without the need for explicit alignment. Specifically, to address the issue of unaligned scales, MSENet introduces a set of experts designed to perceive the correlation between RGBT image pairs across various scales. These experts are capable of identifying and quantifying the scale differences inherent in the image pairs. Subsequently, a dynamic routing mechanism is incorporated to assign adaptive weights to each expert, allowing the network to dynamically select the most appropriate experts based on the specific characteristics of the input data. Furthermore, to address the issue of weakly unaligned positions, we integrate deformable convolution into the network. Deformable convolution is employed to learn position displacements between the RGB and thermal modalities, thereby mitigating the impact of spatial misalignment. To provide a comprehensive evaluation platform for alignment-free RGBT VOD, we introduce a new benchmark dataset. This dataset includes eleven common object categories, with a total of 60,988 images and 271,835 object instances. The dataset encompasses a wide range of scenes from both daily life and natural environments, ensuring high content diversity and complexity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Louis Soum-Fontez, Jean-Emmanuel Deschaud, Fran\c{c}ois Goulette</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous systems rely on accurate 3D object detection from LiDAR data, yet most detectors are limited to a predefined set of known classes, making them vulnerable to unexpected out-of-distribution (OOD) objects. In this work, we present HD-OOD3D, a novel two-stage method for detecting unknown objects. We demonstrate the superiority of two-stage approaches over single-stage methods, achieving more robust detection of unknown objects while addressing key challenges in the evaluation protocol. Furthermore, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the standard evaluation protocol for OOD detection, revealing the critical impact of hyperparameter choices. To address the challenge of scaling the learning of unknown objects, we explore unsupervised training strategies to generate pseudo-labels for unknowns. Among the different approaches evaluated, our experiments show that top-5 auto-labelling offers more promising performance compared to simple resizing techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Laurin Lux, Alexander H. Berger, Alexander Weers, Nico Stucki, Daniel Rueckert, Ulrich Bauer, Johannes C. Paetzold</p>
<p>Abstract: Topological correctness plays a critical role in many image segmentation tasks, yet most networks are trained using pixel-wise loss functions, such as Dice, neglecting topological accuracy. Existing topology-aware methods often lack robust topological guarantees, are limited to specific use cases, or impose high computational costs. In this work, we propose a novel, graph-based framework for topologically accurate image segmentation that is both computationally efficient and generally applicable. Our method constructs a component graph that fully encodes the topological information of both the prediction and ground truth, allowing us to efficiently identify topologically critical regions and aggregate a loss based on local neighborhood information. Furthermore, we introduce a strict topological metric capturing the homotopy equivalence between the union and intersection of prediction-label pairs. We formally prove the topological guarantees of our approach and empirically validate its effectiveness on binary and multi-class datasets. Our loss demonstrates state-of-the-art performance with up to fivefold faster loss computation compared to persistent homology methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyao Zeng, Jingcheng Ni, Daniel Wang, Patrick Rim, Younjoon Chung, Fengyu Yang, Byung-Woo Hong, Alex Wong</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional monocular depth estimation suffers from inherent ambiguity and visual nuisance. We argue that language prior can enhance monocular depth estimation by leveraging the inductive bias learned during the text-to-image pre-training of diffusion models. The ability of these models to generate images that align with text indicates that they have learned the spatial relationships, size, and shape of specified objects, which can be applied to improve depth estimation. Thus, we propose PriorDiffusion, using a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model that takes both images and corresponding text descriptions to infer affine-invariant depth through a denoising process. We also show that language prior enhances the model's perception of specific regions of images that users care about and describe. Simultaneously, language prior acts as a constraint to accelerate the convergence of both training and the inference diffusion trajectory. By training on HyperSim and Virtual KITTI, we achieve faster training convergence, fewer inference diffusion steps, and state-of-the-art zero-shot performance across NYUv2, KITTI, ETH3D, and ScanNet. Code will be released upon acceptance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yan Xing, Qi'ao Xu, Zongyu Guo, Rui Huang, Yuxiang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Semi-supervised change detection (SSCD) utilizes partially labeled data and abundant unlabeled data to detect differences between multi-temporal remote sensing images. The mainstream SSCD methods based on consistency regularization have limitations. They perform perturbations mainly at a single level, restricting the utilization of unlabeled data and failing to fully tap its potential. In this paper, we introduce a novel Gate-guided Two-level Perturbation Consistency regularization-based SSCD method (GTPC-SSCD). It simultaneously maintains strong-to-weak consistency at the image level and perturbation consistency at the feature level, enhancing the utilization efficiency of unlabeled data. Moreover, we develop a hardness analysis-based gating mechanism to assess the training complexity of different samples and determine the necessity of performing feature perturbations for each sample. Through this differential treatment, the network can explore the potential of unlabeled data more efficiently. Extensive experiments conducted on six benchmark CD datasets demonstrate the superiority of our GTPC-SSCD over seven state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jungbin Cho, Junwan Kim, Jisoo Kim, Minseo Kim, Mingu Kang, Sungeun Hong, Tae-Hyun Oh, Youngjae Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Human motion is inherently continuous and dynamic, posing significant challenges for generative models. While discrete generation methods are widely used, they suffer from limited expressiveness and frame-wise noise artifacts. In contrast, continuous approaches produce smoother, more natural motion but often struggle to adhere to conditioning signals due to high-dimensional complexity and limited training data. To resolve this discord between discrete and continuous representations, we introduce DisCoRD: Discrete Tokens to Continuous Motion via Rectified Flow Decoding, a novel method that leverages rectified flow to decode discrete motion tokens in the continuous, raw motion space. Our core idea is to frame token decoding as a conditional generation task, ensuring that DisCoRD captures fine-grained dynamics and achieves smoother, more natural motions. Compatible with any discrete-based framework, our method enhances naturalness without compromising faithfulness to the conditioning signals on diverse settings.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shidan He, Lei Liu, Xiujun Shu, Bo Wang, Yuanhao Feng, Shen Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Anomaly synthesis is a crucial approach to augment abnormal data for advancing anomaly inspection. Based on the knowledge from the large-scale pre-training, existing text-to-image anomaly synthesis methods predominantly focus on textual information or coarse-aligned visual features to guide the entire generation process. However, these methods often lack sufficient descriptors to capture the complicated characteristics of realistic anomalies (e.g., the fine-grained visual pattern of anomalies), limiting the realism and generalization of the generation process. To this end, we propose a novel anomaly synthesis framework called AnomalyControl to learn cross-modal semantic features as guidance signals, which could encode the generalized anomaly cues from text-image reference prompts and improve the realism of synthesized abnormal samples. Specifically, AnomalyControl adopts a flexible and non-matching prompt pair (i.e., a text-image reference prompt and a targeted text prompt), where a Cross-modal Semantic Modeling (CSM) module is designed to extract cross-modal semantic features from the textual and visual descriptors. Then, an Anomaly-Semantic Enhanced Attention (ASEA) mechanism is formulated to allow CSM to focus on the specific visual patterns of the anomaly, thus enhancing the realism and contextual relevance of the generated anomaly features. Treating cross-modal semantic features as the prior, a Semantic Guided Adapter (SGA) is designed to encode effective guidance signals for the adequate and controllable synthesis process. Extensive experiments indicate that AnomalyControl can achieve state-of-the-art results in anomaly synthesis compared with existing methods while exhibiting superior performance for downstream tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyang Dou, Zipeng Wang, Xumeng Han, Guorong Li, Zhipei Huang, Zhenjun Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Global geolocation, which seeks to predict the geographical location of images captured anywhere in the world, is one of the most challenging tasks in the field of computer vision. In this paper, we introduce an innovative interactive global geolocation assistant named GaGA, built upon the flourishing large vision-language models (LVLMs). GaGA uncovers geographical clues within images and combines them with the extensive world knowledge embedded in LVLMs to determine the geolocations while also providing justifications and explanations for the prediction results. We further designed a novel interactive geolocation method that surpasses traditional static inference approaches. It allows users to intervene, correct, or provide clues for the predictions, making the model more flexible and practical. The development of GaGA relies on the newly proposed Multi-modal Global Geolocation (MG-Geo) dataset, a comprehensive collection of 5 million high-quality image-text pairs. GaGA achieves state-of-the-art performance on the GWS15k dataset, improving accuracy by 4.57% at the country level and 2.92% at the city level, setting a new benchmark. These advancements represent a significant leap forward in developing highly accurate, interactive geolocation systems with global applicability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanzhou Liu, Chengkai Liu, Jiacong Xu, Peng Jiang, Mi Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep state-space models (SSMs), like recent Mamba architectures, are emerging as a promising alternative to CNN and Transformer networks. Existing Mamba-based restoration methods process visual data by leveraging a flatten-and-scan strategy that converts image patches into a 1D sequence before scanning. However, this scanning paradigm ignores local pixel dependencies and introduces spatial misalignment by positioning distant pixels incorrectly adjacent, which reduces local noise-awareness and degrades image sharpness in low-level vision tasks. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel slice-and-scan strategy that alternates scanning along intra- and inter-slices. We further design a new Vision State Space Module (VSSM) for image deblurring, and tackle the inefficiency challenges of the current Mamba-based vision module. Building upon this, we develop XYScanNet, an SSM architecture integrated with a lightweight feature fusion module for enhanced image deblurring. XYScanNet, maintains competitive distortion metrics and significantly improves perceptual performance. Experimental results show that XYScanNet enhances KID by $17\%$ compared to the nearest competitor.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francesco Villani, Igor Maljkovic, Dario Lazzaro, Angelo Sotgiu, Antonio Emanuele Cin\`a, Fabio Roli</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep Neural Networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples, i.e., carefully crafted input samples that can cause models to make incorrect predictions with high confidence. To mitigate these vulnerabilities, adversarial training and detection-based defenses have been proposed to strengthen models in advance. However, most of these approaches focus on a single data modality, overlooking the relationships between visual patterns and textual descriptions of the input. In this paper, we propose a novel defense, MultiShield, designed to combine and complement these defenses with multi-modal information to further enhance their robustness. MultiShield leverages multi-modal large language models to detect adversarial examples and abstain from uncertain classifications when there is no alignment between textual and visual representations of the input. Extensive evaluations on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, using robust and non-robust image classification models, demonstrate that MultiShield can be easily integrated to detect and reject adversarial examples, outperforming the original defenses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dong In Lee, Hyeongcheol Park, Jiyoung Seo, Eunbyung Park, Hyunje Park, Ha Dam Baek, Sangheon Shin, Sangmin Kim, Sangpil Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D editing have highlighted the potential of text-driven methods in real-time, user-friendly AR/VR applications. However, current methods rely on 2D diffusion models without adequately considering multi-view information, resulting in multi-view inconsistency. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) significantly improves rendering quality and speed, its 3D editing process encounters difficulties with inefficient optimization, as pre-trained Gaussians retain excessive source information, hindering optimization. To address these limitations, we propose EditSplat, a novel text-driven 3D scene editing framework that integrates Multi-view Fusion Guidance (MFG) and Attention-Guided Trimming (AGT). Our MFG ensures multi-view consistency by incorporating essential multi-view information into the diffusion process, leveraging classifier-free guidance from the text-to-image diffusion model and the geometric structure inherent to 3DGS. Additionally, our AGT utilizes the explicit representation of 3DGS to selectively prune and optimize 3D Gaussians, enhancing optimization efficiency and enabling precise, semantically rich local editing. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations, EditSplat achieves state-of-the-art performance, establishing a new benchmark for text-driven 3D scene editing.</p>

We b) benchmark existing 3D self-supervised learning methods on this dataset for a state-of-the-art CNN and Transformer architecture, clarifying the state of 3D SSL pre-training. Among many findings, we show that pre-trained methods can exceed a strong from-scratch nnU-Net ResEnc-L baseline. Lastly, we c) publish the code of our pre-training and fine-tuning frameworks and provide the pre-trained models created during the benchmarking process to facilitate rapid adoption and reproduction.</p>

<p>Abstract: Disaster events occur around the world and cause significant damage to human life and property. Earth observation (EO) data enables rapid and comprehensive building damage assessment (BDA), an essential capability in the aftermath of a disaster to reduce human casualties and to inform disaster relief efforts. Recent research focuses on the development of AI models to achieve accurate mapping of unseen disaster events, mostly using optical EO data. However, solutions based on optical data are limited to clear skies and daylight hours, preventing a prompt response to disasters. Integrating multimodal (MM) EO data, particularly the combination of optical and SAR imagery, makes it possible to provide all-weather, day-and-night disaster responses. Despite this potential, the development of robust multimodal AI models has been constrained by the lack of suitable benchmark datasets. In this paper, we present a BDA dataset using veRy-hIGH-resoluTion optical and SAR imagery (BRIGHT) to support AI-based all-weather disaster response. To the best of our knowledge, BRIGHT is the first open-access, globally distributed, event-diverse MM dataset specifically curated to support AI-based disaster response. It covers five types of natural disasters and two types of man-made disasters across 14 regions worldwide, with a particular focus on developing countries where external assistance is most needed. The optical and SAR imagery in BRIGHT, with a spatial resolution between 0.3-1 meters, provides detailed representations of individual buildings, making it ideal for precise BDA. In our experiments, we have tested seven advanced AI models trained with our BRIGHT to validate the transferability and robustness. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/ChenHongruixuan/BRIGHT. BRIGHT also serves as the official dataset for the 2025 IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Agnieszka Anna Tomaka, Dariusz Pojda, Micha{\l} Tarnawski, Leszek Luchowski</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal image registration plays a key role in creating digital patient models by combining data from different imaging techniques into a single coordinate system. This process often involves multiple sequential and interconnected transformations, which must be well-documented to ensure transparency and reproducibility. In this paper, we propose the use of transformation trees as a method for structured recording and management of these transformations. This approach has been implemented in the dpVision software and uses a dedicated .dpw file format to store hierarchical relationships between images, transformations, and motion data. Transformation trees allow precise tracking of all image processing steps, reduce the need to store multiple copies of the same data, and enable the indirect registration of images that do not share common reference points. This improves the reproducibility of the analyses and facilitates later processing and integration of images from different sources. The practical application of this method is demonstrated with examples from orthodontics, including the integration of 3D face scans, intraoral scans, and CBCT images, as well as the documentation of mandibular motion. Beyond orthodontics, this method can be applied in other fields that require systematic management of image registration processes, such as maxillofacial surgery, oncology, and biomechanical analysis. Maintaining long-term data consistency is essential for both scientific research and clinical practice. It enables easier comparison of results in longitudinal studies, improves retrospective analysis, and supports the development of artificial intelligence algorithms by providing standardized and well-documented datasets. The proposed approach enhances data organization, allows for efficient analysis, and facilitates the reuse of information in future studies and diagnostic procedures.</p>

<p>Abstract: Although large multimodal models (LMMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in visual scene interpretation and reasoning, their capacity for complex and precise 3-dimensional spatial reasoning remains uncertain. Existing benchmarks focus predominantly on 2D spatial understanding and lack a framework to comprehensively evaluate 6D spatial reasoning across varying complexities. To address this limitation, we present Spatial457, a scalable and unbiased synthetic dataset designed with 4 key capability for spatial reasoning: multi-object recognition, 2D location, 3D location, and 3D orientation. We develop a cascading evaluation structure, constructing 7 question types across 5 difficulty levels that range from basic single object recognition to our new proposed complex 6D spatial reasoning tasks. We evaluated various large multimodal models (LMMs) on PulseCheck457, observing a general decline in performance as task complexity increases, particularly in 3D reasoning and 6D spatial tasks. To quantify these challenges, we introduce the Relative Performance Dropping Rate (RPDR), highlighting key weaknesses in 3D reasoning capabilities. Leveraging the unbiased attribute design of our dataset, we also uncover prediction biases across different attributes, with similar patterns observed in real-world image settings.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyuan Liu, Ruifei Zhu, Long Gao, Yuanxiu Zhou, Jingyu Ma, Yuantao Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning has achieved significant success in the field of remote sensing image change detection (CD), yet two major challenges remain: the scarcity of sub-meter, comprehensive open-source CD datasets, and the difficulty of achieving consistent and satisfactory detection results across images with varying change areas. To address these issues, we introduce the JL1-CD dataset, which consists of 5,000 pairs of 512 x 512 pixel images with a resolution of 0.5 to 0.75 meters. This all-inclusive dataset covers a wide range of human-induced and natural changes, including buildings, roads, hardened surfaces, woodlands, grasslands, croplands, water bodies, and photovoltaic panels, among others. Additionally, we propose a novel multi-teacher knowledge distillation (MTKD) framework that leverages the Origin-Partition (O-P) strategy to enhance CD performance. In the O-P strategy, we partition the training data based on the Change Area Ratio (CAR) to train separate models for small, medium, and large CAR values, alleviating the learning burden on each model and improving their performance within their respective partitions. Building upon this, our MTKD framework distills knowledge from multiple teacher models trained on different CAR partitions into a single student model,enabling the student model to achieve superior detection results across diverse CAR scenarios without incurring additional computational or time overhead during the inference phase. Experimental results on the JL1-CD and SYSU-CD datasets demonstrate that the MTKD framework significantly improves the performance of CD models with various network architectures and parameter sizes, achieving new state-of-the-art results.

<p>Abstract: The complex application scenarios have raised critical requirements for precise and generalizable gaze estimation methods. Recently, the pre-trained CLIP has achieved remarkable performance on various vision tasks, but its potentials have not been fully exploited in gaze estimation. In this paper, we propose a novel Differential Contrastive Training strategy, which boosts gaze estimation performance with the help of the CLIP. Accordingly, a Differential Contrastive Gaze Estimation network (DCGaze) composed of a Visual Appearance-aware branch and a Semantic Differential-aware branch is introduced. The Visual Appearance-aware branch is essentially a primary gaze estimation network and it incorporates an Adaptive Feature-refinement Unit (AFU) and a Double-head Gaze Regressor (DGR), which both help the primary network to extract informative and gaze-related appearance features. Moreover, the Semantic Difference-aware branch is designed on the basis of the CLIP's text encoder to reveal the semantic difference of gazes. This branch could further empower the Visual Appearance-aware branch with the capability of characterizing the gaze-related semantic information. Extensive experimental results on four challenging datasets over within and cross-domain tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our DCGaze. Code will be available upon acceptance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiang Gao, Shuai Yang, Jiaying Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Optical illusion hidden picture is an interesting visual perceptual phenomenon where an image is cleverly integrated into another picture in a way that is not immediately obvious to the viewer. Established on the off-the-shelf text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model, we propose a novel training-free text-guided image-to-image (I2I) translation framework dubbed as \textbf{P}hase-\textbf{T}ransferred \textbf{Diffusion} Model (PTDiffusion) for hidden art syntheses. PTDiffusion harmoniously embeds an input reference image into arbitrary scenes described by the text prompts, producing illusion images exhibiting hidden visual cues of the reference image. At the heart of our method is a plug-and-play phase transfer mechanism that dynamically and progressively transplants diffusion features' phase spectrum from the denoising process to reconstruct the reference image into the one to sample the generated illusion image, realizing deep fusion of the reference structural information and the textual semantic information in the diffusion model latent space. Furthermore, we propose asynchronous phase transfer to enable flexible control to the degree of hidden content discernability. Our method bypasses any model training and fine-tuning process, all while substantially outperforming related text-guided I2I methods in image generation quality, text fidelity, visual discernibility, and contextual naturalness for illusion picture synthesis, as demonstrated by extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Asifullah Khan, Laiba Asmatullah, Anza Malik, Shahzaib Khan, Hamna Asif</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning is a machine learning approach that generates implicit labels by learning underlined patterns and extracting discriminative features from unlabeled data without manual labelling. Contrastive learning introduces the concept of "positive" and "negative" samples, where positive pairs (e.g., variation of the same image/object) are brought together in the embedding space, and negative pairs (e.g., views from different images/objects) are pushed farther away. This methodology has shown significant improvements in image understanding and image text analysis without much reliance on labeled data. In this paper, we comprehensively discuss the terminologies, recent developments and applications of contrastive learning with respect to text-image models. Specifically, we provide an overview of the approaches of contrastive learning in text-image models in recent years. Secondly, we categorize the approaches based on different model structures. Thirdly, we further introduce and discuss the latest advances of the techniques used in the process such as pretext tasks for both images and text, architectural structures, and key trends. Lastly, we discuss the recent state-of-art applications of self-supervised contrastive learning Text-Image based models.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present the evaluation methodology, datasets and results of the BOP Challenge 2024, the 6th in a series of public competitions organized to capture the state of the art in 6D object pose estimation and related tasks. In 2024, our goal was to transition BOP from lab-like setups to real-world scenarios. First, we introduced new model-free tasks, where no 3D object models are available and methods need to onboard objects just from provided reference videos. Second, we defined a new, more practical 6D object detection task where identities of objects visible in a test image are not provided as input. Third, we introduced new BOP-H3 datasets recorded with high-resolution sensors and AR/VR headsets, closely resembling real-world scenarios. BOP-H3 include 3D models and onboarding videos to support both model-based and model-free tasks. Participants competed on seven challenge tracks. Notably, the best 2024 method for model-based 6D localization of unseen objects (FreeZeV2.1) achieves 22% higher accuracy on BOP-Classic-Core than the best 2023 method (GenFlow), and is only 4% behind the best 2023 method for seen objects (GPose2023) although being significantly slower (24.9 vs 2.7s per image). A more practical 2024 method for this task is Co-op which takes only 0.8s per image and is 13% more accurate than GenFlow. Methods have similar rankings on 6D detection as on 6D localization but higher run time. On model-based 2D detection of unseen objects, the best 2024 method (MUSE) achieves 21--29% relative improvement compared to the best 2023 method (CNOS). However, the 2D detection accuracy for unseen objects is still -35% behind the accuracy for seen objects (GDet2023), and the 2D detection stage is consequently the main bottleneck of existing pipelines for 6D localization/detection of unseen objects.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianyu Wu, Hao Yang, Xinhua Zeng, Guibing He, Zhiyu Chen, Zihui Li, Xiaochuan Zhang, Yangyang Ma, Run Fang, Yang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The diagnosis of pathological images is often limited by expert availability and regional disparities, highlighting the importance of automated diagnosis using Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Traditional multimodal models typically emphasize outcomes over the reasoning process, compromising the reliability of clinical decisions. To address the weak reasoning abilities and lack of supervised processes in pathological VLMs, we have innovatively proposed PathVLM-R1, a visual language model designed specifically for pathological images. We have based our model on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct and enhanced its performance for pathological tasks through meticulously designed post-training strategies. Firstly, we conduct supervised fine-tuning guided by pathological data to imbue the model with foundational pathological knowledge, forming a new pathological base model. Subsequently, we introduce Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and propose a dual reward-driven reinforcement learning optimization, ensuring strict constraint on logical supervision of the reasoning process and accuracy of results via cross-modal process reward and outcome accuracy reward. In the pathological image question-answering tasks, the testing results of PathVLM-R1 demonstrate a 14% improvement in accuracy compared to baseline methods, and it demonstrated superior performance compared to the Qwen2.5-VL-32B version despite having a significantly smaller parameter size. Furthermore, in out-domain data evaluation involving four medical imaging modalities: Computed Tomography (CT), dermoscopy, fundus photography, and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images: PathVLM-R1's transfer performance improved by an average of 17.3% compared to traditional SFT methods. These results clearly indicate that PathVLM-R1 not only enhances accuracy but also possesses broad applicability and expansion potential.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Run Luo, Lu Wang, Wanwei He, Xiaobo Xia</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing efforts in building Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents largely rely on the training paradigm of supervised fine-tuning on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). However, this approach not only demands extensive amounts of training data but also struggles to effectively understand GUI screenshots and generalize to unseen interfaces. The issue significantly limits its application in real-world scenarios, especially for high-level tasks. Inspired by Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) in large reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1), which efficiently enhances the problem-solving capabilities of large language models in real-world settings, we propose \name, the first reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance the GUI capabilities of LVLMs in high-level real-world task scenarios, through unified action space rule modeling. By leveraging a small amount of carefully curated high-quality data across multiple platforms (including Windows, Linux, MacOS, Android, and Web) and employing policy optimization algorithms such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to update the model, \name achieves superior performance using only 0.02\% of the data (3K vs. 13M) compared to previous state-of-the-art methods like OS-Atlas across eight benchmarks spanning three different platforms (mobile, desktop, and web). These results demonstrate the immense potential of reinforcement learning based on unified action space rule modeling in improving the execution capabilities of LVLMs for real-world GUI agent tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present GaSLight, a method that generates spatially-varying lighting from regular images. Our method proposes using HDR Gaussian Splats as light source representation, marking the first time regular images can serve as light sources in a 3D renderer. Our two-stage process first enhances the dynamic range of images plausibly and accurately by leveraging the priors embedded in diffusion models. Next, we employ Gaussian Splats to model 3D lighting, achieving spatially variant lighting. Our approach yields state-of-the-art results on HDR estimations and their applications in illuminating virtual objects and scenes. To facilitate the benchmarking of images as light sources, we introduce a novel dataset of calibrated and unsaturated HDR to evaluate images as light sources. We assess our method using a combination of this novel dataset and an existing dataset from the literature. Project page: https://lvsn.github.io/gaslight/</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaxin Huang, Sheng Miao, BangBang Yang, Yuewen Ma, Yiyi Liao</p>
<p>Abstract: Reconstructing 4D dynamic scenes from casually captured monocular videos is valuable but highly challenging, as each timestamp is observed from a single viewpoint. We introduce Vivid4D, a novel approach that enhances 4D monocular video synthesis by augmenting observation views - synthesizing multi-view videos from a monocular input. Unlike existing methods that either solely leverage geometric priors for supervision or use generative priors while overlooking geometry, we integrate both. This reformulates view augmentation as a video inpainting task, where observed views are warped into new viewpoints based on monocular depth priors. To achieve this, we train a video inpainting model on unposed web videos with synthetically generated masks that mimic warping occlusions, ensuring spatially and temporally consistent completion of missing regions. To further mitigate inaccuracies in monocular depth priors, we introduce an iterative view augmentation strategy and a robust reconstruction loss. Experiments demonstrate that our method effectively improves monocular 4D scene reconstruction and completion. See our project page: https://xdimlab.github.io/Vivid4D/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tobias Hallmen, Robin-Nico Kampa, Fabian Deuser, Norbert Oswald, Elisabeth Andr\'e</p>
<p>Abstract: In this study, we present our methodology for two tasks: the Emotional Mimicry Intensity (EMI) Estimation Challenge and the Behavioural Ambivalence/Hesitancy (BAH) Recognition Challenge, both conducted as part of the 8th Workshop and Competition on Affective & Behavior Analysis in-the-wild. We utilize a Wav2Vec 2.0 model pre-trained on a large podcast dataset to extract various audio features, capturing both linguistic and paralinguistic information. Our approach incorporates a valence-arousal-dominance (VAD) module derived from Wav2Vec 2.0, a BERT text encoder, and a vision transformer (ViT) with predictions subsequently processed through a long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture or a convolution-like method for temporal modeling. We integrate the textual and visual modality into our analysis, recognizing that semantic content provides valuable contextual cues and underscoring that the meaning of speech often conveys more critical insights than its acoustic counterpart alone. Fusing in the vision modality helps in some cases to interpret the textual modality more precisely. This combined approach results in significant performance improvements, achieving in EMI $\rho_{\text{TEST}} = 0.706$ and in BAH $F1_{\text{TEST}} = 0.702$, securing first place in the EMI challenge and second place in the BAH challenge.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dubing Chen, Huan Zheng, Jin Fang, Xingping Dong, Xianfei Li, Wenlong Liao, Tao He, Pai Peng, Jianbing Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: We present GDFusion, a temporal fusion method for vision-based 3D semantic occupancy prediction (VisionOcc). GDFusion opens up the underexplored aspects of temporal fusion within the VisionOcc framework, focusing on both temporal cues and fusion strategies. It systematically examines the entire VisionOcc pipeline, identifying three fundamental yet previously overlooked temporal cues: scene-level consistency, motion calibration, and geometric complementation. These cues capture diverse facets of temporal evolution and make distinct contributions across various modules in the VisionOcc framework. To effectively fuse temporal signals across heterogeneous representations, we propose a novel fusion strategy by reinterpreting the formulation of vanilla RNNs. This reinterpretation leverages gradient descent on features to unify the integration of diverse temporal information, seamlessly embedding the proposed temporal cues into the network. Extensive experiments on nuScenes demonstrate that GDFusion significantly outperforms established baselines. Notably, on Occ3D benchmark, it achieves 1.4\%-4.8\% mIoU improvements and reduces memory consumption by 27\%-72\%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dachun Kai, Yueyi Zhang, Jin Wang, Zeyu Xiao, Zhiwei Xiong, Xiaoyan Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the task of blurry video super-resolution (BVSR), aiming to generate high-resolution (HR) videos from low-resolution (LR) and blurry inputs. Current BVSR methods often fail to restore sharp details at high resolutions, resulting in noticeable artifacts and jitter due to insufficient motion information for deconvolution and the lack of high-frequency details in LR frames. To address these challenges, we introduce event signals into BVSR and propose a novel event-enhanced network, Ev-DeblurVSR. To effectively fuse information from frames and events for feature deblurring, we introduce a reciprocal feature deblurring module that leverages motion information from intra-frame events to deblur frame features while reciprocally using global scene context from the frames to enhance event features. Furthermore, to enhance temporal consistency, we propose a hybrid deformable alignment module that fully exploits the complementary motion information from inter-frame events and optical flow to improve motion estimation in the deformable alignment process. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Ev-DeblurVSR establishes a new state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Notably, on real data, our method is +2.59 dB more accurate and 7.28$\times$ faster than the recent best BVSR baseline FMA-Net. Code: https://github.com/DachunKai/Ev-DeblurVSR.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have been driven by diffusion models and autoregressive frameworks, yet critical challenges persist in harmonizing prompt adherence, visual quality, motion dynamics, and duration: compromises in motion dynamics to enhance temporal visual quality, constrained video duration (5-10 seconds) to prioritize resolution, and inadequate shot-aware generation stemming from general-purpose MLLMs' inability to interpret cinematic grammar, such as shot composition, actor expressions, and camera motions. These intertwined limitations hinder realistic long-form synthesis and professional film-style generation. To address these limitations, we propose SkyReels-V2, an Infinite-length Film Generative Model, that synergizes Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM), Multi-stage Pretraining, Reinforcement Learning, and Diffusion Forcing Framework. Firstly, we design a comprehensive structural representation of video that combines the general descriptions by the Multi-modal LLM and the detailed shot language by sub-expert models. Aided with human annotation, we then train a unified Video Captioner, named SkyCaptioner-V1, to efficiently label the video data. Secondly, we establish progressive-resolution pretraining for the fundamental video generation, followed by a four-stage post-training enhancement: Initial concept-balanced Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) improves baseline quality; Motion-specific Reinforcement Learning (RL) training with human-annotated and synthetic distortion data addresses dynamic artifacts; Our diffusion forcing framework with non-decreasing noise schedules enables long-video synthesis in an efficient search space; Final high-quality SFT refines visual fidelity.

<p>Abstract: Creating a photorealistic scene and human reconstruction from a single monocular in-the-wild video figures prominently in the perception of a human-centric 3D world. Recent neural rendering advances have enabled holistic human-scene reconstruction but require pre-calibrated camera and human poses, and days of training time. In this work, we introduce a novel unified framework that simultaneously performs camera tracking, human pose estimation and human-scene reconstruction in an online fashion. 3D Gaussian Splatting is utilized to learn Gaussian primitives for humans and scenes efficiently, and reconstruction-based camera tracking and human pose estimation modules are designed to enable holistic understanding and effective disentanglement of pose and appearance. Specifically, we design a human deformation module to reconstruct the details and enhance generalizability to out-of-distribution poses faithfully. Aiming to learn the spatial correlation between human and scene accurately, we introduce occlusion-aware human silhouette rendering and monocular geometric priors, which further improve reconstruction quality. Experiments on the EMDB and NeuMan datasets demonstrate superior or on-par performance with existing methods in camera tracking, human pose estimation, novel view synthesis and runtime.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Antonio Emanuele Cin\`a, Ambra Demontis, Battista Biggio, Fabio Roli, Marcello Pelillo</p>
<p>Abstract: Sponge examples are test-time inputs optimized to increase energy consumption and prediction latency of deep networks deployed on hardware accelerators. By increasing the fraction of neurons activated during classification, these attacks reduce sparsity in network activation patterns, worsening the performance of hardware accelerators. In this work, we present a novel training-time attack, named sponge poisoning, which aims to worsen energy consumption and prediction latency of neural networks on any test input without affecting classification accuracy. To stage this attack, we assume that the attacker can control only a few model updates during training -- a likely scenario, e.g., when model training is outsourced to an untrusted third party or distributed via federated learning. Our extensive experiments on image classification tasks show that sponge poisoning is effective, and that fine-tuning poisoned models to repair them poses prohibitive costs for most users, highlighting that tackling sponge poisoning remains an open issue.</p>

<p>Abstract: Not yet. We present SPACE, a benchmark that systematically evaluates spatial cognition in frontier models. Our benchmark builds on decades of research in cognitive science. It evaluates large-scale mapping abilities that are brought to bear when an organism traverses physical environments, smaller-scale reasoning about object shapes and layouts, and cognitive infrastructure such as spatial attention and memory. For many tasks, we instantiate parallel presentations via text and images, allowing us to benchmark both large language models and large multimodal models. Results suggest that contemporary frontier models fall short of the spatial intelligence of animals, performing near chance level on a number of classic tests of animal cognition.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaeseong Lee, Taewoong Kang, Marcel C. B\"uhler, Min-Jung Kim, Sungwon Hwang, Junha Hyung, Hyojin Jang, Jaegul Choo</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in head avatar rendering using Gaussian primitives have achieved significantly high-fidelity results. Although precise head geometry is crucial for applications like mesh reconstruction and relighting, current methods struggle to capture intricate geometric details and render unseen poses due to their reliance on similarity transformations, which cannot handle stretch and shear transforms essential for detailed deformations of geometry. To address this, we propose SurFhead, a novel method that reconstructs riggable head geometry from RGB videos using 2D Gaussian surfels, which offer well-defined geometric properties, such as precise depth from fixed ray intersections and normals derived from their surface orientation, making them advantageous over 3D counterparts. SurFhead ensures high-fidelity rendering of both normals and images, even in extreme poses, by leveraging classical mesh-based deformation transfer and affine transformation interpolation. SurFhead introduces precise geometric deformation and blends surfels through polar decomposition of transformations, including those affecting normals. Our key contribution lies in bridging classical graphics techniques, such as mesh-based deformation, with modern Gaussian primitives, achieving state-of-the-art geometry reconstruction and rendering quality. Unlike previous avatar rendering approaches, SurFhead enables efficient reconstruction driven by Gaussian primitives while preserving high-fidelity geometry.</p>

<p>Abstract: Underwater imagery often suffers from severe degradation resulting in low visual quality and reduced object detection performance. This work aims to evaluate state-of-the-art image enhancement models, investigate their effects on underwater object detection, and explore their potential to improve detection performance. To this end, we apply nine recent underwater image enhancement models, covering physical, non-physical and learning-based categories, to two recent underwater image datasets. Following this, we conduct joint qualitative and quantitative analyses on the original and enhanced images, revealing the discrepancy between the two analyses, and analyzing changes in the quality distribution of the images after enhancement. We then train three recent object detection models on the original datasets, selecting the best-performing detector for further analysis. This detector is subsequently re-trained on the enhanced datasets to evaluate changes in detection performance, highlighting the adverse effect of enhancement on detection performance at the dataset level. Next, we perform a correlation study to examine the relationship between various enhancement metrics and the mean Average Precision (mAP). Finally, we conduct an image-level analysis that reveals images of improved detection performance after enhancement. The findings of this study demonstrate the potential of image enhancement to improve detection performance and provide valuable insights for researchers to further explore the effects of enhancement on detection at the individual image level, rather than at the dataset level.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Yin, Guangzong Si, Zilei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Contrastive decoding strategies are widely used to reduce hallucinations in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). These methods work by constructing contrastive samples to induce hallucinations and then suppressing them in the output distribution. However, this paper demonstrates that such approaches fail to effectively mitigate the hallucination problem. The performance improvements observed on POPE Benchmark are largely driven by two misleading factors: (1) crude, unidirectional adjustments to the model's output distribution and (2) the adaptive plausibility constraint, which reduces the sampling strategy to greedy search. To further illustrate these issues, we introduce a series of spurious improvement methods and evaluate their performance against contrastive decoding techniques. Experimental results reveal that the observed performance gains in contrastive decoding are entirely unrelated to its intended goal of mitigating hallucinations. Our findings challenge common assumptions about the effectiveness of contrastive decoding strategies and pave the way for developing genuinely effective solutions to hallucinations in MLLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kevin Xie, Amirmojtaba Sabour, Jiahui Huang, Despoina Paschalidou, Greg Klar, Umar Iqbal, Sanja Fidler, Xiaohui Zeng</p>
<p>Abstract: High resolution panoramic video content is paramount for immersive experiences in Virtual Reality, but is non-trivial to collect as it requires specialized equipment and intricate camera setups. In this work, we introduce VideoPanda, a novel approach for synthesizing 360$^\circ$ videos conditioned on text or single-view video data. VideoPanda leverages multi-view attention layers to augment a video diffusion model, enabling it to generate consistent multi-view videos that can be combined into immersive panoramic content. VideoPanda is trained jointly using two conditions: text-only and single-view video, and supports autoregressive generation of long-videos. To overcome the computational burden of multi-view video generation, we randomly subsample the duration and camera views used during training and show that the model is able to gracefully generalize to generating more frames during inference. Extensive evaluations on both real-world and synthetic video datasets demonstrate that VideoPanda generates more realistic and coherent 360$^\circ$ panoramas across all input conditions compared to existing methods.

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13037">Towards Cardiac MRI Foundation Models: Comprehensive Visual-Tabular Representations for Whole-Heart Assessment and Beyond</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yundi Zhang, Paul Hager, Che Liu, Suprosanna Shit, Chen Chen, Daniel Rueckert, Jiazhen Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is the gold standard for non-invasive cardiac assessment, offering rich spatio-temporal views of the cardiac anatomy and physiology. Patient-level health factors, such as demographics, metabolic, and lifestyle, are known to substantially influence cardiovascular health and disease risk, yet remain uncaptured by CMR alone. To holistically understand cardiac health and to enable the best possible interpretation of an individual's disease risk, CMR and patient-level factors must be jointly exploited within an integrated framework. Recent multi-modal approaches have begun to bridge this gap, yet they often rely on limited spatio-temporal data and focus on isolated clinical tasks, thereby hindering the development of a comprehensive representation for cardiac health evaluation. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ViTa, a step toward foundation models that delivers a comprehensive representation of the heart and a precise interpretation of individual disease risk. Leveraging data from 42,000 UK Biobank participants, ViTa integrates 3D+T cine stacks from short-axis and long-axis views, enabling a complete capture of the cardiac cycle. These imaging data are then fused with detailed tabular patient-level factors, enabling context-aware insights. This multi-modal paradigm supports a wide spectrum of downstream tasks, including cardiac phenotype and physiological feature prediction, segmentation, and classification of cardiac and metabolic diseases within a single unified framework. By learning a shared latent representation that bridges rich imaging features and patient context, ViTa moves beyond traditional, task-specific models toward a universal, patient-specific understanding of cardiac health, highlighting its potential to advance clinical utility and scalability in cardiac analysis.</p>
