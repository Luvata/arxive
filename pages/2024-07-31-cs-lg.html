<p><b>Authors:</b> Bryar A. Hassan, Noor Bahjat Tayfor, Alla A. Hassan, Aram M. Ahmed, Tarik A. Rashid, Naz N. Abdalla</p>
<p>Abstract: Data clustering involves identifying latent similarities within a dataset and organizing them into clusters or groups. The outcomes of various clustering algorithms differ as they are susceptible to the intrinsic characteristics of the original dataset, including noise and dimensionality. The effectiveness of such clustering procedures directly impacts the homogeneity of clusters, underscoring the significance of evaluating algorithmic outcomes. Consequently, the assessment of clustering quality presents a significant and complex endeavor. A pivotal aspect affecting clustering validation is the cluster validity metric, which aids in determining the optimal number of clusters. The main goal of this study is to comprehensively review and explain the mathematical operation of internal and external cluster validity indices, but not all, to categorize these indices and to brainstorm suggestions for future advancement of clustering validation research. In addition, we review and evaluate the performance of internal and external clustering validation indices on the most common clustering algorithms, such as the evolutionary clustering algorithm star (ECA*). Finally, we suggest a classification framework for examining the functionality of both internal and external clustering validation measures regarding their ideal values, user-friendliness, responsiveness to input data, and appropriateness across various fields. This classification aids researchers in selecting the appropriate clustering validation measure to suit their specific requirements.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20249">Revisiting the Disequilibrium Issues in Tackling Heart Disease Classification Tasks</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Thao Hoang, Linh Nguyen, Khoi Do, Duong Nguyen, Viet Dung Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: In the field of heart disease classification, two primary obstacles arise. Firstly, existing Electrocardiogram (ECG) datasets consistently demonstrate imbalances and biases across various modalities. Secondly, these time-series data consist of diverse lead signals, causing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to become overfitting to the one with higher power, hence diminishing the performance of the Deep Learning (DL) process. In addition, when facing an imbalanced dataset, performance from such high-dimensional data may be susceptible to overfitting. Current efforts predominantly focus on enhancing DL models by designing novel architectures, despite these evident challenges, seemingly overlooking the core issues, therefore hindering advancements in heart disease classification. To address these obstacles, our proposed approach introduces two straightforward and direct methods to enhance the classification tasks. To address the high dimensionality issue, we employ a Channel-wise Magnitude Equalizer (CME) on signal-encoded images. This approach reduces redundancy in the feature data range, highlighting changes in the dataset. Simultaneously, to counteract data imbalance, we propose the Inverted Weight Logarithmic Loss (IWL) to alleviate imbalances among the data. When applying IWL loss, the accuracy of state-of-the-art models (SOTA) increases up to 5% in the CPSC2018 dataset. CME in combination with IWL also surpasses the classification results of other baseline models from 5% to 10%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinhe Li, Zhuoying Feng, Yezeng Chen, Weichen Dai, Zixu He, Yi Zhou, Shuhong Jiao</p>
<p>Abstract: To reduce the experimental validation workload for chemical researchers and accelerate the design and optimization of high-energy-density lithium metal batteries, we aim to leverage models to automatically predict Coulombic Efficiency (CE) based on the composition of liquid electrolytes. There are mainly two representative paradigms in existing methods: machine learning and deep learning. However, the former requires intelligent input feature selection and reliable computational methods, leading to error propagation from feature estimation to model prediction, while the latter (e.g. MultiModal-MoLFormer) faces challenges of poor predictive performance and overfitting due to limited diversity in augmented data. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel method COEFF (COlumbic EFficiency prediction via Fine-tuned models), which consists of two stages: pre-training a chemical general model and fine-tuning on downstream domain data. Firstly, we adopt the publicly available MoLFormer model to obtain feature vectors for each solvent and salt in the electrolyte. Then, we perform a weighted average of embeddings for each token across all molecules, with weights determined by the respective electrolyte component ratios. Finally, we input the obtained electrolyte features into a Multi-layer Perceptron or Kolmogorov-Arnold Network to predict CE. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our method achieves SOTA for predicting CE compared to all baselines. Data and code used in this work will be made publicly available after the paper is published.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Habib Hajimolahoseini, Walid Ahmed, Austin Wen, Yang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Tensor decomposition is a mathematically supported technique for data compression. It consists of applying some kind of a Low Rank Decomposition technique on the tensors or matrices in order to reduce the redundancy of the data. However, it is not a popular technique for compressing the AI models duo to the high number of new layers added to the architecture after decomposition. Although the number of parameters could shrink significantly, it could result in the model be more than twice deeper which could add some latency to the training or inference. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study about how to modify low rank decomposition technique in AI models so that we could benefit from both high accuracy and low memory consumption as well as speeding up the training and inference</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eduardo Soares, Victor Shirasuna, Emilio Vital Brazil, Renato Cerqueira, Dmitry Zubarev, Kristin Schmidt</p>
<p>Abstract: Large-scale pre-training methodologies for chemical language models represent a breakthrough in cheminformatics. These methods excel in tasks such as property prediction and molecule generation by learning contextualized representations of input tokens through self-supervised learning on large unlabeled corpora. Typically, this involves pre-training on unlabeled data followed by fine-tuning on specific tasks, reducing dependence on annotated datasets and broadening chemical language representation understanding. This paper introduces a large encoder-decoder chemical foundation models pre-trained on a curated dataset of 91 million SMILES samples sourced from PubChem, which is equivalent to 4 billion of molecular tokens. The proposed foundation model supports different complex tasks, including quantum property prediction, and offer flexibility with two main variants (289M and $8\times289M$). Our experiments across multiple benchmark datasets validate the capacity of the proposed model in providing state-of-the-art results for different tasks. We also provide a preliminary assessment of the compositionality of the embedding space as a prerequisite for the reasoning tasks. We demonstrate that the produced latent space is separable compared to the state-of-the-art with few-shot learning capabilities.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20271">Learn while Unlearn: An Iterative Unlearning Framework for Generative Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyu Tang, Ye Liu, Xukai Liu, Kai Zhang, Yanghai Zhang, Qi Liu, Enhong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in machine learning, especially in Natural Language Processing (NLP), have led to the development of sophisticated models trained on vast datasets, but this progress has raised concerns about potential sensitive information leakage. In response, regulatory measures like the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) have driven the exploration of Machine Unlearning techniques, which aim to enable models to selectively forget certain data entries. While early approaches focused on pre-processing methods, recent research has shifted towards training-based machine unlearning methods. However, many existing methods require access to original training data, posing challenges in scenarios where such data is unavailable. Besides, directly facilitating unlearning may undermine the language model's general expressive ability. To this end, in this paper, we introduce the Iterative Contrastive Unlearning (ICU) framework, which addresses these challenges by incorporating three key components. We propose a Knowledge Unlearning Induction module for unlearning specific target sequences and a Contrastive Learning Enhancement module to prevent degrading in generation capacity. Additionally, an Iterative Unlearning Refinement module is integrated to make the process more adaptive to each target sample respectively. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of ICU in maintaining performance while efficiently unlearning sensitive information, offering a promising avenue for privacy-conscious machine learning applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper we investigate the explainability of transformer models and their plausibility for hate speech and counter speech detection. We compare representatives of four different explainability approaches, i.e., gradient-based, perturbation-based, attention-based, and prototype-based approaches, and analyze them quantitatively with an ablation study and qualitatively in a user study. Results show that perturbation-based explainability performs best, followed by gradient-based and attention-based explainability. Prototypebased experiments did not yield useful results. Overall, we observe that explainability strongly supports the users in better understanding the model predictions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Prabhant Singh, Joaquin Vanschoren</p>
<p>Abstract: Hand-designing Neural Networks is a tedious process that requires significant expertise. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) frameworks offer a very useful and popular solution that helps to democratize AI. However, these NAS frameworks are often computationally expensive to run, which limits their applicability and accessibility. In this paper, we propose a novel transfer learning approach, capable of effectively transferring pretrained supernets based on Optimal Transport or multi-dataset pretaining. This method can be generally applied to NAS methods based on Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS). Through extensive experiments across dozens of image classification tasks, we demonstrate that transferring pretrained supernets in this way can not only drastically speed up the supernet training which then finds optimal models (3 to 5 times faster on average), but even yield that outperform those found when running DARTS methods from scratch. We also observe positive transfer to almost all target datasets, making it very robust. Besides drastically improving the applicability of NAS methods, this also opens up new applications for continual learning and related fields.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shide Zhou, Tianlin Li, Yihao Huang, Ling Shi, Kailong Wang, Yang Liu, Haoyu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep Neural networks (DNNs), extensively applied across diverse disciplines, are characterized by their integrated and monolithic architectures, setting them apart from conventional software systems. This architectural difference introduces particular challenges to maintenance tasks, such as model restructuring (e.g., model compression), re-adaptation (e.g., fitting new samples), and incremental development (e.g., continual knowledge accumulation). Prior research addresses these challenges by identifying task-critical neuron layers, and dividing neural networks into semantically-similar sequential modules. However, such layer-level approaches fail to precisely identify and manipulate neuron-level semantic components, restricting their applicability to finer-grained model maintenance tasks. In this work, we implement NeuSemSlice, a novel framework that introduces the semantic slicing technique to effectively identify critical neuron-level semantic components in DNN models for semantic-aware model maintenance tasks. Specifically, semantic slicing identifies, categorizes and merges critical neurons across different categories and layers according to their semantic similarity, enabling their flexibility and effectiveness in the subsequent tasks. For semantic-aware model maintenance tasks, we provide a series of novel strategies based on semantic slicing to enhance NeuSemSlice. They include semantic components (i.e., critical neurons) preservation for model restructuring, critical neuron tuning for model re-adaptation, and non-critical neuron training for model incremental development. A thorough evaluation has demonstrated that NeuSemSlice significantly outperforms baselines in all three tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fuling Chen, Kevin Vinsen, Arthur Filoche</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate wind speed and direction forecasting is paramount across many sectors, spanning agriculture, renewable energy generation, and bushfire management. However, conventional forecasting models encounter significant challenges in precisely predicting wind conditions at high spatial resolutions for individual locations or small geographical areas (< 20 km2) and capturing medium to long-range temporal trends and comprehensive spatio-temporal patterns. This study focuses on a spatial temporal approach for high-resolution gridded wind forecasting at the height of 3 and 10 metres across large areas of the Southwest of Western Australia to overcome these challenges. The model utilises the data that covers a broad geographic area and harnesses a diverse array of meteorological factors, including terrain characteristics, air pressure, 10-metre wind forecasts from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, and limited observation data from sparsely distributed weather stations (such as 3-metre wind profiles, humidity, and temperature), the model demonstrates promising advancements in wind forecasting accuracy and reliability across the entire region of interest. This paper shows the potential of our machine learning model for wind forecasts across various prediction horizons and spatial coverage. It can help facilitate more informed decision-making and enhance resilience across critical sectors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mile Mitrovic, Dmitry Titov, Klim Volkhov, Irina Lukicheva, Andrey Kudryavzev, Petr Vorobev, Qi Li, Vladimir Terzija</p>
<p>Abstract: As a new practical and economical solution to the aging problem of overhead line (OHL) assets, the technical policies of most power grid companies in the world experienced a gradual transition from scheduled preventive maintenance to a risk-based approach in asset management. Even though the accumulation of contamination is predictable within a certain degree, there are currently no effective ways to identify the risk of the insulator flashover in order to plan its replacement. This paper presents a novel machine learning (ML) based method for estimating the flashover probability of the cup-and-pin glass insulator string. The proposed method is based on the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) supervised ML model, in which the leakage current (LC) features and applied voltage are used as the inputs. The established model can estimate the critical flashover voltage (U50%) for various designs of OHL insulators with different voltage levels. The proposed method is also able to accurately determine the condition of the insulator strings and instruct asset management engineers to take appropriate actions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Karl Friston, Conor Heins, Tim Verbelen, Lancelot Da Costa, Tommaso Salvatori, Dimitrije Markovic, Alexander Tschantz, Magnus Koudahl, Christopher Buckley, Thomas Parr</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper describes a discrete state-space model -- and accompanying methods -- for generative modelling. This model generalises partially observed Markov decision processes to include paths as latent variables, rendering it suitable for active inference and learning in a dynamic setting. Specifically, we consider deep or hierarchical forms using the renormalisation group. The ensuing renormalising generative models (RGM) can be regarded as discrete homologues of deep convolutional neural networks or continuous state-space models in generalised coordinates of motion. By construction, these scale-invariant models can be used to learn compositionality over space and time, furnishing models of paths or orbits; i.e., events of increasing temporal depth and itinerancy. This technical note illustrates the automatic discovery, learning and deployment of RGMs using a series of applications. We start with image classification and then consider the compression and generation of movies and music. Finally, we apply the same variational principles to the learning of Atari-like games.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this work, we introduce ChemBFN, a language model that handles chemistry tasks based on Bayesian flow networks working on discrete data. A new accuracy schedule is proposed to improve the sampling quality by significantly reducing the reconstruction loss. We show evidence that our method is appropriate for generating molecules with satisfied diversity even when a smaller number of sampling steps is used. A classifier-free guidance method is adapted for conditional generation. It is also worthwhile to point out that after generative training, our model can be fine-tuned on regression and classification tasks with the state-of-the-art performance, which opens the gate of building all-in-one models in a single module style.

<p>Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning often requires a quality dataset that we can train a policy on. However, in many situations, it is not possible to get such a dataset, nor is it easy to train a policy to perform well in the actual environment given the offline data. We propose using data distillation to train and distill a better dataset which can then be used for training a better policy model. We show that our method is able to synthesize a dataset where a model trained on it achieves similar performance to a model trained on the full dataset or a model trained using percentile behavioral cloning.

<p>Abstract: This article describes the methods that achieved 4th and 6th place in the forecasting and investment challenges, respectively, of the M6 competition, ultimately securing the 1st place in the overall duathlon ranking. In the forecasting challenge, we tested a novel meta-learning model that utilizes hypernetworks to design a parametric model tailored to a specific family of forecasting tasks. This approach allowed us to leverage similarities observed across individual forecasting tasks while also acknowledging potential heterogeneity in their data generating processes. The model's training can be directly performed with backpropagation, eliminating the need for reliance on higher-order derivatives and is equivalent to a simultaneous search over the space of parametric functions and their optimal parameter values. The proposed model's capabilities extend beyond M6, demonstrating superiority over state-of-the-art meta-learning methods in the sinusoidal regression task and outperforming conventional parametric models on time-series from the M4 competition. In the investment challenge, we adjusted portfolio weights to induce greater or smaller correlation between our submission and that of other participants, depending on the current ranking, aiming to maximize the probability of achieving a good rank.</p>

<p>Abstract: Bayesian Inference with Markov Chain Monte Carlo requires efficient computation of the likelihood function. In some scientific applications, the likelihood must be computed by numerically solving a partial differential equation, which can be prohibitively expensive. We demonstrate that some such problems can be made tractable by amortizing the computation with a surrogate likelihood function implemented by a neural network. We show that this has two additional benefits: reducing noise in the likelihood evaluations and providing fast gradient calculations. In experiments, the approach is applied to a model of heliospheric transport of galactic cosmic rays, where it enables efficient sampling from the posterior of latent parameters in the Parker equation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junda Wu, Xintong Li, Tong Yu, Yu Wang, Xiang Chen, Jiuxiang Gu, Lina Yao, Jingbo Shang, Julian McAuley</p>
<p>Abstract: Instruction tuning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) aims to smoothly integrate a backbone LLM with a pre-trained feature encoder for downstream tasks. The major challenge is how to efficiently find the synergy through cooperative learning where LLMs adapt their reasoning abilities in downstream tasks while feature encoders adjust their encoding to provide more relevant modal information. In this paper, we analyze the MLLM instruction tuning from both theoretical and empirical perspectives, where we find unbalanced learning between the two components, i.e., the feature encoder and the LLM, can cause diminishing learning gradients that slow the model convergence and often lead to sub-optimal results due to insufficient learning. Inspired by our findings, we propose a measurement to quantitatively evaluate the learning balance, based on which we further design a dynamic learning scheduler that better coordinates the learning. In addition, we introduce an auxiliary loss regularization method to promote updating of the generation distribution of MLLMs considering the learning state of each model component, which potentially prevents each component from gradient diminishing and enables a more accurate estimation of the learning balance coefficient. We conduct experiments with multiple LLM backbones and feature encoders, where our techniques are model-agnostic and can be generically integrated with various MLLM backbones. Experiment results on multiple downstream tasks and modalities in vision and audio, demonstrate the proposed method's better efficiency and effectiveness in MLLM instruction tuning.</p>

Our contributions include development of the Multi-Critic Actor-Critic (MCAC) algorithm, establishing its convergence, and empirical evidence demonstrating its efficacy. Our experimental results show that MCAC significantly outperforms the baseline actor-critic algorithm, achieving up to 22.76x faster autonomy transfer and higher reward accumulation. This advancement underscores the potential of leveraging accumulated knowledge for efficient adaptation in RL applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: 3D Euclidean symmetry equivariant neural networks have demonstrated notable success in modeling complex physical systems. We introduce a framework for relaxed $E(3)$ graph equivariant neural networks that can learn and represent symmetry breaking within continuous groups. Building on the existing e3nn framework, we propose the use of relaxed weights to allow for controlled symmetry breaking. We show empirically that these relaxed weights learn the correct amount of symmetry breaking.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nima Shoghi, Pooya Shoghi, Anuroop Sriram, Abhishek Das</p>
<p>Abstract: Using "soft" targets to improve model performance has been shown to be effective in classification settings, but the usage of soft targets for regression is a much less studied topic in machine learning. The existing literature on the usage of soft targets for regression fails to properly assess the method's limitations, and empirical evaluation is quite limited. In this work, we assess the strengths and drawbacks of existing methods when applied to molecular property regression tasks. Our assessment outlines key biases present in existing methods and proposes methods to address them, evaluated through careful ablation studies. We leverage these insights to propose Distributional Mixture of Experts (DMoE): A model-independent, and data-independent method for regression which trains a model to predict probability distributions of its targets. Our proposed loss function combines the cross entropy between predicted and target distributions and the L1 distance between their expected values to produce a loss function that is robust to the outlined biases. We evaluate the performance of DMoE on different molecular property prediction datasets -- Open Catalyst (OC20), MD17, and QM9 -- across different backbone model architectures -- SchNet, GemNet, and Graphormer. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method is a promising alternative to classical regression for molecular property prediction tasks, showing improvements over baselines on all datasets and architectures.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20496">Toward Efficient Permutation for Hierarchical N:M Sparsity on GPUs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Seungmin Yu, Xiaodie Yi, Hayun Lee, Dongkun Shin</p>
<p>Abstract: N:M sparsity pruning is a powerful technique for compressing deep neural networks, utilizing NVIDIA's Sparse Tensor Core technology. This method benefits from hardware support for sparse indexing, enabling the adoption of fine-grained sparsity to maintain model accuracy while minimizing the overhead typically associated with irregular data access. Although restricted to a fixed level of sparsity due to its reliance on hardware, N:M sparsity can be combined with coarser sparsity techniques to achieve diverse compression ratios. Initially, column-wise vector sparsity is applied to a dense model, followed by row-wise N:M sparsity on the preserved column vectors. We call this multi-level approach as hierarchical N:M (HiNM) sparsity. Similar to earlier single-level sparsity techniques, HiNM sparsity necessitates an effective channel permutation strategy to maximize the accuracy of the compressed networks. However, it introduces further complexities by requiring the rearrangement of both input and output channels, addressing challenges such as permutation sequence, HiNM-sparsity-aware permutation, and maintaining consistency in channel ordering across layers. In this paper, we introduce a channel permutation method designed specifically for HiNM sparsity, named gyro-permutation. This method is crafted to exploit the unique characteristics of HiNM pruning, incorporating a strategic policy in each permutation phase, including channel sampling, clustering, and assignment, to circumvent local minima. Additionally, we have developed a GPU kernel that facilitates independent layer permutation during the execution of HiNM sparse networks. Our extensive experimental evaluations on various DNN models demonstrate that our gyro-permutation significantly enhances the accuracy of HiNM sparse networks, allowing them to reach performance levels comparable to those of unstructured sparse networks.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20499">Optimizing Long-tailed Link Prediction in Graph Neural Networks through Structure Representation Enhancement</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yakun Wang, Daixin Wang, Hongrui Liu, Binbin Hu, Yingcui Yan, Qiyang Zhang, Zhiqiang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Link prediction, as a fundamental task for graph neural networks (GNNs), has boasted significant progress in varied domains. Its success is typically influenced by the expressive power of node representation, but recent developments reveal the inferior performance of low-degree nodes owing to their sparse neighbor connections, known as the degree-based long-tailed problem. Will the degree-based long-tailed distribution similarly constrain the efficacy of GNNs on link prediction? Unexpectedly, our study reveals that only a mild correlation exists between node degree and predictive accuracy, and more importantly, the number of common neighbors between node pairs exhibits a strong correlation with accuracy. Considering node pairs with less common neighbors, i.e., tail node pairs, make up a substantial fraction of the dataset but achieve worse performance, we propose that link prediction also faces the long-tailed problem. Therefore, link prediction of GNNs is greatly hindered by the tail node pairs. After knowing the weakness of link prediction, a natural question is how can we eliminate the negative effects of the skewed long-tailed distribution on common neighbors so as to improve the performance of link prediction? Towards this end, we introduce our long-tailed framework (LTLP), which is designed to enhance the performance of tail node pairs on link prediction by increasing common neighbors. Two key modules in LTLP respectively supplement high-quality edges for tail node pairs and enforce representational alignment between head and tail node pairs within the same category, thereby improving the performance of tail node pairs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Long-term time series forecasting in centralized environments poses unique challenges regarding data privacy, communication overhead, and scalability. To address these challenges, we propose FedTime, a federated large language model (LLM) tailored for long-range time series prediction. Specifically, we introduce a federated pre-trained LLM with fine-tuning and alignment strategies. Prior to the learning process, we employ K-means clustering to partition edge devices or clients into distinct clusters, thereby facilitating more focused model training. We also incorporate channel independence and patching to better preserve local semantic information, ensuring that important contextual details are retained while minimizing the risk of information loss. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our FedTime model through extensive experiments on various real-world forecasting benchmarks, showcasing substantial improvements over recent approaches. In addition, we demonstrate the efficiency of FedTime in streamlining resource usage, resulting in reduced communication overhead.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yupei Yang, Biwei Huang, Shikui Tu, Lei Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: The effectiveness of model training heavily relies on the quality of available training resources. However, budget constraints often impose limitations on data collection efforts. To tackle this challenge, we introduce causal exploration in this paper, a strategy that leverages the underlying causal knowledge for both data collection and model training. We, in particular, focus on enhancing the sample efficiency and reliability of the world model learning within the domain of task-agnostic reinforcement learning. During the exploration phase, the agent actively selects actions expected to yield causal insights most beneficial for world model training. Concurrently, the causal knowledge is acquired and incrementally refined with the ongoing collection of data. We demonstrate that causal exploration aids in learning accurate world models using fewer data and provide theoretical guarantees for its convergence. Empirical experiments, on both synthetic data and real-world applications, further validate the benefits of causal exploration.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generative AI technologies have been deployed in many places, such as (multimodal) large language models and vision generative models. Their remarkable performance should be attributed to massive training data and emergent reasoning abilities. However, the models would memorize and generate sensitive, biased, or dangerous information originated from the training data especially those from web crawl. New machine unlearning (MU) techniques are being developed to reduce or eliminate undesirable knowledge and its effects from the models, because those that were designed for traditional classification tasks could not be applied for Generative AI. We offer a comprehensive survey on many things about MU in Generative AI, such as a new problem formulation, evaluation methods, and a structured discussion on the advantages and limitations of different kinds of MU techniques. It also presents several critical challenges and promising directions in MU research. A curated list of readings can be found: https://github.com/franciscoliu/GenAI-MU-Reading.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sara Abdali, Jia He, CJ Barberan, Richard Anarfi</p>
<p>Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has garnered significant popularity and wielded immense power across various domains within Natural Language Processing (NLP). While their capabilities are undeniably impressive, it is crucial to identify and scrutinize their vulnerabilities especially when those vulnerabilities can have costly consequences. One such LLM, trained to provide a concise summarization from medical documents could unequivocally leak personal patient data when prompted surreptitiously. This is just one of many unfortunate examples that have been unveiled and further research is necessary to comprehend the underlying reasons behind such vulnerabilities. In this study, we delve into multiple sections of vulnerabilities which are model-based, training-time, inference-time vulnerabilities, and discuss mitigation strategies including "Model Editing" which aims at modifying LLMs behavior, and "Chroma Teaming" which incorporates synergy of multiple teaming strategies to enhance LLMs' resilience. This paper will synthesize the findings from each vulnerability section and propose new directions of research and development. By understanding the focal points of current vulnerabilities, we can better anticipate and mitigate future risks, paving the road for more robust and secure LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate estimation of counterfactual outcomes in high-dimensional data is crucial for decision-making and understanding causal relationships and intervention outcomes in various domains, including healthcare, economics, and social sciences. However, existing methods often struggle to generate accurate and consistent counterfactuals, particularly when the causal relationships are complex. We propose a novel framework that incorporates causal mechanisms and diffusion models to generate high-quality counterfactual samples guided by causal representation. Our approach introduces a novel, theoretically grounded training and sampling process that enables the model to consistently generate accurate counterfactual high-dimensional data under multiple intervention steps. Experimental results on various synthetic and real benchmarks demonstrate the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generating accurate and high-quality counterfactuals, using different evaluation metrics.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20557">CELLM: An Efficient Communication in Large Language Models Training for Federated Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Raja Vavekanand, Kira Sam</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a recent model training paradigm in which client devices collaboratively train a model without ever aggregating their data. Crucially, this scheme offers users potential privacy and security benefits by only ever communicating updates to the model weights to a central server as opposed to traditional machine learning (ML) training which directly communicates and aggregates data. However, FL training suffers from statistical heterogeneity as clients may have differing local data distributions. Large language models (LLMs) offer a potential solution to this issue of heterogeneity given that they have consistently been shown to be able to learn on vast amounts of noisy data. While LLMs are a promising development for resolving the consistent issue of non-I.I.D. Clients in federated settings exacerbate two other bottlenecks in FL: limited local computing and expensive communication. This thesis aims to develop efficient training methods for LLMs in FL. To this end, we employ two critical techniques in enabling efficient training. First, we use low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to reduce the computational load of local model training. Second, we communicate sparse updates throughout training to significantly cut down on communication costs. Taken together, our method reduces communication costs by up to 10x over vanilla LoRA and up to 5x over more complex sparse LoRA baselines while achieving greater utility. We emphasize the importance of carefully applying sparsity and picking effective rank and sparsity configurations for federated LLM training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhi-Yong Zhang, Jie-Ying Li, Lei-Lei Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Utilizing physics-informed neural networks (PINN) to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) becomes a hot issue and also shows its great powers, but still suffers from the dilemmas of limited predicted accuracy in the sampling domain and poor prediction ability beyond the sampling domain which are usually mitigated by adding the physical properties of PDEs into the loss function or by employing smart techniques to change the form of loss function for special PDEs. In this paper, we design a symmetry-enhanced deep neural network (sDNN) which makes the architecture of neural networks invariant under the finite group through expanding the dimensions of weight matrixes and bias vectors in each hidden layers by the order of finite group if the group has matrix representations, otherwise extending the set of input data and the hidden layers except for the first hidden layer by the order of finite group. However, the total number of training parameters is only about one over the order of finite group of the original PINN size due to the symmetric architecture of sDNN. Furthermore, we give special forms of weight matrixes and bias vectors of sDNN, and rigorously prove that the architecture itself is invariant under the finite group and the sDNN has the universal approximation ability to learn the function keeping the finite group. Numerical results show that the sDNN has strong predicted abilities in and beyond the sampling domain and performs far better than the vanilla PINN with fewer training points and simpler architecture.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ferran Hernandez Caralt, Guillermo Bern\'ardez Gil, Iulia Duta, Pietro Li\`o, Eduard Alarc\'on Cot</p>
<p>Abstract: Sheaf Neural Networks (SNNs) naturally extend Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by endowing a cellular sheaf over the graph, equipping nodes and edges with vector spaces and defining linear mappings between them. While the attached geometric structure has proven to be useful in analyzing heterophily and oversmoothing, so far the methods by which the sheaf is computed do not always guarantee a good performance in such settings. In this work, drawing inspiration from opinion dynamics concepts, we propose two novel sheaf learning approaches that (i) provide a more intuitive understanding of the involved structure maps, (ii) introduce a useful inductive bias for heterophily and oversmoothing, and (iii) infer the sheaf in a way that does not scale with the number of features, thus using fewer learnable parameters than existing methods. In our evaluation, we show the limitations of the real-world benchmarks used so far on SNNs, and design a new synthetic task -- leveraging the symmetries of n-dimensional ellipsoids -- that enables us to better assess the strengths and weaknesses of sheaf-based models. Our extensive experimentation on these novel datasets reveals valuable insights into the scenarios and contexts where SNNs in general -- and our proposed approaches in particular -- can be beneficial.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20601">Investigating Sparsity in Recurrent Neural Networks</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Harshil Darji</p>
<p>Abstract: In the past few years, neural networks have evolved from simple Feedforward Neural Networks to more complex neural networks, such as Convolutional Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks. Where CNNs are a perfect fit for tasks where the sequence is not important such as image recognition, RNNs are useful when order is important such as machine translation. An increasing number of layers in a neural network is one way to improve its performance, but it also increases its complexity making it much more time and power-consuming to train. One way to tackle this problem is to introduce sparsity in the architecture of the neural network. Pruning is one of the many methods to make a neural network architecture sparse by clipping out weights below a certain threshold while keeping the performance near to the original. Another way is to generate arbitrary structures using random graphs and embed them between an input and output layer of an Artificial Neural Network. Many researchers in past years have focused on pruning mainly CNNs, while hardly any research is done for the same in RNNs. The same also holds in creating sparse architectures for RNNs by generating and embedding arbitrary structures. Therefore, this thesis focuses on investigating the effects of the before-mentioned two techniques on the performance of RNNs. We first describe the pruning of RNNs, its impact on the performance of RNNs, and the number of training epochs required to regain accuracy after the pruning is performed. Next, we continue with the creation and training of Sparse Recurrent Neural Networks and identify the relation between the performance and the graph properties of its underlying arbitrary structure. We perform these experiments on RNN with Tanh nonlinearity (RNN-Tanh), RNN with ReLU nonlinearity (RNN-ReLU), GRU, and LSTM. Finally, we analyze and discuss the results achieved from both the experiments.</p>

We investigate a decentralized SGD algorithm that utilizes a random walk to update a global model based on local data. Our focus is on designing the transition probability matrix to speed up convergence. While importance sampling can enhance centralized learning, its decentralized counterpart, using the Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm, can lead to the entrapment problem, where the random walk becomes stuck at certain nodes, slowing convergence. To address this, we propose the Metropolis-Hastings with L\'evy Jumps (MHLJ) algorithm, which incorporates random perturbations (jumps) to overcome entrapment. We theoretically establish the convergence rate and error gap of MHLJ and validate our findings through numerical experiments.</p>

In many scenarios, learning is performed on datasets involving sensitive information, in which privacy protection is essential for learning algorithms. In this work, we study pure private learning in the agnostic model -- a framework reflecting the learning process in practice. We examine the number of users required under item-level (where each user contributes one example) and user-level (where each user contributes multiple examples) privacy and derive several improved upper bounds. For item-level privacy, our algorithm achieves a near optimal bound for general concept classes. We extend this to the user-level setting, rendering a tighter upper bound than the one proved by Ghazi et al. (2023). Lastly, we consider the problem of learning thresholds under user-level privacy and present an algorithm with a nearly tight user complexity.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs) and heterogeneous GNNs (HGNNs) have advanced node embeddings and relationship learning for various tasks. However, existing methods often rely on domain-specific predefined meta-paths, which are coarse-grained and focus solely on aspects like node type, limiting their ability to capture complex interactions. We introduce MF2Vec, a model that uses multi-faceted (fine-grained) paths instead of predefined meta-paths. MF2Vec extracts paths via random walks and generates multi-faceted vectors, ignoring predefined schemas. This method learns diverse aspects of nodes and their relationships, constructs a homogeneous network, and creates node embeddings for classification, link prediction, and clustering. Extensive experiments show that MF2Vec outperforms existing methods, offering a more flexible and comprehensive framework for analyzing complex networks.

<p>Abstract: In recent studies, line search methods have been demonstrated to significantly enhance the performance of conventional stochastic gradient descent techniques across various datasets and architectures, while making an otherwise critical choice of learning rate schedule superfluous. In this paper, we identify problems of current state-of-the-art of line search methods, propose enhancements, and rigorously assess their effectiveness. Furthermore, we evaluate these methods on orders of magnitude larger datasets and more complex data domains than previously done. More specifically, we enhance the Armijo line search method by speeding up its computation and incorporating a momentum term into the Armijo criterion, making it better suited for stochastic mini-batching. Our optimization approach outperforms both the previous Armijo implementation and a tuned learning rate schedule for the Adam and SGD optimizers. Our evaluation covers a diverse range of architectures, such as Transformers, CNNs, and MLPs, as well as data domains, including NLP and image data.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yupei Yang, Biwei Huang, Fan Feng, Xinyue Wang, Shikui Tu, Lei Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: General intelligence requires quick adaption across tasks. While existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods have made progress in generalization, they typically assume only distribution changes between source and target domains. In this paper, we explore a wider range of scenarios where both the distribution and environment spaces may change. For example, in Atari games, we train agents to generalize to tasks with different levels of mode and difficulty, where there could be new state or action variables that never occurred in previous environments. To address this challenging setting, we introduce a causality-guided self-adaptive representation-based approach, called CSR, that equips the agent to generalize effectively and efficiently across a sequence of tasks with evolving dynamics. Specifically, we employ causal representation learning to characterize the latent causal variables and world models within the RL system. Such compact causal representations uncover the structural relationships among variables, enabling the agent to autonomously determine whether changes in the environment stem from distribution shifts or variations in space, and to precisely locate these changes. We then devise a three-step strategy to fine-tune the model under different scenarios accordingly. Empirical experiments show that CSR efficiently adapts to the target domains with only a few samples and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on a wide range of scenarios, including our simulated environments, Cartpole, and Atari games.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zsigmond Benk\H{o}, B\'alint Varga, Marcell Stippinger, Zolt\'an Somogyv\'ari</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding causal relationships within a system is crucial for uncovering its underlying mechanisms. Causal discovery methods, which facilitate the construction of such models from time-series data, hold the potential to significantly advance scientific and engineering fields.
  This study introduces the Cross-Mapping Coherence (CMC) method, designed to reveal causal connections in the frequency domain between time series. CMC builds upon nonlinear state-space reconstruction and extends the Convergent Cross-Mapping algorithm to the frequency domain by utilizing coherence metrics for evaluation. We tested the Cross-Mapping Coherence method using simulations of logistic maps, Lorenz systems, Kuramoto oscillators, and the Wilson-Cowan model of the visual cortex. CMC accurately identified the direction of causal connections in all simulated scenarios. When applied to the Wilson-Cowan model, CMC yielded consistent results similar to spectral Granger causality.
  Furthermore, CMC exhibits high sensitivity in detecting weak connections, demonstrates sample efficiency, and maintains robustness in the presence of noise.
  In conclusion, the capability to determine directed causal influences across different frequency bands allows CMC to provide valuable insights into the dynamics of complex, nonlinear systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Anwar Ma'sum, Mahardhika Pratama, Savitha Ramasamy, Lin Liu, Habibullah Habibullah, Ryszard Kowalczyk</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Class Incremental Learning (FCIL) is a new direction in continual learning (CL) for addressing catastrophic forgetting and non-IID data distribution simultaneously. Existing FCIL methods call for high communication costs and exemplars from previous classes. We propose a novel rehearsal-free method for FCIL named prototypes-injected prompt (PIP) that involves 3 main ideas: a) prototype injection on prompt learning, b) prototype augmentation, and c) weighted Gaussian aggregation on the server side. Our experiment result shows that the proposed method outperforms the current state of the arts (SOTAs) with a significant improvement (up to 33%) in CIFAR100, MiniImageNet and TinyImageNet datasets. Our extensive analysis demonstrates the robustness of PIP in different task sizes, and the advantage of requiring smaller participating local clients, and smaller global rounds. For further study, source codes of PIP, baseline, and experimental logs are shared publicly in https://github.com/anwarmaxsum/PIP.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weiyu Chen, James T. Kwok</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-task learning, which optimizes performance across multiple tasks, is inherently a multi-objective optimization problem. Various algorithms are developed to provide discrete trade-off solutions on the Pareto front. Recently, continuous Pareto front approximations using a linear combination of base networks have emerged as a compelling strategy. However, it suffers from scalability issues when the number of tasks is large. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach that integrates a main network with several low-rank matrices to efficiently learn the Pareto manifold. It significantly reduces the number of parameters and facilitates the extraction of shared features. We also introduce orthogonal regularization to further bolster performance. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, especially on datasets with a large number of tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohan Ren, Zhihao Fang, Keren Li, Anirbit Mukherjee</p>
<p>Abstract: "AI for Science" aims to solve fundamental scientific problems using AI techniques. As most physical phenomena can be described as Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) , approximating their solutions using neural networks has evolved as a central component of scientific-ML. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) is the general method that has evolved for this task but its training is well-known to be very unstable. In this work we explore the possibility of changing the model being trained from being just a neural network to being a non-linear transformation of it - one that algebraically includes the boundary/initial conditions. This reduces the number of terms in the loss function than the standard PINN losses. We demonstrate that our modification leads to significant performance gains across a range of benchmark tasks, in various dimensions and without having to tweak the training algorithm. Our conclusions are based on conducting hundreds of experiments, in the fully unsupervised setting, over multiple linear and non-linear PDEs set to exactly solvable scenarios, which lends to a concrete measurement of our performance gains in terms of order(s) of magnitude lower fractional errors being achieved, than by standard PINNs.

<p>Abstract: Quantum one-class support vector machines leverage the advantage of quantum kernel methods for semi-supervised anomaly detection. However, their quadratic time complexity with respect to data size poses challenges when dealing with large datasets. In recent work, quantum randomized measurements kernels and variable subsampling were proposed, as two independent methods to address this problem. The former achieves higher average precision, but suffers from variance, while the latter achieves linear complexity to data size and has lower variance. The current work focuses instead on combining these two methods, along with rotated feature bagging, to achieve linear time complexity both to data size and to number of features. Despite their instability, the resulting models exhibit considerably higher performance and faster training and testing times.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20768">HyperMM : Robust Multimodal Learning with Varying-sized Inputs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hava Chaptoukaev, Vincenzo Marcian\'o, Francesco Galati, Maria A. Zuluaga</p>
<p>Abstract: Combining multiple modalities carrying complementary information through multimodal learning (MML) has shown considerable benefits for diagnosing multiple pathologies. However, the robustness of multimodal models to missing modalities is often overlooked. Most works assume modality completeness in the input data, while in clinical practice, it is common to have incomplete modalities. Existing solutions that address this issue rely on modality imputation strategies before using supervised learning models. These strategies, however, are complex, computationally costly and can strongly impact subsequent prediction models. Hence, they should be used with parsimony in sensitive applications such as healthcare. We propose HyperMM, an end-to-end framework designed for learning with varying-sized inputs. Specifically, we focus on the task of supervised MML with missing imaging modalities without using imputation before training. We introduce a novel strategy for training a universal feature extractor using a conditional hypernetwork, and propose a permutation-invariant neural network that can handle inputs of varying dimensions to process the extracted features, in a two-phase task-agnostic framework. We experimentally demonstrate the advantages of our method in two tasks: Alzheimer's disease detection and breast cancer classification. We demonstrate that our strategy is robust to high rates of missing data and that its flexibility allows it to handle varying-sized datasets beyond the scenario of missing modalities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Harry J. Davies, James Monsen, Danilo P. Mandic</p>
<p>Abstract: Decoder-only transformers are the backbone of the popular generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) series of large language models. In this work, we apply the same framework to periodic heart time-series data to create two pre-trained general purpose cardiac models, namely PPG-PT and ECG-PT. We demonstrate that both such pre-trained models are fully interpretable. This is achieved firstly through aggregate attention maps which show that the model focuses on similar points in previous cardiac cycles in order to make predictions and gradually broadens its attention in deeper layers. Next, tokens with the same value, that occur at different distinct points in the ECG and PPG cycle, form separate clusters in high dimensional space based on their phase as they propagate through the transformer blocks. Finally, we highlight that individual attention heads respond to specific physiologically relevent features, such as the dicrotic notch in PPG and the P-wave in ECG. It is also demonstrated that these pre-trained models can be easily fine-tuned for tasks such as classification of atrial fibrillation. In this specific example, the fine-tuning took 11 minutes of computer time, and achieved a leave-one-subject-out AUCs of 0.99 and 0.93 for ECG and PPG respectively. Importantly, these fine-tuned models are also fully explainable, with attention shifting to regions in the context that are strongly indicative of atrial fibrillation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Igor V. Tetko, Ruud van Deursen, Guillaume Godin</p>
<p>Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization is very frequently employed in machine learning. However, an optimization of a large space of parameters could result in overfitting of models. In recent studies on solubility prediction the authors collected seven thermodynamic and kinetic solubility datasets from different data sources. They used state-of-the-art graph-based methods and compared models developed for each dataset using different data cleaning protocols and hyperparameter optimization. In our study we showed that hyperparameter optimization did not always result in better models, possibly due to overfitting when using the same statistical measures. Similar results could be calculated using pre-set hyperparameters, reducing the computational effort by around 10,000 times. We also extended the previous analysis by adding a representation learning method based on Natural Language Processing of smiles called Transformer CNN. We show that across all analyzed sets using exactly the same protocol, Transformer CNN provided better results than graph-based methods for 26 out of 28 pairwise comparisons by using only a tiny fraction of time as compared to other methods. Last but not least we stressed the importance of comparing calculation results using exactly the same statistical measures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Norman Di Palo, Leonard Hasenclever, Jan Humplik, Arunkumar Byravan</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Diffusion Augmented Agents (DAAG), a novel framework that leverages large language models, vision language models, and diffusion models to improve sample efficiency and transfer learning in reinforcement learning for embodied agents. DAAG hindsight relabels the agent's past experience by using diffusion models to transform videos in a temporally and geometrically consistent way to align with target instructions with a technique we call Hindsight Experience Augmentation. A large language model orchestrates this autonomous process without requiring human supervision, making it well-suited for lifelong learning scenarios. The framework reduces the amount of reward-labeled data needed to 1) finetune a vision language model that acts as a reward detector, and 2) train RL agents on new tasks. We demonstrate the sample efficiency gains of DAAG in simulated robotics environments involving manipulation and navigation. Our results show that DAAG improves learning of reward detectors, transferring past experience, and acquiring new tasks - key abilities for developing efficient lifelong learning agents.

The Transformer model, a leading method for load prediction, faces challenges modeling historical data due to variables like weather, events, festivals, and data volatility. To tackle this, the cloud model's fuzzy feature is utilized to manage uncertainties effectively. Presenting an innovative approach, the Cloud Model Improved Transformer (CMIT) method integrates the Transformer model with the cloud model utilizing the particle swarm optimization algorithm, with the aim of achieving robust and precise power load predictions. Through comparative experiments conducted on 31 real datasets within a power network cluster, it is demonstrated that CMIT significantly surpasses the Transformer model in terms of prediction accuracy, thereby highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing forecasting capabilities within the power network cluster sector.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ke Cheng, Linzhi Peng, Pengyang Wang, Junchen Ye, Leilei Sun, Bowen Du</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge Tracing aims to assess student learning states by predicting their performance in answering questions. Different from the existing research which utilizes fixed-length learning sequence to obtain the student states and regards KT as a static problem, this work is motivated by three dynamical characteristics: 1) The scales of students answering records are constantly growing; 2) The semantics of time intervals between the records vary; 3) The relationships between students, questions and concepts are evolving. The three dynamical characteristics above contain the great potential to revolutionize the existing knowledge tracing methods. Along this line, we propose a Dynamic Graph-based Knowledge Tracing model, namely DyGKT. In particular, a continuous-time dynamic question-answering graph for knowledge tracing is constructed to deal with the infinitely growing answering behaviors, and it is worth mentioning that it is the first time dynamic graph learning technology is used in this field. Then, a dual time encoder is proposed to capture long-term and short-term semantics among the different time intervals. Finally, a multiset indicator is utilized to model the evolving relationships between students, questions, and concepts via the graph structural feature. Numerous experiments are conducted on five real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate the superiority of our model.

<p>Abstract: Federated learning has emerged as a paradigm for collaborative learning, enabling the development of robust models without the need to centralise sensitive data. However, conventional federated learning techniques have privacy and security vulnerabilities due to the exposure of models, parameters or updates, which can be exploited as an attack surface. This paper presents Federated Knowledge Recycling (FedKR), a cross-silo federated learning approach that uses locally generated synthetic data to facilitate collaboration between institutions. FedKR combines advanced data generation techniques with a dynamic aggregation process to provide greater security against privacy attacks than existing methods, significantly reducing the attack surface. Experimental results on generic and medical datasets show that FedKR achieves competitive performance, with an average improvement in accuracy of 4.24% compared to training models from local data, demonstrating particular effectiveness in data scarcity scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Structure encoding has proven to be the key feature to distinguishing links in a graph. However, Structure encoding in the temporal graph keeps changing as the graph evolves, repeatedly computing such features can be time-consuming due to the high-order subgraph construction. We develop the Co-Neighbor Encoding Schema (CNES) to address this issue. Instead of recomputing the feature by the link, CNES stores information in the memory to avoid redundant calculations. Besides, unlike the existing memory-based dynamic graph learning method that stores node hidden states, we introduce a hashtable-based memory to compress the adjacency matrix for efficient structure feature construction and updating with vector computation in parallel. Furthermore, CNES introduces a Temporal-Diverse Memory to generate long-term and short-term structure encoding for neighbors with different structural information. A dynamic graph learning framework, Co-Neighbor Encoding Network (CNE-N), is proposed using the aforementioned techniques. Extensive experiments on thirteen public datasets verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.</p>

<p>Abstract: Computational complexity of Bayesian learning is impeding its adoption in practical, large-scale tasks. Despite demonstrations of significant merits such as improved robustness and resilience to unseen or out-of-distribution inputs over their non- Bayesian counterparts, their practical use has faded to near insignificance. In this study, we introduce an innovative framework to mitigate the computational burden of Bayesian neural networks (BNNs). Our approach follows the principle of Bayesian techniques based on deep ensembles, but significantly reduces their cost via multiple low-rank perturbations of parameters arising from a pre-trained neural network. Both vanilla version of ensembles as well as more sophisticated schemes such as Bayesian learning with Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD), previously deemed impractical for large models, can be seamlessly implemented within the proposed framework, called Bayesian Low-Rank LeArning (Bella). In a nutshell, i) Bella achieves a dramatic reduction in the number of trainable parameters required to approximate a Bayesian posterior; and ii) it not only maintains, but in some instances, surpasses the performance of conventional Bayesian learning methods and non-Bayesian baselines. Our results with large-scale tasks such as ImageNet, CAMELYON17, DomainNet, VQA with CLIP, LLaVA demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of Bella in building highly scalable and practical Bayesian deep models for real-world applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Cardiac arrhythmia, a condition characterized by irregular heartbeats, often serves as an early indication of various heart ailments. With the advent of deep learning, numerous innovative models have been introduced for diagnosing arrhythmias using Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. However, recent studies solely focus on the performance of models, neglecting the interpretation of their results. This leads to a considerable lack of transparency, posing a significant risk in the actual diagnostic process. To solve this problem, this paper introduces MambaCapsule, a deep neural networks for ECG arrhythmias classification, which increases the explainability of the model while enhancing the accuracy.Our model utilizes Mamba for feature extraction and Capsule networks for prediction, providing not only a confidence score but also signal features. Akin to the processing mechanism of human brain, the model learns signal features and their relationship between them by reconstructing ECG signals in the predicted selection. The model evaluation was conducted on MIT-BIH and PTB dataset, following the AAMI standard. MambaCapsule has achieved a total accuracy of 99.54% and 99.59% on the test sets respectively. These results demonstrate the promising performance of under the standard test protocol.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yinan Huang, Haoyu Wang, Pan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Positional encodings (PE) for graphs are essential in constructing powerful and expressive graph neural networks and graph transformers as they effectively capture relative spatial relations between nodes. While PEs for undirected graphs have been extensively studied, those for directed graphs remain largely unexplored, despite the fundamental role of directed graphs in representing entities with strong logical dependencies, such as those in program analysis and circuit designs. This work studies the design of PEs for directed graphs that are expressive to represent desired directed spatial relations. We first propose walk profile, a generalization of walk counting sequence to directed graphs. We identify limitations in existing PE methods, including symmetrized Laplacian PE, Singular Value Decomposition PE, and Magnetic Laplacian PE, in their ability to express walk profiles. To address these limitations, we propose the Multi-q Magnetic Laplacian PE, which extends Magnetic Laplacian PE with multiple potential factors. This simple variant turns out to be capable of provably expressing walk profiles. Furthermore, we generalize previous basis-invariant and stable networks to handle complex-domain PEs decomposed from Magnetic Laplacians. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Multi-q Magnetic Laplacian PE with a stable neural architecture, outperforming previous PE methods (with stable networks) on predicting directed distances/walk profiles, sorting network satisfiability, and on general circuit benchmarks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weichen Lin, Jiaxiang Chen, Ruomin Huang, Hu Ding</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual learning (CL) is a fundamental topic in machine learning, where the goal is to train a model with continuously incoming data and tasks. Due to the memory limit, we cannot store all the historical data, and therefore confront the ``catastrophic forgetting'' problem, i.e., the performance on the previous tasks can substantially decrease because of the missing information in the latter period. Though a number of elegant methods have been proposed, the catastrophic forgetting phenomenon still cannot be well avoided in practice. In this paper, we study the problem from the gradient perspective, where our aim is to develop an effective algorithm to calibrate the gradient in each updating step of the model; namely, our goal is to guide the model to be updated in the right direction under the situation that a large amount of historical data are unavailable. Our idea is partly inspired by the seminal stochastic variance reduction methods (e.g., SVRG and SAGA) for reducing the variance of gradient estimation in stochastic gradient descent algorithms. Another benefit is that our approach can be used as a general tool, which is able to be incorporated with several existing popular CL methods to achieve better performance. We also conduct a set of experiments on several benchmark datasets to evaluate the performance in practice.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yupeng Chen, Senmiao Wang, Zhihang Lin, Zeyu Qin, Yushun Zhang, Tian Ding, Ruoyu Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in a wide range of tasks. Typically, an LLM is pre-trained on large corpora and subsequently fine-tuned on task-specific datasets. However, during finetuning, LLMs may forget the knowledge acquired in the pretraining stage, leading to a decline in general capabilities. To address this issue, we propose a new fine-tuning algorithm termed Momentum-Filtered Optimizer (MoFO). The key idea of MoFO is to iteratively select and update the model parameters with the largest momentum magnitudes. Compared to full-parameter training, MoFO achieves similar fine-tuning performance while keeping parameters closer to the pre-trained model, thereby mitigating knowledge forgetting. Unlike most existing methods for forgetting mitigation, MoFO combines the following two advantages. First, MoFO does not require access to pre-training data. This makes MoFO particularly suitable for fine-tuning scenarios where pre-training data is unavailable, such as fine-tuning checkpoint-only open-source LLMs. Second, MoFO does not alter the original loss function. This could avoid impairing the model performance on the fine-tuning tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anh The Nguyen, Triet Huynh Minh Le, M. Ali Babar</p>
<p>Abstract: Background: The C and C++ languages hold significant importance in Software Engineering research because of their widespread use in practice. Numerous studies have utilized Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques to detect software vulnerabilities (SVs) in the source code written in these languages. However, the application of these techniques in function-level SV assessment has been largely unexplored. SV assessment is increasingly crucial as it provides detailed information on the exploitability, impacts, and severity of security defects, thereby aiding in their prioritization and remediation. Aims: We conduct the first empirical study to investigate and compare the performance of ML and DL models, many of which have been used for SV detection, for function-level SV assessment in C/C++. Method: Using 9,993 vulnerable C/C++ functions, we evaluated the performance of six multi-class ML models and five multi-class DL models for the SV assessment at the function level based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). We further explore multi-task learning, which can leverage common vulnerable code to predict all SV assessment outputs simultaneously in a single model, and compare the effectiveness and efficiency of this model type with those of the original multi-class models. Results: We show that ML has matching or even better performance compared to the multi-class DL models for function-level SV assessment with significantly less training time. Employing multi-task learning allows the DL models to perform significantly better, with an average of 8-22% increase in Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC). Conclusions: We distill the practices of using data-driven techniques for function-level SV assessment in C/C++, including the use of multi-task DL to balance efficiency and effectiveness. This can establish a strong foundation for future work in this area.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinsung Yoon, Raj Sinha, Sercan O Arik, Tomas Pfister</p>
<p>Abstract: Embeddings from Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as critical components in various applications, particularly for information retrieval. While high-dimensional embeddings generally demonstrate superior performance as they contain more salient information, their practical application is frequently hindered by elevated computational latency and the associated higher cost. To address these challenges, we propose Matryoshka-Adaptor, a novel tuning framework designed for the customization of LLM embeddings. Matryoshka-Adaptor facilitates substantial dimensionality reduction while maintaining comparable performance levels, thereby achieving a significant enhancement in computational efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Our framework directly modifies the embeddings from pre-trained LLMs which is designed to be seamlessly integrated with any LLM architecture, encompassing those accessible exclusively through black-box APIs. Also, it exhibits efficacy in both unsupervised and supervised learning settings. A rigorous evaluation conducted across a diverse corpus of English, multilingual, and multimodal datasets consistently reveals substantial gains with Matryoshka-Adaptor. Notably, with Google and OpenAI Embedding APIs, Matryoshka-Adaptor achieves a reduction in dimensionality ranging from two- to twelve-fold without compromising performance across multiple BEIR datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huyen Ngo, Khoi Do, Duong Nguyen, Viet Dung Nguyen, Lan Dang</p>
<p>Abstract: A significant challenge in the electroencephalogram EEG lies in the fact that current data representations involve multiple electrode signals, resulting in data redundancy and dominant lead information. However extensive research conducted on EEG classification focuses on designing model architectures without tackling the underlying issues. Otherwise, there has been a notable gap in addressing data preprocessing for EEG, leading to considerable computational overhead in Deep Learning (DL) processes. In light of these issues, we propose a simple yet effective approach for EEG data pre-processing. Our method first transforms the EEG data into an encoded image by an Inverted Channel-wise Magnitude Homogenization (ICWMH) to mitigate inter-channel biases. Next, we apply the edge detection technique on the EEG-encoded image combined with skip connection to emphasize the most significant transitions in the data while preserving structural and invariant information. By doing so, we can improve the EEG learning process efficiently without using a huge DL network. Our experimental evaluations reveal that we can significantly improve (i.e., from 2% to 5%) over current baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: The application of Riemannian geometry in the decoding of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) has swiftly garnered attention because of its straightforwardness, precision, and resilience, along with its aptitude for transfer learning, which has been demonstrated through significant achievements in global BCI competitions. This paper presents a comprehensive review of recent advancements in the integration of deep learning with Riemannian geometry to enhance EEG signal decoding in BCIs. Our review updates the findings since the last major review in 2017, comparing modern approaches that utilize deep learning to improve the handling of non-Euclidean data structures inherent in EEG signals. We discuss how these approaches not only tackle the traditional challenges of noise sensitivity, non-stationarity, and lengthy calibration times but also introduce novel classification frameworks and signal processing techniques to reduce these limitations significantly. Furthermore, we identify current shortcomings and propose future research directions in manifold learning and riemannian-based classification, focusing on practical implementations and theoretical expansions, such as feature tracking on manifolds, multitask learning, feature extraction, and transfer learning. This review aims to bridge the gap between theoretical research and practical, real-world applications, making sophisticated mathematical approaches accessible and actionable for BCI enhancements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihan Wang, Anindya Bhaduri, Hongyi Xu, Liping Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Mechanical metamaterials represent an innovative class of artificial structures, distinguished by their extraordinary mechanical characteristics, which are beyond the scope of traditional natural materials. The use of deep generative models has become increasingly popular in the design of metamaterial units. The effectiveness of using deep generative models lies in their capacity to compress complex input data into a simplified, lower-dimensional latent space, while also enabling the creation of novel optimal designs through sampling within this space. However, the design process does not take into account the effect of model uncertainty due to data sparsity or the effect of input data uncertainty due to inherent randomness in the data. This might lead to the generation of undesirable structures with high sensitivity to the uncertainties in the system. To address this issue, a novel uncertainty-aware deep learning framework-based robust design approach is proposed for the design of metamaterial units with optimal target properties. The proposed approach utilizes the probabilistic nature of the deep learning framework and quantifies both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties associated with surrogate-based design optimization. We demonstrate that the proposed design approach is capable of designing high-performance metamaterial units with high reliability. To showcase the effectiveness of the proposed design approach, a single-objective design optimization problem and a multi-objective design optimization problem are presented. The optimal robust designs obtained are validated by comparing them to the designs obtained from the topology optimization method as well as the designs obtained from a deterministic deep learning framework-based design optimization where none of the uncertainties in the system are explicitly considered.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingzhi Chen, Yiyu Gui, Yuqi Su, Yuesheng Zhu, Guibo Luo, Yuchao Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) classification has been widely used in various medical and engineering applications, where it is important for understanding brain function, diagnosing diseases, and assessing mental health conditions. However, the scarcity of EEG data severely restricts the performance of EEG classification networks, and generative model-based data augmentation methods emerging as potential solutions to overcome this challenge. There are two problems with existing such methods: (1) The quality of the generated EEG signals is not high. (2) The enhancement of EEG classification networks is not effective. In this paper, we propose a Transformer-based denoising diffusion probabilistic model and a generated data-based data augmentation method to address the above two problems. For the characteristics of EEG signals, we propose a constant-factor scaling method to preprocess the signals, which reduces the loss of information. We incorporated Multi-Scale Convolution and Dynamic Fourier Spectrum Information modules into the model, improving the stability of the training process and the quality of the generated data. The proposed augmentation method randomly reassemble the generated data with original data in the time-domain to obtain vicinal data, which improves the model performance by minimizing the empirical risk and the vicinal risk. We experiment the proposed augmentation method on five EEG datasets for four tasks and observe significant accuracy performance improvements: 14.00% on the Bonn dataset; 25.83% on the New Delhi epilepsy dataset; 4.98% on the SleepEDF-20 dataset; 9.42% on the FACED dataset; 2.5% on the Shu dataset.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiyu Gui, MingZhi Chen, Yuqi Su, Guibo Luo, Yuchao Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, with the development of deep learning, electroencephalogram (EEG) classification networks have achieved certain progress. Transformer-based models can perform well in capturing long-term dependencies in EEG signals. However, their quadratic computational complexity leads to significant computational overhead. Moreover, most EEG classification models are only suitable for single tasks, showing poor generalization capabilities across different tasks and further unable to handle EEG data from various tasks simultaneously due to variations in signal length and the number of channels. In this paper, we introduce a universal EEG classification network named EEGMamba, which seamlessly integrates the Spatio-Temporal-Adaptive (ST-Adaptive) module, Bidirectional Mamba, and Mixture of Experts (MoE) into a unified framework for multiple tasks. The proposed ST-Adaptive module performs unified feature extraction on EEG signals of different lengths and channel counts through spatio-adaptive convolution and incorporates a class token to achieve temporal-adaptability. Moreover, we design a bidirectional Mamba particularly suitable for EEG signals for further feature extraction, balancing high accuracy and fast inference speed in processing long EEG signals. In order to better process EEG data for different tasks, we introduce Task-aware MoE with a universal expert, achieving the capture of both differences and commonalities between EEG data from different tasks. We test our model on eight publicly available EEG datasets, and experimental results demonstrate its superior performance in four types of tasks: seizure detection, emotion recognition, sleep stage classification, and motor imagery. The code is set to be released soon.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) know little about enterprise database tables in the private data ecosystem, which substantially differ from web text in structure and content. As LLMs' performance is tied to their training data, a crucial question is how useful they can be in improving enterprise database management and analysis tasks. To address this, we contribute experimental results on LLMs' performance for text-to-SQL and semantic column-type detection tasks on enterprise datasets. The performance of LLMs on enterprise data is significantly lower than on benchmark datasets commonly used. Informed by our findings and feedback from industry practitioners, we identify three fundamental challenges -- latency, cost, and quality -- and propose potential solutions to use LLMs in enterprise data workflows effectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adrian Atienza, Jakob Bardram, Sadasivan Puthusserypady</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) methods have been used for electrocardiogram (ECG) processing in a wide variety of tasks, demonstrating good performance compared with traditional signal processing algorithms. These methods offer an efficient framework with a limited need for apriori data pre-processing and feature engineering. While several studies use this approach for ECG signal delineation, a significant gap persists between the expected and the actual outcome. Existing methods rely on a sample-to-sample classifier. However, the clinical expected outcome consists of a set of onset, offset, and peak for the different waves that compose each R-R interval. To align the actual with the expected output, it is necessary to incorporate post-processing algorithms. This counteracts two of the main advantages of DL models, since these algorithms are based on assumptions and slow down the method's performance. In this paper, we present Keypoint Estimation for Electrocardiogram Delineation (KEED), a novel DL model designed for keypoint estimation, which organically offers an output aligned with clinical expectations. By standing apart from the conventional sample-to-sample classifier, we achieve two benefits: (i) Eliminate the need for additional post-processing, and (ii) Establish a flexible framework that allows the adjustment of the threshold value considering the sensitivity-specificity tradeoff regarding the particular clinical requirements. The proposed method's performance is compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) signal processing methods. Remarkably, KEED significantly outperforms despite being optimized with an extremely limited annotated data. In addition, KEED decreases the inference time by a factor ranging from 52x to 703x.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhining Hu, Tobias Schlosser, Michael Friedrich, Andr\'e Luiz Vieira e Silva, Frederik Beuth, Danny Kowerko</p>
<p>Abstract: In semiconductor manufacturing, the wafer dicing process is central yet vulnerable to defects that significantly impair yield - the proportion of defect-free chips. Deep neural networks are the current state of the art in (semi-)automated visual inspection. However, they are notoriously known to require a particularly large amount of data for model training. To address these challenges, we explore the application of generative adversarial networks (GAN) for image data augmentation and classification of semiconductor wafer dicing induced defects to enhance the variety and balance of training data for visual inspection systems. With this approach, synthetic yet realistic images are generated that mimic real-world dicing defects. We employ three different GAN variants for high-resolution image synthesis: Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN), CycleGAN, and StyleGAN3. Our work-in-progress results demonstrate that improved classification accuracies can be obtained, showing an average improvement of up to 23.1 % from 65.1 % (baseline experiment) to 88.2 % (DCGAN experiment) in balanced accuracy, which may enable yield optimization in production.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruijie Miao, Yihan Yan, Xinshuo Yao, Tong Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Building efficient inference framework has gained increasing interests for research community. Early-exit models, a variant of LLMs, improves the inference efficiency of LLMs by skipping rest layers and directly generate output tokens when they are confident enough. However, there is no work of LLM inference framework that takes early-exit models into consideration. This is non-trivial as prior art on LLM inference cannot be directly applied to early-exit models. In this work, we solves two key challenges in building efficient inference framework for early-exit models: (1) batch inference at iteration-level granularity; and (2) KV cache management. For the former, we propose to process the batch until all sequences surpass the early-exit confidence threshold. For the latter, we propose to fill the KV cache of rest layers before the iteration terminates. Our evaluation shows that, compared with the original vLLM operating at full layers, our solution achieves up to 1.25x speed up.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhichao Han, Mohit Pundir, Olga Fink, David S. Kammer</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurately modeling the mechanical behavior of materials is crucial for numerous engineering applications. The quality of these models depends directly on the accuracy of the constitutive law that defines the stress-strain relation. Discovering these constitutive material laws remains a significant challenge, in particular when only material deformation data is available. To address this challenge, unsupervised machine learning methods have been proposed. However, existing approaches have several limitations: they either fail to ensure that the learned constitutive relations are consistent with physical principles, or they rely on a predefined library of constitutive relations or manually crafted input features. These dependencies require significant expertise and specialized domain knowledge. Here, we introduce a machine learning approach called uLED, which overcomes the limitations by using the input convex neural network (ICNN) as the surrogate constitutive model. We improve the optimization strategy for training ICNN, allowing it to be trained end-to-end using direct strain invariants as input across various materials. Furthermore, we utilize the nodal force equilibrium at the internal domain as the training objective, which enables us to learn the constitutive relation solely from temporal displacement recordings. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed method on a diverse range of material laws. We demonstrate that it is robust to a significant level of noise and that it converges to the ground truth with increasing data resolution. We also show that the model can be effectively trained using a displacement field from a subdomain of the test specimen and that the learned constitutive relation from one material sample is transferable to other samples with different geometries. The developed methodology provides an effective tool for discovering constitutive relations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in language models have demonstrated their capability to solve mathematical reasoning problems, achieving near-perfect accuracy on grade-school level math benchmarks like GSM8K. In this paper, we formally study how language models solve these problems. We design a series of controlled experiments to address several fundamental questions: (1) Can language models truly develop reasoning skills, or do they simply memorize templates? (2) What is the model's hidden (mental) reasoning process? (3) Do models solve math questions using skills similar to or different from humans? (4) Do models trained on GSM8K-like datasets develop reasoning skills beyond those necessary for solving GSM8K problems? (5) What mental process causes models to make reasoning mistakes? (6) How large or deep must a model be to effectively solve GSM8K-level math questions?
  Our study uncovers many hidden mechanisms by which language models solve mathematical questions, providing insights that extend beyond current understandings of LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kyra Wilson, Aylin Caliskan</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) hiring tools have revolutionized resume screening, and large language models (LLMs) have the potential to do the same. However, given the biases which are embedded within LLMs, it is unclear whether they can be used in this scenario without disadvantaging groups based on their protected attributes. In this work, we investigate the possibilities of using LLMs in a resume screening setting via a document retrieval framework that simulates job candidate selection. Using that framework, we then perform a resume audit study to determine whether a selection of Massive Text Embedding (MTE) models are biased in resume screening scenarios. We simulate this for nine occupations, using a collection of over 500 publicly available resumes and 500 job descriptions. We find that the MTEs are biased, significantly favoring White-associated names in 85.1\% of cases and female-associated names in only 11.1\% of cases, with a minority of cases showing no statistically significant differences. Further analyses show that Black males are disadvantaged in up to 100\% of cases, replicating real-world patterns of bias in employment settings, and validate three hypotheses of intersectionality. We also find an impact of document length as well as the corpus frequency of names in the selection of resumes. These findings have implications for widely used AI tools that are automating employment, fairness, and tech policy.</p>

CMR is a golden standard for diagnosis of serveral cardiac diseases. LV in CMR comprises of three distinct sections: Basal, Mid-Ventricle, and Apical. This research focuses on the precise segmentation of the LV from Cardiac MRI (CMR) scans, joining with the capabilities of Machine Learning (ML). The central challenge in this research revolves around the absence of a set of parameters applicable to all three types of LV slices. Parameters optimized for basal slices often fall short when applied to mid-ventricular and apical slices, and vice versa. To handle this issue, a new method is proposed to enhance LV segmentation. The proposed method involves using distinct sets of parameters for each type of slice, resulting in a two-phase segmentation approach. The initial phase categorizes images into three groups based on the type of LV slice, while the second phase aims to segment CMR images using parameters derived from the preceding phase. A publicly available dataset (Automated Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge (ACDC)) is used. 10-Fold Cross Validation is used and it achieved a mean score of 0.9228. Comprehensive testing indicates that the best parameter set for a particular type of slice does not perform adequately for the other slice types. All results show that the proposed approach fills a critical void in parameter standardization through a two-phase segmentation model for the LV, aiming to not only improve the accuracy of cardiac image analysis but also contribute advancements to the field of LV segmentation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maxime Seince, Loic Le Folgoc, Luiz Augusto Facury de Souza, Elsa Angelini</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized medical image segmentation, but it relies heavily on high-quality annotations. The time, cost and expertise required to label images at the pixel-level for each new task has slowed down widespread adoption of the paradigm. We propose Pix2Rep, a self-supervised learning (SSL) approach for few-shot segmentation, that reduces the manual annotation burden by learning powerful pixel-level representations directly from unlabeled images. Pix2Rep is a novel pixel-level loss and pre-training paradigm for contrastive SSL on whole images. It is applied to generic encoder-decoder deep learning backbones (e.g., U-Net). Whereas most SSL methods enforce invariance of the learned image-level representations under intensity and spatial image augmentations, Pix2Rep enforces equivariance of the pixel-level representations. We demonstrate the framework on a task of cardiac MRI segmentation. Results show improved performance compared to existing semi- and self-supervised approaches; and a 5-fold reduction in the annotation burden for equivalent performance versus a fully supervised U-Net baseline. This includes a 30% (resp. 31%) DICE improvement for one-shot segmentation under linear-probing (resp. fine-tuning). Finally, we also integrate the novel Pix2Rep concept with the Barlow Twins non-contrastive SSL, which leads to even better segmentation performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingfu Xu, Guangzhi Tang, Amirreza Yousefzadeh, Guido de Croon, Manolis Sifalakis</p>
<p>Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) for event-based optical flow are claimed to be computationally more efficient than their artificial neural networks (ANNs) counterparts, but a fair comparison is missing in the literature. In this work, we propose an event-based optical flow solution based on activation sparsification and a neuromorphic processor, SENECA. SENECA has an event-driven processing mechanism that can exploit the sparsity in ANN activations and SNN spikes to accelerate the inference of both types of neural networks. The ANN and the SNN for comparison have similar low activation/spike density (~5%) thanks to our novel sparsification-aware training. In the hardware-in-loop experiments designed to deduce the average time and energy consumption, the SNN consumes 44.9ms and 927.0 microjoules, which are 62.5% and 75.2% of the ANN's consumption, respectively. We find that SNN's higher efficiency attributes to its lower pixel-wise spike density (43.5% vs. 66.5%) that requires fewer memory access operations for neuron states.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Johannes Hertrich, Robert Gruhlke</p>
<p>Abstract: In order to sample from an unnormalized probability density function, we propose to combine continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) with rejection-resampling steps based on importance weights. We relate the iterative training of CNFs with regularized velocity fields to a JKO scheme and prove convergence of the involved velocity fields to the velocity field of the Wasserstein gradient flow (WGF). The alternation of local flow steps and non-local rejection-resampling steps allows to overcome local minima or slow convergence of the WGF for multimodal distributions. Since the proposal of the rejection step is generated by the model itself, they do not suffer from common drawbacks of classical rejection schemes. The arising model can be trained iteratively, reduces the reverse Kulback-Leibler (KL) loss function in each step, allows to generate iid samples and moreover allows for evaluations of the generated underlying density. Numerical examples show that our method yields accurate results on various test distributions including high-dimensional multimodal targets and outperforms the state of the art in almost all cases significantly.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junda Wu, Zachary Novack, Amit Namburi, Jiaheng Dai, Hao-Wen Dong, Zhouhang Xie, Carol Chen, Julian McAuley</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing music captioning methods are limited to generating concise global descriptions of short music clips, which fail to capture fine-grained musical characteristics and time-aware musical changes. To address these limitations, we propose FUTGA, a model equipped with fined-grained music understanding capabilities through learning from generative augmentation with temporal compositions. We leverage existing music caption datasets and large language models (LLMs) to synthesize fine-grained music captions with structural descriptions and time boundaries for full-length songs. Augmented by the proposed synthetic dataset, FUTGA is enabled to identify the music's temporal changes at key transition points and their musical functions, as well as generate detailed descriptions for each music segment. We further introduce a full-length music caption dataset generated by FUTGA, as the augmentation of the MusicCaps and the Song Describer datasets. We evaluate the automatically generated captions on several downstream tasks, including music generation and retrieval. The experiments demonstrate the quality of the generated captions and the better performance in various downstream tasks achieved by the proposed music captioning approach.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ashirbad Mishra, Soumik Dey, Jinyu Zhao, Marshall Wu, Binbin Li, Kamesh Madduri</p>
<p>Abstract: Keyphrase Recommendation has been a pivotal problem in advertising and e-commerce where advertisers/sellers are recommended keyphrases (search queries) to bid on to increase their sales. It is a challenging task due to the plethora of items shown on online platforms and various possible queries that users search while showing varying interest in the displayed items. Moreover, query/keyphrase recommendations need to be made in real-time and in a resource-constrained environment. This problem can be framed as an Extreme Multi-label (XML) Short text classification by tagging the input text with keywords as labels. Traditional neural network models are either infeasible or have slower inference latency due to large label spaces. We present Graphite, a graph-based classifier model that provides real-time keyphrase recommendations that are on par with standard text classification models. Furthermore, it doesn't utilize GPU resources, which can be limited in production environments. Due to its lightweight nature and smaller footprint, it can train on very large datasets, where state-of-the-art XML models fail due to extreme resource requirements. Graphite is deterministic, transparent, and intrinsically more interpretable than neural network-based models. We present a comprehensive analysis of our model's performance across forty categories spanning eBay's English-speaking sites.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyun Rae Jo, Dong Kun Shin</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLM) based on transformers are facing memory bottleneck issues due to KV cache, especially in long sequence handling. Previous researches proposed KV cache compression techniques that identify insignificant tokens based on Accumulative Attention Scores and removes their items from KV cache, noting that only few tokens play an important role in attention operations. However, we have observed that the existing Accumulative Attention Score is not suitable for the transformer decoder structure. In the decoder model, the number of times the Attention Score accumulates varies depending on the order of token appearance due to the effect of masking, causing an uneven comparison between tokens. To solve this, we propose Accumulative Attention Score with Forgetting Factor (A2SF) technique, which introduces a Forgetting Factor in the Attention Score accumulation process. A2SF applies a penalty to the past Attention Score generated from old tokens by repeatedly multiplying the Forgetting Factor to the Attention Score over time. Therefore, older tokens receive a larger penalty, providing fairness among different ages of tokens. Through the fair comparison among tokens, we can more effectively select important tokens. We have verified the accuracy improvement through A2SF in the OPT and LLaMA models and A2SF improves the accuracy of LLaMA 2 by up to 7.8% and 5.1% on 1-shot and 0-shot.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingkun Xu, Huifeng Yin, Yujie Wu, Guoqi Li, Faqiang Liu, Jing Pei, Shuai Zhong, Lei Deng</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, spiking neural networks (SNNs) have attracted substantial interest due to their potential to replicate the energy-efficient and event-driven processing of biological neurons. Despite this, the application of SNNs in graph representation learning, particularly for non-Euclidean data, remains underexplored, and the influence of spiking dynamics on graph learning is not yet fully understood. This work seeks to address these gaps by examining the unique properties and benefits of spiking dynamics in enhancing graph representation learning. We propose a spike-based graph neural network model that incorporates spiking dynamics, enhanced by a novel spatial-temporal feature normalization (STFN) technique, to improve training efficiency and model stability. Our detailed analysis explores the impact of rate coding and temporal coding on SNN performance, offering new insights into their advantages for deep graph networks and addressing challenges such as the oversmoothing problem. Experimental results demonstrate that our SNN models can achieve competitive performance with state-of-the-art graph neural networks (GNNs) while considerably reducing computational costs, highlighting the potential of SNNs for efficient neuromorphic computing applications in complex graph-based scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samip Karki, Diego Chavez Arana, Andrew Sornborger, Francesco Caravelli</p>
<p>Abstract: Reservoir computing is a promising approach for harnessing the computational power of recurrent neural networks while dramatically simplifying training. This paper investigates the application of integrate-and-fire neurons within reservoir computing frameworks for two distinct tasks: capturing chaotic dynamics of the H\'enon map and forecasting the Mackey-Glass time series. Integrate-and-fire neurons can be implemented in low-power neuromorphic architectures such as Intel Loihi. We explore the impact of network topologies created through random interactions on the reservoir's performance. Our study reveals task-specific variations in network effectiveness, highlighting the importance of tailored architectures for distinct computational tasks. To identify optimal network configurations, we employ a meta-learning approach combined with simulated annealing. This method efficiently explores the space of possible network structures, identifying architectures that excel in different scenarios. The resulting networks demonstrate a range of behaviors, showcasing how inherent architectural features influence task-specific capabilities. We study the reservoir computing performance using a custom integrate-and-fire code, Intel's Lava neuromorphic computing software framework, and via an on-chip implementation in Loihi. We conclude with an analysis of the energy performance of the Loihi architecture.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mayur Mallya, Ali Khajegili Mirabadi, Hossein Farahani, Ali Bashashati</p>
<p>Abstract: Bevacizumab is a widely studied targeted therapeutic drug used in conjunction with standard chemotherapy for the treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer. While its administration has shown to increase the progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with advanced stage ovarian cancer, the lack of identifiable biomarkers for predicting patient response has been a major roadblock in its effective adoption towards personalized medicine. In this work, we leverage the latest histopathology foundation models trained on large-scale whole slide image (WSI) datasets to extract ovarian tumor tissue features for predicting bevacizumab response from WSIs. Our extensive experiments across a combination of different histopathology foundation models and multiple instance learning (MIL) strategies demonstrate capability of these large models in predicting bevacizumab response in ovarian cancer patients with the best models achieving an AUC score of 0.86 and an accuracy score of 72.5%. Furthermore, our survival models are able to stratify high- and low-risk cases with statistical significance (p < 0.05) even among the patients with the aggressive subtype of high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma. This work highlights the utility of histopathology foundation models for the task of ovarian bevacizumab response prediction from WSIs. The high-attention regions of the WSIs highlighted by these models not only aid the model explainability but also serve as promising imaging biomarkers for treatment prognosis.</p>

<p>Abstract: We examine convergence properties of continuous-time variants of accelerated Forward-Backward (FB) and Douglas-Rachford (DR) splitting algorithms for nonsmooth composite optimization problems. When the objective function is given by the sum of a quadratic and a nonsmooth term, we establish accelerated sublinear and exponential convergence rates for convex and strongly convex problems, respectively. Moreover, for FB splitting dynamics, we demonstrate that accelerated exponential convergence rate carries over to general strongly convex problems. In our Lyapunov-based analysis we exploit the variable-metric gradient interpretations of FB and DR splittings to obtain smooth Lyapunov functions that allow us to establish accelerated convergence rates. We provide computational experiments to demonstrate the merits and the effectiveness of our analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Filippo Varini, Francesco Ferretti, Jeremy Jenrette, Joel H. Gayford, Mark E. Bond, Matthew J. Witt, Michael R. Heithaus, Sophie Wilday, Ben Glocker</p>
<p>Abstract: Elasmobranchs (sharks and rays) can be important components of marine ecosystems but are experiencing global population declines. Effective monitoring of these populations is essential to their protection. Baited Remote Underwater Video Stations (BRUVS) have been a key tool for monitoring, but require time-consuming manual analysis. To address these challenges, we developed SharkTrack, an AI-enhanced BRUVS analysis software. SharkTrack uses Convolutional Neural Networks and Multi-Object Tracking to detect and track elasmobranchs and provides an annotation pipeline to manually classify elasmobranch species and compute MaxN, the standard metric of relative abundance. We tested SharkTrack on BRUVS footage from locations unseen by the model during training. SharkTrack computed MaxN with 89% accuracy over 207 hours of footage. The semi-automatic SharkTrack pipeline required two minutes of manual classification per hour of video, a 97% reduction of manual BRUVS analysis time compared to traditional methods, estimated conservatively at one hour per hour of video. Furthermore, we demonstrate SharkTrack application across diverse marine ecosystems and elasmobranch species, an advancement compared to previous models, which were limited to specific species or locations. SharkTrack applications extend beyond BRUVS analysis, facilitating rapid annotation of unlabeled videos, aiding the development of further models to classify elasmobranch species. We provide public access to the software and an unprecedentedly diverse dataset, facilitating future research in an important area of marine conservation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks are known to be vulnerable to security risks due to the inherent transferable nature of adversarial examples. Despite the success of recent generative model-based attacks demonstrating strong transferability, it still remains a challenge to design an efficient attack strategy in a real-world strict black-box setting, where both the target domain and model architectures are unknown. In this paper, we seek to explore a feature contrastive approach in the frequency domain to generate adversarial examples that are robust in both cross-domain and cross-model settings. With that goal in mind, we propose two modules that are only employed during the training phase: a Frequency-Aware Domain Randomization (FADR) module to randomize domain-variant low- and high-range frequency components and a Frequency-Augmented Contrastive Learning (FACL) module to effectively separate domain-invariant mid-frequency features of clean and perturbed image. We demonstrate strong transferability of our generated adversarial perturbations through extensive cross-domain and cross-model experiments, while keeping the inference time complexity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> An Vo, Ngoc Hoang Luong</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) aims to automate the discovery of high-performing deep neural network architectures. Traditional objective-based NAS approaches typically optimize a certain performance metric (e.g., prediction accuracy), overlooking large parts of the architecture search space that potentially contain interesting network configurations. Furthermore, objective-driven population-based metaheuristics in complex search spaces often quickly exhaust population diversity and succumb to premature convergence to local optima. This issue becomes more complicated in NAS when performance objectives do not fully align with the actual performance of the candidate architectures, as is often the case with training-free metrics. While training-free metrics have gained popularity for their rapid performance estimation of candidate architectures without incurring computation-heavy network training, their effective incorporation into NAS remains a challenge. This paper presents the Pareto Dominance-based Novelty Search for multi-objective NAS with Multiple Training-Free metrics (MTF-PDNS). Unlike conventional NAS methods that optimize explicit objectives, MTF-PDNS promotes population diversity by utilizing a novelty score calculated based on multiple training-free performance and complexity metrics, thereby yielding a broader exploration of the search space. Experimental results on standard NAS benchmark suites demonstrate that MTF-PDNS outperforms conventional methods driven by explicit objectives in terms of convergence speed, diversity maintenance, architecture transferability, and computational costs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent vision-language foundation models, such as CLIP, have demonstrated superior capabilities in learning representations that can be transferable across diverse range of downstream tasks and domains. With the emergence of such powerful models, it has become crucial to effectively leverage their capabilities in tackling challenging vision tasks. On the other hand, only a few works have focused on devising adversarial examples that transfer well to both unknown domains and model architectures. In this paper, we propose a novel transfer attack method called PDCL-Attack, which leverages the CLIP model to enhance the transferability of adversarial perturbations generated by a generative model-based attack framework. Specifically, we formulate an effective prompt-driven feature guidance by harnessing the semantic representation power of text, particularly from the ground-truth class labels of input images. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce prompt learning to enhance the transferable generative attacks. Extensive experiments conducted across various cross-domain and cross-model settings empirically validate our approach, demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Identity document (ID) image analysis has become essential for many online services, like bank account opening or insurance subscription. In recent years, much research has been conducted on subjects like document localization, text recognition and fraud detection, to achieve a level of accuracy reliable enough to automatize identity verification. However, there are only a few available datasets to benchmark ID analysis methods, mainly because of privacy restrictions, security requirements and legal reasons.
  In this paper, we present the DocXPand-25k dataset, which consists of 24,994 richly labeled IDs images, generated using custom-made vectorial templates representing nine fictitious ID designs, including four identity cards, two residence permits and three passports designs. These synthetic IDs feature artificially generated personal information (names, dates, identifiers, faces, barcodes, ...), and present a rich diversity in the visual layouts and textual contents.
  We collected about 5.8k diverse backgrounds coming from real-world photos, scans and screenshots of IDs to guarantee the variety of the backgrounds.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vincent C. Scholz, Yaohua Zang, Phaedon-Stelios Koutsourelakis</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel, data-driven approach for solving high-dimensional Bayesian inverse problems based on partial differential equations (PDEs), called Weak Neural Variational Inference (WNVI). The method complements real measurements with virtual observations derived from the physical model. In particular, weighted residuals are employed as probes to the governing PDE in order to formulate and solve a Bayesian inverse problem without ever formulating nor solving a forward model. The formulation treats the state variables of the physical model as latent variables, inferred using Stochastic Variational Inference (SVI), along with the usual unknowns. The approximate posterior employed uses neural networks to approximate the inverse mapping from state variables to the unknowns. We illustrate the proposed method in a biomedical setting where we infer spatially varying material properties from noisy tissue deformation data. We demonstrate that WNVI is not only as accurate and more efficient than traditional methods that rely on repeatedly solving the (non)linear forward problem as a black-box, but it can also handle ill-posed forward problems (e.g., with insufficient boundary conditions).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minas Karamanis, Uro\v{s} Seljak</p>
<p>Abstract: Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods are powerful tools for Bayesian inference but suffer from requiring many particles for accurate estimates, leading to high computational costs. We introduce persistent sampling (PS), an extension of SMC that mitigates this issue by allowing particles from previous iterations to persist. This generates a growing, weighted ensemble of particles distributed across iterations. In each iteration, PS utilizes multiple importance sampling and resampling from the mixture of all previous distributions to produce the next generation of particles. This addresses particle impoverishment and mode collapse, resulting in more accurate posterior approximations. Furthermore, this approach provides lower-variance marginal likelihood estimates for model comparison. Additionally, the persistent particles improve transition kernel adaptation for efficient exploration. Experiments on complex distributions show that PS consistently outperforms standard methods, achieving lower squared bias in posterior moment estimation and significantly reduced marginal likelihood errors, all at a lower computational cost. PS offers a robust, efficient, and scalable framework for Bayesian inference.</p>

<p>Abstract: Inverse problems have many applications in science and engineering. In Computer vision, several image restoration tasks such as inpainting, deblurring, and super-resolution can be formally modeled as inverse problems. Recently, methods have been developed for solving inverse problems that only leverage a pre-trained unconditional diffusion model and do not require additional task-specific training. In such methods, however, the inherent intractability of determining the conditional score function during the reverse diffusion process poses a real challenge, leaving the methods to settle with an approximation instead, which affects their performance in practice. Here, we propose a MAP estimation framework to model the reverse conditional generation process of a continuous time diffusion model as an optimization process of the underlying MAP objective, whose gradient term is tractable. In theory, the proposed framework can be applied to solve general inverse problems using gradient-based optimization methods. However, given the highly non-convex nature of the loss objective, finding a perfect gradient-based optimization algorithm can be quite challenging, nevertheless, our framework offers several potential research directions. We use our proposed formulation and develop empirically effective algorithms for solving noiseless and noisy image inpainting tasks. We validate our proposed algorithms with extensive experiments across diverse mask settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Neil Ashton, Danielle C. Maddix, Samuel Gundry, Parisa M. Shabestari</p>
<p>Abstract: The development of Machine Learning (ML) methods for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is currently limited by the lack of openly available training data. This paper presents a new open-source dataset comprising of high fidelity, scale-resolving CFD simulations of 500 geometric variations of the Ahmed Car Body - a simplified car-like shape that exhibits many of the flow topologies that are present on bluff bodies such as road vehicles. The dataset contains simulation results that exhibit a broad set of fundamental flow physics such as geometry and pressure-induced flow separation as well as 3D vortical structures. Each variation of the Ahmed car body were run using a high-fidelity, time-accurate, hybrid Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) - Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) turbulence modelling approach using the open-source CFD code OpenFOAM. The dataset contains boundary, volume, geometry, and time-averaged forces/moments in widely used open-source formats. In addition, the OpenFOAM case setup is provided so that others can reproduce or extend the dataset. This represents to the authors knowledge, the first open-source large-scale dataset using high-fidelity CFD methods for the widely used Ahmed car body that is available to freely download with a permissive license (CC-BY-SA).</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces ARCLE, an environment designed to facilitate reinforcement learning research on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC). Addressing this inductive reasoning benchmark with reinforcement learning presents these challenges: a vast action space, a hard-to-reach goal, and a variety of tasks. We demonstrate that an agent with proximal policy optimization can learn individual tasks through ARCLE. The adoption of non-factorial policies and auxiliary losses led to performance enhancements, effectively mitigating issues associated with action spaces and goal attainment. Based on these insights, we propose several research directions and motivations for using ARCLE, including MAML, GFlowNets, and World Models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nils K\"orber, Silvan Wehrli, Christopher Irrgang</p>
<p>Abstract: With the release of ChatGPT and other large language models (LLMs) the discussion about the intelligence, possibilities, and risks, of current and future models have seen large attention. This discussion included much debated scenarios about the imminent rise of so-called "super-human" AI, i.e., AI systems that are orders of magnitude smarter than humans. In the spirit of Alan Turing, there is no doubt that current state-of-the-art language models already pass his famous test. Moreover, current models outperform humans in several benchmark tests, so that publicly available LLMs have already become versatile companions that connect everyday life, industry and science. Despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs sometimes fail completely at tasks that are thought to be trivial for humans. In other cases, the trustworthiness of LLMs becomes much more elusive and difficult to evaluate. Taking the example of academia, language models are capable of writing convincing research articles on a given topic with only little input. Yet, the lack of trustworthiness in terms of factual consistency or the existence of persistent hallucinations in AI-generated text bodies has led to a range of restrictions for AI-based content in many scientific journals. In view of these observations, the question arises as to whether the same metrics that apply to human intelligence can also be applied to computational methods and has been discussed extensively. In fact, the choice of metrics has already been shown to dramatically influence assessments on potential intelligence emergence. Here, we argue that the intelligence of LLMs should not only be assessed by task-specific statistical metrics, but separately in terms of qualitative and quantitative measures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soohyun Lee, Minsuk Chang, Seokhyeon Park, Jinwook Seo</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in vision models have greatly improved their ability to handle complex chart understanding tasks, like chart captioning and question answering. However, it remains challenging to assess how these models process charts. Existing benchmarks only roughly evaluate model performance without evaluating the underlying mechanisms, such as how models extract image embeddings. This limits our understanding of the model's ability to perceive fundamental graphical components. To address this, we introduce a novel evaluation framework to assess the graphical perception of image embedding models. For chart comprehension, we examine two main aspects of channel effectiveness: accuracy and discriminability of various visual channels. Channel accuracy is assessed through the linearity of embeddings, measuring how well the perceived magnitude aligns with the size of the stimulus. Discriminability is evaluated based on the distances between embeddings, indicating their distinctness. Our experiments with the CLIP model show that it perceives channel accuracy differently from humans and shows unique discriminability in channels like length, tilt, and curvature. We aim to develop this work into a broader benchmark for reliable visual encoders, enhancing models for precise chart comprehension and human-like perception in future applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boyang Zhang, Yicong Tan, Yun Shen, Ahmed Salem, Michael Backes, Savvas Zannettou, Yang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, autonomous agents built on large language models (LLMs) have experienced significant development and are being deployed in real-world applications. These agents can extend the base LLM's capabilities in multiple ways. For example, a well-built agent using GPT-3.5-Turbo as its core can outperform the more advanced GPT-4 model by leveraging external components. More importantly, the usage of tools enables these systems to perform actions in the real world, moving from merely generating text to actively interacting with their environment. Given the agents' practical applications and their ability to execute consequential actions, it is crucial to assess potential vulnerabilities. Such autonomous systems can cause more severe damage than a standalone language model if compromised. While some existing research has explored harmful actions by LLM agents, our study approaches the vulnerability from a different perspective. We introduce a new type of attack that causes malfunctions by misleading the agent into executing repetitive or irrelevant actions. We conduct comprehensive evaluations using various attack methods, surfaces, and properties to pinpoint areas of susceptibility. Our experiments reveal that these attacks can induce failure rates exceeding 80\% in multiple scenarios. Through attacks on implemented and deployable agents in multi-agent scenarios, we accentuate the realistic risks associated with these vulnerabilities. To mitigate such attacks, we propose self-examination detection methods. However, our findings indicate these attacks are difficult to detect effectively using LLMs alone, highlighting the substantial risks associated with this vulnerability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Timothy Dai, Kate Maher, Zach Perzan</p>
<p>Abstract: Process-based hydrologic models are invaluable tools for understanding the terrestrial water cycle and addressing modern water resources problems. However, many hydrologic models are computationally expensive and, depending on the resolution and scale, simulations can take on the order of hours to days to complete. While techniques such as uncertainty quantification and optimization have become valuable tools for supporting management decisions, these analyses typically require hundreds of model simulations, which are too computationally expensive to perform with a process-based hydrologic model. To address this gap, we propose a hybrid modeling workflow in which a process-based model is used to generate an initial set of simulations and a machine learning (ML) surrogate model is then trained to perform the remaining simulations required for downstream analysis. As a case study, we apply this workflow to simulations of variably saturated groundwater flow at a prospective managed aquifer recharge (MAR) site. We compare the accuracy and computational efficiency of several ML architectures, including deep convolutional networks, recurrent neural networks, vision transformers, and networks with Fourier transforms. Our results demonstrate that ML surrogate models can achieve under 10% mean absolute percentage error and yield order-of-magnitude runtime savings over processed-based models. We also offer practical recommendations for training hydrologic surrogate models, including implementing data normalization to improve accuracy, using a normalized loss function to improve training stability and downsampling input features to decrease memory requirements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rafael Cristino, Ricardo P. M. Cruz, Jaime S. Cardoso</p>
<p>Abstract: Semantic segmentation consists of predicting a semantic label for each image pixel. Conventional deep learning models do not take advantage of ordinal relations that might exist in the domain at hand. For example, it is known that the pupil is inside the iris, and the lane markings are inside the road. Such domain knowledge can be employed as constraints to make the model more robust. The current literature on this topic has explored pixel-wise ordinal segmentation methods, which treat each pixel as an independent observation and promote ordinality in its representation. This paper proposes novel spatial ordinal segmentation methods, which take advantage of the structured image space by considering each pixel as an observation dependent on its neighborhood context to also promote ordinal spatial consistency. When evaluated with five biomedical datasets and multiple configurations of autonomous driving datasets, ordinal methods resulted in more ordinally-consistent models, with substantial improvements in ordinal metrics and some increase in the Dice coefficient. It was also shown that the incorporation of ordinal consistency results in models with better generalization abilities.</p>

<p>Abstract: We contrast high effectiveness of state of the art deep learning architectures designed for general audio classification tasks, refined for respiratory insufficiency (RI) detection and blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) estimation and classification through automated audio analysis. Recently, multiple deep learning architectures have been proposed to detect RI in COVID patients through audio analysis, achieving accuracy above 95% and F1-score above 0.93. RI is a condition associated with low SpO2 levels, commonly defined as the threshold SpO2 <92%. While SpO2 serves as a crucial determinant of RI, a medical doctor's diagnosis typically relies on multiple factors. These include respiratory frequency, heart rate, SpO2 levels, among others. Here we study pretrained audio neural networks (CNN6, CNN10 and CNN14) and the Masked Autoencoder (Audio-MAE) for RI detection, where these models achieve near perfect accuracy, surpassing previous results. Yet, for the regression task of estimating SpO2 levels, the models achieve root mean square error values exceeding the accepted clinical range of 3.5% for finger oximeters. Additionally, Pearson correlation coefficients fail to surpass 0.3. As deep learning models perform better in classification than regression, we transform SpO2-regression into a SpO2-threshold binary classification problem, with a threshold of 92%. However, this task still yields an F1-score below 0.65. Thus, audio analysis offers valuable insights into a patient's RI status, but does not provide accurate information about actual SpO2 levels, indicating a separation of domains in which voice and speech biomarkers may and may not be useful in medical diagnostics under current technologies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sule Tekkesinoglu, Lars Kunze</p>
<p>Abstract: As machine learning becomes increasingly integral to autonomous decision-making processes involving human interaction, the necessity of comprehending the model's outputs through conversational means increases. Most recently, foundation models are being explored for their potential as post hoc explainers, providing a pathway to elucidate the decision-making mechanisms of predictive models. In this work, we introduce traceable question-answering, leveraging an external knowledge repository to inform the responses of Large Language Models (LLMs) to user queries within a scene understanding task. This knowledge repository comprises contextual details regarding the model's output, containing high-level features, feature importance, and alternative probabilities. We employ subtractive counterfactual reasoning to compute feature importance, a method that entails analysing output variations resulting from decomposing semantic features. Furthermore, to maintain a seamless conversational flow, we integrate four key characteristics - social, causal, selective, and contrastive - drawn from social science research on human explanations into a single-shot prompt, guiding the response generation process. Our evaluation demonstrates that explanations generated by the LLMs encompassed these elements, indicating its potential to bridge the gap between complex model outputs and natural language expressions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are intensively used in many downstream tasks, including those requiring assessments of individuals appearing in the images. While VLMs perform well in simple single-person scenarios, in real-world applications, we often face complex situations in which there are persons of different genders doing different activities. We show that in such cases, VLMs are biased towards identifying the individual with the expected gender (according to ingrained gender stereotypes in the model or other forms of sample selection bias) as the performer of the activity. We refer to this bias in associating an activity with the gender of its actual performer in an image or text as the Gender-Activity Binding (GAB) bias and analyze how this bias is internalized in VLMs. To assess this bias, we have introduced the GAB dataset with approximately 5500 AI-generated images that represent a variety of activities, addressing the scarcity of real-world images for some scenarios. To have extensive quality control, the generated images are evaluated for their diversity, quality, and realism. We have tested 12 renowned pre-trained VLMs on this dataset in the context of text-to-image and image-to-text retrieval to measure the effect of this bias on their predictions. Additionally, we have carried out supplementary experiments to quantify the bias in VLMs' text encoders and to evaluate VLMs' capability to recognize activities. Our experiments indicate that VLMs experience an average performance decline of about 13.2% when confronted with gender-activity binding bias.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) have demonstrated notable success in self-supervised representation learning across various tasks. However, the existing CLIP-like approaches often demand extensive GPU resources and prolonged training times due to the considerable size of the model and dataset, making them poor for medical applications, in which large datasets are not always common. Meanwhile, the language model prompts are mainly manually derived from labels tied to images, potentially overlooking the richness of information within training samples. We introduce a novel language-image Contrastive Learning method with an Efficient large language model and prompt Fine-Tuning (CLEFT) that harnesses the strengths of the extensive pre-trained language and visual models. Furthermore, we present an efficient strategy for learning context-based prompts that mitigates the gap between informative clinical diagnostic data and simple class labels. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on multiple chest X-ray and mammography datasets compared with various baselines. The proposed parameter efficient framework can reduce the total trainable model size by 39% and reduce the trainable language model to only 4% compared with the current BERT encoder.</p>

<p>Abstract: We consider a novel stochastic multi-armed bandit setting, where playing an arm makes it unavailable for a fixed number of time slots thereafter. This models situations where reusing an arm too often is undesirable (e.g. making the same product recommendation repeatedly) or infeasible (e.g. compute job scheduling on machines). We show that with prior knowledge of the rewards and delays of all the arms, the problem of optimizing cumulative reward does not admit any pseudo-polynomial time algorithm (in the number of arms) unless randomized exponential time hypothesis is false, by mapping to the PINWHEEL scheduling problem. Subsequently, we show that a simple greedy algorithm that plays the available arm with the highest reward is asymptotically $(1-1/e)$ optimal. When the rewards are unknown, we design a UCB based algorithm which is shown to have $c \log T + o(\log T)$ cumulative regret against the greedy algorithm, leveraging the free exploration of arms due to the unavailability. Finally, when all the delays are equal the problem reduces to Combinatorial Semi-bandits providing us with a lower bound of $c' \log T+ \omega(\log T)$.</p>

<p>Abstract: Causal learning has garnered significant attention in recent years because it reveals the essential relationships that underpin phenomena and delineates the mechanisms by which the world evolves. Nevertheless, traditional causal learning methods face numerous challenges and limitations, including high-dimensional, unstructured variables, combinatorial optimization problems, unobserved confounders, selection biases, and estimation inaccuracies. Deep causal learning, which leverages deep neural networks, offers innovative insights and solutions for addressing these challenges. Although numerous deep learning-based methods for causal discovery and inference have been proposed, there remains a dearth of reviews examining the underlying mechanisms by which deep learning can enhance causal learning. In this article, we comprehensively review how deep learning can contribute to causal learning by tackling traditional challenges across three key dimensions: representation, discovery, and inference. We emphasize that deep causal learning is pivotal for advancing the theoretical frontiers and broadening the practical applications of causal science. We conclude by summarizing open issues and outlining potential directions for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simin Li, Jun Guo, Jingqiao Xiu, Yuwei Zheng, Pu Feng, Xin Yu, Aishan Liu, Yaodong Yang, Bo An, Wenjun Wu, Xianglong Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: This study probes the vulnerabilities of cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (c-MARL) under adversarial attacks, a critical determinant of c-MARL's worst-case performance prior to real-world implementation. Current observation-based attacks, constrained by white-box assumptions, overlook c-MARL's complex multi-agent interactions and cooperative objectives, resulting in impractical and limited attack capabilities. To address these shortcomes, we propose Adversarial Minority Influence (AMI), a practical and strong for c-MARL. AMI is a practical black-box attack and can be launched without knowing victim parameters. AMI is also strong by considering the complex multi-agent interaction and the cooperative goal of agents, enabling a single adversarial agent to unilaterally misleads majority victims to form targeted worst-case cooperation. This mirrors minority influence phenomena in social psychology. To achieve maximum deviation in victim policies under complex agent-wise interactions, our unilateral attack aims to characterize and maximize the impact of the adversary on the victims. This is achieved by adapting a unilateral agent-wise relation metric derived from mutual information, thereby mitigating the adverse effects of victim influence on the adversary. To lead the victims into a jointly detrimental scenario, our targeted attack deceives victims into a long-term, cooperatively harmful situation by guiding each victim towards a specific target, determined through a trial-and-error process executed by a reinforcement learning agent. Through AMI, we achieve the first successful attack against real-world robot swarms and effectively fool agents in simulated environments into collectively worst-case scenarios, including Starcraft II and Multi-agent Mujoco.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weiqi Zhang, Guanlue Li, Jianheng Tang, Jia Li, Fugee Tsung</p>
<p>Abstract: Data imputation is a crucial task due to the widespread occurrence of missing data. Many methods adopt a two-step approach: initially crafting a preliminary imputation (the "draft") and then refining it to produce the final missing data imputation result, commonly referred to as "draft-then-refine". In our study, we examine this prevalent strategy through the lens of graph Dirichlet energy. We observe that a basic "draft" imputation tends to decrease the Dirichlet energy. Therefore, a subsequent "refine" step is necessary to restore the overall energy balance. Existing refinement techniques, such as the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), often result in further energy reduction. To address this, we introduce a new framework, the Graph Laplacian Pyramid Network (GLPN). GLPN incorporates a U-shaped autoencoder and residual networks to capture both global and local details effectively. Through extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets, GLPN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across three different missing data mechanisms.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lucas Goncalves, Seong-Gyun Leem, Wei-Cheng Lin, Berrak Sisman, Carlos Busso</p>
<p>Abstract: Most current audio-visual emotion recognition models lack the flexibility needed for deployment in practical applications. We envision a multimodal system that works even when only one modality is available and can be implemented interchangeably for either predicting emotional attributes or recognizing categorical emotions. Achieving such flexibility in a multimodal emotion recognition system is difficult due to the inherent challenges in accurately interpreting and integrating varied data sources. It is also a challenge to robustly handle missing or partial information while allowing direct switch between regression or classification tasks. This study proposes a versatile audio-visual learning (VAVL) framework for handling unimodal and multimodal systems for emotion regression or emotion classification tasks. We implement an audio-visual framework that can be trained even when audio and visual paired data is not available for part of the training set (i.e., audio only or only video is present). We achieve this effective representation learning with audio-visual shared layers, residual connections over shared layers, and a unimodal reconstruction task. Our experimental results reveal that our architecture significantly outperforms strong baselines on the CREMA-D, MSP-IMPROV, and CMU-MOSEI corpora. Notably, VAVL attains a new state-of-the-art performance in the emotional attribute prediction task on the MSP-IMPROV corpus.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rafael Rafailov, Archit Sharma, Eric Mitchell, Stefano Ermon, Christopher D. Manning, Chelsea Finn</p>
<p>Abstract: While large-scale unsupervised language models (LMs) learn broad world knowledge and some reasoning skills, achieving precise control of their behavior is difficult due to the completely unsupervised nature of their training. Existing methods for gaining such steerability collect human labels of the relative quality of model generations and fine-tune the unsupervised LM to align with these preferences, often with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However, RLHF is a complex and often unstable procedure, first fitting a reward model that reflects the human preferences, and then fine-tuning the large unsupervised LM using reinforcement learning to maximize this estimated reward without drifting too far from the original model. In this paper we introduce a new parameterization of the reward model in RLHF that enables extraction of the corresponding optimal policy in closed form, allowing us to solve the standard RLHF problem with only a simple classification loss. The resulting algorithm, which we call Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), is stable, performant, and computationally lightweight, eliminating the need for sampling from the LM during fine-tuning or performing significant hyperparameter tuning. Our experiments show that DPO can fine-tune LMs to align with human preferences as well as or better than existing methods. Notably, fine-tuning with DPO exceeds PPO-based RLHF in ability to control sentiment of generations, and matches or improves response quality in summarization and single-turn dialogue while being substantially simpler to implement and train.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Laya Das, Sai Munikoti, Nrushad Joshi, Mahantesh Halappanavar</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the problem of learning features through self-supervision that are generalisable to multiple graphs. State-of-the-art graph self-supervision restricts training to only one graph, resulting in graph-specific models that are incompatible with different but related graphs. We hypothesize that training with more than one graph that belong to the same family can improve the quality of the learnt representations. However, learning universal features from disparate node/edge features in different graphs is non-trivial. To address this challenge, we first homogenise the disparate features with graph-specific encoders that transform the features into a common space. A universal representation learning module then learns generalisable features on this common space. We show that compared to traditional self-supervision with one graph, our approach results in (1) better performance on downstream node classification, (2) learning features that can be re-used for unseen graphs of the same family, (3) more efficient training and (4) compact yet generalisable models. We also show ability of the proposed framework to deliver these benefits for relatively larger graphs. In this paper, we present a principled way to design foundation graph models that learn from more than one graph in an end-to-end manner, while bridging the gap between self-supervised and supervised performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amirhossein Zolfagharian, Manel Abdellatif, Lionel C. Briand, Ramesh S</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning algorithms (DRL) are increasingly being used in safety-critical systems. Ensuring the safety of DRL agents is a critical concern in such contexts. However, relying solely on testing is not sufficient to ensure safety as it does not offer guarantees. Building safety monitors is one solution to alleviate this challenge. This paper proposes SMARLA, a machine learning-based safety monitoring approach designed for DRL agents. For practical reasons, SMARLA is agnostic to the type of DRL agent's inputs. Further, it is designed to be black-box (as it does not require access to the internals or training data of the agent) by leveraging state abstraction to facilitate the learning of safety violation prediction models from the agent's states using a reduced state space. We quantitatively and qualitatively validated SMARLA on three well-known RL case studies. Empirical results reveal that SMARLA achieves accurate violation prediction with a low false positive rate and can predict safety violations at an early stage, approximately halfway through the execution of the agent, before violations occur.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eran Malach</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models display remarkable capabilities in logical and mathematical reasoning, allowing them to solve complex tasks. Interestingly, these abilities emerge in networks trained on the simple task of next-token prediction. In this work, we present a theoretical framework for studying auto-regressive next-token predictors. We demonstrate that even simple models such as linear next-token predictors, trained on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data, can approximate any function efficiently computed by a Turing machine. We introduce a new complexity measure -- length complexity -- which measures the number of intermediate tokens in a CoT sequence required to approximate some target function, and analyze the interplay between length complexity and other notions of complexity. Finally, we show experimentally that simple next-token predictors, such as linear networks and shallow Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), display non-trivial performance on text generation and arithmetic tasks. Our results demonstrate that the power of today's LLMs can be attributed, to a great extent, to the auto-regressive next-token training scheme, and not necessarily to a particular choice of architecture.</p>

<p>Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (RL), which learns environment model from offline dataset and generates more out-of-distribution model data, has become an effective approach to the problem of distribution shift in offline RL. Due to the gap between the learned and actual environment, conservatism should be incorporated into the algorithm to balance accurate offline data and imprecise model data. The conservatism of current algorithms mostly relies on model uncertainty estimation. However, uncertainty estimation is unreliable and leads to poor performance in certain scenarios, and the previous methods ignore differences between the model data, which brings great conservatism. Therefore, this paper proposes a milDly cOnservative Model-bAsed offlINe RL algorithm (DOMAIN) without estimating model uncertainty to address the above issues. DOMAIN introduces adaptive sampling distribution of model samples, which can adaptively adjust the model data penalty. In this paper, we theoretically demonstrate that the Q value learned by the DOMAIN outside the region is a lower bound of the true Q value, the DOMAIN is less conservative than previous model-based offline RL algorithms and has the guarantee of safety policy improvement. The results of extensive experiments show that DOMAIN outperforms prior RL algorithms on the D4RL dataset benchmark.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zheshun Wu, Zenglin Xu, Dun Zeng, Qifan Wang, Jie Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has surged in prominence due to its capability of collaborative model training without direct data sharing. However, the vast disparity in local data distributions among clients, often termed the Non-Independent Identically Distributed (Non-IID) challenge, poses a significant hurdle to FL's generalization efficacy. The scenario becomes even more complex when not all clients participate in the training process, a common occurrence due to unstable network connections or limited computational capacities. This can greatly complicate the assessment of the trained models' generalization abilities. While a plethora of recent studies has centered on the generalization gap pertaining to unseen data from participating clients with diverse distributions, the distinction between the training distributions of participating clients and the testing distributions of non-participating ones has been largely overlooked. In response, our paper unveils an information-theoretic generalization framework for FL. Specifically, it quantifies generalization errors by evaluating the information entropy of local distributions and discerning discrepancies across these distributions. Inspired by our deduced generalization bounds, we introduce a weighted aggregation approach and a duo of client selection strategies. These innovations are designed to strengthen FL's ability to generalize and thus ensure that trained models perform better on non-participating clients by incorporating a more diverse range of client data distributions. Our extensive empirical evaluations reaffirm the potency of our proposed methods, aligning seamlessly with our theoretical construct.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nathael Da Costa, Cyrus Mostajeran, Juan-Pablo Ortega, Salem Said</p>
<p>Abstract: Kernel methods are powerful tools in machine learning. Classical kernel methods are based on positive-definite kernels, which map data spaces into reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS). For non-Euclidean data spaces, positive-definite kernels are difficult to come by. In this case, we propose the use of reproducing kernel Krein space (RKKS) based methods, which require only kernels that admit a positive decomposition. We show that one does not need to access this decomposition in order to learn in RKKS. We then investigate the conditions under which a kernel is positively decomposable. We show that invariant kernels admit a positive decomposition on homogeneous spaces under tractable regularity assumptions. This makes them much easier to construct than positive-definite kernels, providing a route for learning with kernels for non-Euclidean data. By the same token, this provides theoretical foundations for RKKS-based methods in general.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunhui Jang, Seul Lee, Sungsoo Ahn</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, there has been a surge of interest in employing neural networks for graph generation, a fundamental statistical learning problem with critical applications like molecule design and community analysis. However, most approaches encounter significant limitations when generating large-scale graphs. This is due to their requirement to output the full adjacency matrices whose size grows quadratically with the number of nodes. In response to this challenge, we introduce a new, simple, and scalable graph representation named gap encoded edge list (GEEL) that has a small representation size that aligns with the number of edges. In addition, GEEL significantly reduces the vocabulary size by incorporating the gap encoding and bandwidth restriction schemes. GEEL can be autoregressively generated with the incorporation of node positional encoding, and we further extend GEEL to deal with attributed graphs by designing a new grammar. Our findings reveal that the adoption of this compact representation not only enhances scalability but also bolsters performance by simplifying the graph generation process. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation across ten non-attributed and two molecular graph generation tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of GEEL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Surojit Ganguli, Zeyu Zhou, Christopher G. Brinton, David I. Inouye</p>
<p>Abstract: Vertical Federated learning (VFL) is a class of FL where each client shares the same set of samples but only owns a subset of the features. Usually, VFL assumes perfect hardware and communication capabilities. However, this assumption hinders the broad deployment of VFL, particularly on a network of edge devices, which are heterogeneous in their in-situ capabilities while any device may connect/disconnect from the network over time. To address this gap, we study the test time performance of VFL under dynamic network conditions, which we call DN-VFL. We first formalize DN-VFL, including a message passing distributed inference algorithm, the corresponding risk, and a serverless setup. We develop a novel DN-VFL approach called Multiple Aggregation with Gossip Rounds and Simulated Faults (MAGS) that synthesizes replication, gossiping, and selective feature omission to improve performance significantly over baselines. Furthermore, we propose metrics and extensively analyze MAGS using a simulated sensor network. The results show that naively using VFL for DN-VFL is not the best approach. Rather, MAGS present a better alternative to handle changes in the network during inference.</p>

<p>Abstract: The ability of machine learning systems to learn continually is hindered by catastrophic forgetting, the tendency of neural networks to overwrite previously acquired knowledge when learning a new task. Existing methods mitigate this problem through regularization, parameter isolation, or rehearsal, but they are typically evaluated on benchmarks comprising only a handful of tasks. In contrast, humans are able to learn over long time horizons in dynamic, open-world environments, effortlessly memorizing unfamiliar objects and reliably recognizing them under various transformations. To make progress towards closing this gap, we introduce Infinite dSprites, a parsimonious tool for creating continual classification and disentanglement benchmarks of arbitrary length and with full control over generative factors. We show that over a sufficiently long time horizon, the performance of all major types of continual learning methods deteriorates on this simple benchmark. This result highlights an important and previously overlooked aspect of continual learning: given a finite modelling capacity and an arbitrarily long learning horizon, efficient learning requires memorizing class-specific information and accumulating knowledge about general mechanisms. In a simple setting with direct supervision on the generative factors, we show how learning class-agnostic transformations offers a way to circumvent catastrophic forgetting and improve classification accuracy over time. Our approach sets the stage for continual learning over hundreds of tasks with explicit control over memorization and forgetting, emphasizing open-set classification and one-shot generalization.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00912">Can we Constrain Concept Bottleneck Models to Learn Semantically Meaningful Input Features?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jack Furby, Daniel Cunnington, Dave Braines, Alun Preece</p>
<p>Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) are regarded as inherently interpretable because they first predict a set of human-defined concepts which are used to predict a task label. For inherent interpretability to be fully realised, and ensure trust in a model's output, it's desirable for concept predictions to use semantically meaningful input features. For instance, in an image, pixels representing a broken bone should contribute to predicting a fracture. However, current literature suggests that concept predictions often rely on irrelevant input features. We hypothesise that this occurs when dataset labels include inaccurate concept annotations, or the relationship between input features and concepts is unclear. In general, the effect of dataset labelling on concept representations remains an understudied area. In this paper, we demonstrate that CBMs can learn to map concepts to semantically meaningful input features, by utilising datasets with a clear link between the input features and the desired concept predictions. This is achieved, for instance, by ensuring multiple concepts do not always co-occur and, therefore provide a clear training signal for the CBM to distinguish the relevant input features for each concept. We validate our hypothesis on both synthetic and real-world image datasets, and demonstrate under the correct conditions, CBMs can learn to attribute semantically meaningful input features to the correct concept predictions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Grigorii Veviurko, Wendelin B\"ohmer, Mathijs de Weerdt</p>
<p>Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL), different reward functions can define the same optimal policy but result in drastically different learning performance. For some, the agent gets stuck with a suboptimal behavior, and for others, it solves the task efficiently. Choosing a good reward function is hence an extremely important yet challenging problem. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach for using rewards for learning. We introduce \textit{max-reward RL}, where an agent optimizes the maximum rather than the cumulative reward. Unlike earlier works, our approach works for deterministic and stochastic environments and can be easily combined with state-of-the-art RL algorithms. In the experiments, we study the performance of max-reward RL algorithms in two goal-reaching environments from Gymnasium-Robotics and demonstrate its benefits over standard RL.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikita Gushchin, Sergei Kholkin, Evgeny Burnaev, Alexander Korotin</p>
<p>Abstract: Schr\"odinger Bridges (SB) have recently gained the attention of the ML community as a promising extension of classic diffusion models which is also interconnected to the Entropic Optimal Transport (EOT). Recent solvers for SB exploit the pervasive bridge matching procedures. Such procedures aim to recover a stochastic process transporting the mass between distributions given only a transport plan between them. In particular, given the EOT plan, these procedures can be adapted to solve SB. This fact is heavily exploited by recent works giving rise to matching-based SB solvers. The cornerstone here is recovering the EOT plan: recent works either use heuristical approximations (e.g., the minibatch OT) or establish iterative matching procedures which by the design accumulate the error during the training. We address these limitations and propose a novel procedure to learn SB which we call the \textbf{optimal Schr\"odinger bridge matching}. It exploits the optimal parameterization of the diffusion process and provably recovers the SB process \textbf{(a)} with a single bridge matching step and \textbf{(b)} with arbitrary transport plan as the input. Furthermore, we show that the optimal bridge matching objective coincides with the recently discovered energy-based modeling (EBM) objectives to learn EOT/SB. Inspired by this observation, we develop a light solver (which we call LightSB-M) to implement optimal matching in practice using the Gaussian mixture parameterization of the adjusted Schr\"odinger potential. We experimentally showcase the performance of our solver in a range of practical tasks. The code for our solver can be found at https://github.com/SKholkin/LightSB-Matching.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jos\'e \'Angel Mart\'in-Baos, Ricardo Garc\'ia-R\'odenas, Luis Rodriguez-Benitez, Michel Bierlaire</p>
<p>Abstract: The application of kernel-based Machine Learning (ML) techniques to discrete choice modelling using large datasets often faces challenges due to memory requirements and the considerable number of parameters involved in these models. This complexity hampers the efficient training of large-scale models. This paper addresses these problems of scalability by introducing the Nystr\"om approximation for Kernel Logistic Regression (KLR) on large datasets. The study begins by presenting a theoretical analysis in which: i) the set of KLR solutions is characterised, ii) an upper bound to the solution of KLR with Nystr\"om approximation is provided, and finally iii) a specialisation of the optimisation algorithms to Nystr\"om KLR is described. After this, the Nystr\"om KLR is computationally validated. Four landmark selection methods are tested, including basic uniform sampling, a k-means sampling strategy, and two non-uniform methods grounded in leverage scores. The performance of these strategies is evaluated using large-scale transport mode choice datasets and is compared with traditional methods such as Multinomial Logit (MNL) and contemporary ML techniques. The study also assesses the efficiency of various optimisation techniques for the proposed Nystr\"om KLR model. The performance of gradient descent, Momentum, Adam, and L-BFGS-B optimisation methods is examined on these datasets. Among these strategies, the k-means Nystr\"om KLR approach emerges as a successful solution for applying KLR to large datasets, particularly when combined with the L-BFGS-B and Adam optimisation methods. The results highlight the ability of this strategy to handle datasets exceeding 200,000 observations while maintaining robust performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Practitioners conducting adaptive experiments often encounter two competing priorities: maximizing total welfare (or `reward') through effective treatment assignment and swiftly concluding experiments to implement population-wide treatments. Current literature addresses these priorities separately, with regret minimization studies focusing on the former and best-arm identification research on the latter. This paper bridges this divide by proposing a unified model that simultaneously accounts for within-experiment performance and post-experiment outcomes. We provide a sharp theory of optimal performance in large populations that not only unifies canonical results in the literature but also uncovers novel insights. Our theory reveals that familiar algorithms, such as the recently proposed top-two Thompson sampling algorithm, can optimize a broad class of objectives if a single scalar parameter is appropriately adjusted. In addition, we demonstrate that substantial reductions in experiment duration can often be achieved with minimal impact on both within-experiment and post-experiment regret.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chaoqun Du, Yizeng Han, Gao Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in semi-supervised learning have focused on a more realistic yet challenging task: addressing imbalances in labeled data while the class distribution of unlabeled data remains both unknown and potentially mismatched. Current approaches in this sphere often presuppose rigid assumptions regarding the class distribution of unlabeled data, thereby limiting the adaptability of models to only certain distribution ranges. In this study, we propose a novel approach, introducing a highly adaptable framework, designated as SimPro, which does not rely on any predefined assumptions about the distribution of unlabeled data. Our framework, grounded in a probabilistic model, innovatively refines the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm by explicitly decoupling the modeling of conditional and marginal class distributions. This separation facilitates a closed-form solution for class distribution estimation during the maximization phase, leading to the formulation of a Bayes classifier. The Bayes classifier, in turn, enhances the quality of pseudo-labels in the expectation phase. Remarkably, the SimPro framework not only comes with theoretical guarantees but also is straightforward to implement. Moreover, we introduce two novel class distributions broadening the scope of the evaluation. Our method showcases consistent state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks and data distribution scenarios. Our code is available at https://github.com/LeapLabTHU/SimPro.</p>

In a scenario where small base stations (SBSs) serve as local models trained on cached data, and a macro base station (MBS) functions as the global model setting, an attacker can exploit the vulnerability of FL, launching attacks with various adversarial attacks or deployment tactics.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nathan Gavenski, Felipe Meneguzzi, Michael Luck, Odinaldo Rodrigues</p>
<p>Abstract: Imitation learning is an approach in which an agent learns how to execute a task by trying to mimic how one or more teachers perform it. This learning approach offers a compromise between the time it takes to learn a new task and the effort needed to collect teacher samples for the agent. It achieves this by balancing learning from the teacher, who has some information on how to perform the task, and deviating from their examples when necessary, such as states not present in the teacher samples. Consequently, the field of imitation learning has received much attention from researchers in recent years, resulting in many new methods and applications. However, with this increase in published work and past surveys focusing mainly on methodology, a lack of standardisation became more prominent in the field. This non-standardisation is evident in the use of environments, which appear in no more than two works, and evaluation processes, such as qualitative analysis, that have become rare in current literature. In this survey, we systematically review current imitation learning literature and present our findings by (i) classifying imitation learning techniques, environments and metrics by introducing novel taxonomies; (ii) reflecting on main problems from the literature; and (iii) presenting challenges and future directions for researchers.</p>

To overcome this inherent lack of interpretability, we propose ECATS, a concept-based neuro-symbolic architecture where concepts are represented as Signal Temporal Logic (STL) formulae. Leveraging kernel-based methods for STL, concept embeddings are learnt in an unsupervised manner through a cross-attention mechanism. The network makes class predictions through these concept embeddings, allowing for a meaningful explanation to be naturally extracted for each input. Our preliminary experiments with a simple CPS-based dataset show that our model is able to achieve great classification performance while ensuring local interpretability.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graph Attention Networks (GATs) are designed to provide flexible neighborhood aggregation that assigns weights to neighbors according to their importance. In practice, however, GATs are often unable to switch off task-irrelevant neighborhood aggregation, as we show experimentally and analytically. To address this challenge, we propose GATE, a GAT extension that holds three major advantages: i) It alleviates over-smoothing by addressing its root cause of unnecessary neighborhood aggregation. ii) Similarly to perceptrons, it benefits from higher depth as it can still utilize additional layers for (non-)linear feature transformations in case of (nearly) switched-off neighborhood aggregation. iii) By down-weighting connections to unrelated neighbors, it often outperforms GATs on real-world heterophilic datasets. To further validate our claims, we construct a synthetic test bed to analyze a model's ability to utilize the appropriate amount of neighborhood aggregation, which could be of independent interest.</p>

<p>Abstract: The recent rapid development of language models (LMs) has attracted attention in the field of time series, including multimodal time series modeling. However, we note that current time series multimodal methods are biased, often assigning a primary role to one modality while the other assumes a secondary role. They overlook the mutual benefits and complementary of different modalities. For example, in seizure diagnosis, relying solely on textual clinical reports makes it difficult to pinpoint the area and type of the disease, while electroencephalograms (EEGs) alone cannot provide an accurate diagnosis without considering the symptoms. In this study, based on the complementary information mining of time series multimodal data, we propose DualTime, a Dual-adapter multimodal language model for Time series representation implementing temporal-primary and textual-primary modeling simultaneously. By injecting lightweight adaption tokens, the LM pipeline shared by dual adapters encourages embedding alignment and achieves efficient fine-tuning. Empirically, our method outperforms state-of-the-art models in both supervised and unsupervised settings, highlighting the complementary benefits of different modalities. In addition, we conduct few-shot label transfer experiments, which further verifies the transferability and expressiveness of our proposed DualTime.</p>

Our method is designed based on a non-conformity score function that has its roots in Evidential Deep Learning (EDL) as a method of quantifying model (epistemic) uncertainty in DNN classifiers. We use evidence that are derived from the logit values of target labels to compute the components of our non-conformity score function: the heuristic notion of uncertainty in CP, uncertainty surprisal, and expected utility. Our extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that ECP outperforms three state-of-the-art methods for generating CP sets, in terms of their set sizes and adaptivity while maintaining the coverage of true labels.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohamed Hassouna, Clara Holzh\"uter, Pawel Lytaev, Josephine Thomas, Bernhard Sick, Christoph Scholz</p>
<p>Abstract: The challenges posed by renewable energy and distributed electricity generation motivate the development of deep learning approaches to overcome the lack of flexibility of traditional methods in power grids use cases. The application of GNNs is particularly promising due to their ability to learn from graph-structured data present in power grids. Combined with RL, they can serve as control approaches to determine remedial grid actions. This review analyses the ability of GRL to capture the inherent graph structure of power grids to improve representation learning and decision making in different power grid use cases. It distinguishes between common problems in transmission and distribution grids and explores the synergy between RL and GNNs. In transmission grids, GRL typically addresses automated grid management and topology control, whereas on the distribution side, GRL concentrates more on voltage regulation. We analyzed the selected papers based on their graph structure and GNN model, the applied RL algorithm, and their overall contributions. Although GRL demonstrate adaptability in the face of unpredictable events and noisy or incomplete data, it primarily serves as a proof of concept at this stage. There are multiple open challenges and limitations that need to be addressed when considering the application of RL to real power grid operation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Marczak, Bart{\l}omiej Twardowski, Tomasz Trzci\'nski, Sebastian Cygert</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a continual learning approach named MagMax, which utilizes model merging to enable large pre-trained models to continuously learn from new data without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. Distinct from traditional continual learning methods that aim to reduce forgetting during task training, MagMax combines sequential fine-tuning with a maximum magnitude weight selection for effective knowledge integration across tasks. Our initial contribution is an extensive examination of model merging techniques, revealing that simple approaches like weight averaging and random weight selection surprisingly hold up well in various continual learning contexts. More importantly, we present MagMax, a novel model-merging strategy that enables continual learning of large pre-trained models for successive tasks. Our thorough evaluation demonstrates the superiority of MagMax in various scenarios, including class- and domain-incremental learning settings.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Achintya Kundu, Rhui Dih Lee, Laura Wynter, Raghu Kiran Ganti, Mayank Mishra</p>
<p>Abstract: Padding is often used in tuning LLM models by adding special tokens to shorter training examples to match the length of the longest sequence in each batch. While this ensures uniformity for batch processing, it introduces inefficiencies by including irrelevant padding tokens in the computation and wastes GPU resources. Hugging Face SFT trainer has always offered the option to use packing to combine multiple training examples, allowing for maximal utilization of GPU resources. However, up till now, it did not offer proper masking of each packed training example. This capability has now been added to Hugging Face Transformers 4.43. We analyse this new feature and show the benefits across different variations of packing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> GaoXiang Zhao, Li Zhou, XiaoQiang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Long time series forecasting aims to utilize historical information to forecast future states over extended horizons. Traditional RNN-based series forecasting methods struggle to effectively address long-term dependencies and gradient issues in long time series problems. Recently, SegRNN has emerged as a leading RNN-based model tailored for long-term series forecasting, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance while maintaining a streamlined architecture through innovative segmentation and parallel decoding techniques. Nevertheless, SegRNN has several limitations: its fixed segmentation disrupts data continuity and fails to effectively leverage information across different segments, the segmentation strategy employed by SegRNN does not fundamentally address the issue of information loss within the recurrent structure. To address these issues, we propose the ISMRNN method with three key enhancements: we introduce an implicit segmentation structure to decompose the time series and map it to segmented hidden states, resulting in denser information exchange during the segmentation phase. Additionally, we incorporate residual structures in the encoding layer to mitigate information loss within the recurrent structure. To extract information more effectively, we further integrate the Mamba architecture to enhance time series information extraction. Experiments on several real-world long time series forecasting datasets demonstrate that our model surpasses the performance of current state-of-the-art models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tae-Geun Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: This study proposes two novel learning rate schedulers: the Hyperbolic Learning Rate Scheduler (HyperbolicLR) and the Exponential Hyperbolic Learning Rate Scheduler (ExpHyperbolicLR). These schedulers attempt to address the inconsistent learning curves often observed in conventional schedulers when adjusting the number of epochs. By leveraging the asymptotic behavior of hyperbolic curves, the proposed schedulers maintain more consistent learning curves across varying epoch settings. The HyperbolicLR algorithm directly applies this property to the epoch-learning rate space, while the ExpHyperbolicLR maps this concept onto the exponential space of epochs and learning rates. To evaluate the performance of these schedulers, first we found the optimal hyperparameters for each scheduler on a small number of epochs, fixed these values, and compared their performance as the number of epochs increased. Our experimental results on various deep learning tasks and architectures demonstrate that both HyperbolicLR and ExpHyperbolicLR maintain more consistent performance improvements compared to conventional schedulers as the number of epochs increases. These findings suggest that our hyperbolic-based learning rate schedulers offer a more robust and efficient approach to training deep neural networks, especially in scenarios where computational resources or time constraints limit extensive hyperparameter searches.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper is about the recent notion of computably probably approximately correct learning, which lies between the statistical learning theory where there is no computational requirement on the learner and efficient PAC where the learner must be polynomially bounded. Examples have recently been given of hypothesis classes which are PAC learnable but not computably PAC learnable, but these hypothesis classes are unnatural or non-canonical in the sense that they depend on a numbering of proofs, formulas, or programs. We use the on-a-cone machinery from computability theory to prove that, under mild assumptions such as that the hypothesis class can be computably listable, any natural hypothesis class which is learnable must be computably learnable. Thus the counterexamples given previously are necessarily unnatural.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kanghyun Choi, Hye Yoon Lee, Dain Kwon, SunJong Park, Kyuyeun Kim, Noseong Park, Jinho Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Data-free quantization (DFQ) is a technique that creates a lightweight network from its full-precision counterpart without the original training data, often through a synthetic dataset. Although several DFQ methods have been proposed for vision transformer (ViT) architectures, they fail to achieve efficacy in low-bit settings. Examining the existing methods, we identify that their synthetic data produce misaligned attention maps, while those of the real samples are highly aligned. From the observation of aligned attention, we find that aligning attention maps of synthetic data helps to improve the overall performance of quantized ViTs. Motivated by this finding, we devise \aname, a novel DFQ method designed for ViTs that focuses on inter-head attention similarity. First, we generate synthetic data by aligning head-wise attention responses in relation to spatial query patches. Then, we apply head-wise structural attention distillation to align the attention maps of the quantized network to those of the full-precision teacher. The experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms baselines, setting a new state-of-the-art performance for data-free ViT quantization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen-Lu Ding, Jiancan Wu, Wei Lin, Shiyang Shen, Xiang Wang, Yancheng Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a novel self-supervised deep clustering approach tailored for unstructured data without requiring prior knowledge of the number of clusters, termed Adaptive Self-supervised Robust Clustering (ASRC). In particular, ASRC adaptively learns the graph structure and edge weights to capture both local and global structural information. The obtained graph enables us to learn clustering-friendly feature representations by an enhanced graph auto-encoder with contrastive learning technique. It further leverages the clustering results adaptively obtained by robust continuous clustering (RCC) to generate prototypes for negative sampling, which can further contribute to promoting consistency among positive pairs and enlarging the gap between positive and negative samples. ASRC obtains the final clustering results by applying RCC to the learned feature representations with their consistent graph structure and edge weights. Extensive experiments conducted on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficacy of ASRC, demonstrating its superior performance over other popular clustering models. Notably, ASRC even outperforms methods that rely on prior knowledge of the number of clusters, highlighting its effectiveness in addressing the challenges of clustering unstructured data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Freund, Chamsi Hssaine</p>
<p>Abstract: We study a decision-maker's problem of finding optimal monetary incentive schemes for retention when faced with agents whose participation decisions (stochastically) depend on the incentive they receive. Our focus is on policies constrained to fulfill two fairness properties that preclude outcomes wherein different groups of agents experience different treatment on average. We formulate the problem as a high-dimensional stochastic optimization problem, and study it through the use of a closely related deterministic variant. We show that the optimal static solution to this deterministic variant is asymptotically optimal for the dynamic problem under fairness constraints. Though solving for the optimal static solution gives rise to a non-convex optimization problem, we uncover a structural property that allows us to design a tractable, fast-converging heuristic policy. Traditional schemes for retention ignore fairness constraints; indeed, the goal in these is to use differentiation to incentivize repeated engagement with the system. Our work (i) shows that even in the absence of explicit discrimination, dynamic policies may unintentionally discriminate between agents of different types by varying the type composition of the system, and (ii) presents an asymptotically optimal policy to avoid such discriminatory outcomes.</p>

<p>Abstract: Consistent and holistic expression of software requirements is important for the success of software projects. In this study, we aim to enhance the efficiency of the software development processes by automatically identifying conflicting and duplicate software requirement specifications. We formulate the conflict and duplicate detection problem as a requirement pair classification task. We design a novel transformers-based architecture, SR-BERT, which incorporates Sentence-BERT and Bi-encoders for the conflict and duplicate identification task. Furthermore, we apply supervised multi-stage fine-tuning to the pre-trained transformer models. We test the performance of different transfer models using four different datasets. We find that sequentially trained and fine-tuned transformer models perform well across the datasets with SR-BERT achieving the best performance for larger datasets. We also explore the cross-domain performance of conflict detection models and adopt a rule-based filtering approach to validate the model classifications. Our analysis indicates that the sentence pair classification approach and the proposed transformer-based natural language processing strategies can contribute significantly to achieving automation in conflict and duplicate detection</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool for solving a wide range of problems, including medical decision-making. The exponential growth of medical data over the past two decades has surpassed the capacity for manual analysis, prompting increased interest in automated data analysis and processing. ML algorithms, capable of learning from data with minimal human intervention, are particularly well-suited for medical data analysis and interpretation. One significant advantage of ML is the reduced cost of collecting labeled training data necessary for supervised learning. While numerous studies have explored the applications of ML in medicine, this survey specifically focuses on the use of ML across various medical research fields. We provide a comprehensive technical overview of existing studies on ML applications in medicine, highlighting the strengths and limitations of these approaches. Additionally, we discuss potential research directions for future exploration. These include the development of more sophisticated reward functions, as the accuracy of the reward function is crucial for ML performance, the integration of ML with other techniques, and the application of ML to new and emerging areas in genomics research. Finally, we summarize our findings and present the current state of the field and the future outlook for ML in medical application.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tao Ma, Jin Zhu, Hengrui Cai, Zhengling Qi, Yunxiao Chen, Chengchun Shi, Eric B. Laber</p>
<p>Abstract: In real-world applications of reinforcement learning, it is often challenging to obtain a state representation that is parsimonious and satisfies the Markov property without prior knowledge. Consequently, it is common practice to construct a state larger than necessary, e.g., by concatenating measurements over contiguous time points. However, needlessly increasing the dimension of the state may slow learning and obfuscate the learned policy. We introduce the notion of a minimal sufficient state in a Markov decision process (MDP) as the subvector of the original state under which the process remains an MDP and shares the same reward function as the original process. We propose a novel SEquEntial Knockoffs (SEEK) algorithm that estimates the minimal sufficient state in a system with high-dimensional complex nonlinear dynamics. In large samples, the proposed method achieves selection consistency. As the method is agnostic to the reinforcement learning algorithm being applied, it benefits downstream tasks such as policy learning. Empirical experiments verify theoretical results and show the proposed approach outperforms several competing methods regarding variable selection accuracy and regret.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in large-scale vision-language models have achieved impressive performance in various zero-shot image classification tasks. While prior studies have demonstrated significant improvements by introducing few-shot labelled target samples, they still require labelling of target samples, which greatly degrades their scalability and generalizability while handling various visual recognition tasks. We design NtUA, a Noise-tolerant Unsupervised Adapter that allows the learning of effective target models with few unlabelled target samples. NtUA works as a key-value cache that formulates visual features and predicted pseudo-labels of the few unlabelled target samples as key-value pairs. It consists of two complementary designs. The first is adaptive cache formation that combats pseudo-label noises by weighting the key-value pairs according to their prediction confidence. The second is knowledge-guided cache refinement, which refines pair values (i.e., pseudo-labels) and cache weights by leveraging knowledge distillation from large-scale vision language models. Extensive experiments show that NtUA achieves superior performance consistently across multiple widely adopted benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanming Kang, Giang Tran, Hans De Sterck</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer-based models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many areas. However, the quadratic complexity of self-attention with respect to the input length hinders the applicability of Transformer-based models to long sequences. To address this, we present Fast Multipole Attention, a new attention mechanism that uses a divide-and-conquer strategy to reduce the time and memory complexity of attention for sequences of length $n$ from $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$ or $O(n)$, while retaining a global receptive field. The hierarchical approach groups queries, keys, and values into $\mathcal{O}( \log n)$ levels of resolution, where groups at greater distances are increasingly larger in size and the weights to compute group quantities are learned. As such, the interaction between tokens far from each other is considered in lower resolution in an efficient hierarchical manner. The overall complexity of Fast Multipole Attention is $\mathcal{O}(n)$ or $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$, depending on whether the queries are down-sampled or not. This multi-level divide-and-conquer strategy is inspired by fast summation methods from $n$-body physics and the Fast Multipole Method. We perform evaluation on autoregressive and bidirectional language modeling tasks and compare our Fast Multipole Attention model with other efficient attention variants on medium-size datasets. We find empirically that the Fast Multipole Transformer performs much better than other efficient transformers in terms of memory size and accuracy. The Fast Multipole Attention mechanism has the potential to empower large language models with much greater sequence lengths, taking the full context into account in an efficient, naturally hierarchical manner during training and when generating long sequences.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xueqing Liu, Nina Deliu, Tanujit Chakraborty, Lauren Bell, Bibhas Chakraborty</p>
<p>Abstract: Mobile health (mHealth) interventions often aim to improve distal outcomes, such as clinical conditions, by optimizing proximal outcomes through just-in-time adaptive interventions. Contextual bandits provide a suitable framework for customizing such interventions according to individual time-varying contexts. However, unique challenges, such as modeling count outcomes within bandit frameworks, have hindered the widespread application of contextual bandits to mHealth studies. The current work addresses this challenge by leveraging count data models into online decision-making approaches. Specifically, we combine four common offline count data models (Poisson, negative binomial, zero-inflated Poisson, and zero-inflated negative binomial regressions) with Thompson sampling, a popular contextual bandit algorithm. The proposed algorithms are motivated by and evaluated on a real dataset from the Drink Less trial, where they are shown to improve user engagement with the mHealth platform. The proposed methods are further evaluated on simulated data, achieving improvement in maximizing cumulative proximal outcomes over existing algorithms. Theoretical results on regret bounds are also derived. The countts R package provides an implementation of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengshu Li, Jacky Liang, Andy Zeng, Xinyun Chen, Karol Hausman, Dorsa Sadigh, Sergey Levine, Li Fei-Fei, Fei Xia, Brian Ichter</p>
<p>Abstract: Code provides a general syntactic structure to build complex programs and perform precise computations when paired with a code interpreter - we hypothesize that language models (LMs) can leverage code-writing to improve Chain of Thought reasoning not only for logic and arithmetic tasks, but also for semantic ones (and in particular, those that are a mix of both). For example, consider prompting an LM to write code that counts the number of times it detects sarcasm in an essay: the LM may struggle to write an implementation for "detect_sarcasm(string)" that can be executed by the interpreter (handling the edge cases would be insurmountable). However, LMs may still produce a valid solution if they not only write code, but also selectively "emulate" the interpreter by generating the expected output of "detect_sarcasm(string)". In this work, we propose Chain of Code (CoC), a simple yet surprisingly effective extension that improves LM code-driven reasoning. The key idea is to encourage LMs to format semantic sub-tasks in a program as flexible pseudocode that the interpreter can explicitly catch undefined behaviors and hand off to simulate with an LM (as an "LMulator"). Experiments demonstrate that Chain of Code outperforms Chain of Thought and other baselines across a variety of benchmarks; on BIG-Bench Hard, Chain of Code achieves 84%, a gain of 12% over Chain of Thought. In a nutshell, CoC broadens the scope of reasoning questions that LMs can answer by "thinking in code".</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce Dream2Real, a robotics framework which integrates vision-language models (VLMs) trained on 2D data into a 3D object rearrangement pipeline. This is achieved by the robot autonomously constructing a 3D representation of the scene, where objects can be rearranged virtually and an image of the resulting arrangement rendered. These renders are evaluated by a VLM, so that the arrangement which best satisfies the user instruction is selected and recreated in the real world with pick-and-place. This enables language-conditioned rearrangement to be performed zero-shot, without needing to collect a training dataset of example arrangements. Results on a series of real-world tasks show that this framework is robust to distractors, controllable by language, capable of understanding complex multi-object relations, and readily applicable to both tabletop and 6-DoF rearrangement tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Prithvijit Chattopadhyay, Bharat Goyal, Boglarka Ecsedi, Viraj Prabhu, Judy Hoffman</p>
<p>Abstract: Synthetic data (SIM) drawn from simulators have emerged as a popular alternative for training models where acquiring annotated real-world images is difficult. However, transferring models trained on synthetic images to real-world applications can be challenging due to appearance disparities. A commonly employed solution to counter this SIM2REAL gap is unsupervised domain adaptation, where models are trained using labeled SIM data and unlabeled REAL data. Mispredictions made by such SIM2REAL adapted models are often associated with miscalibration - stemming from overconfident predictions on real data. In this paper, we introduce AUGCAL, a simple training-time patch for unsupervised adaptation that improves SIM2REAL adapted models by - (1) reducing overall miscalibration, (2) reducing overconfidence in incorrect predictions and (3) improving confidence score reliability by better guiding misclassification detection - all while retaining or improving SIM2REAL performance. Given a base SIM2REAL adaptation algorithm, at training time, AUGCAL involves replacing vanilla SIM images with strongly augmented views (AUG intervention) and additionally optimizing for a training time calibration loss on augmented SIM predictions (CAL intervention). We motivate AUGCAL using a brief analytical justification of how to reduce miscalibration on unlabeled REAL data. Through our experiments, we empirically show the efficacy of AUGCAL across multiple adaptation methods, backbones, tasks and shifts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingying He, Xiaobing Pei</p>
<p>Abstract: Log anomaly detection is a critical component in modern software system security and maintenance, serving as a crucial support and basis for system monitoring, operation, and troubleshooting. It aids operations personnel in timely identification and resolution of issues. However, current methods in log anomaly detection still face challenges such as underutilization of unlabeled data, imbalance between normal and anomaly class data, and high rates of false positives and false negatives, leading to insufficient effectiveness in anomaly recognition. In this study, we propose a semi-supervised log anomaly detection method named DQNLog, which integrates deep reinforcement learning to enhance anomaly detection performance by leveraging a small amount of labeled data and large-scale unlabeled data. To address issues of imbalanced data and insufficient labeling, we design a state transition function biased towards anomalies based on cosine similarity, aiming to capture semantic-similar anomalies rather than favoring the majority class. To enhance the model's capability in learning anomalies, we devise a joint reward function that encourages the model to utilize labeled anomalies and explore unlabeled anomalies, thereby reducing false positives and false negatives. Additionally, to prevent the model from deviating from normal trajectories due to misestimation, we introduce a regularization term in the loss function to ensure the model retains prior knowledge during updates. We evaluate DQNLog on three widely used datasets, demonstrating its ability to effectively utilize large-scale unlabeled data and achieve promising results across all experimental datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nan Yin, Mengzhu Wang, Zhenghan Chen, Giulia De Masi, Bin Gu, Huan Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: The integration of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is gradually attracting attention due to the low power consumption and high efficiency in processing the non-Euclidean data represented by graphs. However, as a common problem, dynamic graph representation learning faces challenges such as high complexity and large memory overheads. Current work often uses SNNs instead of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) by using binary features instead of continuous ones for efficient training, which would overlooks graph structure information and leads to the loss of details during propagation. Additionally, optimizing dynamic spiking models typically requires propagation of information across time steps, which increases memory requirements. To address these challenges, we present a framework named \underline{Dy}namic \underline{S}p\underline{i}king \underline{G}raph \underline{N}eural Networks (\method{}). To mitigate the information loss problem, \method{} propagates early-layer information directly to the last layer for information compensation. To accommodate the memory requirements, we apply the implicit differentiation on the equilibrium state, which does not rely on the exact reverse of the forward computation. While traditional implicit differentiation methods are usually used for static situations, \method{} extends it to the dynamic graph setting. Extensive experiments on three large-scale real-world dynamic graph datasets validate the effectiveness of \method{} on dynamic node classification tasks with lower computational costs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rahul Yedida, Tim Menzies</p>
<p>Abstract: Yes. SE data can have "smoother" boundaries between classes (compared to traditional AI data sets). To be more precise, the magnitude of the second derivative of the loss function found in SE data is typically much smaller. A new hyper-parameter optimizer, called SMOOTHIE, can exploit this idiosyncrasy of SE data. We compare SMOOTHIE and a state-of-the-art AI hyper-parameter optimizer on three tasks: (a) GitHub issue lifetime prediction (b) detecting static code warnings false alarm; (c) defect prediction. For completeness, we also show experiments on some standard AI datasets. SMOOTHIE runs faster and predicts better on the SE data--but ties on non-SE data with the AI tool. Hence we conclude that SE data can be different to other kinds of data; and those differences mean that we should use different kinds of algorithms for our data.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pritha Gupta, Marcel Wever, Eyke H\"ullermeier</p>
<p>Abstract: In today's data-driven world, the proliferation of publicly available information raises security concerns due to the information leakage (IL) problem. IL involves unintentionally exposing sensitive information to unauthorized parties via observable system information. Conventional statistical approaches rely on estimating mutual information (MI) between observable and secret information for detecting ILs, face challenges of the curse of dimensionality, convergence, computational complexity, and MI misestimation. Though effective, emerging supervised machine learning based approaches to detect ILs are limited to binary system sensitive information and lack a comprehensive framework. To address these limitations, we establish a theoretical framework using statistical learning theory and information theory to quantify and detect IL accurately. Using automated machine learning, we demonstrate that MI can be accurately estimated by approximating the typically unknown Bayes predictor's log-loss and accuracy. Based on this, we show how MI can effectively be estimated to detect ILs. Our method performs superior to state-of-the-art baselines in an empirical study considering synthetic and real-world OpenSSL TLS server datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Carmen Martin-Turrero, Maxence Bouvier, Manuel Breitenstein, Pietro Zanuttigh, Vincent Parret</p>
<p>Abstract: We seek to enable classic processing of continuous ultra-sparse spatiotemporal data generated by event-based sensors with dense machine learning models. We propose a novel hybrid pipeline composed of asynchronous sensing and synchronous processing that combines several ideas: (1) an embedding based on PointNet models -- the ALERT module -- that can continuously integrate new and dismiss old events thanks to a leakage mechanism, (2) a flexible readout of the embedded data that allows to feed any downstream model with always up-to-date features at any sampling rate, (3) exploiting the input sparsity in a patch-based approach inspired by Vision Transformer to optimize the efficiency of the method. These embeddings are then processed by a transformer model trained for object and gesture recognition. Using this approach, we achieve performances at the state-of-the-art with a lower latency than competitors. We also demonstrate that our asynchronous model can operate at any desired sampling rate.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Orazio Pontorno (University of Catania), Luca Guarnera (University of Catania), Sebastiano Battiato (University of Catania)</p>
<p>Abstract: Deepfakes represent one of the toughest challenges in the world of Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics, especially considering the high-quality results obtained with recent generative AI-based solutions. Almost all generative models leave unique traces in synthetic data that, if analyzed and identified in detail, can be exploited to improve the generalization limitations of existing deepfake detectors. In this paper we analyzed deepfake images in the frequency domain generated by both GAN and Diffusion Model engines, examining in detail the underlying statistical distribution of Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients. Recognizing that not all coefficients contribute equally to image detection, we hypothesize the existence of a unique ``discriminative fingerprint", embedded in specific combinations of coefficients. To identify them, Machine Learning classifiers were trained on various combinations of coefficients. In addition, the Explainable AI (XAI) LIME algorithm was used to search for intrinsic discriminative combinations of coefficients. Finally, we performed a robustness test to analyze the persistence of traces by applying JPEG compression. The experimental results reveal the existence of traces left by the generative models that are more discriminative and persistent at JPEG attacks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bingqing Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials are revolutionizing large-scale, accurate atomistic modelling in material science and chemistry. Many potentials use atomic cluster expansion or equivariant message passing frameworks. Such frameworks typically use spherical harmonics as angular basis functions, and then use Clebsch-Gordan contraction to maintain rotational symmetry, which may introduce redundancies in representations and computational overhead. We propose an alternative: a Cartesian-coordinates-based atomic density expansion. This approach provides a complete set of polynormially indepedent features of atomic environments while maintaining interaction body orders. Additionally, we integrate low-dimensional embeddings of various chemical elements and inter-atomic message passing. The resulting potential, named Cartesian Atomic Cluster Expansion (CACE), exhibits good accuracy, stability, and generalizability. We validate its performance in diverse systems, including bulk water, small molecules, and 25-element high-entropy alloys.</p>

<p>Abstract: The study of cooperation within social dilemmas has long been a fundamental topic across various disciplines, including computer science and social science. Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have significantly reshaped this field, offering fresh insights into understanding and enhancing cooperation. This survey examines three key areas at the intersection of AI and cooperation in social dilemmas. First, focusing on multi-agent cooperation, we review the intrinsic and external motivations that support cooperation among rational agents, and the methods employed to develop effective strategies against diverse opponents. Second, looking into human-agent cooperation, we discuss the current AI algorithms for cooperating with humans and the human biases towards AI agents. Third, we review the emergent field of leveraging AI agents to enhance cooperation among humans. We conclude by discussing future research avenues, such as using large language models, establishing unified theoretical frameworks, revisiting existing theories of human cooperation, and exploring multiple real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Nickelsen, Gernot M\"uller</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a first study of Bayesian forecasting of electricity prices traded on the German continuous intraday market which fully incorporates parameter uncertainty. A particularly large set of endogenous and exogenous covariables is used, handled through feature selection with Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) and regularising priors. Our target variable is the IDFull price index, forecasts are given in terms of posterior predictive distributions. For validation we use the exceedingly volatile electricity prices of 2022, which have hardly been the subject of forecasting studies before. As a benchmark model, we use all available intraday transactions at the time of forecast creation to compute a current value for the IDFull. According to the weak-form efficiency hypothesis, it would not be possible to significantly improve this benchmark built from last price information. We do, however, observe statistically significant improvement in terms of both point measures and probability scores. Finally, we challenge the declared gold standard of using LASSO for feature selection in electricity price forecasting by presenting strong statistical evidence that OMP leads to better forecasting performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander Timans, Christoph-Nikolas Straehle, Kaspar Sakmann, Eric Nalisnick</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantifying a model's predictive uncertainty is essential for safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving. We consider quantifying such uncertainty for multi-object detection. In particular, we leverage conformal prediction to obtain uncertainty intervals with guaranteed coverage for object bounding boxes. One challenge in doing so is that bounding box predictions are conditioned on the object's class label. Thus, we develop a novel two-step conformal approach that propagates uncertainty in predicted class labels into the uncertainty intervals of bounding boxes. This broadens the validity of our conformal coverage guarantees to include incorrectly classified objects, thus offering more actionable safety assurances. Moreover, we investigate novel ensemble and quantile regression formulations to ensure the bounding box intervals are adaptive to object size, leading to a more balanced coverage. Validating our two-step approach on real-world datasets for 2D bounding box localization, we find that desired coverage levels are satisfied with practically tight predictive uncertainty intervals.</p>

<p>Abstract: Solving parametric Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) for a broad range of parameters is a critical challenge in scientific computing. To this end, neural operators, which \textcolor{black}{predicts the PDE solution with variable PDE parameter inputs}, have been successfully used. However, the training of neural operators typically demands large training datasets, the acquisition of which can be prohibitively expensive. To address this challenge, physics-informed training can offer a cost-effective strategy. However, current physics-informed neural operators face limitations, either in handling irregular domain shapes or in in generalizing to various discrete representations of PDE parameters. In this research, we introduce a novel physics-informed model architecture which can generalize to various discrete representations of PDE parameters and irregular domain shapes. Particularly, inspired by deep operator neural networks, our model involves a discretization-independent learning of parameter embedding repeatedly, and this parameter embedding is integrated with the response embeddings through multiple compositional layers, for more expressivity. Numerical results demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Uday Mallappa, Hesham Mostafa, Mikhail Galkin, Mariano Phielipp, Somdeb Majumdar</p>
<p>Abstract: Floorplanning for systems-on-a-chip (SoCs) and its sub-systems is a crucial and non-trivial step of the physical design flow. It represents a difficult combinatorial optimization problem. A typical large scale SoC with 120 partitions generates a search-space of nearly 10E250. As novel machine learning (ML) approaches emerge to tackle such problems, there is a growing need for a modern benchmark that comprises a large training dataset and performance metrics that better reflect real-world constraints and objectives compared to existing benchmarks. To address this need, we present FloorSet -- two comprehensive datasets of synthetic fixed-outline floorplan layouts that reflect the distribution of real SoCs. Each dataset has 1M training samples and 100 test samples where each sample is a synthetic floor-plan. FloorSet-Prime comprises fully-abutted rectilinear partitions and near-optimal wire-length. A simplified dataset that reflects early design phases, FloorSet-Lite comprises rectangular partitions, with under 5 percent white-space and near-optimal wire-length. Both datasets define hard constraints seen in modern design flows such as shape constraints, edge-affinity, grouping constraints, and pre-placement constraints. FloorSet is intended to spur fundamental research on large-scale constrained optimization problems. Crucially, FloorSet alleviates the core issue of reproducibility in modern ML driven solutions to such problems. FloorSet is available as an open-source repository for the research community.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuanpu Cao, Tianrong Zhang, Bochuan Cao, Ziyi Yin, Lu Lin, Fenglong Ma, Jinghui Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Researchers have been studying approaches to steer the behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs) and build personalized LLMs tailored for various applications. While fine-tuning seems to be a direct solution, it requires substantial computational resources and may significantly affect the utility of the original LLM. Recent endeavors have introduced more lightweight strategies, focusing on extracting "steering vectors" to guide the model's output toward desired behaviors by adjusting activations within specific layers of the LLM's transformer architecture. However, such steering vectors are directly extracted from the activations of human preference data and thus often lead to suboptimal results and occasional failures, especially in alignment-related scenarios. This work proposes an innovative approach that could produce more effective steering vectors through bi-directional preference optimization. Our method is designed to allow steering vectors to directly influence the generation probability of contrastive human preference data pairs, thereby offering a more precise representation of the target behavior. By carefully adjusting the direction and magnitude of the steering vector, we enabled personalized control over the desired behavior across a spectrum of intensities. Extensive experimentation across various open-ended generation tasks, particularly focusing on steering AI personas, has validated the efficacy of our approach. Moreover, we comprehensively investigate critical alignment-concerning scenarios, such as managing truthfulness, mitigating hallucination, and addressing jailbreaking attacks. Remarkably, our method can still demonstrate outstanding steering effectiveness across these scenarios. Furthermore, we showcase the transferability of our steering vectors across different models/LoRAs and highlight the synergistic benefits of applying multiple vectors simultaneously.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ryan Liu, Jiayi Geng, Joshua C. Peterson, Ilia Sucholutsky, Thomas L. Griffiths</p>
<p>Abstract: In order for AI systems to communicate effectively with people, they must understand how we make decisions. However, people's decisions are not always rational, so the implicit internal models of human decision-making in Large Language Models (LLMs) must account for this. Previous empirical evidence seems to suggest that these implicit models are accurate -- LLMs offer believable proxies of human behavior, acting how we expect humans would in everyday interactions. However, by comparing LLM behavior and predictions to a large dataset of human decisions, we find that this is actually not the case: when both simulating and predicting people's choices, a suite of cutting-edge LLMs (GPT-4o & 4-Turbo, Llama-3-8B & 70B, Claude 3 Opus) assume that people are more rational than we really are. Specifically, these models deviate from human behavior and align more closely with a classic model of rational choice -- expected value theory. Interestingly, people also tend to assume that other people are rational when interpreting their behavior. As a consequence, when we compare the inferences that LLMs and people draw from the decisions of others using another psychological dataset, we find that these inferences are highly correlated. Thus, the implicit decision-making models of LLMs appear to be aligned with the human expectation that other people will act rationally, rather than with how people actually act.</p>

<p>Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a promising technique for 3D reconstruction, offering efficient training and rendering speeds, making it suitable for real-time applications.However, current methods require highly controlled environments (no moving people or wind-blown elements, and consistent lighting) to meet the inter-view consistency assumption of 3DGS. This makes reconstruction of real-world captures problematic. We present SpotLessSplats, an approach that leverages pre-trained and general-purpose features coupled with robust optimization to effectively ignore transient distractors. Our method achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality both visually and quantitatively, on casual captures. Additional results available at: https://spotlesssplats.github.io</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate remarkable zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks, but fall short of the performance of supervised methods in generalizing to downstream tasks with limited data. Prompt learning is emerging as a parameter-efficient method for adapting VLMs, but state-of-the-art approaches require annotated samples. In this paper we propose a novel approach to prompt learning based on unsupervised knowledge distillation from more powerful models. Our approach, which we call Knowledge Distillation Prompt Learning (KDPL), can be integrated into existing prompt learning techniques and eliminates the need for labeled examples during adaptation. Our experiments on more than ten standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that KDPL is very effective at improving generalization of learned prompts for zero-shot domain generalization, zero-shot cross-dataset generalization, and zero-shot base-to-novel class generalization problems. KDPL requires no ground-truth labels for adaptation, and moreover we show that even in the absence of any knowledge of training class names it can be used to effectively transfer knowledge.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sara Hooker</p>
<p>Abstract: At face value, this essay is about understanding a fairly esoteric governance tool called compute thresholds. However, in order to grapple with whether these thresholds will achieve anything, we must first understand how they came to be. To do so, we need to engage with a decades-old debate at the heart of computer science progress, namely, is bigger always better? Does a certain inflection point of compute result in changes to the risk profile of a model? Hence, this essay may be of interest not only to policymakers and the wider public but also to computer scientists interested in understanding the role of compute in unlocking breakthroughs. This discussion is timely given the wide adoption of compute thresholds in both the White House Executive Orders on AI Safety (EO) and the EU AI Act to identify more risky systems. A key conclusion of this essay is that compute thresholds, as currently implemented, are shortsighted and likely to fail to mitigate risk. The relationship between compute and risk is highly uncertain and rapidly changing. Relying upon compute thresholds overestimates our ability to predict what abilities emerge at different scales. This essay ends with recommendations for a better way forward.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hayden McAlister, Anthony Robins, Lech Szymanski</p>
<p>Abstract: The modern Hopfield network generalizes the classical Hopfield network by allowing for sharper interaction functions. This increases the capacity of the network as an autoassociative memory as nearby learned attractors will not interfere with one another. However, the implementation of the network relies on applying large exponents to the dot product of memory vectors and probe vectors. If the dimension of the data is large the calculation can be very large and result in problems when using floating point numbers in a practical implementation. We describe this problem in detail, modify the original network description to mitigate the problem, and show the modification will not alter the networks' dynamics during update or training. We also show our modification greatly improves hyperparameter selection for the modern Hopfield network, removing hyperparameter dependence on the interaction vertex and resulting in an optimal region of hyperparameters that does not significantly change with the interaction vertex as it does in the original network.</p>

While computer vision models are often evaluated for accuracy on available benchmarks, more annotated data is necessary to learn about their robustness and fairness against semantic distributional shifts in input data, especially in face data. Among annotated data, counterfactual examples grant strong explainability characteristics. Because collecting natural face data is prohibitively expensive, we put forth a generative AI-based framework to construct targeted, counterfactual, high-quality synthetic face data. Our synthetic data pipeline has many use cases, including face recognition systems sensitivity evaluations and image understanding system probes. The pipeline is validated with multiple user studies. We showcase the efficacy of our face generation pipeline on a leading commercial vision model. We identify facial attributes that cause vision systems to fail.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eugenio Lomurno, Matteo Matteucci</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence has transformed the generation of synthetic data, providing innovative solutions to challenges like data scarcity and privacy, which are particularly critical in fields such as medicine. However, the effective use of this synthetic data to train high-performance models remains a significant challenge. This paper addresses this issue by introducing Knowledge Recycling (KR), a pipeline designed to optimise the generation and use of synthetic data for training downstream classifiers. At the heart of this pipeline is Generative Knowledge Distillation (GKD), the proposed technique that significantly improves the quality and usefulness of the information provided to classifiers through a synthetic dataset regeneration and soft labelling mechanism. The KR pipeline has been tested on a variety of datasets, with a focus on six highly heterogeneous medical image datasets, ranging from retinal images to organ scans. The results show a significant reduction in the performance gap between models trained on real and synthetic data, with models based on synthetic data outperforming those trained on real data in some cases. Furthermore, the resulting models show almost complete immunity to Membership Inference Attacks, manifesting privacy properties missing in models trained with conventional techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Neil Ashton, Jordan B. Angel, Aditya S. Ghate, Gaetan K. W. Kenway, Man Long Wong, Cetin Kiris, Astrid Walle, Danielle C. Maddix, Gary Page</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a new open-source high-fidelity dataset for Machine Learning (ML) containing 355 geometric variants of the Windsor body, to help the development and testing of ML surrogate models for external automotive aerodynamics. Each Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation was run with a GPU-native high-fidelity Wall-Modeled Large-Eddy Simulations (WMLES) using a Cartesian immersed-boundary method using more than 280M cells to ensure the greatest possible accuracy. The dataset contains geometry variants that exhibits a wide range of flow characteristics that are representative of those observed on road-cars. The dataset itself contains the 3D time-averaged volume & boundary data as well as the geometry and force & moment coefficients. This paper discusses the validation of the underlying CFD methods as well as contents and structure of the dataset. To the authors knowledge, this represents the first, large-scale high-fidelity CFD dataset for the Windsor body with a permissive open-source license (CC-BY-SA).</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19707">Neural networks for bifurcation and linear stability analysis of steady states in partial differential equations</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Luthfi Shahab, Hadi Susanto</p>
<p>Abstract: This research introduces an extended application of neural networks for solving nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). A neural network, combined with a pseudo-arclength continuation, is proposed to construct bifurcation diagrams from parameterized nonlinear PDEs. Additionally, a neural network approach is also presented for solving eigenvalue problems to analyze solution linear stability, focusing on identifying the largest eigenvalue. The effectiveness of the proposed neural network is examined through experiments on the Bratu equation and the Burgers equation. Results from a finite difference method are also presented as comparison. Varying numbers of grid points are employed in each case to assess the behavior and accuracy of both the neural network and the finite difference method. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed neural network produces better solutions, generates more accurate bifurcation diagrams, has reasonable computational times, and proves effective for linear stability analysis.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19985">Mixture of Nested Experts: Adaptive Processing of Visual Tokens</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Gagan Jain, Nidhi Hegde, Aditya Kusupati, Arsha Nagrani, Shyamal Buch, Prateek Jain, Anurag Arnab, Sujoy Paul</p>
<p>Abstract: The visual medium (images and videos) naturally contains a large amount of information redundancy, thereby providing a great opportunity for leveraging efficiency in processing. While Vision Transformer (ViT) based models scale effectively to large data regimes, they fail to capitalize on this inherent redundancy, leading to higher computational costs. Mixture of Experts (MoE) networks demonstrate scalability while maintaining same inference-time costs, but they come with a larger parameter footprint. We present Mixture of Nested Experts (MoNE), which utilizes a nested structure for experts, wherein individual experts fall on an increasing compute-accuracy curve. Given a compute budget, MoNE learns to dynamically choose tokens in a priority order, and thus redundant tokens are processed through cheaper nested experts. Using this framework, we achieve equivalent performance as the baseline models, while reducing inference time compute by over two-fold. We validate our approach on standard image and video datasets - ImageNet-21K, Kinetics400, and Something-Something-v2. We further highlight MoNE$'$s adaptability by showcasing its ability to maintain strong performance across different inference-time compute budgets on videos, using only a single trained model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dennis Vetter, Muhammad Ahsan, Diana Delicado, Thomas A. Neubauer, Thomas Wilke, Gemma Roig</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present our first proposal of a machine learning system for the classification of freshwater snails of the genus Radomaniola. We elaborate on the specific challenges encountered during system design, and how we tackled them; namely a small, very imbalanced dataset with a high number of classes and high visual similarity between classes. We then show how we employed triplet networks and the multiple input modalities of images, measurements, and genetic information to overcome these challenges and reach a performance comparable to that of a trained domain expert.</p>
