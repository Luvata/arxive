<p><b>Authors:</b> Min Hun Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using a transformer-based, spatiotemporal attention network (STAN) for gradient-based time-series explanations. First, we trained the STAN model for video classifications using the global and local views of data and weakly supervised labels on time-series data (i.e. the type of an activity). We then leveraged a gradient-based XAI technique (e.g. saliency map) to identify salient frames of time-series data. According to the experiments using the datasets of four medically relevant activities, the STAN model demonstrated its potential to identify important frames of videos.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maximilian Mueller, Matthias Hein</p>
<p>Abstract: VisionTransformers have been shown to be powerful out-of-distribution detectors for ImageNet-scale settings when finetuned from publicly available checkpoints, often outperforming other model types on popular benchmarks. In this work, we investigate the impact of both the pretraining and finetuning scheme on the performance of ViTs on this task by analyzing a large pool of models. We find that the exact type of pretraining has a strong impact on which method works well and on OOD detection performance in general. We further show that certain training schemes might only be effective for a specific type of out-distribution, but not in general, and identify a best-practice training recipe.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas Winterbottom, G. Thomas Hudson, Daniel Kluvanec, Dean Slack, Jamie Sterling, Junjie Shentu, Chenghao Xiao, Zheming Zhou, Noura Al Moubayed</p>
<p>Abstract: Next-frame prediction is a useful and powerful method for modelling and understanding the dynamics of video data. Inspired by the empirical success of causal language modelling and next-token prediction in language modelling, we explore the extent to which next-frame prediction serves as a strong foundational learning strategy (analogous to language modelling) for inducing an understanding of the visual world. In order to quantify the specific visual understanding induced by next-frame prediction, we introduce six diagnostic simulation video datasets derived from fundamental physical laws created by varying physical constants such as gravity and mass. We demonstrate that our models trained only on next-frame prediction are capable of predicting the value of these physical constants (e.g. gravity) without having been trained directly to learn these constants via a regression task. We find that the generative training phase alone induces a model state that can predict physical constants significantly better than that of a random model, improving the loss by a factor of between 1.28 to 6.24. We conclude that next-frame prediction shows great promise as a general learning strategy to induce understanding of the many `laws' that govern the visual domain without the need for explicit labelling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adib Hasan, Mardavij Roozbehani, Munther Dahleh</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces WeatherFormer, a transformer encoder-based model designed to learn robust weather features from minimal observations. It addresses the challenge of modeling complex weather dynamics from small datasets, a bottleneck for many prediction tasks in agriculture, epidemiology, and climate science. WeatherFormer was pretrained on a large pretraining dataset comprised of 39 years of satellite measurements across the Americas. With a novel pretraining task and fine-tuning, WeatherFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance in county-level soybean yield prediction and influenza forecasting. Technical innovations include a unique spatiotemporal encoding that captures geographical, annual, and seasonal variations, adapting the transformer architecture to continuous weather data, and a pretraining strategy to learn representations that are robust to missing weather features. This paper for the first time demonstrates the effectiveness of pretraining large transformer encoder models for weather-dependent applications across multiple domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ling-Qi Zhang, Zahra Kadkhodaie, Eero P. Simoncelli, David H. Brainard</p>
<p>Abstract: We re-examine the problem of reconstructing a high-dimensional signal from a small set of linear measurements, in combination with image prior from a diffusion probabilistic model. Well-established methods for optimizing such measurements include principal component analysis (PCA), independent component analysis (ICA) and compressed sensing (CS), all of which rely on axis- or subspace-aligned statistical characterization. But many naturally occurring signals, including photographic images, contain richer statistical structure. To exploit such structure, we introduce a general method for obtaining an optimized set of linear measurements, assuming a Bayesian inverse solution that leverages the prior implicit in a neural network trained to perform denoising. We demonstrate that these measurements are distinct from those of PCA and CS, with significant improvements in minimizing squared reconstruction error. In addition, we show that optimizing the measurements for the SSIM perceptual loss leads to perceptually improved reconstruction. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating the specific statistical regularities of natural signals when designing effective linear measurements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Naibo Wang, Yuchen Deng, Wenjie Feng, Jianwei Yin, See-Kiong Ng</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Class Incremental Learning (FCIL) is a critical yet largely underexplored issue that deals with the dynamic incorporation of new classes within federated learning (FL). Existing methods often employ generative adversarial networks (GANs) to produce synthetic images to address privacy concerns in FL. However, GANs exhibit inherent instability and high sensitivity, compromising the effectiveness of these methods. In this paper, we introduce a novel data-free federated class incremental learning framework with diffusion-based generative memory (DFedDGM) to mitigate catastrophic forgetting by generating stable, high-quality images through diffusion models. We design a new balanced sampler to help train the diffusion models to alleviate the common non-IID problem in FL, and introduce an entropy-based sample filtering technique from an information theory perspective to enhance the quality of generative samples. Finally, we integrate knowledge distillation with a feature-based regularization term for better knowledge transfer. Our framework does not incur additional communication costs compared to the baseline FedAvg method. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines, e.g., over a 4% improvement in average accuracy on the Tiny-ImageNet dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Olena Burda-Lassen, Aman Chadha, Shashank Goswami, Vinija Jain</p>
<p>Abstract: An image is often said to be worth a thousand words, and certain images can tell rich and insightful stories. Can these stories be told via image captioning? Images from folklore genres, such as mythology, folk dance, cultural signs, and symbols, are vital to every culture. Our research compares the performance of four popular vision-language models (GPT-4V, Gemini Pro Vision, LLaVA, and OpenFlamingo) in identifying culturally specific information in such images and creating accurate and culturally sensitive image captions. We also propose a new evaluation metric, Cultural Awareness Score (CAS), dedicated to measuring the degree of cultural awareness in image captions. We provide a dataset MOSAIC-1.5k, labeled with ground truth for images containing cultural background and context, as well as a labeled dataset with assigned Cultural Awareness Scores that can be used with unseen data. Creating culturally appropriate image captions is valuable for scientific research and can be beneficial for many practical applications. We envision that our work will promote a deeper integration of cultural sensitivity in AI applications worldwide. By making the dataset and Cultural Awareness Score available to the public, we aim to facilitate further research in this area, encouraging the development of more culturally aware AI systems that respect and celebrate global diversity.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17523">Locally Testing Model Detections for Semantic Global Concepts</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Franz Motzkus, Christian Hellert, Ute Schmid</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring the quality of black-box Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has become ever more significant, especially in safety-critical domains such as automated driving. While global concept encodings generally enable a user to test a model for a specific concept, linking global concept encodings to the local processing of single network inputs reveals their strengths and limitations. Our proposed framework global-to-local Concept Attribution (glCA) uses approaches from local (why a specific prediction originates) and global (how a model works generally) eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (xAI) to test DNNs for a predefined semantical concept locally. The approach allows for conditioning local, post-hoc explanations on predefined semantic concepts encoded as linear directions in the model's latent space. Pixel-exact scoring concerning the global concept usage assists the tester in further understanding the model processing of single data points for the selected concept. Our approach has the advantage of fully covering the model-internal encoding of the semantic concept and allowing the localization of relevant concept-related information. The results show major differences in the local perception and usage of individual global concept encodings and demand for further investigations regarding obtaining thorough semantic concept encodings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fangneng Zhan, Hanxue Liang, Yifan Wang, Michael Niemeyer, Michael Oechsle, Adam Kortylewski, Cengiz Oztireli, Gordon Wetzstein, Christian Theobalt</p>
<p>Abstract: The landscape of computer graphics has undergone significant transformations with the recent advances of differentiable rendering models. These rendering models often rely on heuristic designs that may not fully align with the final rendering objectives. We address this gap by pioneering \textit{evolutive rendering models}, a methodology where rendering models possess the ability to evolve and adapt dynamically throughout the rendering process. In particular, we present a comprehensive learning framework that enables the optimization of three principal rendering elements, including the gauge transformations, the ray sampling mechanisms, and the primitive organization. Central to this framework is the development of differentiable versions of these rendering elements, allowing for effective gradient backpropagation from the final rendering objectives. A detailed analysis of gradient characteristics is performed to facilitate a stable and goal-oriented elements evolution. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the large potential of evolutive rendering models for enhancing the rendering performance across various domains, including static and dynamic scene representations, generative modeling, and texture mapping.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17532">ClassDiffusion: More Aligned Personalization Tuning with Explicit Class Guidance</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiannan Huang, Jun Hao Liew, Hanshu Yan, Yuyang Yin, Yao Zhao, Yunchao Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent text-to-image customization works have been proven successful in generating images of given concepts by fine-tuning the diffusion models on a few examples. However, these methods tend to overfit the concepts, resulting in failure to create the concept under multiple conditions (e.g. headphone is missing when generating a <sks> dog wearing a headphone'). Interestingly, we notice that the base model before fine-tuning exhibits the capability to compose the base concept with other elements (e.g. a dog wearing a headphone) implying that the compositional ability only disappears after personalization tuning. Inspired by this observation, we present ClassDiffusion, a simple technique that leverages a semantic preservation loss to explicitly regulate the concept space when learning the new concept. Despite its simplicity, this helps avoid semantic drift when fine-tuning on the target concepts. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that the use of semantic preservation loss effectively improves the compositional abilities of the fine-tune models. In response to the ineffective evaluation of CLIP-T metrics, we introduce BLIP2-T metric, a more equitable and effective evaluation metric for this particular domain. We also provide in-depth empirical study and theoretical analysis to better understand the role of the proposed loss. Lastly, we also extend our ClassDiffusion to personalized video generation, demonstrating its flexibility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Quan Liu, Brandon T. Swartz, Ivan Kravchenko, Jason G. Valentine, Yuankai Huo</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have heavily relied on traditional computational units like CPUs and GPUs. However, this conventional approach brings significant computational burdens, latency issues, and high power consumption, limiting their effectiveness. This has sparked the need for lightweight networks like ExtremeC3Net. On the other hand, there have been notable advancements in optical computational units, particularly with metamaterials, offering the exciting prospect of energy-efficient neural networks operating at the speed of light. Yet, the digital design of metamaterial neural networks (MNNs) faces challenges such as precision, noise, and bandwidth, limiting their application to intuitive tasks and low-resolution images. In this paper, we propose a large kernel lightweight segmentation model, ExtremeMETA. Based on the ExtremeC3Net, the ExtremeMETA maximizes the ability of the first convolution layer by exploring a larger convolution kernel and multiple processing paths. With the proposed large kernel convolution model, we extend the optic neural network application boundary to the segmentation task. To further lighten the computation burden of the digital processing part, a set of model compression methods is applied to improve model efficiency in the inference stage. The experimental results on three publicly available datasets demonstrate that the optimized efficient design improved segmentation performance from 92.45 to 95.97 on mIoU while reducing computational FLOPs from 461.07 MMacs to 166.03 MMacs. The proposed the large kernel lightweight model ExtremeMETA showcases the hybrid design's ability on complex tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yansong Qu, Shaohui Dai, Xinyang Li, Jianghang Lin, Liujuan Cao, Shengchuan Zhang, Rongrong Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D open-vocabulary scene understanding, crucial for advancing augmented reality and robotic applications, involves interpreting and locating specific regions within a 3D space as directed by natural language instructions. To this end, we introduce GOI, a framework that integrates semantic features from 2D vision-language foundation models into 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and identifies 3D Gaussians of Interest using an Optimizable Semantic-space Hyperplane. Our approach includes an efficient compression method that utilizes scene priors to condense noisy high-dimensional semantic features into compact low-dimensional vectors, which are subsequently embedded in 3DGS. During the open-vocabulary querying process, we adopt a distinct approach compared to existing methods, which depend on a manually set fixed empirical threshold to select regions based on their semantic feature distance to the query text embedding. This traditional approach often lacks universal accuracy, leading to challenges in precisely identifying specific target areas. Instead, our method treats the feature selection process as a hyperplane division within the feature space, retaining only those features that are highly relevant to the query. We leverage off-the-shelf 2D Referring Expression Segmentation (RES) models to fine-tune the semantic-space hyperplane, enabling a more precise distinction between target regions and others. This fine-tuning substantially improves the accuracy of open-vocabulary queries, ensuring the precise localization of pertinent 3D Gaussians. Extensive experiments demonstrate GOI's superiority over previous state-of-the-art methods. Our project page is available at https://goi-hyperplane.github.io/ .</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent research interest in the learning-based processing of garments, from virtual fitting to generation and reconstruction, stumbles on a scarcity of high-quality public data in the domain. We contribute to resolving this need by presenting the first large-scale synthetic dataset of 3D made-to-measure garments with sewing patterns, as well as its generation pipeline. GarmentCodeData contains 115,000 data points that cover a variety of designs in many common garment categories: tops, shirts, dresses, jumpsuits, skirts, pants, etc., fitted to a variety of body shapes sampled from a custom statistical body model based on CAESAR, as well as a standard reference body shape, applying three different textile materials. To enable the creation of datasets of such complexity, we introduce a set of algorithms for automatically taking tailor's measures on sampled body shapes, sampling strategies for sewing pattern design, and propose an automatic, open-source 3D garment draping pipeline based on a fast XPBD simulator, while contributing several solutions for collision resolution and drape correctness to enable scalability.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Divyam Madaan, Taro Makino, Sumit Chopra, Kyunghyun Cho</p>
<p>Abstract: Supervised multi-modal learning involves mapping multiple modalities to a target label. Previous studies in this field have concentrated on capturing in isolation either the inter-modality dependencies (the relationships between different modalities and the label) or the intra-modality dependencies (the relationships within a single modality and the label). We argue that these conventional approaches that rely solely on either inter- or intra-modality dependencies may not be optimal in general. We view the multi-modal learning problem from the lens of generative models where we consider the target as a source of multiple modalities and the interaction between them. Towards that end, we propose inter- & intra-modality modeling (I2M2) framework, which captures and integrates both the inter- and intra-modality dependencies, leading to more accurate predictions. We evaluate our approach using real-world healthcare and vision-and-language datasets with state-of-the-art models, demonstrating superior performance over traditional methods focusing only on one type of modality dependency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaohua Dong, Yunhe Feng, Qing Yang, Yuewei Lin, Heng Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: High-performance Transformer trackers have shown excellent results, yet they often bear a heavy computational load. Observing that a smaller input can immediately and conveniently reduce computations without changing the model, an easy solution is to adopt the low-resolution input for efficient Transformer tracking. Albeit faster, this hurts tracking accuracy much due to information loss in low resolution tracking. In this paper, we aim to mitigate such information loss to boost the performance of the low-resolution Transformer tracking via dual knowledge distillation from a frozen high-resolution (but not a larger) Transformer tracker. The core lies in two simple yet effective distillation modules, comprising query-key-value knowledge distillation (QKV-KD) and discrimination knowledge distillation (Disc-KD), across resolutions. The former, from the global view, allows the low-resolution tracker to inherit the features and interactions from the high-resolution tracker, while the later, from the target-aware view, enhances the target-background distinguishing capacity via imitating discriminative regions from its high-resolution counterpart. With the dual knowledge distillation, our Low-Resolution Transformer Tracker (LoReTrack) enjoys not only high efficiency owing to reduced computation but also enhanced accuracy by distilling knowledge from the high-resolution tracker. In extensive experiments, LoReTrack with a 256x256 resolution consistently improves baseline with the same resolution, and shows competitive or even better results compared to 384x384 high-resolution Transformer tracker, while running 52% faster and saving 56% MACs. Moreover, LoReTrack is resolution-scalable. With a 128x128 resolution, it runs 25 fps on a CPU with 64.9%/46.4% SUC scores on LaSOT/LaSOText, surpassing all other CPU real-time trackers.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17661">RefDrop: Controllable Consistency in Image or Video Generation via Reference Feature Guidance</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaojiao Fan, Haotian Xue, Qinsheng Zhang, Yongxin Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: There is a rapidly growing interest in controlling consistency across multiple generated images using diffusion models. Among various methods, recent works have found that simply manipulating attention modules by concatenating features from multiple reference images provides an efficient approach to enhancing consistency without fine-tuning. Despite its popularity and success, few studies have elucidated the underlying mechanisms that contribute to its effectiveness. In this work, we reveal that the popular approach is a linear interpolation of image self-attention and cross-attention between synthesized content and reference features, with a constant rank-1 coefficient. Motivated by this observation, we find that a rank-1 coefficient is not necessary and simplifies the controllable generation mechanism. The resulting algorithm, which we coin as RefDrop, allows users to control the influence of reference context in a direct and precise manner. Besides further enhancing consistency in single-subject image generation, our method also enables more interesting applications, such as the consistent generation of multiple subjects, suppressing specific features to encourage more diverse content, and high-quality personalized video generation by boosting temporal consistency. Even compared with state-of-the-art image-prompt-based generators, such as IP-Adapter, RefDrop is competitive in terms of controllability and quality while avoiding the need to train a separate image encoder for feature injection from reference images, making it a versatile plug-and-play solution for any image or video diffusion model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kushagra Pandey, Ruihan Yang, Stephan Mandt</p>
<p>Abstract: Constructing fast samplers for unconditional diffusion and flow-matching models has received much attention recently; however, existing methods for solving inverse problems, such as super-resolution, inpainting, or deblurring, still require hundreds to thousands of iterative steps to obtain high-quality results. We propose a plug-and-play framework for constructing efficient samplers for inverse problems, requiring only pre-trained diffusion or flow-matching models. We present Conditional Conjugate Integrators, which leverage the specific form of the inverse problem to project the respective conditional diffusion/flow dynamics into a more amenable space for sampling. Our method complements popular posterior approximation methods for solving inverse problems using diffusion/flow models. We evaluate the proposed method's performance on various linear image restoration tasks across multiple datasets, employing diffusion and flow-matching models. Notably, on challenging inverse problems like 4$\times$ super-resolution on the ImageNet dataset, our method can generate high-quality samples in as few as 5 conditional sampling steps and outperforms competing baselines requiring 20-1000 steps. Our code and models will be publicly available at https://github.com/mandt-lab/CI2RM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanqi Xu, Yiqiu Shen, Carlos Fernandez-Granda, Laura Heacock, Krzysztof J. Geras</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer-based detectors have shown success in computer vision tasks with natural images. These models, exemplified by the Deformable DETR, are optimized through complex engineering strategies tailored to the typical characteristics of natural scenes. However, medical imaging data presents unique challenges such as extremely large image sizes, fewer and smaller regions of interest, and object classes which can be differentiated only through subtle differences. This study evaluates the applicability of these transformer-based design choices when applied to a screening mammography dataset that represents these distinct medical imaging data characteristics. Our analysis reveals that common design choices from the natural image domain, such as complex encoder architectures, multi-scale feature fusion, query initialization, and iterative bounding box refinement, do not improve and sometimes even impair object detection performance in medical imaging. In contrast, simpler and shallower architectures often achieve equal or superior results. This finding suggests that the adaptation of transformer models for medical imaging data requires a reevaluation of standard practices, potentially leading to more efficient and specialized frameworks for medical diagnosis.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17678">TIMA: Text-Image Mutual Awareness for Balancing Zero-Shot Adversarial Robustness and Generalization Ability</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Fengji Ma, Li Liu, Hei Victor Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: This work addresses the challenge of achieving zero-shot adversarial robustness while preserving zero-shot generalization in large-scale foundation models, with a focus on the popular Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP). Although foundation models were reported to have exceptional zero-shot generalization, they are highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. Existing methods achieve a comparable good tradeoff between zero-shot adversarial robustness and generalization under small adversarial perturbations. However, they fail to achieve a good tradeoff under large adversarial perturbations. To this end, we propose a novel Text-Image Mutual Awareness (TIMA) method that strikes a balance between zero-shot adversarial robustness and generalization. More precisely, we propose an Image-Aware Text (IAT) tuning mechanism that increases the inter-class distance of text embeddings by incorporating the Minimum Hyperspherical Energy (MHE). Simultaneously, fixed pre-trained image embeddings are used as cross-modal auxiliary supervision to maintain the similarity between the MHE-tuned and original text embeddings by the knowledge distillation, preserving semantic information between different classes. Besides, we introduce a Text-Aware Image (TAI) tuning mechanism, which increases inter-class distance between image embeddings during the training stage by Text-distance based Adaptive Margin (TAM). Similarly, a knowledge distillation is utilized to retain the similarity between fine-tuned and pre-trained image embeddings. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing impressive zero-shot performance against a wide range of adversarial perturbations while preserving the zero-shot generalization capabilities of the original CLIP model.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17680">Deciphering Movement: Unified Trajectory Generation Model for Multi-Agent</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Xu, Yun Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding multi-agent behavior is critical across various fields. The conventional approach involves analyzing agent movements through three primary tasks: trajectory prediction, imputation, and spatial-temporal recovery. Considering the unique input formulation and constraint of these tasks, most existing methods are tailored to address only one specific task. However, in real-world applications, these scenarios frequently occur simultaneously. Consequently, methods designed for one task often fail to adapt to others, resulting in performance drops. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Unified Trajectory Generation model, UniTraj, that processes arbitrary trajectories as masked inputs, adaptable to diverse scenarios. Specifically, we introduce a Ghost Spatial Masking (GSM) module embedded within a Transformer encoder for spatial feature extraction. We further extend recent successful State Space Models (SSMs), particularly the Mamba model, into a Bidirectional Temporal Mamba to effectively capture temporal dependencies. Additionally, we incorporate a Bidirectional Temporal Scaled (BTS) module to comprehensively scan trajectories while maintaining the temporal missing relationships within the sequence. We curate and benchmark three practical sports game datasets, Basketball-U, Football-U, and Soccer-U, for evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that addresses this unified problem through a versatile generative framework, thereby enhancing our understanding of multi-agent movement.

<p>Abstract: Video analytics systems based on deep learning models are often opaque and brittle and require explanation systems to help users debug. Current model explanation system are very good at giving literal explanations of behavior in terms of pixel contributions but cannot integrate information about the physical or systems processes that might influence a prediction. This paper introduces the idea that a simple form of causal reasoning, called a regression discontinuity design, can be used to associate changes in multiple key performance indicators to physical real world phenomena to give users a more actionable set of video analytics explanations. We overview the system architecture and describe a vision of the impact that such a system might have.</p>

<p>Abstract: Using drones to track multiple individuals simultaneously in their natural environment is a powerful approach for better understanding group primate behavior. Previous studies have demonstrated that it is possible to automate the classification of primate behavior from video data, but these studies have been carried out in captivity or from ground-based cameras. To understand group behavior and the self-organization of a collective, the whole troop needs to be seen at a scale where behavior can be seen in relation to the natural environment in which ecological decisions are made. This study presents a novel dataset from drone videos for baboon detection, tracking, and behavior recognition. The baboon detection dataset was created by manually annotating all baboons in drone videos with bounding boxes. A tiling method was subsequently applied to create a pyramid of images at various scales from the original 5.3K resolution images, resulting in approximately 30K images used for baboon detection. The tracking dataset is derived from the detection dataset, where all bounding boxes are assigned the same ID throughout the video. This process resulted in half an hour of very dense tracking data. The behavior recognition dataset was generated by converting tracks into mini-scenes, a video subregion centered on each animal; each mini-scene was manually annotated with 12 distinct behavior types, resulting in over 20 hours of data. Benchmark results show mean average precision (mAP) of 92.62\% for the YOLOv8-X detection model, multiple object tracking precision (MOTA) of 63.81\% for the BotSort tracking algorithm, and micro top-1 accuracy of 63.97\% for the X3D behavior recognition model. Using deep learning to classify wildlife behavior from drone footage facilitates non-invasive insight into the collective behavior of an entire group.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amir El-Ghoussani, Julia Hornauer, Gustavo Carneiro, Vasileios Belagiannis</p>
<p>Abstract: In monocular depth estimation, unsupervised domain adaptation has recently been explored to relax the dependence on large annotated image-based depth datasets. However, this comes at the cost of training multiple models or requiring complex training protocols. We formulate unsupervised domain adaptation for monocular depth estimation as a consistency-based semi-supervised learning problem by assuming access only to the source domain ground truth labels. To this end, we introduce a pairwise loss function that regularises predictions on the source domain while enforcing perturbation consistency across multiple augmented views of the unlabelled target samples. Importantly, our approach is simple and effective, requiring only training of a single model in contrast to the prior work. In our experiments, we rely on the standard depth estimation benchmarks KITTI and NYUv2 to demonstrate state-of-the-art results compared to related approaches. Furthermore, we analyse the simplicity and effectiveness of our approach in a series of ablation studies. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/AmirMaEl/SemiSupMDE}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linhan Wang, Kai Cheng, Shuo Lei, Shengkun Wang, Wei Yin, Chenyang Lei, Xiaoxiao Long, Chang-Tien Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: We present DC-Gaussian, a new method for generating novel views from in-vehicle dash cam videos. While neural rendering techniques have made significant strides in driving scenarios, existing methods are primarily designed for videos collected by autonomous vehicles. However, these videos are limited in both quantity and diversity compared to dash cam videos, which are more widely used across various types of vehicles and capture a broader range of scenarios. Dash cam videos often suffer from severe obstructions such as reflections and occlusions on the windshields, which significantly impede the application of neural rendering techniques. To address this challenge, we develop DC-Gaussian based on the recent real-time neural rendering technique 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Our approach includes an adaptive image decomposition module to model reflections and occlusions in a unified manner. Additionally, we introduce illumination-aware obstruction modeling to manage reflections and occlusions under varying lighting conditions. Lastly, we employ a geometry-guided Gaussian enhancement strategy to improve rendering details by incorporating additional geometry priors. Experiments on self-captured and public dash cam videos show that our method not only achieves state-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis, but also accurately reconstructing captured scenes getting rid of obstructions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sihe Zhang, Qingdong He, Jinlong Peng, Yuxi Li, Zhengkai Jiang, Jiafu Wu, Mingmin Chi, Yabiao Wang, Chengjie Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Image retrieval aims to identify visually similar images within a database using a given query image. Traditional methods typically employ both global and local features extracted from images for matching, and may also apply re-ranking techniques to enhance accuracy. However, these methods often fail to account for the noise present in query images, which can stem from natural or human-induced factors, thereby negatively impacting retrieval performance. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a novel setting for low-quality image retrieval, and propose an Adaptive Noise-Based Network (AdapNet) to learn robust abstract representations. Specifically, we devise a quality compensation block trained to compensate for various low-quality factors in input images. Besides, we introduce an innovative adaptive noise-based loss function, which dynamically adjusts its focus on the gradient in accordance with image quality, thereby augmenting the learning of unknown noisy samples during training and enhancing intra-class compactness. To assess the performance, we construct two datasets with low-quality queries, which is built by applying various types of noise on clean query images on the standard Revisited Oxford and Revisited Paris datasets. Comprehensive experimental results illustrate that AdapNet surpasses state-of-the-art methods on the Noise Revisited Oxford and Noise Revisited Paris benchmarks, while maintaining competitive performance on high-quality datasets. The code and constructed datasets will be made available.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17719">EgoNCE++: Do Egocentric Video-Language Models Really Understand Hand-Object Interactions?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Boshen Xu, Ziheng Wang, Yang Du, Sipeng Zheng, Zhinan Song, Qin Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Egocentric video-language pretraining is a crucial paradigm to advance the learning of egocentric hand-object interactions (EgoHOI). Despite the great success on existing testbeds, these benchmarks focus more on closed-set visual concepts or limited scenarios. Due to the occurrence of diverse EgoHOIs in the real world, we propose an open-vocabulary benchmark named EgoHOIBench to reveal the diminished performance of current egocentric video-language models (EgoVLM) on fined-grained concepts, indicating that these models still lack a full spectrum of egocentric understanding. We attribute this performance gap to insufficient fine-grained supervision and strong bias towards understanding objects rather than temporal dynamics in current methods. To tackle these issues, we introduce a novel asymmetric contrastive objective for EgoHOI named EgoNCE++. For video-to-text loss, we enhance text supervision through the generation of negative captions by leveraging the in-context learning of large language models to perform HOI-related word substitution. For text-to-video loss, we propose an object-centric positive video sampling strategy that aggregates video representations by the same nouns. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that EgoNCE++ significantly boosts open-vocabulary HOI recognition, multi-instance retrieval, and action recognition tasks across various egocentric models, with improvements of up to +26.55%.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Inhwa Han, Jaayeon Lee, Jong Chul Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Research efforts to understand neural signals have been ongoing for many years, with visual decoding from fMRI signals attracting considerable attention. Particularly, the advent of image diffusion models has advanced the reconstruction of images from fMRI data significantly. However, existing approaches often introduce inter- and intra- subject variations in the reconstructed images, which can compromise accuracy. To address current limitations in multi-subject brain decoding, we introduce a new Transformer architecture called MindFormer. This model is specifically designed to generate fMRI-conditioned feature vectors that can be used for conditioning Stable Diffusion model. More specifically, MindFormer incorporates two key innovations: 1) a novel training strategy based on the IP-Adapter to extract semantically meaningful features from fMRI signals, and 2) a subject specific token and linear layer that effectively capture individual differences in fMRI signals while synergistically combines multi subject fMRI data for training. Our experimental results demonstrate that Stable Diffusion, when integrated with MindFormer, produces semantically consistent images across different subjects. This capability significantly surpasses existing models in multi-subject brain decoding. Such advancements not only improve the accuracy of our reconstructions but also deepen our understanding of neural processing variations among individuals.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiyu Li, Ke Xu, Gerhard Petrus Hancke, Rynson W. H. Lau</p>
<p>Abstract: Images captured under sub-optimal illumination conditions may contain both over- and under-exposures. Current approaches mainly focus on adjusting image brightness, which may exacerbate the color tone distortion in under-exposed areas and fail to restore accurate colors in over-exposed regions. We observe that under-exposed and over-exposed regions display opposite color tone distribution shifts with respect to each other, which may not be easily normalized in joint modeling as they usually do not have ``normal-exposed'' regions/pixels as reference. In this paper, we propose a novel method to enhance images with both over- and under-exposures by learning to estimate and correct such color shifts. Specifically, we first derive the color feature maps of the brightened and darkened versions of the input image via a UNet-based network, followed by a pseudo-normal feature generator to produce pseudo-normal color feature maps. We then propose a novel COlor Shift Estimation (COSE) module to estimate the color shifts between the derived brightened (or darkened) color feature maps and the pseudo-normal color feature maps. The COSE module corrects the estimated color shifts of the over- and under-exposed regions separately. We further propose a novel COlor MOdulation (COMO) module to modulate the separately corrected colors in the over- and under-exposed regions to produce the enhanced image. Comprehensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing approaches. Project webpage: https://github.com/yiyulics/CSEC.</p>

To address this, we formalize the novel task of hierarchical video recognition, and propose a video-language learning framework tailored for hierarchical recognition. Specifically, our framework encodes dependencies between hierarchical category levels, and applies a top-down constraint to filter recognition predictions. We further construct a new fine-grained dataset based on medical assessments for rehabilitation of stroke patients, serving as a challenging benchmark for hierarchical recognition. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach for hierarchical recognition, significantly outperforming conventional methods, especially for fine-grained subcategories. The proposed framework paves the way for hierarchical modeling in video understanding tasks, moving beyond flat categorization.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal learning methods with targeted unimodal learning objectives have exhibited their superior efficacy in alleviating the imbalanced multimodal learning problem. However, in this paper, we identify the previously ignored gradient conflict between multimodal and unimodal learning objectives, potentially misleading the unimodal encoder optimization. To well diminish these conflicts, we observe the discrepancy between multimodal loss and unimodal loss, where both gradient magnitude and covariance of the easier-to-learn multimodal loss are smaller than the unimodal one. With this property, we analyze Pareto integration under our multimodal scenario and propose MMPareto algorithm, which could ensure a final gradient with direction that is common to all learning objectives and enhanced magnitude to improve generalization, providing innocent unimodal assistance. Finally, experiments across multiple types of modalities and frameworks with dense cross-modal interaction indicate our superior and extendable method performance. Our method is also expected to facilitate multi-task cases with a clear discrepancy in task difficulty, demonstrating its ideal scalability.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kun Yuan, Hongbo Liu, Mading Li, Muyi Sun, Ming Sun, Jiachao Gong, Jinhua Hao, Chao Zhou, Yansong Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Video quality assessment (VQA) is a challenging problem due to the numerous factors that can affect the perceptual quality of a video, \eg, content attractiveness, distortion type, motion pattern, and level. However, annotating the Mean opinion score (MOS) for videos is expensive and time-consuming, which limits the scale of VQA datasets, and poses a significant obstacle for deep learning-based methods. In this paper, we propose a VQA method named PTM-VQA, which leverages PreTrained Models to transfer knowledge from models pretrained on various pre-tasks, enabling benefits for VQA from different aspects.
  Specifically, we extract features of videos from different pretrained models with frozen weights and integrate them to generate representation. Since these models possess various fields of knowledge and are often trained with labels irrelevant to quality, we propose an Intra-Consistency and Inter-Divisibility (ICID) loss to impose constraints on features extracted by multiple pretrained models. The intra-consistency constraint ensures that features extracted by different pretrained models are in the same unified quality-aware latent space, while the inter-divisibility introduces pseudo clusters based on the annotation of samples and tries to separate features of samples from different clusters. Furthermore, with a constantly growing number of pretrained models, it is crucial to determine which models to use and how to use them. To address this problem, we propose an efficient scheme to select suitable candidates. Models with better clustering performance on VQA datasets are chosen to be our candidates. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuedong Tan, Zongwei Wu, Yuqian Fu, Zhuyun Zhou, Guolei Sun, Chao Ma, Danda Pani Paudel, Luc Van Gool, Radu Timofte</p>
<p>Abstract: With the emergence of a single large model capable of successfully solving a multitude of tasks in NLP, there has been growing research interest in achieving similar goals in computer vision. On the one hand, most of these generic models, referred to as generalist vision models, aim at producing unified outputs serving different tasks. On the other hand, some existing models aim to combine different input types (aka data modalities), which are then processed by a single large model. Yet, this step of combination remains specialized, which falls short of serving the initial ambition. In this paper, we showcase that such specialization (during unification) is unnecessary, in the context of RGB-X video object tracking. Our single model tracker, termed XTrack, can remain blind to any modality X during inference time. Our tracker employs a mixture of modal experts comprising those dedicated to shared commonality and others capable of flexibly performing reasoning conditioned on input modality. Such a design ensures the unification of input modalities towards a common latent space, without weakening the modality-specific information representation. With this idea, our training process is extremely simple, integrating multi-label classification loss with a routing function, thereby effectively aligning and unifying all modalities together, even from only paired data. Thus, during inference, we can adopt any modality without relying on the inductive bias of the modal prior and achieve generalist performance. Without any bells and whistles, our generalist and blind tracker can achieve competitive performance compared to well-established modal-specific models on 5 benchmarks across 3 auxiliary modalities, covering commonly used depth, thermal, and event data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shanshan Wang, Hao Zhou, Xun Yang, Zhenwei He, Mengzhu Wang, Xingyi Zhang, Meng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) is a critical problem for transfer learning, which aims to transfer the semantic information from labeled source domain to unlabeled target domain. Recent advancements in UDA models have demonstrated significant generalization capabilities on the target domain. However, the generalization boundary of UDA models remains unclear. When the domain discrepancy is too large, the model can not preserve the distribution structure, leading to distribution collapse during the alignment. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient UDA framework named Gradually Vanishing Gap in Prototypical Network (GVG-PN), which achieves transfer learning from both global and local perspectives. From the global alignment standpoint, our model generates a domain-biased intermediate domain that helps preserve the distribution structures. By entangling cross-domain features, our model progressively reduces the risk of distribution collapse. However, only relying on global alignment is insufficient to preserve the distribution structure. To further enhance the inner relationships of features, we introduce the local perspective. We utilize the graph convolutional network (GCN) as an intuitive method to explore the internal relationships between features, ensuring the preservation of manifold structures and generating domain-biased prototypes. Additionally, we consider the discriminability of the inner relationships between features. We propose a pro-contrastive loss to enhance the discriminability at the prototype level by separating hard negative pairs. By incorporating both GCN and the pro-contrastive loss, our model fully explores fine-grained semantic relationships. Experiments on several UDA benchmarks validated that the proposed GVG-PN can clearly outperform the SOTA models.</p>

<p>Abstract: As we navigate our daily commutes, the threat posed by a distracted driver is at a large, resulting in a troubling rise in traffic accidents. Addressing this safety concern, our project harnesses the analytical power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), with a particular emphasis on the well-established models VGG16 and VGG19. These models are acclaimed for their precision in image recognition and are meticulously tested for their ability to detect nuances in driver behavior under varying environmental conditions. Through a comparative analysis against an array of CNN architectures, this study seeks to identify the most efficient model for real-time detection of driver distractions. The ultimate aim is to incorporate the findings into vehicle safety systems, significantly boosting their capability to prevent accidents triggered by inattention. This research not only enhances our understanding of automotive safety technologies but also marks a pivotal step towards creating vehicles that are intuitively aligned with driver behaviors, ensuring safer roads for all.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weizhen He, Yiheng Deng, Yunfeng Yan, Feng Zhu, Yizhou Wang, Lei Bai, Qingsong Xie, Donglian Qi, Wanli Ouyang, Shixiang Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Human intelligence can retrieve any person according to both visual and language descriptions. However, the current computer vision community studies specific person re-identification (ReID) tasks in different scenarios separately, which limits the applications in the real world. This paper strives to resolve this problem by proposing a novel instruct-ReID task that requires the model to retrieve images according to the given image or language instructions. Instruct-ReID is the first exploration of a general ReID setting, where existing 6 ReID tasks can be viewed as special cases by assigning different instructions. To facilitate research in this new instruct-ReID task, we propose a large-scale OmniReID++ benchmark equipped with diverse data and comprehensive evaluation methods e.g., task specific and task-free evaluation settings. In the task-specific evaluation setting, gallery sets are categorized according to specific ReID tasks. We propose a novel baseline model, IRM, with an adaptive triplet loss to handle various retrieval tasks within a unified framework. For task-free evaluation setting, where target person images are retrieved from task-agnostic gallery sets, we further propose a new method called IRM++ with novel memory bank-assisted learning. Extensive evaluations of IRM and IRM++ on OmniReID++ benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our proposed methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance on 10 test sets. The datasets, the model, and the code will be available at https://github.com/hwz-zju/Instruct-ReID</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongjae Lee, Zhaoliang Zhang, Deliang Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has made a significant stride in novel view synthesis, demonstrating top-notch rendering quality while achieving real-time rendering speed. However, the excessively large number of Gaussian primitives resulting from 3DGS' suboptimal densification process poses a major challenge, slowing down frame-per-second (FPS) and demanding considerable memory cost, making it unfavorable for low-end devices. To cope with this issue, many follow-up studies have suggested various pruning techniques, often in combination with different score functions, to optimize rendering performance. Nonetheless, a comprehensive discussion regarding their effectiveness and implications across all techniques is missing. In this paper, we first categorize 3DGS pruning techniques into two types: Cross-view pruning and pixel-wise pruning, which differ in their approaches to rank primitives. Our subsequent experiments reveal that while cross-view pruning leads to disastrous quality drops under extreme Gaussian primitives decimation, the pixel-wise pruning technique not only sustains relatively high rendering quality with minuscule performance degradation but also provides a reasonable minimum boundary for pruning. Building on this observation, we further propose multiple variations of score functions and empirically discover that the color-weighted score function outperforms others for discriminating insignificant primitives for rendering. We believe our research provides valuable insights for optimizing 3DGS pruning strategies for future works.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanjun Luo, Ziye Deng, Ruizhe Chen, Zuozhu Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid development and reduced barriers to entry for Text-to-Image (T2I) models have raised concerns about the biases in their outputs, but existing research lacks a holistic definition and evaluation framework of biases, limiting the enhancement of debiasing techniques. To address this issue, we introduce FAIntbench, a holistic and precise benchmark for biases in T2I models. In contrast to existing benchmarks that evaluate bias in limited aspects, FAIntbench evaluate biases from four dimensions: manifestation of bias, visibility of bias, acquired attributes, and protected attributes. We applied FAIntbench to evaluate seven recent large-scale T2I models and conducted human evaluation, whose results demonstrated the effectiveness of FAIntbench in identifying various biases. Our study also revealed new research questions about biases, including the side-effect of distillation. The findings presented here are preliminary, highlighting the potential of FAIntbench to advance future research aimed at mitigating the biases in T2I models. Our benchmark is publicly available to ensure the reproducibility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haogeng Liu, Quanzeng You, Xiaotian Han, Yongfei Liu, Huaibo Huang, Ran He, Hongxia Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: In the realm of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), vision-language connector plays a crucial role to link the pre-trained vision encoders with Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite its importance, the vision-language connector has been relatively less explored. In this study, we aim to propose a strong vision-language connector that enables MLLMs to achieve high accuracy while maintain low computation cost. We first reveal the existence of the visual anchors in Vision Transformer and propose a cost-effective search algorithm to extract them. Building on these findings, we introduce the Anchor Former (AcFormer), a novel vision-language connector designed to leverage the rich prior knowledge obtained from these visual anchors during pretraining, guiding the aggregation of information. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that the proposed method significantly reduces computational costs by nearly two-thirds compared with baseline, while simultaneously outperforming baseline methods. This highlights the effectiveness and efficiency of AcFormer.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17816">Pursuing Feature Separation based on Neural Collapse for Out-of-Distribution Detection</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingwen Wu, Ruiji Yu, Xinwen Cheng, Zhengbao He, Xiaolin Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: In the open world, detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) data, whose labels are disjoint with those of in-distribution (ID) samples, is important for reliable deep neural networks (DNNs). To achieve better detection performance, one type of approach proposes to fine-tune the model with auxiliary OOD datasets to amplify the difference between ID and OOD data through a separation loss defined on model outputs. However, none of these studies consider enlarging the feature disparity, which should be more effective compared to outputs. The main difficulty lies in the diversity of OOD samples, which makes it hard to describe their feature distribution, let alone design losses to separate them from ID features. In this paper, we neatly fence off the problem based on an aggregation property of ID features named Neural Collapse (NC). NC means that the penultimate features of ID samples within a class are nearly identical to the last layer weight of the corresponding class. Based on this property, we propose a simple but effective loss called OrthLoss, which binds the features of OOD data in a subspace orthogonal to the principal subspace of ID features formed by NC. In this way, the features of ID and OOD samples are separated by different dimensions. By optimizing the feature separation loss rather than purely enlarging output differences, our detection achieves SOTA performance on CIFAR benchmarks without any additional data augmentation or sampling, demonstrating the importance of feature separation in OOD detection. The code will be published.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vida Adeli, Soroush Mehraban, Yasamin Zarghami, Irene Ballester, Andrea Sabo, Andrea Iaboni, Babak Taati</p>
<p>Abstract: This study investigates the application of general human motion encoders trained on large-scale human motion datasets for analyzing gait patterns in PD patients. Although these models have learned a wealth of human biomechanical knowledge, their effectiveness in analyzing pathological movements, such as parkinsonian gait, has yet to be fully validated. We propose a comparative framework and evaluate six pre-trained state-of-the-art human motion encoder models on their ability to predict the Movement Disorder Society - Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS-III) gait scores from motion capture data. We compare these against a traditional gait feature-based predictive model in a recently released large public PD dataset, including PD patients on and off medication. The feature-based model currently shows higher weighted average accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Motion encoder models with closely comparable results demonstrate promise for scalability and efficiency in clinical settings. This potential is underscored by the enhanced performance of the encoder model upon fine-tuning on PD training set. Four of the six human motion models examined provided prediction scores that were significantly different between on- and off-medication states. This finding reveals the sensitivity of motion encoder models to nuanced clinical changes. It also underscores the necessity for continued customization of these models to better capture disease-specific features, thereby reducing the reliance on labor-intensive feature engineering. Lastly, we establish a benchmark for the analysis of skeleton-based motion encoder models in clinical settings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to provide a benchmark that enables state-of-the-art models to be tested and compete in a clinical context. Codes and benchmark leaderboard are available at code.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ting Wang, Zipei Yan, Jizhou Li, Xile Zhao, Chao Wang, Michael Ng</p>
<p>Abstract: The fusion of a low-resolution hyperspectral image (LR-HSI) with a high-resolution multispectral image (HR-MSI) has emerged as an effective technique for achieving HSI super-resolution (SR). Previous studies have mainly concentrated on estimating the posterior distribution of the latent high-resolution hyperspectral image (HR-HSI), leveraging an appropriate image prior and likelihood computed from the discrepancy between the latent HSI and observed images. Low rankness stands out for preserving latent HSI characteristics through matrix factorization among the various priors. However, this method only enhances resolution within the dimensions of the two modalities. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel continuous low-rank factorization (CLoRF) by integrating two neural representations into the matrix factorization, capturing spatial and spectral information, respectively. This approach enables us to harness both the low rankness from the matrix factorization and the continuity from neural representation in a self-supervised manner. Theoretically, we prove the low-rank property and Lipschitz continuity in the proposed continuous low-rank factorization. Experimentally, our method significantly surpasses existing techniques and achieves user-desired resolutions without the need for neural network retraining.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sangmin Woo, Donguk Kim, Jaehyuk Jang, Yubin Choi, Changick Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: This study addresses the issue observed in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs), where excessive attention on a few image tokens, referred to as blind tokens, leads to hallucinatory responses in tasks requiring fine-grained understanding of visual objects. We found that tokens receiving lower attention weights often hold essential information for identifying nuanced object details -- ranging from merely recognizing object existence to identifying their attributes (color, position, etc.) and understanding their relationships. To counteract the over-emphasis on blind tokens and to accurately respond to user queries, we introduce a technique called Attentional Vision Calibration (AVC). During the decoding phase, AVC identifies blind tokens by analyzing the image-related attention distribution. It then dynamically adjusts the logits for the next token prediction by contrasting the logits conditioned on the original visual tokens with those conditioned on the blind tokens. This effectively lowers the dependency on blind tokens and promotes a more balanced consideration of all tokens. We validate AVC on benchmarks such as POPE, MME, and AMBER, where it consistently outperforms existing decoding techniques in mitigating object hallucinations in LVLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sangmin Woo, Jaehyuk Jang, Donguk Kim, Yubin Choi, Changick Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have revolutionized how machines understand and generate textual responses based on visual inputs. Despite their impressive capabilities, they often produce "hallucinatory" outputs that do not accurately reflect the visual information, posing challenges in reliability and trustworthiness. Current methods such as contrastive decoding have made strides in addressing these issues by contrasting the original probability distribution of generated tokens with distorted counterparts; yet, generating visually-faithful outputs remains a challenge. In this work, we shift our focus to the opposite: What could serve as a complementary enhancement to the original probability distribution? We propose a simple, training-free method termed RITUAL to enhance robustness against hallucinations in LVLMs. Our approach employs random image transformations as complements to the original probability distribution, aiming to mitigate the likelihood of hallucinatory visual explanations by enriching the model's exposure to varied visual scenarios. Our empirical results show that while the isolated use of transformed images initially degrades performance, strategic implementation of these transformations can indeed serve as effective complements. Notably, our method is compatible with current contrastive decoding methods and does not require external models or costly self-feedback mechanisms, making it a practical addition. In experiments, RITUAL significantly outperforms existing contrastive decoding methods across several object hallucination benchmarks, including POPE, CHAIR, and MME.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Quan Liu, Ruining Deng, Can Cui, Tianyuan Yao, Vishwesh Nath, Yucheng Tang, Yuankai Huo</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-modal learning adeptly integrates visual and textual data, but its application to histopathology image and text analysis remains challenging, particularly with large, high-resolution images like gigapixel Whole Slide Images (WSIs). Current methods typically rely on manual region labeling or multi-stage learning to assemble local representations (e.g., patch-level) into global features (e.g., slide-level). However, there is no effective way to integrate multi-scale image representations with text data in a seamless end-to-end process. In this study, we introduce Multi-Level Text-Guided Representation End-to-End Learning (mTREE). This novel text-guided approach effectively captures multi-scale WSI representations by utilizing information from accompanying textual pathology information. mTREE innovatively combines - the localization of key areas (global-to-local) and the development of a WSI-level image-text representation (local-to-global) - into a unified, end-to-end learning framework. In this model, textual information serves a dual purpose: firstly, functioning as an attention map to accurately identify key areas, and secondly, acting as a conduit for integrating textual features into the comprehensive representation of the image. Our study demonstrates the effectiveness of mTREE through quantitative analyses in two image-related tasks: classification and survival prediction, showcasing its remarkable superiority over baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seokil Ham, Sangmin Woo, Jin-Young Kim, Hyojun Go, Byeongjun Park, Changick Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: We present Diffusion Model Patching (DMP), a simple method to boost the performance of pre-trained diffusion models that have already reached convergence, with a negligible increase in parameters. DMP inserts a small, learnable set of prompts into the model's input space while keeping the original model frozen. The effectiveness of DMP is not merely due to the addition of parameters but stems from its dynamic gating mechanism, which selects and combines a subset of learnable prompts at every step of the generative process (e.g., reverse denoising steps). This strategy, which we term "mixture-of-prompts", enables the model to draw on the distinct expertise of each prompt, essentially "patching" the model's functionality at every step with minimal yet specialized parameters. Uniquely, DMP enhances the model by further training on the same dataset on which it was originally trained, even in a scenario where significant improvements are typically not expected due to model convergence. Experiments show that DMP significantly enhances the converged FID of DiT-L/2 on FFHQ 256x256 by 10.38%, achieved with only a 1.43% parameter increase and 50K additional training iterations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuojue Yang, Qian Li, Daiyun Shen, Bingchen Gong, Qi Dou, Yueming Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Tissue deformation poses a key challenge for accurate surgical scene reconstruction. Despite yielding high reconstruction quality, existing methods suffer from slow rendering speeds and long training times, limiting their intraoperative applicability. Motivated by recent progress in 3D Gaussian Splatting, an emerging technology in real-time 3D rendering, this work presents a novel fast reconstruction framework, termed Deform3DGS, for deformable tissues during endoscopic surgery. Specifically, we introduce 3D GS into surgical scenes by integrating a point cloud initialization to improve reconstruction. Furthermore, we propose a novel flexible deformation modeling scheme (FDM) to learn tissue deformation dynamics at the level of individual Gaussians. Our FDM can model the surface deformation with efficient representations, allowing for real-time rendering performance. More importantly, FDM significantly accelerates surgical scene reconstruction, demonstrating considerable clinical values, particularly in intraoperative settings where time efficiency is crucial. Experiments on DaVinci robotic surgery videos indicate the efficacy of our approach, showcasing superior reconstruction fidelity PSNR: (37.90) and rendering speed (338.8 FPS) while substantially reducing training time to only 1 minute/scene.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this study, we aim to construct an audio-video generative model with minimal computational cost by leveraging pre-trained single-modal generative models for audio and video. To achieve this, we propose a novel method that guides each single-modal model to cooperatively generate well-aligned samples across modalities. Specifically, given two pre-trained base diffusion models, we train a lightweight joint guidance module to adjust scores separately estimated by the base models to match the score of joint distribution over audio and video. We theoretically show that this guidance can be computed through the gradient of the optimal discriminator distinguishing real audio-video pairs from fake ones independently generated by the base models. On the basis of this analysis, we construct the joint guidance module by training this discriminator. Additionally, we adopt a loss function to make the gradient of the discriminator work as a noise estimator, as in standard diffusion models, stabilizing the gradient of the discriminator. Empirical evaluations on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method improves both single-modal fidelity and multi-modal alignment with a relatively small number of parameters.</p>

<p>Abstract: Fare evasion is a problem for public transport companies, with LSTM models this issue can help companies get an analytical insight into where this issue occurs the most, to prevent capital loss. In addition to the financial burden this problem causes, having more inspectors is not enough to alleviate the problem. The purpose of this study is to find a different way to predict fare evasion in the public transport sector. Through the use of keypoint extractions of passengers in video footage, an LSTM model is trained on those keypoints to help predict the actions of passengers between payments and evasions. The results were promising when it came to predicting the actions of passengers on real-time footage. Thus a sophisticated approach can help to decrease the fare evasion problem. A ReID model can be used alongside the LSTM model for better accuracy, as there is always the chance that a person might only pay for the fare at a later stage. With both models, it is possible for public transport companies to start narrowing down where the root of their fare evasion problems emerges.</p>

<p>Abstract: Novel Instance Detection and Segmentation (NIDS) aims at detecting and segmenting novel object instances given a few examples of each instance. We propose a unified framework (NIDS-Net) comprising object proposal generation, embedding creation for both instance templates and proposal regions, and embedding matching for instance label assignment. Leveraging recent advancements in large vision methods, we utilize the Grounding DINO and Segment Anything Model (SAM) to obtain object proposals with accurate bounding boxes and masks. Central to our approach is the generation of high-quality instance embeddings. We utilize foreground feature averages of patch embeddings from the DINOv2 ViT backbone, followed by refinement through a weight adapter mechanism that we introduce. We show experimentally that our weight adapter can adjust the embeddings locally within their feature space and effectively limit overfitting. This methodology enables a straightforward matching strategy, resulting in significant performance gains. Our framework surpasses current state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating notable improvements of 22.3, 46.2, 10.3, and 24.0 in average precision (AP) across four detection datasets. In instance segmentation tasks on seven core datasets of the BOP challenge, our method outperforms the top RGB methods by 3.6 AP and remains competitive with the best RGB-D method.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Xiao, Bohong Wu, Jiacong Wang, Chunyuan Li, Xun Zhou, Haoyuan Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing image-text modality alignment in Vision Language Models (VLMs) treats each text token equally in an autoregressive manner. Despite being simple and effective, this method results in sub-optimal cross-modal alignment by over-emphasizing the text tokens that are less correlated with or even contradictory with the input images. In this paper, we advocate for assigning distinct contributions for each text token based on its visual correlation. Specifically, we present by contrasting image inputs, the difference in prediction logits on each text token provides strong guidance of visual correlation. We therefore introduce Contrastive ALignment (CAL), a simple yet effective re-weighting strategy that prioritizes training visually correlated tokens. Our experimental results demonstrate that CAL consistently improves different types of VLMs across different resolutions and model sizes on various benchmark datasets. Importantly, our method incurs minimal additional computational overhead, rendering it highly efficient compared to alternative data scaling strategies.

<p>Abstract: Robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery benefits from enhancing dynamic scene reconstruction, as it improves surgical outcomes. While Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have been effective in scene reconstruction, their slow inference speeds and lengthy training durations limit their applicability. To overcome these limitations, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) based methods have emerged as a recent trend, offering rapid inference capabilities and superior 3D quality. However, these methods still struggle with under-reconstruction in both static and dynamic scenes. In this paper, we propose HFGS, a novel approach for deformable endoscopic reconstruction that addresses these challenges from spatial and temporal frequency perspectives. Our approach incorporates deformation fields to better handle dynamic scenes and introduces Spatial High-Frequency Emphasis Reconstruction (SHF) to minimize discrepancies in spatial frequency spectra between the rendered image and its ground truth. Additionally, we introduce Temporal High-Frequency Emphasis Reconstruction (THF) to enhance dynamic awareness in neural rendering by leveraging flow priors, focusing optimization on motion-intensive parts. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmarks demonstrate that HFGS achieves superior rendering quality. Our code will be available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianchen Zhao, Xuefei Ning, Tongcheng Fang, Enshu Liu, Guyue Huang, Zinan Lin, Shengen Yan, Guohao Dai, Yu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved significant visual generation quality. However, their significant computational and memory costs pose challenge for their application on resource-constrained mobile devices or even desktop GPUs. Recent few-step diffusion models reduces the inference time by reducing the denoising steps. However, their memory consumptions are still excessive. The Post Training Quantization (PTQ) replaces high bit-width FP representation with low-bit integer values (INT4/8) , which is an effective and efficient technique to reduce the memory cost. However, when applying to few-step diffusion models, existing quantization methods face challenges in preserving both the image quality and text alignment. To address this issue, we propose an mixed-precision quantization framework - MixDQ. Firstly, We design specialized BOS-aware quantization method for highly sensitive text embedding quantization. Then, we conduct metric-decoupled sensitivity analysis to measure the sensitivity of each layer. Finally, we develop an integer-programming-based method to conduct bit-width allocation. While existing quantization methods fall short at W8A8, MixDQ could achieve W8A8 without performance loss, and W4A8 with negligible visual degradation. Compared with FP16, we achieve 3-4x reduction in model size and memory cost, and 1.45x latency speedup.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingyuan Liu, Lu Xu, Shengnan Liu, Jicong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The success of Large Vision Models (LVMs) is accompanied by vast data volumes, which are prohibitively expensive in medical diagnosis.To address this, recent efforts exploit Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), which trains a small number of weights while freezing the rest.However, they typically assign trainable weights to the same positions in LVMs in a heuristic manner, regardless of task differences, making them suboptimal for professional applications like medical diagnosis.To address this, we statistically reveal the nature of sparsity and hybridity during diagnostic-targeted fine-tuning, i.e., a small portion of key weights significantly impacts performance, and these key weights are hybrid, including both task-specific and task-agnostic parts.Based on this, we propose a novel Sparsity- and Hybridity-inspired Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (SH-PEFT).It selects and trains a small portion of weights based on their importance, which is innovatively estimated by hybridizing both task-specific and task-agnostic strategies.Validated on six medical datasets of different modalities, we demonstrate that SH-PEFT achieves state-of-the-art performance in transferring LVMs to medical diagnosis in terms of accuracy. By tuning around 0.01% number of weights, it outperforms full model fine-tuning.Moreover, SH-PEFT also achieves comparable performance to other models deliberately optimized for specific medical tasks.Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of each design and reveal that large model transfer holds great potential in medical diagnosis.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graphomotor and handwriting disabilities (GD and HD, respectively) could significantly reduce children's quality of life. Effective remediation depends on proper diagnosis; however, current approaches to diagnosis and assessment of GD and HD have several limitations and knowledge gaps, e.g. they are subjective, they do not facilitate identification of specific manifestations, etc. The aim of this work is to introduce a new scale (GHDRS Graphomotor and Handwriting Disabilities Rating Scale) that will enable experts to perform objective and complex computeraided diagnosis and assessment of GD and HD. The scale supports quantification of 17 manifestations associated with the process/product of drawing/ handwriting. The whole methodology of GHDRS design is made maximally transparent so that it could be adapted for other languages.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17891">A Refined 3D Gaussian Representation for High-Quality Dynamic Scene Reconstruction</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Bin Zhang, Bi Zeng, Zexin Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) has revolutionized three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction with its implicit representation. Building upon NeRF, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has departed from the implicit representation of neural networks and instead directly represents scenes as point clouds with Gaussian-shaped distributions. While this shift has notably elevated the rendering quality and speed of radiance fields but inevitably led to a significant increase in memory usage. Additionally, effectively rendering dynamic scenes in 3D-GS has emerged as a pressing challenge. To address these concerns, this paper purposes a refined 3D Gaussian representation for high-quality dynamic scene reconstruction. Firstly, we use a deformable multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network to capture the dynamic offset of Gaussian points and express the color features of points through hash encoding and a tiny MLP to reduce storage requirements. Subsequently, we introduce a learnable denoising mask coupled with denoising loss to eliminate noise points from the scene, thereby further compressing 3D Gaussian model. Finally, motion noise of points is mitigated through static constraints and motion consistency constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses existing approaches in rendering quality and speed, while significantly reducing the memory usage associated with 3D-GS, making it highly suitable for various tasks such as novel view synthesis, and dynamic mapping.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruofan Wang, Xingjun Ma, Hanxu Zhou, Chuanjun Ji, Guangnan Ye, Yu-Gang Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have underscored their superiority in various multimodal tasks. However, the adversarial robustness of VLMs has not been fully explored. Existing methods mainly assess robustness through unimodal adversarial attacks that perturb images, while assuming inherent resilience against text-based attacks. Different from existing attacks, in this work we propose a more comprehensive strategy that jointly attacks both text and image modalities to exploit a broader spectrum of vulnerability within VLMs. Specifically, we propose a dual optimization objective aimed at guiding the model to generate affirmative responses with high toxicity. Our attack method begins by optimizing an adversarial image prefix from random noise to generate diverse harmful responses in the absence of text input, thus imbuing the image with toxic semantics. Subsequently, an adversarial text suffix is integrated and co-optimized with the adversarial image prefix to maximize the probability of eliciting affirmative responses to various harmful instructions. The discovered adversarial image prefix and text suffix are collectively denoted as a Universal Master Key (UMK). When integrated into various malicious queries, UMK can circumvent the alignment defenses of VLMs and lead to the generation of objectionable content, known as jailbreaks. The experimental results demonstrate that our universal attack strategy can effectively jailbreak MiniGPT-4 with a 96% success rate, highlighting the vulnerability of VLMs and the urgent need for new alignment strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Irem Ulku, O. Ozgur Tanriover, Erdem Akag\"und\"uz</p>
<p>Abstract: Plant health can be monitored dynamically using multispectral sensors that measure Near-Infrared reflectance (NIR). Despite this potential, obtaining and annotating high-resolution NIR images poses a significant challenge for training deep neural networks. Typically, large networks pre-trained on the RGB domain are utilized to fine-tune infrared images. This practice introduces a domain shift issue because of the differing visual traits between RGB and NIR images.As an alternative to fine-tuning, a method called low-rank adaptation (LoRA) enables more efficient training by optimizing rank-decomposition matrices while keeping the original network weights frozen. However, existing parameter-efficient adaptation strategies for remote sensing images focus on RGB images and overlook domain shift issues in the NIR domain. Therefore, this study investigates the potential benefits of using vision transformer (ViT) backbones pre-trained in the RGB domain, with low-rank adaptation for downstream tasks in the NIR domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that employing LoRA with pre-trained ViT backbones yields the best performance for downstream tasks applied to NIR images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongze Sun, Rui Liu, Wuque Cai, Jun Wang, Yue Wang, Huajin Tang, Yan Cui, Dezhong Yao, Daqing Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual object tracking, which is primarily based on visible light image sequences, encounters numerous challenges in complicated scenarios, such as low light conditions, high dynamic ranges, and background clutter. To address these challenges, incorporating the advantages of multiple visual modalities is a promising solution for achieving reliable object tracking. However, the existing approaches usually integrate multimodal inputs through adaptive local feature interactions, which cannot leverage the full potential of visual cues, thus resulting in insufficient feature modeling. In this study, we propose a novel multimodal hybrid tracker (MMHT) that utilizes frame-event-based data for reliable single object tracking. The MMHT model employs a hybrid backbone consisting of an artificial neural network (ANN) and a spiking neural network (SNN) to extract dominant features from different visual modalities and then uses a unified encoder to align the features across different domains. Moreover, we propose an enhanced transformer-based module to fuse multimodal features using attention mechanisms. With these methods, the MMHT model can effectively construct a multiscale and multidimensional visual feature space and achieve discriminative feature modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the MMHT model exhibits competitive performance in comparison with that of other state-of-the-art methods. Overall, our results highlight the effectiveness of the MMHT model in terms of addressing the challenges faced in visual object tracking tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengji Li, Xi Xiao, Jiacheng Xie, Yuxiao Fan, Wentao Wang, Gang Chen, Liqiang Zhang, Tianyang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: With the development of modern society, traffic volume continues to increase in most countries worldwide, leading to an increase in the rate of pavement damage Therefore, the real-time and highly accurate pavement damage detection and maintenance have become the current need. In this paper, an enhanced pavement damage detection method with CycleGAN and improved YOLOv5 algorithm is presented. We selected 7644 self-collected images of pavement damage samples as the initial dataset and augmented it by CycleGAN. Due to a substantial difference between the images generated by CycleGAN and real road images, we proposed a data enhancement method based on an improved Scharr filter, CycleGAN, and Laplacian pyramid. To improve the target recognition effect on a complex background and solve the problem that the spatial pyramid pooling-fast module in the YOLOv5 network cannot handle multiscale targets, we introduced the convolutional block attention module attention mechanism and proposed the atrous spatial pyramid pooling with squeeze-and-excitation structure. In addition, we optimized the loss function of YOLOv5 by replacing the CIoU with EIoU. The experimental results showed that our algorithm achieved a precision of 0.872, recall of 0.854, and mean average precision@0.5 of 0.882 in detecting three main types of pavement damage: cracks, potholes, and patching. On the GPU, its frames per second reached 68, meeting the requirements for real-time detection. Its overall performance even exceeded the current more advanced YOLOv7 and achieved good results in practical applications, providing a basis for decision-making in pavement damage detection and prevention.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junjie Wang, Bin Chen, Bin Kang, Yulin Li, YiChi Chen, Weizhi Xian, Huifeng Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Detection (OVD) aims to detect objects from novel categories beyond the base categories on which the detector is trained. However, existing open-vocabulary detectors trained on known category data tend to assign higher confidence to trained categories and confuse novel categories with background. To resolve this, we propose OV-DQUO, an \textbf{O}pen-\textbf{V}ocabulary DETR with \textbf{D}enoising text \textbf{Q}uery training and open-world \textbf{U}nknown \textbf{O}bjects supervision. Specifically, we introduce a wildcard matching method that enables the detector to learn from pairs of unknown objects recognized by the open-world detector and text embeddings with general semantics, mitigating the confidence bias between base and novel categories. Additionally, we propose a denoising text query training strategy that synthesizes additional noisy query-box pairs from open-world unknown objects to trains the detector through contrastive learning, enhancing its ability to distinguish novel objects from the background. We conducted extensive experiments on the challenging OV-COCO and OV-LVIS benchmarks, achieving new state-of-the-art results of 45.6 AP50 and 39.3 mAP on novel categories respectively, without the need for additional training data.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leo Shan Wenzhang Zhou Grace Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Image matting aims to obtain an alpha matte that separates foreground objects from the background accurately. Recently, trimap-free matting has been well studied because it requires only the original image without any extra input. Such methods usually extract a rough foreground by itself to take place trimap as further guidance. However, the definition of 'foreground' lacks a unified standard and thus ambiguities arise. Besides, the extracted foreground is sometimes incomplete due to inadequate network design. Most importantly, there is not a large-scale real-world matting dataset, and current trimap-free methods trained with synthetic images suffer from large domain shift problems in practice. In this paper, we define the salient object as foreground, which is consistent with human cognition and annotations of the current matting dataset. Meanwhile, data and technologies in salient object detection can be transferred to matting in a breeze. To obtain a more accurate and complete alpha matte, we propose a network called \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{F}eature fusion-based \textbf{C}oarse-to-fine Network \textbf{(MFC-Net)}, which fully integrates multiple features for an accurate and complete alpha matte. Furthermore, we introduce image harmony in data composition to bridge the gap between synthetic and real images. More importantly, we establish the largest general matting dataset \textbf{(Real-19k)} in the real world to date. Experiments show that our method is significantly effective on both synthetic and real-world images, and the performance in the real-world dataset is far better than existing matting-free methods. Our code and data will be released soon.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17926">SarcNet: A Novel AI-based Framework to Automatically Analyze and Score Sarcomere Organizations in Fluorescently Tagged hiPSC-CMs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Huyen Le, Khiet Dang, Tien Lai, Nhung Nguyen, Mai Tran, Hieu Pham</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantifying sarcomere structure organization in human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) is crucial for understanding cardiac disease pathology, improving drug screening, and advancing regenerative medicine. Traditional methods, such as manual annotation and Fourier transform analysis, are labor-intensive, error-prone, and lack high-throughput capabilities. In this study, we present a novel deep learning-based framework that leverages cell images and integrates cell features to automatically evaluate the sarcomere structure of hiPSC-CMs from the onset of differentiation. This framework overcomes the limitations of traditional methods through automated, high-throughput analysis, providing consistent, reliable results while accurately detecting complex sarcomere patterns across diverse samples. The proposed framework contains the SarcNet, a linear layers-added ResNet-18 module, to output a continuous score ranging from one to five that captures the level of sarcomere structure organization. It is trained and validated on an open-source dataset of hiPSC-CMs images with the endogenously GFP-tagged alpha-actinin-2 structure developed by the Allen Institute for Cell Science (AICS). SarcNet achieves a Spearman correlation of 0.831 with expert evaluations, demonstrating superior performance and an improvement of 0.075 over the current state-of-the-art approach, which uses Linear Regression. Our results also show a consistent pattern of increasing organization from day 18 to day 32 of differentiation, aligning with expert evaluations. By integrating the quantitative features calculated directly from the images with the visual features learned during the deep learning model, our framework offers a more comprehensive and accurate assessment, thereby enhancing the further utility of hiPSC-CMs in medical research and therapy development.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper addresses image copy detection, a task in online sharing platforms for copyright protection. While previous approaches have performed exceptionally well, the large size of their networks and descriptors remains a significant disadvantage, complicating their practical application. In this paper, we propose a novel method that achieves a competitive performance by using a lightweight network and compact descriptors. By utilizing relational self-supervised distillation to transfer knowledge from a large network to a small network, we enable the training of lightweight networks with a small descriptor size. Our approach, which we call Relational selfsupervised Distillation with Compact Descriptors (RDCD), introduces relational self-supervised distillation (RSD) for flexible representation in a smaller feature space and applies contrastive learning with a hard negative (HN) loss to prevent dimensional collapse. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using the DISC2021, Copydays, and NDEC benchmark datasets, with which our lightweight network with compact descriptors achieves a competitive performance. For the DISC2021 benchmark, ResNet-50/EfficientNet- B0 are used as a teacher and student respectively, the micro average precision improved by 5.0%/4.9%/5.9% for 64/128/256 descriptor sizes compared to the baseline method.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17929">Towards Unified Robustness Against Both Backdoor and Adversarial Attacks</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenxing Niu, Yuyao Sun, Qiguang Miao, Rong Jin, Gang Hua</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are known to be vulnerable to both backdoor and adversarial attacks. In the literature, these two types of attacks are commonly treated as distinct robustness problems and solved separately, since they belong to training-time and inference-time attacks respectively. However, this paper revealed that there is an intriguing connection between them: (1) planting a backdoor into a model will significantly affect the model's adversarial examples; (2) for an infected model, its adversarial examples have similar features as the triggered images. Based on these observations, a novel Progressive Unified Defense (PUD) algorithm is proposed to defend against backdoor and adversarial attacks simultaneously. Specifically, our PUD has a progressive model purification scheme to jointly erase backdoors and enhance the model's adversarial robustness. At the early stage, the adversarial examples of infected models are utilized to erase backdoors. With the backdoor gradually erased, our model purification can naturally turn into a stage to boost the model's robustness against adversarial attacks. Besides, our PUD algorithm can effectively identify poisoned images, which allows the initial extra dataset not to be completely clean. Extensive experimental results show that, our discovered connection between backdoor and adversarial attacks is ubiquitous, no matter what type of backdoor attack. The proposed PUD outperforms the state-of-the-art backdoor defense, including the model repairing-based and data filtering-based methods. Besides, it also has the ability to compete with the most advanced adversarial defense methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce ToonCrafter, a novel approach that transcends traditional correspondence-based cartoon video interpolation, paving the way for generative interpolation. Traditional methods, that implicitly assume linear motion and the absence of complicated phenomena like dis-occlusion, often struggle with the exaggerated non-linear and large motions with occlusion commonly found in cartoons, resulting in implausible or even failed interpolation results. To overcome these limitations, we explore the potential of adapting live-action video priors to better suit cartoon interpolation within a generative framework. ToonCrafter effectively addresses the challenges faced when applying live-action video motion priors to generative cartoon interpolation. First, we design a toon rectification learning strategy that seamlessly adapts live-action video priors to the cartoon domain, resolving the domain gap and content leakage issues. Next, we introduce a dual-reference-based 3D decoder to compensate for lost details due to the highly compressed latent prior spaces, ensuring the preservation of fine details in interpolation results. Finally, we design a flexible sketch encoder that empowers users with interactive control over the interpolation results. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method not only produces visually convincing and more natural dynamics, but also effectively handles dis-occlusion. The comparative evaluation demonstrates the notable superiority of our approach over existing competitors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaohao Xu, Tianyi Zhang, Jinrong Yang, Matthew Johnson-Roberson, Xiaonan Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: In autonomous driving, multi-modal perception models leveraging inputs from multiple sensors exhibit strong robustness in degraded environments. However, these models face challenges in efficiently and effectively transferring learned representations across different modalities and tasks. This paper presents NeRF-Supervised Masked Auto Encoder (NS-MAE), a self-supervised pre-training paradigm for transferable multi-modal representation learning. NS-MAE is designed to provide pre-trained model initializations for efficient and high-performance fine-tuning. Our approach uses masked multi-modal reconstruction in neural radiance fields (NeRF), training the model to reconstruct missing or corrupted input data across multiple modalities. Specifically, multi-modal embeddings are extracted from corrupted LiDAR point clouds and images, conditioned on specific view directions and locations. These embeddings are then rendered into projected multi-modal feature maps using neural rendering techniques. The original multi-modal signals serve as reconstruction targets for the rendered feature maps, facilitating self-supervised representation learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the promising transferability of NS-MAE representations across diverse multi-modal and single-modal perception models. This transferability is evaluated on various 3D perception downstream tasks, such as 3D object detection and BEV map segmentation, using different amounts of fine-tuning labeled data. Our code will be released to support the community.</p>

<p>Abstract: Empowering 3D Gaussian Splatting with generalization ability is appealing. However, existing generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting methods are largely confined to narrow-range interpolation between stereo images due to their heavy backbones, thus lacking the ability to accurately localize 3D Gaussian and support free-view synthesis across wide view range. In this paper, we present a novel framework FreeSplat that is capable of reconstructing geometrically consistent 3D scenes from long sequence input towards free-view synthesis.Specifically, we firstly introduce Low-cost Cross-View Aggregation achieved by constructing adaptive cost volumes among nearby views and aggregating features using a multi-scale structure. Subsequently, we present the Pixel-wise Triplet Fusion to eliminate redundancy of 3D Gaussians in overlapping view regions and to aggregate features observed across multiple views. Additionally, we propose a simple but effective free-view training strategy that ensures robust view synthesis across broader view range regardless of the number of views. Our empirical results demonstrate state-of-the-art novel view synthesis peformances in both novel view rendered color maps quality and depth maps accuracy across different numbers of input views. We also show that FreeSplat performs inference more efficiently and can effectively reduce redundant Gaussians, offering the possibility of feed-forward large scene reconstruction without depth priors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junjie Shentu, Matthew Watson, Noura Al Moubayed</p>
<p>Abstract: With the unprecedented performance being achieved by text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, T2I customization further empowers users to tailor the diffusion model to new concepts absent in the pre-training dataset, termed subject-driven generation. Moreover, extracting several new concepts from a single image enables the model to learn multiple concepts, and simultaneously decreases the difficulties of training data preparation, urging the disentanglement of multiple concepts to be a new challenge. However, existing models for disentanglement commonly require pre-determined masks or retain background elements. To this end, we propose an attention-guided method, AttenCraft, for multiple concept disentanglement. In particular, our method leverages self-attention and cross-attention maps to create accurate masks for each concept within a single initialization step, omitting any required mask preparation by humans or other models. The created masks are then applied to guide the cross-attention activation of each target concept during training and achieve concept disentanglement. Additionally, we introduce Uniform sampling and Reweighted sampling schemes to alleviate the non-synchronicity of feature acquisition from different concepts, and improve generation quality. Our method outperforms baseline models in terms of image-alignment, and behaves comparably on text-alignment. Finally, we showcase the applicability of AttenCraft to more complicated settings, such as an input image containing three concepts.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Roy Miles, Pradyumna Reddy, Ismail Elezi, Jiankang Deng</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently emerged as powerful tools for tackling many language-processing tasks. Despite their success, training and fine-tuning these models is still far too computationally and memory intensive. In this paper, we identify and characterise the important components needed for effective model convergence using gradient descent. In doing so we find that the intermediate activations used to implement backpropagation can be excessively compressed without incurring any degradation in performance. This result leads us to a cheap and memory-efficient algorithm for both fine-tuning and pre-training LLMs. The proposed algorithm simply divides the tokens up into smaller sub-tokens before projecting them onto a fixed 1-dimensional subspace during the forward pass. These features are then coarsely reconstructed during the backward pass to implement the update rules. We confirm the effectiveness of our algorithm as being complimentary to many state-of-the-art PEFT methods on the VTAB-1k fine-tuning benchmark. Furthermore, we outperform QLoRA for fine-tuning LLaMA and show competitive performance against other memory-efficient pre-training methods on the large-scale C4 dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract: The joint-embedding predictive architecture (JEPA) recently has shown impressive results in extracting visual representations from unlabeled imagery under a masking strategy. However, we reveal its disadvantages, notably its insufficient understanding of local semantics. This deficiency originates from masked modeling in the embedding space, resulting in a reduction of discriminative power and can even lead to the neglect of critical local semantics. To bridge this gap, we introduce DMT-JEPA, a novel masked modeling objective rooted in JEPA, specifically designed to generate discriminative latent targets from neighboring information. Our key idea is simple: we consider a set of semantically similar neighboring patches as a target of a masked patch. To be specific, the proposed DMT-JEPA (a) computes feature similarities between each masked patch and its corresponding neighboring patches to select patches having semantically meaningful relations, and (b) employs lightweight cross-attention heads to aggregate features of neighboring patches as the masked targets. Consequently, DMT-JEPA demonstrates strong discriminative power, offering benefits across a diverse spectrum of downstream tasks. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate our effectiveness across various visual benchmarks, including ImageNet-1K image classification, ADE20K semantic segmentation, and COCO object detection tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bowen Zhang, Xiaofei Xie, Haotian Lu, Na Ma, Tianlin Li, Qing Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion-based video generation has achieved significant progress, yet generating multiple actions that occur sequentially remains a formidable task. Directly generating a video with sequential actions can be extremely challenging due to the scarcity of fine-grained action annotations and the difficulty in establishing temporal semantic correspondences and maintaining long-term consistency. To tackle this, we propose an intuitive and straightforward solution: splicing multiple single-action video segments sequentially. The core challenge lies in generating smooth and natural transitions between these segments given the inherent complexity and variability of action transitions. We introduce MAVIN (Multi-Action Video INfilling model), designed to generate transition videos that seamlessly connect two given videos, forming a cohesive integrated sequence. MAVIN incorporates several innovative techniques to address challenges in the transition video infilling task. Firstly, a consecutive noising strategy coupled with variable-length sampling is employed to handle large infilling gaps and varied generation lengths. Secondly, boundary frame guidance (BFG) is proposed to address the lack of semantic guidance during transition generation. Lastly, a Gaussian filter mixer (GFM) dynamically manages noise initialization during inference, mitigating train-test discrepancy while preserving generation flexibility. Additionally, we introduce a new metric, CLIP-RS (CLIP Relative Smoothness), to evaluate temporal coherence and smoothness, complementing traditional quality-based metrics. Experimental results on horse and tiger scenarios demonstrate MAVIN's superior performance in generating smooth and coherent video transitions compared to existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juexiao Zhou, Liyuan Sun, Yan Xu, Wenbin Liu, Shawn Afvari, Zhongyi Han, Jiaoyan Song, Yongzhi Ji, Xiaonan He, Xin Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: With the widespread application of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly deep learning (DL) and vision-based large language models (VLLMs), in skin disease diagnosis, the need for interpretability becomes crucial. However, existing dermatology datasets are limited in their inclusion of concept-level meta-labels, and none offer rich medical descriptions in natural language. This deficiency impedes the advancement of LLM-based methods in dermatological diagnosis. To address this gap and provide a meticulously annotated dermatology dataset with comprehensive natural language descriptions, we introduce SkinCAP: a multi-modal dermatology dataset annotated with rich medical captions. SkinCAP comprises 4,000 images sourced from the Fitzpatrick 17k skin disease dataset and the Diverse Dermatology Images dataset, annotated by board-certified dermatologists to provide extensive medical descriptions and captions. Notably, SkinCAP represents the world's first such dataset and is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/joshuachou/SkinCAP.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Adi Nugroho, Sangmin Woo, Sumin Lee, Jinyoung Park, Yooseung Wang, Donguk Kim, Changick Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Weakly-Supervised Group Activity Recognition (WSGAR) aims to understand the activity performed together by a group of individuals with the video-level label and without actor-level labels. We propose Flow-Assisted Motion Learning Network (Flaming-Net) for WSGAR, which consists of the motion-aware actor encoder to extract actor features and the two-pathways relation module to infer the interaction among actors and their activity. Flaming-Net leverages an additional optical flow modality in the training stage to enhance its motion awareness when finding locally active actors. The first pathway of the relation module, the actor-centric path, initially captures the temporal dynamics of individual actors and then constructs inter-actor relationships. In parallel, the group-centric path starts by building spatial connections between actors within the same timeframe and then captures simultaneous spatio-temporal dynamics among them. We demonstrate that Flaming-Net achieves new state-of-the-art WSGAR results on two benchmarks, including a 2.8%p higher MPCA score on the NBA dataset. Importantly, we use the optical flow modality only for training and not for inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Felix Seegr\"aber, Mengkun She, Felix Woelk, Kevin K\"oser</p>
<p>Abstract: Many underwater robotic applications relying on vision sensors require proper camera calibration, i.e. knowing the incoming light ray for each pixel in the image. While for the ideal pinhole camera model all viewing rays intersect in a single 3D point, underwater cameras suffer from - possibly multiple - refractions of light rays at the interfaces of water, glass and air. These changes of direction depend on the position and orientation of the camera inside the water-proof housing, as well as on the shape and properties of the optical window, the port, itself. In recent years explicit models for underwater vision behind common ports such as flat or dome port have been proposed, but the underwater community is still lacking a calibration tool which can determine port parameters through refractive calibration. With this work we provide the first open source implementation of an underwater refractive camera calibration toolbox. It allows end-to-end calibration of underwater vision systems, including camera, stereo and housing calibration for systems with dome or flat ports. The implementation is verified using rendered datasets and real-world experiments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite the increasing interest in enhancing perception systems for autonomous vehicles, the online calibration between event cameras and LiDAR - two sensors pivotal in capturing comprehensive environmental information - remains unexplored. We introduce MULi-Ev, the first online, deep learning-based framework tailored for the extrinsic calibration of event cameras with LiDAR. This advancement is instrumental for the seamless integration of LiDAR and event cameras, enabling dynamic, real-time calibration adjustments that are essential for maintaining optimal sensor alignment amidst varying operational conditions. Rigorously evaluated against the real-world scenarios presented in the DSEC dataset, MULi-Ev not only achieves substantial improvements in calibration accuracy but also sets a new standard for integrating LiDAR with event cameras in mobile platforms. Our findings reveal the potential of MULi-Ev to bolster the safety, reliability, and overall performance of event-based perception systems in autonomous driving, marking a significant step forward in their real-world deployment and effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dvir Samuel, Rami Ben-Ari, Matan Levy, Nir Darshan, Gal Chechik</p>
<p>Abstract: Personalized retrieval and segmentation aim to locate specific instances within a dataset based on an input image and a short description of the reference instance. While supervised methods are effective, they require extensive labeled data for training. Recently, self-supervised foundation models have been introduced to these tasks showing comparable results to supervised methods. However, a significant flaw in these models is evident: they struggle to locate a desired instance when other instances within the same class are presented. In this paper, we explore text-to-image diffusion models for these tasks. Specifically, we propose a novel approach called PDM for Personalized Features Diffusion Matching, that leverages intermediate features of pre-trained text-to-image models for personalization tasks without any additional training. PDM demonstrates superior performance on popular retrieval and segmentation benchmarks, outperforming even supervised methods. We also highlight notable shortcomings in current instance and segmentation datasets and propose new benchmarks for these tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zebin You, Xinyu Zhang, Hanzhong Guo, Jingdong Wang, Chongxuan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The ultimate goal of generative models is to characterize the data distribution perfectly. For image generation, common metrics of visual quality (e.g., FID), and the truthlikeness of generated images to the human eyes seem to suggest that we are close to achieving it. However, through distribution classification tasks, we find that, in the eyes of classifiers parameterized by neural networks, the strongest diffusion models are still far from this goal. Specifically, classifiers consistently and effortlessly distinguish between real and generated images in various settings. Further, we observe an intriguing discrepancy: classifiers can identify differences between diffusion models with similar performance (e.g., U-ViT-H vs. DiT-XL), but struggle to differentiate between the smallest and largest models in the same family (e.g., EDM2-XS vs. EDM2-XXL), whereas humans exhibit the opposite tendency. As an explanation, our comprehensive empirical study suggests that, unlike humans, classifiers tend to classify images through edge and high-frequency components. We believe that our methodology can serve as a probe to understand how generative models work and inspire further thought on how existing models can be improved and how the abuse of such models can be prevented.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mihnea-Bogdan Jurca, Remco Royen, Ion Giosan, Adrian Munteanu</p>
<p>Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has revolutionized the world of novel view synthesis by achieving high rendering performance in real-time. Recently, studies have focused on enriching these 3D representations with semantic information for downstream tasks. In this paper, we introduce RT-GS2, the first generalizable semantic segmentation method employing Gaussian Splatting. While existing Gaussian Splatting-based approaches rely on scene-specific training, RT-GS2 demonstrates the ability to generalize to unseen scenes. Our method adopts a new approach by first extracting view-independent 3D Gaussian features in a self-supervised manner, followed by a novel View-Dependent / View-Independent (VDVI) feature fusion to enhance semantic consistency over different views. Extensive experimentation on three different datasets showcases RT-GS2's superiority over the state-of-the-art methods in semantic segmentation quality, exemplified by a 8.01% increase in mIoU on the Replica dataset. Moreover, our method achieves real-time performance of 27.03 FPS, marking an astonishing 901 times speedup compared to existing approaches. This work represents a significant advancement in the field by introducing, to the best of our knowledge, the first real-time generalizable semantic segmentation method for 3D Gaussian representations of radiance fields.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youngwan Lee, Jeffrey Ryan Willette, Jonghee Kim, Sung Ju Hwang</p>
<p>Abstract: The Masked autoencoder (MAE) has drawn attention as a representative self-supervised approach for masked image modeling with vision transformers. However, even though MAE shows better generalization capability than fully supervised training from scratch, the reason why has not been explored. In another line of work, the Reconstruction Consistent Masked Auto Encoder (RC-MAE), has been proposed which adopts a self-distillation scheme in the form of an exponential moving average (EMA) teacher into MAE, and it has been shown that the EMA-teacher performs a conditional gradient correction during optimization. To further investigate the reason for better generalization of the self-supervised ViT when trained by MAE (MAE-ViT) and the effect of the gradient correction of RC-MAE from the perspective of optimization, we visualize the loss landscapes of the self-supervised vision transformer by both MAE and RC-MAE and compare them with the supervised ViT (Sup-ViT). Unlike previous loss landscape visualizations of neural networks based on classification task loss, we visualize the loss landscape of ViT by computing pre-training task loss. Through the lens of loss landscapes, we find two interesting observations: (1) MAE-ViT has a smoother and wider overall loss curvature than Sup-ViT. (2) The EMA-teacher allows MAE to widen the region of convexity in both pretraining and linear probing, leading to quicker convergence. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to investigate the self-supervised ViT through the lens of the loss landscape.</p>

<p>Abstract: The task of Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is to predict the location of a query image from a database of geo-tagged images. Recent studies in VPR have highlighted the significant advantage of employing pre-trained foundation models like DINOv2 for the VPR task. However, these models are often deemed inadequate for VPR without further fine-tuning on task-specific data. In this paper, we propose a simple yet powerful approach to better exploit the potential of a foundation model for VPR. We first demonstrate that features extracted from self-attention layers can serve as a powerful re-ranker for VPR. Utilizing these features in a zero-shot manner, our method surpasses previous zero-shot methods and achieves competitive results compared to supervised methods across multiple datasets. Subsequently, we demonstrate that a single-stage method leveraging internal ViT layers for pooling can generate global features that achieve state-of-the-art results, even when reduced to a dimensionality as low as 128D. Nevertheless, incorporating our local foundation features for re-ranking, expands this gap. Our approach further demonstrates remarkable robustness and generalization, achieving state-of-the-art results, with a significant gap, in challenging scenarios, involving occlusion, day-night variations, and seasonal changes.</p>

<p>Abstract: The widespread use of diffusion methods enables the creation of highly realistic images on demand, thereby posing significant risks to the integrity and safety of online information and highlighting the necessity of DeepFake detection. Our analysis of features extracted by traditional image encoders reveals that both low-level and high-level features offer distinct advantages in identifying DeepFake images produced by various diffusion methods. Inspired by this finding, we aim to develop an effective representation that captures both low-level and high-level features to detect diffusion-based DeepFakes. To address the problem, we propose a text modality-oriented feature extraction method, termed TOFE. Specifically, for a given target image, the representation we discovered is a corresponding text embedding that can guide the generation of the target image with a specific text-to-image model. Experiments conducted across ten diffusion types demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lianlei Shan, Weiqiang Wang, Ke Lv, Bin Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Semantic segmentation requires pixel-level annotation, which is time-consuming. Active Learning (AL) is a promising method for reducing data annotation costs. Due to the gap between aerial and natural images, the previous AL methods are not ideal, mainly caused by unreasonable labeling units and the neglect of class imbalance. Previous labeling units are based on images or regions, which does not consider the characteristics of segmentation tasks and aerial images, i.e., the segmentation network often makes mistakes in the edge region, and the edge of aerial images is often interlaced and irregular. Therefore, an edge-guided labeling unit is proposed and supplemented as the new unit. On the other hand, the class imbalance is severe, manifested in two aspects: the aerial image is seriously imbalanced, and the AL strategy does not fully consider the class balance. Both seriously affect the performance of AL in aerial images. We comprehensively ensure class balance from all steps that may occur imbalance, including initial labeled data, subsequent labeled data, and pseudo-labels. Through the two improvements, our method achieves more than 11.2\% gains compared to state-of-the-art methods on three benchmark datasets, Deepglobe, Potsdam, and Vaihingen, and more than 18.6\% gains compared to the baseline. Sufficient ablation studies show that every module is indispensable. Furthermore, we establish a fair and strong benchmark for future research on AL for aerial image segmentation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lea Bogensperger, Dominik Narnhofer, Alexander Falk, Konrad Schindler, Thomas Pock</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a crucial task that relies on the ability to accurately identify and isolate regions of interest in medical images. Thereby, generative approaches allow to capture the statistical properties of segmentation masks that are dependent on the respective structures. In this work we propose FlowSDF, an image-guided conditional flow matching framework to represent the signed distance function (SDF) leading to an implicit distribution of segmentation masks. The advantage of leveraging the SDF is a more natural distortion when compared to that of binary masks. By learning a vector field that is directly related to the probability path of a conditional distribution of SDFs, we can accurately sample from the distribution of segmentation masks, allowing for the evaluation of statistical quantities. Thus, this probabilistic representation allows for the generation of uncertainty maps represented by the variance, which can aid in further analysis and enhance the predictive robustness. We qualitatively and quantitatively illustrate competitive performance of the proposed method on a public nuclei and gland segmentation data set, highlighting its utility in medical image segmentation applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Cheng, Hongrui Ye, Xiao Wen, Jiachen Zhang, Jiping Xu, Feifan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning has significantly improved the accuracy of crop classification using multispectral temporal data. However, these models have complex structures with numerous parameters, requiring large amounts of data and costly training. In low-resource situations with fewer labeled samples, deep learning models perform poorly due to insufficient data. Conversely, compressors are data-type agnostic, and non-parametric methods do not bring underlying assumptions. Inspired by this insight, we propose a non-training alternative to deep learning models, aiming to address these situations. Specifically, the Symbolic Representation Module is proposed to convert the reflectivity into symbolic representations. The symbolic representations are then cross-transformed in both the channel and time dimensions to generate symbolic embeddings. Next, the Multi-scale Normalised Compression Distance (MNCD) is designed to measure the correlation between any two symbolic embeddings. Finally, based on the MNCDs, high quality crop classification can be achieved using only a k-nearest-neighbor classifier kNN. The entire framework is ready-to-use and lightweight. Without any training, it outperformed, on average, 7 advanced deep learning models trained at scale on three benchmark datasets. It also outperforms more than half of these models in the few-shot setting with sparse crop labels. Therefore, the high performance and robustness of our non-training framework makes it truly applicable to real-world crop mapping.

<p>Abstract: Despite the superiority of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers in single-image rain removal, current multi-scale models still face significant challenges due to their reliance on single-scale feature pyramid patterns. In this paper, we propose an effective rain removal method, the dual-path multi-scale Transformer (DPMformer) for high-quality image reconstruction by leveraging rich multi-scale information. This method consists of a backbone path and two branch paths from two different multi-scale approaches. Specifically, one path adopts the coarse-to-fine strategy, progressively downsampling the image to 1/2 and 1/4 scales, which helps capture fine-scale potential rain information fusion. Simultaneously, we employ the multi-patch stacked model (non-overlapping blocks of size 2 and 4) to enrich the feature information of the deep network in the other path. To learn a richer blend of features, the backbone path fully utilizes the multi-scale information to achieve high-quality rain removal image reconstruction. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves promising performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Learning-based isosurface extraction methods have recently emerged as a robust and efficient alternative to axiomatic techniques. However, the vast majority of such approaches rely on supervised training with axiomatically computed ground truths, thus potentially inheriting biases and data artifacts of the corresponding axiomatic methods. Steering away from such dependencies, we propose a self-supervised training scheme for the Neural Dual Contouring meshing framework, resulting in our method: Self-Supervised Dual Contouring (SDC). Instead of optimizing predicted mesh vertices with supervised training, we use two novel self-supervised loss functions that encourage the consistency between distances to the generated mesh up to the first order. Meshes reconstructed by SDC surpass existing data-driven methods in capturing intricate details while being more robust to possible irregularities in the input. Furthermore, we use the same self-supervised training objective linking inferred mesh and input SDF, to regularize the training process of Deep Implicit Networks (DINs). We demonstrate that the resulting DINs produce higher-quality implicit functions, ultimately leading to more accurate and detail-preserving surfaces compared to prior baselines for different input modalities. Finally, we demonstrate that our self-supervised losses improve meshing performance in the single-view reconstruction task by enabling joint training of predicted SDF and resulting output mesh.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qi Sun, Zhiyang Guo, Ziyu Wan, Jing Nathan Yan, Shengming Yin, Wengang Zhou, Jing Liao, Houqiang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, the increasing demand for dynamic 3D assets in design and gaming applications has given rise to powerful generative pipelines capable of synthesizing high-quality 4D objects. Previous methods generally rely on score distillation sampling (SDS) algorithm to infer the unseen views and motion of 4D objects, thus leading to unsatisfactory results with defects like over-saturation and Janus problem. Therefore, inspired by recent progress of video diffusion models, we propose to optimize a 4D representation by explicitly generating multi-view videos from one input image. However, it is far from trivial to handle practical challenges faced by such a pipeline, including dramatic temporal inconsistency, inter-frame geometry and texture diversity, and semantic defects brought by video generation results. To address these issues, we propose DG4D, a novel multi-stage framework that generates high-quality and consistent 4D assets without score distillation. Specifically, collaborative techniques and solutions are developed, including an attention injection strategy to synthesize temporal-consistent multi-view videos, a robust and efficient dynamic reconstruction method based on Gaussian Splatting, and a refinement stage with diffusion prior for semantic restoration. The qualitative results and user preference study demonstrate that our framework outperforms the baselines in generation quality by a considerable margin.

<p><b>Authors:</b> JuneHyoung Kwon, Eunju Lee, Yunsung Cho, YoungBin Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) employing weak forms of labels has been actively studied to alleviate the annotation cost of acquiring pixel-level labels. However, classifiers trained on biased datasets tend to exploit shortcut features and make predictions based on spurious correlations between certain backgrounds and objects, leading to a poor generalization performance. In this paper, we propose shortcut mitigating augmentation (SMA) for WSSS, which generates synthetic representations of object-background combinations not seen in the training data to reduce the use of shortcut features. Our approach disentangles the object-relevant and background features. We then shuffle and combine the disentangled representations to create synthetic features of diverse object-background combinations. SMA-trained classifier depends less on contexts and focuses more on the target object when making predictions. In addition, we analyzed the behavior of the classifier on shortcut usage after applying our augmentation using an attribution method-based metric.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qilin Wang, Zhengkai Jiang, Chengming Xu, Jiangning Zhang, Yabiao Wang, Xinyi Zhang, Yun Cao, Weijian Cao, Chengjie Wang, Yanwei Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: Human image animation involves generating a video from a static image by following a specified pose sequence. Current approaches typically adopt a multi-stage pipeline that separately learns appearance and motion, which often leads to appearance degradation and temporal inconsistencies. To address these issues, we propose VividPose, an innovative end-to-end pipeline based on Stable Video Diffusion (SVD) that ensures superior temporal stability. To enhance the retention of human identity, we propose an identity-aware appearance controller that integrates additional facial information without compromising other appearance details such as clothing texture and background. This approach ensures that the generated videos maintain high fidelity to the identity of human subject, preserving key facial features across various poses. To accommodate diverse human body shapes and hand movements, we introduce a geometry-aware pose controller that utilizes both dense rendering maps from SMPL-X and sparse skeleton maps. This enables accurate alignment of pose and shape in the generated videos, providing a robust framework capable of handling a wide range of body shapes and dynamic hand movements. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on the UBCFashion and TikTok benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, VividPose exhibits superior generalization capabilities on our proposed in-the-wild dataset. Codes and models will be available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhan Li, Hao Zhou, Wenxiang Shang, Ran Lin, Xuanhong Chen, Bingbing Ni</p>
<p>Abstract: While image-based virtual try-on has made significant strides, emerging approaches still fall short of delivering high-fidelity and robust fitting images across various scenarios, as their models suffer from issues of ill-fitted garment styles and quality degrading during the training process, not to mention the lack of support for various combinations of attire. Therefore, we first propose a lightweight, scalable, operator known as Hydra Block for attire combinations. This is achieved through a parallel attention mechanism that facilitates the feature injection of multiple garments from conditionally encoded branches into the main network. Secondly, to significantly enhance the model's robustness and expressiveness in real-world scenarios, we evolve its potential across diverse settings by synthesizing the residuals of multiple models, as well as implementing a mask region boost strategy to overcome the instability caused by information leakage in existing models. Equipped with the above design, AnyFit surpasses all baselines on high-resolution benchmarks and real-world data by a large gap, excelling in producing well-fitting garments replete with photorealistic and rich details. Furthermore, AnyFit's impressive performance on high-fidelity virtual try-ons in any scenario from any image, paves a new path for future research within the fashion community.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yitao Zhao, Turgay Celik, Nanqing Liu, Feng Gao, Heng-Chao Li</p>
<p>Abstract: In conventional remote sensing change detection (RS CD) procedures, extensive manual labeling for bi-temporal images is first required to maintain the performance of subsequent fully supervised training. However, pixel-level labeling for CD tasks is very complex and time-consuming. In this paper, we explore a novel self-supervised contrastive framework applicable to the RS CD task, which promotes the model to accurately capture spatial, structural, and semantic information through domain adapter and hierarchical contrastive head. The proposed SSLChange framework accomplishes self-learning only by taking a single-temporal sample and can be flexibly transferred to main-stream CD baselines. With self-supervised contrastive learning, feature representation pre-training can be performed directly based on the original data even without labeling. After a certain amount of labels are subsequently obtained, the pre-trained features will be aligned with the labels for fully supervised fine-tuning. Without introducing any additional data or labels, the performance of downstream baselines will experience a significant enhancement. Experimental results on 2 entire datasets and 6 diluted datasets show that our proposed SSLChange improves the performance and stability of CD baseline in data-limited situations. The code of SSLChange will be released at \url{https://github.com/MarsZhaoYT/SSLChange}</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenzhuo Liu, Fei Zhu, Shijie Ma, Cheng-Lin Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Although Vision Transformers (ViTs) have recently advanced computer vision tasks significantly, an important real-world problem was overlooked: adapting to variable input resolutions. Typically, images are resized to a fixed resolution, such as 224x224, for efficiency during training and inference. However, uniform input size conflicts with real-world scenarios where images naturally vary in resolution. Modifying the preset resolution of a model may severely degrade the performance. In this work, we propose to enhance the model adaptability to resolution variation by optimizing the patch embedding. The proposed method, called Multi-Scale Patch Embedding (MSPE), substitutes the standard patch embedding with multiple variable-sized patch kernels and selects the best parameters for different resolutions, eliminating the need to resize the original image. Our method does not require high-cost training or modifications to other parts, making it easy to apply to most ViT models. Experiments in image classification, segmentation, and detection tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of MSPE, yielding superior performance on low-resolution inputs and performing comparably on high-resolution inputs with existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qing Zhou, Junlin Huang, Qiang Li, Junyu Gao, Qi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: From paired image-text training to text-only training for image captioning, the pursuit of relaxing the requirements for high-cost and large-scale annotation of good quality data remains consistent. In this paper, we propose Text-only Synthesis for Image Captioning (ToCa), which further advances this relaxation with fewer human labor and less computing time. Specifically, we deconstruct caption text into structures and lexical words, which serve as the fundamental components of the caption. By combining different structures and lexical words as inputs to the large language model, massive captions that contain various patterns of lexical words are generated. This method not only approaches the target domain but also surpasses it by generating new captions, thereby enhancing the zero-shot generalization ability of the model. Considering the different levels of data access in the real world, we define three synthesis scenarios: cross-domain synthesis, in-domain synthesis, and data-efficient synthesis. Experiments in these scenarios demonstrate the generalizability, transferability and practicability of ToCa with a nearly 5 CIDEr improvement for zero-shot cross-domain captioning and a maximum increase of over 20 CIDEr for data-efficient captioning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weitai Kang, Mengxue Qu, Jyoti Kini, Yunchao Wei, Mubarak Shah, Yan Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: In real-life scenarios, humans seek out objects in the 3D world to fulfill their daily needs or intentions. This inspires us to introduce 3D intention grounding, a new task in 3D object detection employing RGB-D, based on human intention, such as "I want something to support my back". Closely related, 3D visual grounding focuses on understanding human reference. To achieve detection based on human intention, it relies on humans to observe the scene, reason out the target that aligns with their intention ("pillow" in this case), and finally provide a reference to the AI system, such as "A pillow on the couch". Instead, 3D intention grounding challenges AI agents to automatically observe, reason and detect the desired target solely based on human intention. To tackle this challenge, we introduce the new Intent3D dataset, consisting of 44,990 intention texts associated with 209 fine-grained classes from 1,042 scenes of the ScanNet dataset. We also establish several baselines based on different language-based 3D object detection models on our benchmark. Finally, we propose IntentNet, our unique approach, designed to tackle this intention-based detection problem. It focuses on three key aspects: intention understanding, reasoning to identify object candidates, and cascaded adaptive learning that leverages the intrinsic priority logic of different losses for multiple objective optimization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaskaran Singh Walia, Pavithra L K</p>
<p>Abstract: Addressing the issue of submerged underwater trash is crucial for safeguarding aquatic ecosystems and preserving marine life. While identifying debris present on the surface of water bodies is straightforward, assessing the underwater submerged waste is a challenge due to the image distortions caused by factors such as light refraction, absorption, suspended particles, color shifts, and occlusion. This paper conducts a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art architectures and on the existing datasets to establish a baseline for submerged waste and trash detection. The primary goal remains to establish the benchmark of the object localization techniques to be leveraged by advanced underwater sensors and autonomous underwater vehicles. The ultimate objective is to explore the underwater environment, to identify, and remove underwater debris. The absence of benchmarks (dataset or algorithm) in many researches emphasizes the need for a more robust algorithmic solution. Through this research, we aim to give performance comparative analysis of various underwater trash detection algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fernando Alonso-Fernandez, Kevin Hernandez-Diaz, Jose Maria Buades Rubio, Prayag Tiwari, Josef Bigun</p>
<p>Abstract: The widespread use of mobile devices for all kind of transactions makes necessary reliable and real-time identity authentication, leading to the adoption of face recognition (FR) via the cameras embedded in such devices. Progress of deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has provided substantial advances in FR. Nonetheless, the size of state-of-the-art architectures is unsuitable for mobile deployment, since they often encompass hundreds of megabytes and millions of parameters. We address this by studying methods for deep network compression applied to FR. In particular, we apply network pruning based on Taylor scores, where less important filters are removed iteratively. The method is tested on three networks based on the small SqueezeNet (1.24M parameters) and the popular MobileNetv2 (3.5M) and ResNet50 (23.5M) architectures. These have been selected to showcase the method on CNNs with different complexities and sizes. We observe that a substantial percentage of filters can be removed with minimal performance loss. Also, filters with the highest amount of output channels tend to be removed first, suggesting that high-dimensional spaces within popular CNNs are over-dimensionated.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amandeep Kumar, Muzammal Naseer, Sanath Narayan, Rao Muhammad Anwer, Salman Khan, Hisham Cholakkal</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we study the problem of generating novel images from complex multimodal prompt sequences. While existing methods achieve promising results for text-to-image generation, they often struggle to capture fine-grained details from lengthy prompts and maintain contextual coherence within prompt sequences. Moreover, they often result in misaligned image generation for prompt sequences featuring multiple objects. To address this, we propose a Multi-modal Generation via Cross-Modal In-Context Learning (MGCC) method that generates novel images from complex multimodal prompt sequences by leveraging the combined capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models. Our MGCC comprises a novel Cross-Modal Refinement module to explicitly learn cross-modal dependencies between the text and image in the LLM embedding space, and a contextual object grounding module to generate object bounding boxes specifically targeting scenes with multiple objects. Our MGCC demonstrates a diverse range of multimodal capabilities, like novel image generation, the facilitation of multimodal dialogue, and generation of texts. Experimental evaluations on two benchmark datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. On Visual Story Generation (VIST) dataset with multimodal inputs, our MGCC achieves a CLIP Similarity score of $0.652$ compared to SOTA GILL $0.641$. Similarly, on Visual Dialogue Context (VisDial) having lengthy dialogue sequences, our MGCC achieves an impressive CLIP score of $0.660$, largely outperforming existing SOTA method scoring $0.645$.

We have compared the performance of multiple generative, contrastive SSL approaches against handcrafted feature extractors and supervised learning on CEDAR AND dataset. We show that ResNet based Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) outperforms other generative approaches achieving 76.3% accuracy, while ResNet-18 fine-tuned using Variance-Invariance-Covariance Regularization (VICReg) outperforms other contrastive approaches achieving 78% accuracy. Using a pre-trained VAE and VICReg for the downstream task of writer verification we observed a relative improvement in accuracy of 6.7% and 9% over ResNet-18 supervised baseline with 10% writer labels.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kejia Yin, Varshanth R. Rao, Ruowei Jiang, Xudong Liu, Parham Aarabi, David B. Lindell</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised landmark estimation is a challenging task that demands the formation of locally distinct feature representations to identify sparse facial landmarks in the absence of annotated data. To tackle this task, existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods (1) extract coarse features from backbones that are trained with instance-level self-supervised learning (SSL) paradigms, which neglect the dense prediction nature of the task, (2) aggregate them into memory-intensive hypercolumn formations, and (3) supervise lightweight projector networks to naively establish full local correspondences among all pairs of spatial features. In this paper, we introduce SCE-MAE, a framework that (1) leverages the MAE, a region-level SSL method that naturally better suits the landmark prediction task, (2) operates on the vanilla feature map instead of on expensive hypercolumns, and (3) employs a Correspondence Approximation and Refinement Block (CARB) that utilizes a simple density peak clustering algorithm and our proposed Locality-Constrained Repellence Loss to directly hone only select local correspondences. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that SCE-MAE is highly effective and robust, outperforming existing SOTA methods by large margins of approximately 20%-44% on the landmark matching and approximately 9%-15% on the landmark detection tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jun Zheng, Fuwei Zhao, Youjiang Xu, Xin Dong, Xiaodan Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Video try-on stands as a promising area for its tremendous real-world potential. Prior works are limited to transferring product clothing images onto person videos with simple poses and backgrounds, while underperforming on casually captured videos. Recently, Sora revealed the scalability of Diffusion Transformer (DiT) in generating lifelike videos featuring real-world scenarios. Inspired by this, we explore and propose the first DiT-based video try-on framework for practical in-the-wild applications, named VITON-DiT. Specifically, VITON-DiT consists of a garment extractor, a Spatial-Temporal denoising DiT, and an identity preservation ControlNet. To faithfully recover the clothing details, the extracted garment features are fused with the self-attention outputs of the denoising DiT and the ControlNet. We also introduce novel random selection strategies during training and an Interpolated Auto-Regressive (IAR) technique at inference to facilitate long video generation. Unlike existing attempts that require the laborious and restrictive construction of a paired training dataset, severely limiting their scalability, VITON-DiT alleviates this by relying solely on unpaired human dance videos and a carefully designed multi-stage training strategy. Furthermore, we curate a challenging benchmark dataset to evaluate the performance of casual video try-on. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of VITON-DiT in generating spatio-temporal consistent try-on results for in-the-wild videos with complicated human poses.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18330">Frustratingly Easy Test-Time Adaptation of Vision-Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Matteo Farina, Gianni Franchi, Giovanni Iacca, Massimiliano Mancini, Elisa Ricci</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models seamlessly discriminate among arbitrary semantic categories, yet they still suffer from poor generalization when presented with challenging examples. For this reason, Episodic Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) strategies have recently emerged as powerful techniques to adapt VLMs in the presence of a single unlabeled image. The recent literature on TTA is dominated by the paradigm of prompt tuning by Marginal Entropy Minimization, which, relying on online backpropagation, inevitably slows down inference while increasing memory. In this work, we theoretically investigate the properties of this approach and unveil that a surprisingly strong TTA method lies dormant and hidden within it. We term this approach ZERO (TTA with "zero" temperature), whose design is both incredibly effective and frustratingly simple: augment N times, predict, retain the most confident predictions, and marginalize after setting the Softmax temperature to zero. Remarkably, ZERO requires a single batched forward pass through the vision encoder only and no backward passes. We thoroughly evaluate our approach following the experimental protocol established in the literature and show that ZERO largely surpasses or compares favorably w.r.t. the state-of-the-art while being almost 10x faster and 13x more memory-friendly than standard Test-Time Prompt Tuning. Thanks to its simplicity and comparatively negligible computation, ZERO can serve as a strong baseline for future work in this field.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Bai, Dongming Wu, Yingfei Liu, Fan Jia, Weixin Mao, Ziheng Zhang, Yucheng Zhao, Jianbing Shen, Xing Wei, Tiancai Wang, Xiangyu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Rapid advancements in Autonomous Driving (AD) tasks turned a significant shift toward end-to-end fashion, particularly in the utilization of vision-language models (VLMs) that integrate robust logical reasoning and cognitive abilities to enable comprehensive end-to-end planning. However, these VLM-based approaches tend to integrate 2D vision tokenizers and a large language model (LLM) for ego-car planning, which lack 3D geometric priors as a cornerstone of reliable planning. Naturally, this observation raises a critical concern: Can a 2D-tokenized LLM accurately perceive the 3D environment? Our evaluation of current VLM-based methods across 3D object detection, vectorized map construction, and environmental caption suggests that the answer is, unfortunately, NO. In other words, 2D-tokenized LLM fails to provide reliable autonomous driving. In response, we introduce DETR-style 3D perceptrons as 3D tokenizers, which connect LLM with a one-layer linear projector. This simple yet elegant strategy, termed Atlas, harnesses the inherent priors of the 3D physical world, enabling it to simultaneously process high-resolution multi-view images and employ spatiotemporal modeling. Despite its simplicity, Atlas demonstrates superior performance in both 3D detection and ego planning tasks on nuScenes dataset, proving that 3D-tokenized LLM is the key to reliable autonomous driving. The code and datasets will be released.</p>

<p>Abstract: Gliomas are the most common malignant primary brain tumors in adults and one of the deadliest types of cancer. There are many challenges in treatment and monitoring due to the genetic diversity and high intrinsic heterogeneity in appearance, shape, histology, and treatment response. Treatments include surgery, radiation, and systemic therapies, with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) playing a key role in treatment planning and post-treatment longitudinal assessment. The 2024 Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenge on post-treatment glioma MRI will provide a community standard and benchmark for state-of-the-art automated segmentation models based on the largest expert-annotated post-treatment glioma MRI dataset. Challenge competitors will develop automated segmentation models to predict four distinct tumor sub-regions consisting of enhancing tissue (ET), surrounding non-enhancing T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintensity (SNFH), non-enhancing tumor core (NETC), and resection cavity (RC). Models will be evaluated on separate validation and test datasets using standardized performance metrics utilized across the BraTS 2024 cluster of challenges, including lesion-wise Dice Similarity Coefficient and Hausdorff Distance. Models developed during this challenge will advance the field of automated MRI segmentation and contribute to their integration into clinical practice, ultimately enhancing patient care.</p>

<p>Abstract: The 2024 Brain Tumor Segmentation Meningioma Radiotherapy (BraTS-MEN-RT) challenge aims to advance automated segmentation algorithms using the largest known multi-institutional dataset of radiotherapy planning brain MRIs with expert-annotated target labels for patients with intact or post-operative meningioma that underwent either conventional external beam radiotherapy or stereotactic radiosurgery. Each case includes a defaced 3D post-contrast T1-weighted radiotherapy planning MRI in its native acquisition space, accompanied by a single-label "target volume" representing the gross tumor volume (GTV) and any at-risk post-operative site. Target volume annotations adhere to established radiotherapy planning protocols, ensuring consistency across cases and institutions. For pre-operative meningiomas, the target volume encompasses the entire GTV and associated nodular dural tail, while for post-operative cases, it includes at-risk resection cavity margins as determined by the treating institution. Case annotations were reviewed and approved by expert neuroradiologists and radiation oncologists. Participating teams will develop, containerize, and evaluate automated segmentation models using this comprehensive dataset. Model performance will be assessed using the lesion-wise Dice Similarity Coefficient and the 95% Hausdorff distance. The top-performing teams will be recognized at the Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention Conference in October 2024. BraTS-MEN-RT is expected to significantly advance automated radiotherapy planning by enabling precise tumor segmentation and facilitating tailored treatment, ultimately improving patient outcomes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ioanna Gogou, Dimitrios Koutsomitropoulos</p>
<p>Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are commonly used for the problem of object detection thanks to their increased accuracy. Nevertheless, the performance of CNN-based detection models is ambiguous when detection speed is considered. To the best of our knowledge, there has not been sufficient evaluation of the available methods in terms of the speed/accuracy trade-off in related literature. This work assesses the most fundamental object detection models on the Common Objects in Context (COCO) dataset with respect to this trade-off, their memory consumption, and computational and storage cost. Next, we select a highly efficient model called YOLOv5 to train on the topical and unexplored dataset of human faces with medical masks, the Properly-Wearing Masked Faces Dataset (PWMFD), and analyze the benefits of specific optimization techniques for real-time medical mask detection: transfer learning, data augmentations, and a Squeeze-and-Excitation attention mechanism. Using our findings in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, we propose an optimized model based on YOLOv5s using transfer learning for the detection of correctly and incorrectly worn medical masks that surpassed more than two times in speed (69 frames per second) the state-of-the-art model SE-YOLOv3 on the PWMFD dataset while maintaining the same level of mean Average Precision (67%).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiawei Ma, Yulei Niu, Shiyuan Huang, Guangxing Han, Shih-Fu Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: Language has been useful in extending the vision encoder to data from diverse distributions without empirical discovery in training domains. However, as the image description is mostly at coarse-grained level and ignores visual details, the resulted embeddings are still ineffective in overcoming complexity of domains at inference time. We present a self-supervision framework WIDIn, Wording Images for Domain-Invariant representation, to disentangle discriminative visual representation, by only leveraging data in a single domain and without any test prior. Specifically, for each image, we first estimate the language embedding with fine-grained alignment, which can be consequently used to adaptively identify and then remove domain-specific counterpart from the raw visual embedding. WIDIn can be applied to both pretrained vision-language models like CLIP, and separately trained uni-modal models like MoCo and BERT. Experimental studies on three domain generalization datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaehong Yoon, Shoubin Yu, Mohit Bansal</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent video generative models primarily rely on carefully written text prompts for specific tasks, like inpainting or style editing. They require labor-intensive textual descriptions for input videos, hindering their flexibility to adapt personal/raw videos to user specifications. This paper proposes RACCooN, a versatile and user-friendly video-to-paragraph-to-video generative framework that supports multiple video editing capabilities such as removal, addition, and modification, through a unified pipeline. RACCooN consists of two principal stages: Video-to-Paragraph (V2P) and Paragraph-to-Video (P2V). In the V2P stage, we automatically describe video scenes in well-structured natural language, capturing both the holistic context and focused object details. Subsequently, in the P2V stage, users can optionally refine these descriptions to guide the video diffusion model, enabling various modifications to the input video, such as removing, changing subjects, and/or adding new objects. The proposed approach stands out from other methods through several significant contributions: (1) RACCooN suggests a multi-granular spatiotemporal pooling strategy to generate well-structured video descriptions, capturing both the broad context and object details without requiring complex human annotations, simplifying precise video content editing based on text for users. (2) Our video generative model incorporates auto-generated narratives or instructions to enhance the quality and accuracy of the generated content. It supports the addition of video objects, inpainting, and attribute modification within a unified framework, surpassing existing video editing and inpainting benchmarks. The proposed framework demonstrates impressive versatile capabilities in video-to-paragraph generation, video content editing, and can be incorporated into other SoTA video generative models for further enhancement.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhui Zhang, Alyssa Unell, Xiaohan Wang, Dhruba Ghosh, Yuchang Su, Ludwig Schmidt, Serena Yeung-Levy</p>
<p>Abstract: Image classification is one of the most fundamental capabilities of machine vision intelligence. In this work, we revisit the image classification task using visually-grounded language models (VLMs) such as GPT-4V and LLaVA. We find that existing proprietary and public VLMs, despite often using CLIP as a vision encoder and having many more parameters, significantly underperform CLIP on standard image classification benchmarks like ImageNet. To understand the reason, we explore several hypotheses concerning the inference algorithms, training objectives, and data processing in VLMs. Our analysis reveals that the primary cause is data-related: critical information for image classification is encoded in the VLM's latent space but can only be effectively decoded with enough training data. Specifically, there is a strong correlation between the frequency of class exposure during VLM training and instruction-tuning and the VLM's performance in those classes; when trained with sufficient data, VLMs can match the accuracy of state-of-the-art classification models. Based on these findings, we enhance a VLM by integrating classification-focused datasets into its training, and demonstrate that the enhanced classification performance of the VLM transfers to its general capabilities, resulting in an improvement of 11.8% on the newly collected ImageWikiQA dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingwei Xu, Yikai Wang, Yiqun Zhao, Yanwei Fu, Shenghua Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Unveiling an empty street from crowded observations captured by in-car cameras is crucial for autonomous driving. However, removing all temporary static objects, such as stopped vehicles and standing pedestrians, presents a significant challenge. Unlike object-centric 3D inpainting, which relies on thorough observation in a small scene, street scenes involve long trajectories that differ from previous 3D inpainting tasks. The camera-centric moving environment of captured videos further complicates the task due to the limited degree and time duration of object observation. To address these obstacles, we introduce StreetUnveiler to reconstruct an empty street. StreetUnveiler learns a 3D representation of the empty street from crowded observations. Our representation is based on the hard-label semantic 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) for its scalability and ability to identify Gaussians to be removed. We inpaint rendered image after removing unwanted Gaussians to provide pseudo-labels and subsequently re-optimize the 2DGS. Given its temporal continuous movement, we divide the empty street scene into observed, partial-observed, and unobserved regions, which we propose to locate through a rendered alpha map. This decomposition helps us to minimize the regions that need to be inpainted. To enhance the temporal consistency of the inpainting, we introduce a novel time-reversal framework to inpaint frames in reverse order and use later frames as references for earlier frames to fully utilize the long-trajectory observations. Our experiments conducted on the street scene dataset successfully reconstructed a 3D representation of the empty street. The mesh representation of the empty street can be extracted for further applications. Project page and more visualizations can be found at: https://streetunveiler.github.io</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qihang Zhang, Yinghao Xu, Chaoyang Wang, Hsin-Ying Lee, Gordon Wetzstein, Bolei Zhou, Ceyuan Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Scene image editing is crucial for entertainment, photography, and advertising design. Existing methods solely focus on either 2D individual object or 3D global scene editing. This results in a lack of a unified approach to effectively control and manipulate scenes at the 3D level with different levels of granularity. In this work, we propose 3DitScene, a novel and unified scene editing framework leveraging language-guided disentangled Gaussian Splatting that enables seamless editing from 2D to 3D, allowing precise control over scene composition and individual objects. We first incorporate 3D Gaussians that are refined through generative priors and optimization techniques. Language features from CLIP then introduce semantics into 3D geometry for object disentanglement. With the disentangled Gaussians, 3DitScene allows for manipulation at both the global and individual levels, revolutionizing creative expression and empowering control over scenes and objects. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of 3DitScene in scene image editing.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bencheng Liao, Xinggang Wang, Lianghui Zhu, Qian Zhang, Chang Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, linear complexity sequence modeling networks have achieved modeling capabilities similar to Vision Transformers on a variety of computer vision tasks, while using fewer FLOPs and less memory. However, their advantage in terms of actual runtime speed is not significant. To address this issue, we introduce Gated Linear Attention (GLA) for vision, leveraging its superior hardware-awareness and efficiency. We propose direction-wise gating to capture 1D global context through bidirectional modeling and a 2D gating locality injection to adaptively inject 2D local details into 1D global context. Our hardware-aware implementation further merges forward and backward scanning into a single kernel, enhancing parallelism and reducing memory cost and latency. The proposed model, \name{}, offers a favorable trade-off in accuracy, parameters, and FLOPs on ImageNet and downstream tasks, outperforming popular Transformer and CNN-based models. Notably, \name{}-S matches DeiT-B's accuracy while using only 27\% of the parameters and 20\% of the FLOPs, running 2$\times$ faster on $224\times224$ images. At $1024\times1024$ resolution, \name{}-T uses 5.2$\times$ fewer FLOPs, saves 90\% GPU memory, runs 4.8$\times$ faster, and achieves 20.7\% higher top-1 accuracy than DeiT-T. These results position \name{} as an efficient and scalable solution for visual representation learning. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/hustvl/ViG}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shizun Wang, Xingyi Yang, Qiuhong Shen, Zhenxiang Jiang, Xinchao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Reconstructing 4D scenes from video inputs is a crucial yet challenging task. Conventional methods usually rely on the assumptions of multi-view video inputs, known camera parameters, or static scenes, all of which are typically absent under in-the-wild scenarios. In this paper, we relax all these constraints and tackle a highly ambitious but practical task, which we termed as AnyV4D: we assume only one monocular video is available without any camera parameters as input, and we aim to recover the dynamic 4D world alongside the camera poses. To this end, we introduce GFlow, a new framework that utilizes only 2D priors (depth and optical flow) to lift a video (3D) to a 4D explicit representation, entailing a flow of Gaussian splatting through space and time. GFlow first clusters the scene into still and moving parts, then applies a sequential optimization process that optimizes camera poses and the dynamics of 3D Gaussian points based on 2D priors and scene clustering, ensuring fidelity among neighboring points and smooth movement across frames. Since dynamic scenes always introduce new content, we also propose a new pixel-wise densification strategy for Gaussian points to integrate new visual content. Moreover, GFlow transcends the boundaries of mere 4D reconstruction; it also enables tracking of any points across frames without the need for prior training and segments moving objects from the scene in an unsupervised way. Additionally, the camera poses of each frame can be derived from GFlow, allowing for rendering novel views of a video scene through changing camera pose. By employing the explicit representation, we may readily conduct scene-level or object-level editing as desired, underscoring its versatility and power.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lianghui Zhu, Zilong Huang, Bencheng Liao, Jun Hao Liew, Hanshu Yan, Jiashi Feng, Xinggang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models with large-scale pre-training have achieved significant success in the field of visual content generation, particularly exemplified by Diffusion Transformers (DiT). However, DiT models have faced challenges with scalability and quadratic complexity efficiency. In this paper, we aim to leverage the long sequence modeling capability of Gated Linear Attention (GLA) Transformers, expanding its applicability to diffusion models. We introduce Diffusion Gated Linear Attention Transformers (DiG), a simple, adoptable solution with minimal parameter overhead, following the DiT design, but offering superior efficiency and effectiveness. In addition to better performance than DiT, DiG-S/2 exhibits $2.5\times$ higher training speed than DiT-S/2 and saves $75.7\%$ GPU memory at a resolution of $1792 \times 1792$. Moreover, we analyze the scalability of DiG across a variety of computational complexity. DiG models, with increased depth/width or augmentation of input tokens, consistently exhibit decreasing FID. We further compare DiG with other subquadratic-time diffusion models. With the same model size, DiG-XL/2 is $4.2\times$ faster than the recent Mamba-based diffusion model at a $1024$ resolution, and is $1.8\times$ faster than DiT with CUDA-optimized FlashAttention-2 under the $2048$ resolution. All these results demonstrate its superior efficiency among the latest diffusion models. Code is released at https://github.com/hustvl/DiG.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Coenraad Mouton</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding generalization in deep neural networks is an active area of research. A promising avenue of exploration has been that of margin measurements: the shortest distance to the decision boundary for a given sample or that sample's representation internal to the network. Margin-based complexity measures have been shown to be correlated with the generalization ability of deep neural networks in some circumstances but not others. The reasons behind the success or failure of these metrics are currently unclear. In this study, we examine margin-based generalization prediction methods in different settings. We motivate why these metrics sometimes fail to accurately predict generalization and how they can be improved.
  First, we analyze the relationship between margins measured in the input space and sample noise. We find that different types of sample noise can have a very different effect on the overall margin of a network that has modeled noisy data.
  Following this, we empirically evaluate how robust margins measured at different representational spaces are at predicting generalization. We find that these metrics have several limitations and that a large margin does not exhibit a strong correlation with empirical risk in many cases.
  Finally, we introduce a new margin-based measure that incorporates an approximation of the underlying data manifold. It is empirically demonstrated that this measure is generally more predictive of generalization than all other margin-based measures. Furthermore, we find that this measurement also outperforms other contemporary complexity measures on a well-known generalization prediction benchmark. In addition, we analyze the utility and limitations of this approach and find that this metric is well aligned with intuitions expressed in prior work.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, an innovative multi-modal deep learning model is proposed to deeply integrate heterogeneous information from medical images and clinical reports. First, for medical images, convolutional neural networks were used to extract high-dimensional features and capture key visual information such as focal details, texture and spatial distribution. Secondly, for clinical report text, a two-way long and short-term memory network combined with an attention mechanism is used for deep semantic understanding, and key statements related to the disease are accurately captured. The two features interact and integrate effectively through the designed multi-modal fusion layer to realize the joint representation learning of image and text. In the empirical study, we selected a large medical image database covering a variety of diseases, combined with corresponding clinical reports for model training and validation. The proposed multimodal deep learning model demonstrated substantial superiority in the realms of disease classification, lesion localization, and clinical description generation, as evidenced by the experimental results.</p>

<p>Abstract: Aiming at the limitations of traditional medical decision system in processing large-scale heterogeneous medical data and realizing highly personalized recommendation, this paper introduces a personalized medical decision algorithm utilizing graph neural network (GNN). This research innovatively integrates graph neural network technology into the medical and health field, aiming to build a high-precision representation model of patient health status by mining the complex association between patients' clinical characteristics, genetic information, living habits. In this study, medical data is preprocessed to transform it into a graph structure, where nodes represent different data entities (such as patients, diseases, genes, etc.) and edges represent interactions or relationships between entities. The core of the algorithm is to design a novel multi-scale fusion mechanism, combining the historical medical records, physiological indicators and genetic characteristics of patients, to dynamically adjust the attention allocation strategy of the graph neural network, so as to achieve highly customized analysis of individual cases. In the experimental part, this study selected several publicly available medical data sets for validation, and the results showed that compared with traditional machine learning methods and a single graph neural network model, the proposed personalized medical decision algorithm showed significantly superior performance in terms of disease prediction accuracy, treatment effect evaluation and patient risk stratification.</p>

<p>Abstract: The success of pretrain-finetune paradigm brings about the release of numerous model weights. In this case, merging models finetuned on different tasks to enable a single model with multi-task capabilities is gaining increasing attention for its practicability. Existing model merging methods usually suffer from (1) significant performance degradation or (2) requiring tuning by additional data or training. In this paper, we rethink and analyze the existing model merging paradigm. We discover that using a single model's weights can hardly simulate all the models' performance. To tackle this issue, we propose Elect, Mask & Rescale-Merging (EMR-Merging). We first (a) elect a unified model from all the model weights and then (b) generate extremely lightweight task-specific modulators, including masks and rescalers, to align the direction and magnitude between the unified model and each specific model, respectively. EMR-Merging is tuning-free, thus requiring no data availability or any additional training while showing impressive performance. We find that EMR-Merging shows outstanding performance compared to existing merging methods under different classical and newly-established settings, including merging different numbers of vision models (up to 30), NLP models, PEFT models, and multi-modal models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kai Huang, Wei Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models can be fine-tuned in custom domains to adapt to specific user preferences, but such unconstrained adaptability has also been utilized for illegal purposes, such as forging public figures' portraits and duplicating copyrighted artworks. Most existing work focuses on detecting the illegally generated contents, but cannot prevent or mitigate illegal adaptations of diffusion models. Other schemes of model unlearning and reinitialization, similarly, cannot prevent users from relearning the knowledge of illegal model adaptation with custom data. In this paper, we present FreezeAsGuard, a new technique that addresses these limitations and enables irreversible mitigation of illegal adaptations of diffusion models. The basic approach is that the model publisher selectively freezes tensors in pre-trained diffusion models that are critical to illegal model adaptations, to mitigate the fine-tuned model's representation power in illegal domains but minimize the impact on legal model adaptations in other domains. Such tensor freezing can be enforced via APIs provided by the model publisher for fine-tuning, can motivate users' adoption due to its computational savings. Experiment results with datasets in multiple domains show that FreezeAsGuard provides stronger power in mitigating illegal model adaptations of generating fake public figures' portraits, while having the minimum impact on model adaptation in other legal domains.

<p>Abstract: While following different technical routes, both low-rank and orthogonal adaptation techniques can efficiently adapt large-scale pre-training models in specific tasks or domains based on a small piece of trainable parameters. In this study, we bridge the gap between these two techniques, proposing a simple but effective adaptation method based on Householder reflections. Given a pre-trained model, our method fine-tunes its layers by multiplying each frozen weight matrix with an orthogonal matrix constructed by a chain of learnable Householder reflections (HRs). This HR-based orthogonal fine-tuning is equivalent to an adaptive low-rank adaptation. Moreover, we show that the orthogonality of the reflection planes corresponding to the HRs impacts the model capacity and regularity. The analysis motivates us to regularize the orthogonality of the HRs, leading to different implementations of the proposed Householder reflection adaptation (HRA) method. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, HRA achieves superior performance with fewer learnable parameters when adapting large language models and conditional image generators.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joshua Offergeld, Marcel van Gerven, Nasir Ahmad</p>
<p>Abstract: A significant increase in the commercial use of deep neural network models increases the need for efficient AI. Node pruning is the art of removing computational units such as neurons, filters, attention heads, or even entire layers while keeping network performance at a maximum. This can significantly reduce the inference time of a deep network and thus enhance its efficiency. Few of the previous works have exploited the ability to recover performance by reorganizing network parameters while pruning. In this work, we propose to create a subspace from unit activations which enables node pruning while recovering maximum accuracy. We identify that for effective node pruning, a subspace can be created using a triangular transformation matrix, which we show to be equivalent to Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization, which automates this procedure. We further improve this method by reorganizing the network prior to subspace formation. Finally, we leverage the orthogonal subspaces to identify layer-wise pruning ratios appropriate to retain a significant amount of the layer-wise information. We show that this measure outperforms existing pruning methods on VGG networks. We further show that our method can be extended to other network architectures such as residual networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Louis Fournier (MLIA), Adel Nabli (MLIA, Mila), Masih Aminbeidokhti (ETS), Marco Pedersoli (ETS), Eugene Belilovsky (Mila), Edouard Oyallon</p>
<p>Abstract: The performance of deep neural networks is enhanced by ensemble methods, which average the output of several models. However, this comes at an increased cost at inference. Weight averaging methods aim at balancing the generalization of ensembling and the inference speed of a single model by averaging the parameters of an ensemble of models. Yet, naive averaging results in poor performance as models converge to different loss basins, and aligning the models to improve the performance of the average is challenging. Alternatively, inspired by distributed training, methods like DART and PAPA have been proposed to train several models in parallel such that they will end up in the same basin, resulting in good averaging accuracy. However, these methods either compromise ensembling accuracy or demand significant communication between models during training. In this paper, we introduce WASH, a novel distributed method for training model ensembles for weight averaging that achieves state-of-the-art image classification accuracy. WASH maintains models within the same basin by randomly shuffling a small percentage of weights during training, resulting in diverse models and lower communication costs compared to standard parameter averaging methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Unlike Right Atrium (RA), Left Atrium (LA) presents distinctive challenges, including much thinner myocardial walls, complex and irregular morphology, as well as diversity in individual's structure, making off-the-shelf methods designed for the Left Ventricle (LV) may not work in the context of the left atrium. To overcome aforementioned challenges, we are the first to present comprehensive technical workflow designed for 4D registration modeling to automatically analyze LA motion using high-resolution 3D Cine MR images. We integrate segmentation network and 4D registration process to precisely delineate LA segmentation throughout the full cardiac cycle. Additionally, an image 4D registration network is employed to extract LA displacement vector fields (DVFs). Our findings show the potential of proposed end to end framework in providing clinicians with novel regional biomarkers for left atrium motion tracking and deformation, carrying significant clinical implications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Syed Javed, Tariq M. Khan, Abdul Qayyum, Arcot Sowmya, Imran Razzak</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate segmentation of anatomical structures and abnormalities in medical images is crucial for computer-aided diagnosis and analysis. While deep learning techniques excel at this task, their computational demands pose challenges. Additionally, some cutting-edge segmentation methods, though effective for general object segmentation, may not be optimised for medical images. To address these issues, we propose Mini-Net, a lightweight segmentation network specifically designed for medical images. With fewer than 38,000 parameters, Mini-Net efficiently captures both high- and low-frequency features, enabling real-time applications in various medical imaging scenarios. We evaluate Mini-Net on various datasets, including DRIVE, STARE, ISIC-2016, ISIC-2018, and MoNuSeg, demonstrating its robustness and good performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Apurva Sinha, Ekta Gujral</p>
<p>Abstract: Product attribute extraction is an growing field in e-commerce business, with several applications including product ranking, product recommendation, future assortment planning and improving online shopping customer experiences. Understanding the customer needs is critical part of online business, specifically fashion products. Retailers uses assortment planning to determine the mix of products to offer in each store and channel, stay responsive to market dynamics and to manage inventory and catalogs. The goal is to offer the right styles, in the right sizes and colors, through the right channels. When shoppers find products that meet their needs and desires, they are more likely to return for future purchases, fostering customer loyalty. Product attributes are a key factor in assortment planning. In this paper we present PAE, a product attribute extraction algorithm for future trend reports consisting text and images in PDF format. Most existing methods focus on attribute extraction from titles or product descriptions or utilize visual information from existing product images. Compared to the prior works, our work focuses on attribute extraction from PDF files where upcoming fashion trends are explained. This work proposes a more comprehensive framework that fully utilizes the different modalities for attribute extraction and help retailers to plan the assortment in advance. Our contributions are three-fold: (a) We develop PAE, an efficient framework to extract attributes from unstructured data (text and images); (b) We provide catalog matching methodology based on BERT representations to discover the existing attributes using upcoming attribute values; (c) We conduct extensive experiments with several baselines and show that PAE is an effective, flexible and on par or superior (avg 92.5% F1-Score) framework to existing state-of-the-art for attribute value extraction task.</p>

<p>Abstract: Measuring biodiversity is crucial for understanding ecosystem health. While prior works have developed machine learning models for the taxonomic classification of photographic images and DNA separately, in this work, we introduce a multimodal approach combining both, using CLIP-style contrastive learning to align images, DNA barcodes, and textual data in a unified embedding space. This allows for accurate classification of both known and unknown insect species without task-specific fine-tuning, leveraging contrastive learning for the first time to fuse DNA and image data. Our method surpasses previous single-modality approaches in accuracy by over 11% on zero-shot learning tasks, showcasing its effectiveness in biodiversity studies.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep learning has been extensively applied in medical image reconstruction, where Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) represent the predominant paradigms, each possessing distinct advantages and inherent limitations: CNNs exhibit linear complexity with local sensitivity, whereas ViTs demonstrate quadratic complexity with global sensitivity. The emerging Mamba has shown superiority in learning visual representation, which combines the advantages of linear scalability and global sensitivity. In this study, we introduce MambaMIR, an Arbitrary-Masked Mamba-based model with wavelet decomposition for joint medical image reconstruction and uncertainty estimation. A novel Arbitrary Scan Masking (ASM) mechanism ``masks out'' redundant information to introduce randomness for further uncertainty estimation. Compared to the commonly used Monte Carlo (MC) dropout, our proposed MC-ASM provides an uncertainty map without the need for hyperparameter tuning and mitigates the performance drop typically observed when applying dropout to low-level tasks. For further texture preservation and better perceptual quality, we employ the wavelet transformation into MambaMIR and explore its variant based on the Generative Adversarial Network, namely MambaMIR-GAN. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted for multiple representative medical image reconstruction tasks, demonstrating that the proposed MambaMIR and MambaMIR-GAN outperform other baseline and state-of-the-art methods in different reconstruction tasks, where MambaMIR achieves the best reconstruction fidelity and MambaMIR-GAN has the best perceptual quality. In addition, our MC-ASM provides uncertainty maps as an additional tool for clinicians, while mitigating the typical performance drop caused by the commonly used dropout.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cory Efird, Alex Murphy, Joel Zylberberg, Alona Fyshe</p>
<p>Abstract: Prior work has offered evidence for functional localization in the brain; different anatomical regions preferentially activate for certain types of visual input. For example, the fusiform face area preferentially activates for visual stimuli that include a face. However, the spectrum of visual semantics is extensive, and only a few semantically-tuned patches of cortex have so far been identified in the human brain. Using a multimodal (natural language and image) neural network architecture (CLIP) we train a highly accurate contrastive model that maps brain responses during naturalistic image viewing to CLIP embeddings. We then use a novel adaptation of the DBSCAN clustering algorithm to cluster the parameters of these participant-specific contrastive models. This reveals what we call Shared Decodable Concepts (SDCs): clusters in CLIP space that are decodable from common sets of voxels across multiple participants.
  Examining the images most and least associated with each SDC cluster gives us additional insight into the semantic properties of each SDC. We note SDCs for previously reported visual features (e.g. orientation tuning in early visual cortex) as well as visual semantic concepts such as faces, places and bodies. In cases where our method finds multiple clusters for a visuo-semantic concept, the least associated images allow us to dissociate between confounding factors. For example, we discovered two clusters of food images, one driven by color, the other by shape. We also uncover previously unreported areas such as regions of extrastriate body area (EBA) tuned for legs/hands and sensitivity to numerosity in right intraparietal sulcus, and more. Thus, our contrastive-learning methodology better characterizes new and existing visuo-semantic representations in the brain by leveraging multimodal neural network representations and a novel adaptation of clustering algorithms.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this work, we propose the use of "aligned visual captions" as a mechanism for integrating information contained within videos into retrieval augmented generation (RAG) based chat assistant systems. These captions are able to describe the visual and audio content of videos in a large corpus while having the advantage of being in a textual format that is both easy to reason about & incorporate into large language model (LLM) prompts, but also typically require less multimedia content to be inserted into the multimodal LLM context window, where typical configurations can aggressively fill up the context window by sampling video frames from the source video. Furthermore, visual captions can be adapted to specific use cases by prompting the original foundational model / captioner for particular visual details or fine tuning. In hopes of helping advancing progress in this area, we curate a dataset and describe automatic evaluation procedures on common RAG tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhifeng Chen, Kamlesh Pawar, Kh Tohidul Islam, Himashi Peiris, Gary Egan, Zhaolin Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Motion artifacts in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) are one of the frequently occurring artifacts due to patient movements during scanning. Motion is estimated to be present in approximately 30% of clinical MRI scans; however, motion has not been explicitly modeled within deep learning image reconstruction models. Deep learning (DL) algorithms have been demonstrated to be effective for both the image reconstruction task and the motion correction task, but the two tasks are considered separately. The image reconstruction task involves removing undersampling artifacts such as noise and aliasing artifacts, whereas motion correction involves removing artifacts including blurring, ghosting, and ringing. In this work, we propose a novel method to simultaneously accelerate imaging and correct motion. This is achieved by integrating a motion module into the deep learning-based MRI reconstruction process, enabling real-time detection and correction of motion. We model motion as a tightly integrated auxiliary layer in the deep learning model during training, making the deep learning model 'motion-informed'. During inference, image reconstruction is performed from undersampled raw k-space data using a trained motion-informed DL model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed motion-informed deep learning image reconstruction network outperformed the conventional image reconstruction network for motion-degraded MRI datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Neuromorphic vision sensors or event cameras have made the visual perception of extremely low reaction time possible, opening new avenues for high-dynamic robotics applications. These event cameras' output is dependent on both motion and texture. However, the event camera fails to capture object edges that are parallel to the camera motion. This is a problem intrinsic to the sensor and therefore challenging to solve algorithmically. Human vision deals with perceptual fading using the active mechanism of small involuntary eye movements, the most prominent ones called microsaccades. By moving the eyes constantly and slightly during fixation, microsaccades can substantially maintain texture stability and persistence. Inspired by microsaccades, we designed an event-based perception system capable of simultaneously maintaining low reaction time and stable texture. In this design, a rotating wedge prism was mounted in front of the aperture of an event camera to redirect light and trigger events. The geometrical optics of the rotating wedge prism allows for algorithmic compensation of the additional rotational motion, resulting in a stable texture appearance and high informational output independent of external motion. The hardware device and software solution are integrated into a system, which we call Artificial MIcrosaccade-enhanced EVent camera (AMI-EV). Benchmark comparisons validate the superior data quality of AMI-EV recordings in scenarios where both standard cameras and event cameras fail to deliver. Various real-world experiments demonstrate the potential of the system to facilitate robotics perception both for low-level and high-level vision tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangjun Gao, Xiaoyu Li, Yiyu Zhuang, Qi Zhang, Wenbo Hu, Chaopeng Zhang, Yao Yao, Ying Shan, Long Quan</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural 3D representations such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), excel at producing photo-realistic rendering results but lack the flexibility for manipulation and editing which is crucial for content creation. Previous works have attempted to address this issue by deforming a NeRF in canonical space or manipulating the radiance field based on an explicit mesh. However, manipulating NeRF is not highly controllable and requires a long training and inference time. With the emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), extremely high-fidelity novel view synthesis can be achieved using an explicit point-based 3D representation with much faster training and rendering speed. However, there is still a lack of effective means to manipulate 3DGS freely while maintaining rendering quality. In this work, we aim to tackle the challenge of achieving manipulable photo-realistic rendering. We propose to utilize a triangular mesh to manipulate 3DGS directly with self-adaptation. This approach reduces the need to design various algorithms for different types of Gaussian manipulation. By utilizing a triangle shape-aware Gaussian binding and adapting method, we can achieve 3DGS manipulation and preserve high-fidelity rendering after manipulation. Our approach is capable of handling large deformations, local manipulations, and soft body simulations while keeping high-quality rendering. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method is also effective with inaccurate meshes extracted from 3DGS. Experiments conducted demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and its superiority over baseline approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shakti N. Wadekar, Abhishek Chaurasia, Aman Chadha, Eugenio Culurciello</p>
<p>Abstract: This work uniquely identifies and characterizes four prevalent multimodal model architectural patterns in the contemporary multimodal landscape. Systematically categorizing models by architecture type facilitates monitoring of developments in the multimodal domain. Distinct from recent survey papers that present general information on multimodal architectures, this research conducts a comprehensive exploration of architectural details and identifies four specific architectural types. The types are distinguished by their respective methodologies for integrating multimodal inputs into the deep neural network model. The first two types (Type A and B) deeply fuses multimodal inputs within the internal layers of the model, whereas the following two types (Type C and D) facilitate early fusion at the input stage. Type-A employs standard cross-attention, whereas Type-B utilizes custom-designed layers for modality fusion within the internal layers. On the other hand, Type-C utilizes modality-specific encoders, while Type-D leverages tokenizers to process the modalities at the model's input stage. The identified architecture types aid the monitoring of any-to-any multimodal model development. Notably, Type-C and Type-D are currently favored in the construction of any-to-any multimodal models. Type-C, distinguished by its non-tokenizing multimodal model architecture, is emerging as a viable alternative to Type-D, which utilizes input-tokenizing techniques. To assist in model selection, this work highlights the advantages and disadvantages of each architecture type based on data and compute requirements, architecture complexity, scalability, simplification of adding modalities, training objectives, and any-to-any multimodal generation capability.</p>

<p>Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of modern large language models are rooted in their vast repositories of knowledge encoded within their parameters, enabling them to perceive the world and engage in reasoning. The inner workings of how these models store knowledge have long been a subject of intense interest and investigation among researchers. To date, most studies have concentrated on isolated components within these models, such as the Multilayer Perceptrons and attention head. In this paper, we delve into the computation graph of the language model to uncover the knowledge circuits that are instrumental in articulating specific knowledge. The experiments, conducted with GPT2 and TinyLLAMA, has allowed us to observe how certain information heads, relation heads, and Multilayer Perceptrons collaboratively encode knowledge within the model. Moreover, we evaluate the impact of current knowledge editing techniques on these knowledge circuits, providing deeper insights into the functioning and constraints of these editing methodologies. Finally, we utilize knowledge circuits to analyze and interpret language model behaviors such as hallucinations and in-context learning. We believe the knowledge circuit holds potential for advancing our understanding of Transformers and guiding the improved design of knowledge editing.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Panagiotis Koromilas, Giorgos Bouritsas, Theodoros Giannakopoulos, Mihalis Nicolaou, Yannis Panagakis</p>
<p>Abstract: What do different contrastive learning (CL) losses actually optimize for? Although multiple CL methods have demonstrated remarkable representation learning capabilities, the differences in their inner workings remain largely opaque. In this work, we analyse several CL families and prove that, under certain conditions, they admit the same minimisers when optimizing either their batch-level objectives or their expectations asymptotically. In both cases, an intimate connection with the hyperspherical energy minimisation (HEM) problem resurfaces. Drawing inspiration from this, we introduce a novel CL objective, coined Decoupled Hyperspherical Energy Loss (DHEL). DHEL simplifies the problem by decoupling the target hyperspherical energy from the alignment of positive examples while preserving the same theoretical guarantees. Going one step further, we show the same results hold for another relevant CL family, namely kernel contrastive learning (KCL), with the additional advantage of the expected loss being independent of batch size, thus identifying the minimisers in the non-asymptotic regime. Empirical results demonstrate improved downstream performance and robustness across combinations of different batch sizes and hyperparameters and reduced dimensionality collapse, on several computer vision datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ke Zou, Tian Lin, Zongbo Han, Meng Wang, Xuedong Yuan, Haoyu Chen, Changqing Zhang, Xiaojing Shen, Huazhu Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-modal ophthalmic image classification plays a key role in diagnosing eye diseases, as it integrates information from different sources to complement their respective performances. However, recent improvements have mainly focused on accuracy, often neglecting the importance of confidence and robustness in predictions for diverse modalities. In this study, we propose a novel multi-modality evidential fusion pipeline for eye disease screening. It provides a measure of confidence for each modality and elegantly integrates the multi-modality information using a multi-distribution fusion perspective. Specifically, our method first utilizes normal inverse gamma prior distributions over pre-trained models to learn both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty for uni-modality. Then, the normal inverse gamma distribution is analyzed as the Student's t distribution. Furthermore, within a confidence-aware fusion framework, we propose a mixture of Student's t distributions to effectively integrate different modalities, imparting the model with heavy-tailed properties and enhancing its robustness and reliability. More importantly, the confidence-aware multi-modality ranking regularization term induces the model to more reasonably rank the noisy single-modal and fused-modal confidence, leading to improved reliability and accuracy. Experimental results on both public and internal datasets demonstrate that our model excels in robustness, particularly in challenging scenarios involving Gaussian noise and modality missing conditions. Moreover, our model exhibits strong generalization capabilities to out-of-distribution data, underscoring its potential as a promising solution for multimodal eye disease screening.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sharut Gupta, Chenyu Wang, Yifei Wang, Tommi Jaakkola, Stefanie Jegelka</p>
<p>Abstract: At the core of self-supervised learning for vision is the idea of learning invariant or equivariant representations with respect to a set of data transformations. This approach, however, introduces strong inductive biases, which can render the representations fragile in downstream tasks that do not conform to these symmetries. In this work, drawing insights from world models, we propose to instead learn a general representation that can adapt to be invariant or equivariant to different transformations by paying attention to context -- a memory module that tracks task-specific states, actions, and future states. Here, the action is the transformation, while the current and future states respectively represent the input's representation before and after the transformation. Our proposed algorithm, Contextual Self-Supervised Learning (ContextSSL), learns equivariance to all transformations (as opposed to invariance). In this way, the model can learn to encode all relevant features as general representations while having the versatility to tail down to task-wise symmetries when given a few examples as the context. Empirically, we demonstrate significant performance gains over existing methods on equivariance-related tasks, supported by both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the field of Robot Learning, the complex mapping between high-dimensional observations such as RGB images and low-level robotic actions, two inherently very different spaces, constitutes a complex learning problem, especially with limited amounts of data. In this work, we introduce Render and Diffuse (R&D) a method that unifies low-level robot actions and RGB observations within the image space using virtual renders of the 3D model of the robot. Using this joint observation-action representation it computes low-level robot actions using a learnt diffusion process that iteratively updates the virtual renders of the robot. This space unification simplifies the learning problem and introduces inductive biases that are crucial for sample efficiency and spatial generalisation. We thoroughly evaluate several variants of R&D in simulation and showcase their applicability on six everyday tasks in the real world. Our results show that R&D exhibits strong spatial generalisation capabilities and is more sample efficient than more common image-to-action methods.</p>

NeRAF is designed as a Nerfstudio module for convenient access to realistic audio-visual generation. It synthesizes both novel views and spatialized audio at new positions, leveraging radiance field capabilities to condition the acoustic field with 3D scene information. At inference, each modality can be rendered independently and at spatially separated positions, providing greater versatility. We demonstrate the advantages of our method on the SoundSpaces dataset. NeRAF achieves substantial performance improvements over previous works while being more data-efficient. Furthermore, NeRAF enhances novel view synthesis of complex scenes trained with sparse data through cross-modal learning.</p>

On-device anti-phishing solutions are gaining popularity as they offer faster phishing detection locally. Aim. We aim to eliminate the delay in recognizing and recording phishing campaigns in databases via on-device solutions that identify phishing sites immediately when encountered by the user rather than waiting for a web crawler's scan to finish. Additionally, utilizing operating system-specific resources and frameworks, we aim to minimize the impact on system performance and depend on local processing to protect user privacy. Method. We propose a phishing detection solution that uses a combination of computer vision and on-device machine learning models to analyze websites in real time. Our reference-based approach analyzes the visual content of webpages, identifying phishing attempts through layout analysis, credential input areas detection, and brand impersonation criteria combination. Results. Our case study shows it's feasible to perform background processing on-device continuously, for the case of the web browser requiring the resource use of 16% of a single CPU core and less than 84MB of RAM on Apple M1 while maintaining the accuracy of brand logo detection at 46.6% (comparable with baselines), and of Credential Requiring Page detection at 98.1% (improving the baseline by 3.1%), within the test dataset. Conclusions. Our results demonstrate the potential of on-device, real-time phishing detection systems to enhance cybersecurity defensive technologies and extend the scope of phishing detection to more similar regions of interest, e.g., email clients and messenger windows.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Reihaneh Teimouri, Marta Kersten-Oertel, Yiming Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficient and accurate brain ventricle segmentation from clinical CT scans is critical for emergency surgeries like ventriculostomy. With the challenges in poor soft tissue contrast and a scarcity of well-annotated databases for clinical brain CTs, we introduce a novel uncertainty-aware ventricle segmentation technique without the need of CT segmentation ground truths by leveraging diffusion-model-based domain adaptation. Specifically, our method employs the diffusion Schr\"odinger Bridge and an attention recurrent residual U-Net to capitalize on unpaired CT and MRI scans to derive automatic CT segmentation from those of the MRIs, which are more accessible. Importantly, we propose an end-to-end, joint training framework of image translation and segmentation tasks, and demonstrate its benefit over training individual tasks separately. By comparing the proposed method against similar setups using two different GAN models for domain adaptation (CycleGAN and CUT), we also reveal the advantage of diffusion models towards improved segmentation and image translation quality. With a Dice score of 0.78$\pm$0.27, our proposed method outperformed the compared methods, including SynSeg-Net, while providing intuitive uncertainty measures to further facilitate quality control of the automatic segmentation outcomes.</p>

<p>Abstract: Predictive biomarkers of treatment response are lacking for metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), a tumor type that is treated with angiogenesis inhibitors, immune checkpoint inhibitors, mTOR inhibitors and a HIF2 inhibitor. The Angioscore, an RNA-based quantification of angiogenesis, is arguably the best candidate to predict anti-angiogenic (AA) response. However, the clinical adoption of transcriptomic assays faces several challenges including standardization, time delay, and high cost. Further, ccRCC tumors are highly heterogenous, and sampling multiple areas for sequencing is impractical. Here we present a novel deep learning (DL) approach to predict the Angioscore from ubiquitous histopathology slides. To overcome the lack of interpretability, one of the biggest limitations of typical DL models, our model produces a visual vascular network which is the basis of the model's prediction. To test its reliability, we applied this model to multiple cohorts including a clinical trial dataset. Our model accurately predicts the RNA-based Angioscore on multiple independent cohorts (spearman correlations of 0.77 and 0.73). Further, the predictions help unravel meaningful biology such as association of angiogenesis with grade, stage, and driver mutation status. Finally, we find our model can predict response to AA therapy, in both a real-world cohort and the IMmotion150 clinical trial. The predictive power of our model vastly exceeds that of CD31, a marker of vasculature, and nearly rivals the performance (c-index 0.66 vs 0.67) of the ground truth RNA-based Angioscore at a fraction of the cost. By providing a robust yet interpretable prediction of the Angioscore from histopathology slides alone, our approach offers insights into angiogenesis biology and AA treatment response.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we will present SketchQL, a video database management system (VDBMS) for retrieving video moments with a sketch-based query interface. This novel interface allows users to specify object trajectory events with simple mouse drag-and-drop operations.

Using a pre-trained model that encodes trajectory similarity, SketchQL achieves zero-shot video moments retrieval by performing similarity searches over the video to identify clips that are the most similar to the visual query. In this demonstration, we introduce the graphic user interface of SketchQL and detail its functionalities and interaction mechanisms. We also demonstrate the end-to-end usage of SketchQL from query composition to video moments retrieval using real-world scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jie Liu, Yixiao Zhang, Kang Wang, Mehmet Can Yavuz, Xiaoxi Chen, Yixuan Yuan, Haoliang Li, Yang Yang, Alan Yuille, Yucheng Tang, Zongwei Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: The advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) for organ segmentation and tumor detection is propelled by the growing availability of computed tomography (CT) datasets with detailed, per-voxel annotations. However, these AI models often struggle with flexibility for partially annotated datasets and extensibility for new classes due to limitations in the one-hot encoding, architectural design, and learning scheme. To overcome these limitations, we propose a universal, extensible framework enabling a single model, termed Universal Model, to deal with multiple public datasets and adapt to new classes (e.g., organs/tumors). Firstly, we introduce a novel language-driven parameter generator that leverages language embeddings from large language models, enriching semantic encoding compared with one-hot encoding. Secondly, the conventional output layers are replaced with lightweight, class-specific heads, allowing Universal Model to simultaneously segment 25 organs and six types of tumors and ease the addition of new classes. We train our Universal Model on 3,410 CT volumes assembled from 14 publicly available datasets and then test it on 6,173 CT volumes from four external datasets. Universal Model achieves first place on six CT tasks in the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) public leaderboard and leading performance on the Beyond The Cranial Vault (BTCV) dataset. In summary, Universal Model exhibits remarkable computational efficiency (6x faster than other dataset-specific models), demonstrates strong generalization across different hospitals, transfers well to numerous downstream tasks, and more importantly, facilitates the extensibility to new classes while alleviating the catastrophic forgetting of previously learned classes.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Somnath Kumar, Yash Gadhia, Tanuja Ganu, Akshay Nambi</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly improved their performance in tasks combining vision and language. However, challenges persist in detailed multi-modal understanding, comprehension of complex tasks, and reasoning over multi-modal information. This paper introduces MMCTAgent, a novel multi-modal critical thinking agent framework designed to address the inherent limitations of current MLLMs in complex visual reasoning tasks. Inspired by human cognitive processes and critical thinking, MMCTAgent iteratively analyzes multi-modal information, decomposes queries, plans strategies, and dynamically evolves its reasoning. Additionally, MMCTAgent incorporates critical thinking elements such as verification of final answers and self-reflection through a novel approach that defines a vision-based critic and identifies task-specific evaluation criteria, thereby enhancing its decision-making abilities. Through rigorous evaluations across various image and video understanding benchmarks, we demonstrate that MMCTAgent (with and without the critic) outperforms both foundational MLLMs and other tool-augmented pipelines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongjie Chen, Kartik Patwari, Zhengfeng Lai, Sen-ching Cheung, Chen-Nee Chuah</p>
<p>Abstract: Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) aims to adapt a pre-trained source model to a target domain using only unlabeled target data. Current SFDA methods face challenges in effectively leveraging pre-trained knowledge and exploiting target domain data. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer remarkable capabilities in understanding visual and textual information, but their applicability to SFDA poses challenges such as instruction-following failures, intensive computational demands, and difficulties in performance measurement prior to adaptation. To alleviate these issues, we propose Reliability-based Curriculum Learning (RCL), a novel framework that integrates multiple MLLMs for knowledge exploitation via pseudo-labeling in SFDA. Our framework incorporates proposed Reliable Knowledge Transfer, Self-correcting and MLLM-guided Knowledge Expansion, and Multi-hot Masking Refinement to progressively exploit unlabeled data in the target domain. RCL achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on multiple SFDA benchmarks, e.g., $\textbf{+9.4%}$ on DomainNet, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing adaptability and robustness without requiring access to source data.

<p>Abstract: The consistency model (CM) has recently made significant progress in accelerating the generation of diffusion models. However, its application to high-resolution, text-conditioned image generation in the latent space (a.k.a., LCM) remains unsatisfactory. In this paper, we identify three key flaws in the current design of LCM. We investigate the reasons behind these limitations and propose the Phased Consistency Model (PCM), which generalizes the design space and addresses all identified limitations. Our evaluations demonstrate that PCM significantly outperforms LCM across 1--16 step generation settings. While PCM is specifically designed for multi-step refinement, it achieves even superior or comparable 1-step generation results to previously state-of-the-art specifically designed 1-step methods. Furthermore, we show that PCM's methodology is versatile and applicable to video generation, enabling us to train the state-of-the-art few-step text-to-video generator.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mahrokh Najaf, Gregory Ongie</p>
<p>Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful tool for solving inverse problems in computer vision and computational imaging. INRs represent images as continuous domain functions realized by a neural network taking spatial coordinates as inputs. However, unlike traditional pixel representations, little is known about the sample complexity of estimating images using INRs in the context of linear inverse problems. Towards this end, we study the sampling requirements for recovery of a continuous domain image from its low-pass Fourier coefficients by fitting a single hidden-layer INR with ReLU activation and a Fourier features layer using a generalized form of weight decay regularization. Our key insight is to relate minimizers of this non-convex parameter space optimization problem to minimizers of a convex penalty defined over an infinite-dimensional space of measures. We identify a sufficient number of samples for which an image realized by a width-1 INR is exactly recoverable by solving the INR training problem, and give a conjecture for the general width-$W$ case. To validate our theory, we empirically assess the probability of achieving exact recovery of images realized by low-width single hidden-layer INRs, and illustrate the performance of INR on super-resolution recovery of more realistic continuous domain phantom images.</p>

<p>Abstract: Whole-body control for humanoids is challenging due to the high-dimensional nature of the problem, coupled with the inherent instability of a bipedal morphology. Learning from visual observations further exacerbates this difficulty. In this work, we explore highly data-driven approaches to visual whole-body humanoid control based on reinforcement learning, without any simplifying assumptions, reward design, or skill primitives. Specifically, we propose a hierarchical world model in which a high-level agent generates commands based on visual observations for a low-level agent to execute, both of which are trained with rewards. Our approach produces highly performant control policies in 8 tasks with a simulated 56-DoF humanoid, while synthesizing motions that are broadly preferred by humans.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihao Huang, Liangru Sun, Qing Guo, Felix Juefei-Xu, Jiayi Zhu, Jincao Feng, Yang Liu, Geguang Pu</p>
<p>Abstract: Most researchers have tried to enhance the robustness of DNNs by revealing and repairing the vulnerability of DNNs with specialized adversarial examples. Parts of the attack examples have imperceptible perturbations restricted by Lp norm. However, due to their high-frequency property, the adversarial examples can be defended by denoising methods and are hard to realize in the physical world. To avoid the defects, some works have proposed unrestricted attacks to gain better robustness and practicality. It is disappointing that these examples usually look unnatural and can alert the guards. In this paper, we propose Adversarial Lightness Attack (ALA), a white-box unrestricted adversarial attack that focuses on modifying the lightness of the images. The shape and color of the samples, which are crucial to human perception, are barely influenced. To obtain adversarial examples with a high attack success rate, we propose unconstrained enhancement in terms of the light and shade relationship in images. To enhance the naturalness of images, we craft the naturalness-aware regularization according to the range and distribution of light. The effectiveness of ALA is verified on two popular datasets for different tasks (i.e., ImageNet for image classification and Places-365 for scene recognition).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yong Guo, Mingkui Tan, Zeshuai Deng, Jingdong Wang, Qi Chen, Jiezhang Cao, Yanwu Xu, Jian Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks have exhibited remarkable performance in image super-resolution (SR) tasks by learning a mapping from low-resolution (LR) images to high-resolution (HR) images. However, the SR problem is typically an ill-posed problem and existing methods would come with several limitations. First, the possible mapping space of SR can be extremely large since there may exist many different HR images that can be super-resolved from the same LR image. As a result, it is hard to directly learn a promising SR mapping from such a large space. Second, it is often inevitable to develop very large models with extremely high computational cost to yield promising SR performance. In practice, one can use model compression techniques to obtain compact models by reducing model redundancy. Nevertheless, it is hard for existing model compression methods to accurately identify the redundant components due to the extremely large SR mapping space. To alleviate the first challenge, we propose a dual regression learning scheme to reduce the space of possible SR mappings. Specifically, in addition to the mapping from LR to HR images, we learn an additional dual regression mapping to estimate the downsampling kernel and reconstruct LR images. In this way, the dual mapping acts as a constraint to reduce the space of possible mappings. To address the second challenge, we propose a dual regression compression (DRC) method to reduce model redundancy in both layer-level and channel-level based on channel pruning. Specifically, we first develop a channel number search method that minimizes the dual regression loss to determine the redundancy of each layer. Given the searched channel numbers, we further exploit the dual regression manner to evaluate the importance of channels and prune the redundant ones. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our method in obtaining accurate and efficient SR models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdulla Jasem Almansoori, Samuel Horv\'ath, Martin Tak\'a\v{c}</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning has become a popular machine learning paradigm with many potential real-life applications, including recommendation systems, the Internet of Things (IoT), healthcare, and self-driving cars. Though most current applications focus on classification-based tasks, learning personalized generative models remains largely unexplored, and their benefits in the heterogeneous setting still need to be better understood. This work proposes a novel architecture combining global client-agnostic and local client-specific generative models. We show that using standard techniques for training federated models, our proposed model achieves privacy and personalization by implicitly disentangling the globally consistent representation (i.e. content) from the client-dependent variations (i.e. style). Using such decomposition, personalized models can generate locally unseen labels while preserving the given style of the client and can predict the labels for all clients with high accuracy by training a simple linear classifier on the global content features. Furthermore, disentanglement enables other essential applications, such as data anonymization, by sharing only the content. Extensive experimental evaluation corroborates our findings, and we also discuss a theoretical motivation for the proposed approach.</p>

<p>Abstract: Heterogeneous face re-identification, namely matching heterogeneous faces across disjoint visible light (VIS) and near-infrared (NIR) cameras, has become an important problem in video surveillance application. However, the large domain discrepancy between heterogeneous NIR-VIS faces makes the performance of face re-identification degraded dramatically. To solve this problem, a multimodal fusion ranking optimization algorithm for heterogeneous face re-identification is proposed in this paper. Firstly, we design a heterogeneous face translation network to obtain multimodal face pairs, including NIR-VIS/NIR-NIR/VIS-VIS face pairs, through mutual transformation between NIR-VIS faces. Secondly, we propose linear and non-linear fusion strategies to aggregate initial ranking lists of multimodal face pairs and acquire the optimized re-ranked list based on modal complementarity. The experimental results show that the proposed multimodal fusion ranking optimization algorithm can effectively utilize the complementarity and outperforms some relative methods on the SCface dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract: SpikeCV is a new open-source computer vision platform for the spike camera, which is a neuromorphic visual sensor that has developed rapidly in recent years. In the spike camera, each pixel position directly accumulates the light intensity and asynchronously fires spikes. The output binary spikes can reach a frequency of 40,000 Hz. As a new type of visual expression, spike sequence has high spatiotemporal completeness and preserves the continuous visual information of the external world. Taking advantage of the low latency and high dynamic range of the spike camera, many spike-based algorithms have made significant progress, such as high-quality imaging and ultra-high-speed target detection.
  To build up a community ecology for the spike vision to facilitate more users to take advantage of the spike camera, SpikeCV provides a variety of ultra-high-speed scene datasets, hardware interfaces, and an easy-to-use modules library. SpikeCV focuses on encapsulation for spike data, standardization for dataset interfaces, modularization for vision tasks, and real-time applications for challenging scenes. With the advent of the open-source Python ecosystem, modules of SpikeCV can be used as a Python library to fulfilled most of the numerical analysis needs of researchers. We demonstrate the efficiency of the SpikeCV on offline inference and real-time applications.

<p>Abstract: Distributed sparse block codes (SBCs) exhibit compact representations for encoding and manipulating symbolic data structures using fixed-width vectors. One major challenge however is to disentangle, or factorize, the distributed representation of data structures into their constituent elements without having to search through all possible combinations. This factorization becomes more challenging when SBCs vectors are noisy due to perceptual uncertainty and approximations made by modern neural networks to generate the query SBCs vectors. To address these challenges, we first propose a fast and highly accurate method for factorizing a more flexible and hence generalized form of SBCs, dubbed GSBCs. Our iterative factorizer introduces a threshold-based nonlinear activation, conditional random sampling, and an $\ell_\infty$-based similarity metric. Secondly, the proposed factorizer maintains a high accuracy when queried by noisy product vectors generated using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This facilitates its application in replacing the large fully connected layer (FCL) in CNNs, whereby $C$ trainable class vectors, or attribute combinations, can be implicitly represented by our factorizer having $F$-factor codebooks, each with $\sqrt[\leftroot{-2}\uproot{2}F]{C}$ fixed codevectors. We provide a methodology to flexibly integrate our factorizer in the classification layer of CNNs with a novel loss function. With this integration, the convolutional layers can generate a noisy product vector that our factorizer can still decode, whereby the decoded factors can have different interpretations based on downstream tasks. We demonstrate the feasibility of our method on four deep CNN architectures over CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1K, and RAVEN datasets. In all use cases, the number of parameters and operations are notably reduced compared to the FCL.</p>

<p>Abstract: The "pre-training then fine-tuning (FT)" paradigm is widely adopted to boost the model performance of deep learning-based methods for medical volumetric segmentation. However, conventional full FT incurs high computational and memory costs. Thus, it is of increasing importance to fine-tune pre-trained models for medical volumetric segmentation tasks in a both effective and parameter-efficient manner. In this paper, we introduce a new framework named Med-Tuning to realize parameter-efficient tuning (PET) for medical volumetric segmentation task and an efficient plug-and-play module named Med-Adapter for task-specific feature extraction. With a small number of tuned parameters, our framework enhances the 2D baselines's precision on segmentation tasks, which are pre-trained on natural images. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets (CT and MRI modalities) show that our method achieves better results than previous PET methods on volumetric segmentation tasks. Compared to full FT, Med-Tuning reduces the fine-tuned model parameters by up to 4x, with even better segmentation performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shady Abu-Hussein, Raja Giryes</p>
<p>Abstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) have recently gained significant attention. DDPMs compose a Markovian process that begins in the data domain and gradually adds noise until reaching pure white noise. DDPMs generate high-quality samples from complex data distributions by defining an inverse process and training a deep neural network to learn this mapping. However, these models are inefficient because they require many diffusion steps to produce aesthetically pleasing samples. Additionally, unlike generative adversarial networks (GANs), the latent space of diffusion models is less interpretable. In this work, we propose to generalize the denoising diffusion process into an Upsampling Diffusion Probabilistic Model (UDPM). In the forward process, we reduce the latent variable dimension through downsampling, followed by the traditional noise perturbation. As a result, the reverse process gradually denoises and upsamples the latent variable to produce a sample from the data distribution. We formalize the Markovian diffusion processes of UDPM and demonstrate its generation capabilities on the popular FFHQ, AFHQv2, and CIFAR10 datasets. UDPM generates images with as few as three network evaluations, whose overall computational cost is less than a single DDPM or EDM step, while achieving an FID score of 6.86. This surpasses current state-of-the-art efficient diffusion models that use a single denoising step for sampling. Additionally, UDPM offers an interpretable and interpolable latent space, which gives it an advantage over traditional DDPMs. Our code is available online: \url{https://github.com/shadyabh/UDPM/}</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanxi Li, Jingqi Wu, Hao Chen, Mingwen Wang, Chunhua Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Anomaly Detection is challenging as usually only the normal samples are seen during training and the detector needs to discover anomalies on-the-fly. The recently proposed deep-learning-based approaches could somehow alleviate the problem but there is still a long way to go in obtaining an industrial-class anomaly detector for real-world applications. On the other hand, in some particular AD tasks, a few anomalous samples are labeled manually for achieving higher accuracy. However, this performance gain is at the cost of considerable annotation efforts, which can be intractable in many practical scenarios.
  In this work, the above two problems are addressed in a unified framework. Firstly, inspired by the success of the patch-matching-based AD algorithms, we train a sliding vision transformer over the residuals generated by a novel position-constrained patch-matching. Secondly, the conventional pixel-wise segmentation problem is cast into a block-wise classification problem. Thus the sliding transformer can attain even higher accuracy with much less annotation labor. Thirdly, to further reduce the labeling cost, we propose to label the anomalous regions using only bounding boxes. The unlabeled regions caused by the weak labels are effectively exploited using a highly-customized semi-supervised learning scheme equipped with two novel data augmentation methods. The proposed method outperforms all the state-of-the-art approaches using all the evaluation metrics in both the unsupervised and supervised scenarios. On the popular MVTec-AD dataset, our SemiREST algorithm obtains the Average Precision (AP) of 81.2% in the unsupervised condition and 84.4% AP for supervised anomaly detection. Surprisingly, with the bounding-box-based semi-supervisions, SemiREST still outperforms the SOTA methods with full supervision (83.8% AP) on MVTec-AD.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenjun Jiang, Tianlong Fan, Changhao Li, Chuanfu Zhang, Tao Zhang, Zong-fu Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Connectivity robustness, a crucial aspect for understanding, optimizing, and repairing complex networks, has traditionally been evaluated through time-consuming and often impractical simulations. Fortunately, machine learning provides a new avenue for addressing this challenge. However, several key issues remain unresolved, including the performance in more general edge removal scenarios, capturing robustness through attack curves instead of directly training for robustness, scalability of predictive tasks, and transferability of predictive capabilities. In this paper, we address these challenges by designing a convolutional neural networks (CNN) model with spatial pyramid pooling networks (SPP-net), adapting existing evaluation metrics, redesigning the attack modes, introducing appropriate filtering rules, and incorporating the value of robustness as training data. The results demonstrate the thoroughness of the proposed CNN framework in addressing the challenges of high computational time across various network types, failure component types and failure scenarios. However, the performance of the proposed CNN model varies: for evaluation tasks that are consistent with the trained network type, the proposed CNN model consistently achieves accurate evaluations of both attack curves and robustness values across all removal scenarios. When the predicted network type differs from the trained network, the CNN model still demonstrates favorable performance in the scenario of random node failure, showcasing its scalability and performance transferability. Nevertheless, the performance falls short of expectations in other removal scenarios. This observed scenario-sensitivity in the evaluation of network features has been overlooked in previous studies and necessitates further attention and optimization. Lastly, we discuss important unresolved questions and further investigation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fabio Ferreira, Ivo Rapant, J\"org K. H. Franke, Frank Hutter</p>
<p>Abstract: Many Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods aim for model invariance to different image augmentations known as views. To achieve this invariance, conventional approaches make use of random sampling operations within the image augmentation pipeline. We hypothesize that the efficacy of pretraining pipelines based on conventional random view sampling can be enhanced by explicitly selecting views that benefit the learning progress. A simple, yet effective approach is to select hard views that yield a higher loss. In this paper, we present Hard View Pretraining (HVP), a learning-free strategy that builds upon this hypothesis and extends random view generation. HVP exposes the model to harder, more challenging samples during SSL pretraining, which enhances downstream performance. It encompasses the following iterative steps: 1) randomly sample multiple views and forward each view through the pretrained model, 2) create pairs of two views and compute their loss, 3) adversarially select the pair yielding the highest loss depending on the current model state, and 4) run the backward pass with the selected pair. As a result, HVP achieves linear evaluation accuracy improvements of 1% on average on ImageNet for both 100 and 300 epoch pretraining and similar improvements on transfer tasks across DINO, SimSiam, iBOT, and SimCLR.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaewoo Lee, Jaehong Yoon, Wonjae Kim, Yunji Kim, Sung Ju Hwang</p>
<p>Abstract: Continuously learning a variety of audio-video semantics over time is crucial for audio-related reasoning tasks in our ever-evolving world. However, this is a nontrivial problem and poses two critical challenges: sparse spatio-temporal correlation between audio-video pairs and multimodal correlation overwriting that forgets audio-video relations. To tackle this problem, we propose a new continual audio-video pre-training method with two novel ideas: (1) Localized Patch Importance Scoring: we introduce a multimodal encoder to determine the importance score for each patch, emphasizing semantically intertwined audio-video patches. (2) Replay-guided Correlation Assessment: to reduce the corruption of previously learned audiovisual knowledge due to drift, we propose to assess the correlation of the current patches on the past steps to identify the patches exhibiting high correlations with the past steps. Based on the results from the two ideas, we perform probabilistic patch selection for effective continual audio-video pre-training. Experimental validation on multiple benchmarks shows that our method achieves a 3.69%p of relative performance gain in zero-shot retrieval tasks compared to strong continual learning baselines, while reducing memory consumption by ~45%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenyi Liao, Zhijie Deng</p>
<p>Abstract: Leveraging pre-trained conditional diffusion models for video editing without further tuning has gained increasing attention due to its promise in film production, advertising, etc. Yet, seminal works in this line fall short in generation length, temporal coherence, or fidelity to the source video. This paper aims to bridge the gap, establishing a simple and effective baseline for training-free diffusion model-based long video editing. As suggested by prior arts, we build the pipeline upon ControlNet, which excels at various image editing tasks based on text prompts. To break down the length constraints caused by limited computational memory, we split the long video into consecutive windows and develop a novel cross-window attention mechanism to ensure the consistency of global style and maximize the smoothness among windows. To achieve more accurate control, we extract the information from the source video via DDIM inversion and integrate the outcomes into the latent states of the generations. We also incorporate a video frame interpolation model to mitigate the frame-level flickering issue. Extensive empirical studies verify the superior efficacy of our method over competing baselines across scenarios, including the replacement of the attributes of foreground objects, style transfer, and background replacement. Besides, our method manages to edit videos comprising hundreds of frames according to user requirements.

<p>Abstract: We present AutoDIR, an innovative all-in-one image restoration system incorporating latent diffusion. AutoDIR excels in its ability to automatically identify and restore images suffering from a range of unknown degradations. AutoDIR offers intuitive open-vocabulary image editing, empowering users to customize and enhance images according to their preferences. Specifically, AutoDIR consists of two key stages: a Blind Image Quality Assessment (BIQA) stage based on a semantic-agnostic vision-language model which automatically detects unknown image degradations for input images, an All-in-One Image Restoration (AIR) stage utilizes structural-corrected latent diffusion which handles multiple types of image degradations. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that AutoDIR outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for a wider range of image restoration tasks. The design of AutoDIR also enables flexible user control (via text prompt) and generalization to new tasks as a foundation model of image restoration.

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13613">Spanning Training Progress: Temporal Dual-Depth Scoring (TDDS) for Enhanced Dataset Pruning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Zhang, Jiawei Du, Yunsong Li, Weiying Xie, Joey Tianyi Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Dataset pruning aims to construct a coreset capable of achieving performance comparable to the original, full dataset. Most existing dataset pruning methods rely on snapshot-based criteria to identify representative samples, often resulting in poor generalization across various pruning and cross-architecture scenarios. Recent studies have addressed this issue by expanding the scope of training dynamics considered, including factors such as forgetting event and probability change, typically using an averaging approach. However, these works struggle to integrate a broader range of training dynamics without overlooking well-generalized samples, which may not be sufficiently highlighted in an averaging manner. In this study, we propose a novel dataset pruning method termed as Temporal Dual-Depth Scoring (TDDS), to tackle this problem. TDDS utilizes a dual-depth strategy to achieve a balance between incorporating extensive training dynamics and identifying representative samples for dataset pruning. In the first depth, we estimate the series of each sample's individual contributions spanning the training progress, ensuring comprehensive integration of training dynamics. In the second depth, we focus on the variability of the sample-wise contributions identified in the first depth to highlight well-generalized samples. Extensive experiments conducted on CIFAR and ImageNet datasets verify the superiority of TDDS over previous SOTA methods. Specifically on CIFAR-100, our method achieves 54.51% accuracy with only 10% training data, surpassing random selection by 7.83% and other comparison methods by at least 12.69%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shijie Wang, Qi Zhao, Minh Quan Do, Nakul Agarwal, Kwonjoon Lee, Chen Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: What makes good representations for video understanding, such as anticipating future activities, or answering video-conditioned questions? While earlier approaches focus on end-to-end learning directly from video pixels, we propose to revisit text-based representations, such as general-purpose video captions, which are interpretable and can be directly consumed by large language models (LLMs). Intuitively, different video understanding tasks may require representations that are complementary and at different granularity. To this end, we propose versatile action models (Vamos), a learning framework powered by a large language model as the ``reasoner'', and can flexibly leverage visual embedding and free-form text descriptions as its input. To interpret the important text evidence for question answering, we generalize the concept bottleneck model to work with tokens and nonlinear models, which uses hard attention to select a small subset of tokens from the free-form text as inputs to the LLM reasoner. We evaluate Vamos on four complementary video understanding benchmarks, Ego4D, NeXT-QA, IntentQA, and EgoSchema, on its capability to model temporal dynamics, encode visual history, and perform reasoning. Surprisingly, we observe that text-based representations consistently achieve competitive performance on all benchmarks, and that visual embeddings provide marginal or no performance improvement, demonstrating the effectiveness of text-based video representation in the LLM era. We also demonstrate that our token bottleneck model is able to select relevant evidence from free-form text, support test-time intervention, and achieves nearly 5 times inference speedup while keeping a competitive question answering performance. Code and models are publicly released at https://brown-palm.github.io/Vamos/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Deepak Sridhar, Yunsheng Li, Nuno Vasconcelos</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision Transformers have achieved impressive performance in many vision tasks. While the token mixer or attention block has been studied in great detail, much less research has been devoted to the channel mixer or feature mixing block (FFN or MLP), which accounts for a significant portion of of the model parameters and computation. In this work, we show that the dense MLP connections can be replaced with a block diagonal MLP structure that supports larger expansion ratios by splitting MLP features into groups. To improve the feature clusters formed by this structure we propose the use of a lightweight, parameter-free, channel covariance attention (CCA) mechanism as a parallel branch during training. This enables gradual feature mixing across channel groups during training whose contribution decays to zero as the training progresses to convergence. In result, the CCA block can be discarded during inference, enabling enhanced performance at no additional computational cost. The resulting $\textit{Scalable CHannEl MixEr}$ (SCHEME) can be plugged into any ViT architecture to obtain a gamut of models with different trade-offs between complexity and performance by controlling the block diagonal MLP structure. This is shown by the introduction of a new family of SCHEMEformer models. Experiments on image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation, with different ViT backbones, consistently demonstrate substantial accuracy gains over existing designs, especially for lower complexity regimes. The SCHEMEformer family is shown to establish new Pareto frontiers for accuracy vs FLOPS, accuracy vs model size, and accuracy vs throughput, especially for fast transformers of small size.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youngwan Lee, Kwanyong Park, Yoorhim Cho, Yong-Ju Lee, Sung Ju Hwang</p>
<p>Abstract: As text-to-image (T2I) synthesis models increase in size, they demand higher inference costs due to the need for more expensive GPUs with larger memory, which makes it challenging to reproduce these models in addition to the restricted access to training datasets. Our study aims to reduce these inference costs and explores how far the generative capabilities of T2I models can be extended using only publicly available datasets and open-source models. To this end, by using the de facto standard text-to-image model, Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL), we present three key practices in building an efficient T2I model: (1) Knowledge distillation: we explore how to effectively distill the generation capability of SDXL into an efficient U-Net and find that self-attention is the most crucial part. (2) Data: despite fewer samples, high-resolution images with rich captions are more crucial than a larger number of low-resolution images with short captions. (3) Teacher: Step-distilled Teacher allows T2I models to reduce the noising steps. Based on these findings, we build two types of efficient text-to-image models, called KOALA-Turbo &-Lightning, with two compact U-Nets (1B & 700M), reducing the model size up to 54% and 69% of the SDXL U-Net. In particular, the KOALA-Lightning-700M is 4x faster than SDXL while still maintaining satisfactory generation quality. Moreover, unlike SDXL, our KOALA models can generate 1024px high-resolution images on consumer-grade GPUs with 8GB of VRAMs (3060Ti). We believe that our KOALA models will have a significant practical impact, serving as cost-effective alternatives to SDXL for academic researchers and general users in resource-constrained environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Synthesizing high-fidelity and emotion-controllable talking video portraits, with audio-lip sync, vivid expressions, realistic head poses, and eye blinks, has been an important and challenging task in recent years. Most existing methods suffer in achieving personalized and precise emotion control, smooth transitions between different emotion states, and the generation of diverse motions. To tackle these challenges, we present GMTalker, a Gaussian mixture-based emotional talking portraits generation framework. Specifically, we propose a Gaussian mixture-based expression generator that can construct a continuous and disentangled latent space, achieving more flexible emotion manipulation. Furthermore, we introduce a normalizing flow-based motion generator pretrained on a large dataset with a wide-range motion to generate diverse head poses, blinks, and eyeball movements. Finally, we propose a personalized emotion-guided head generator with an emotion mapping network that can synthesize high-fidelity and faithful emotional video portraits. Both quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate our method outperforms previous methods in image quality, photo-realism, emotion accuracy, and motion diversity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gu\'enol\'e Fiche, Simon Leglaive, Xavier Alameda-Pineda, Antonio Agudo, Francesc Moreno-Noguer</p>
<p>Abstract: Previous works on Human Pose and Shape Estimation (HPSE) from RGB images can be broadly categorized into two main groups: parametric and non-parametric approaches. Parametric techniques leverage a low-dimensional statistical body model for realistic results, whereas recent non-parametric methods achieve higher precision by directly regressing the 3D coordinates of the human body mesh. This work introduces a novel paradigm to address the HPSE problem, involving a low-dimensional discrete latent representation of the human mesh and framing HPSE as a classification task. Instead of predicting body model parameters or 3D vertex coordinates, we focus on predicting the proposed discrete latent representation, which can be decoded into a registered human mesh. This innovative paradigm offers two key advantages. Firstly, predicting a low-dimensional discrete representation confines our predictions to the space of anthropomorphic poses and shapes even when little training data is available. Secondly, by framing the problem as a classification task, we can harness the discriminative power inherent in neural networks. The proposed model, VQ-HPS, predicts the discrete latent representation of the mesh. The experimental results demonstrate that VQ-HPS outperforms the current state-of-the-art non-parametric approaches while yielding results as realistic as those produced by parametric methods when trained with little data. VQ-HPS also shows promising results when training on large-scale datasets, highlighting the significant potential of the classification approach for HPSE.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiyuan Ou, Pei Zhang, Sihang Zhou, En Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Late fusion multi-view clustering (LFMVC) has become a rapidly growing class of methods in the multi-view clustering (MVC) field, owing to its excellent computational speed and clustering performance. One bottleneck faced by existing late fusion methods is that they are usually aligned to the average kernel function, which makes the clustering performance highly dependent on the quality of datasets. Another problem is that they require subsequent k-means clustering after obtaining the consensus partition matrix to get the final discrete labels, and the resulting separation of the label learning and cluster structure optimization processes limits the integrity of these models. To address the above issues, we propose an integrated framework named One-Step Late Fusion Multi-view Clustering with Compressed Subspace (OS-LFMVC-CS). Specifically, we use the consensus subspace to align the partition matrix while optimizing the partition fusion, and utilize the fused partition matrix to guide the learning of discrete labels. A six-step iterative optimization approach with verified convergence is proposed. Sufficient experiments on multiple datasets validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method.</p>

Materials are crucial components of virtual relightable assets, defining the interaction of light at the surface of geometries. Given their importance, significant research effort was dedicated to their representation, creation and acquisition. However, in the past 6 years, most research in material acquisiton or generation relied either on the same unique dataset, or on company-owned huge library of procedural materials. With this dataset we propose a significantly larger, more diverse, and higher resolution set of materials than previously publicly available. We carefully discuss the data collection process and demonstrate the benefits of this dataset on material acquisition and generation applications. The complete data further contains metadata with each material's origin, license, category, tags, creation method and, when available, descriptions and physical size, as well as 3M+ renderings of the augmented materials, in 1K, under various environment lightings.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Edward Sanderson, Bogdan J. Matuszewski</p>
<p>Abstract: Solutions to vision tasks in gastrointestinal endoscopy (GIE) conventionally use image encoders pretrained in a supervised manner with ImageNet-1k as backbones. However, the use of modern self-supervised pretraining algorithms and a recent dataset of 100k unlabelled GIE images (Hyperkvasir-unlabelled) may allow for improvements. In this work, we study the fine-tuned performance of models with ResNet50 and ViT-B backbones pretrained in self-supervised and supervised manners with ImageNet-1k and Hyperkvasir-unlabelled (self-supervised only) in a range of GIE vision tasks. In addition to identifying the most suitable pretraining pipeline and backbone architecture for each task, out of those considered, our results suggest three general principles. Firstly, that self-supervised pretraining generally produces more suitable backbones for GIE vision tasks than supervised pretraining. Secondly, that self-supervised pretraining with ImageNet-1k is typically more suitable than pretraining with Hyperkvasir-unlabelled, with the notable exception of monocular depth estimation in colonoscopy. Thirdly, that ViT-Bs are more suitable in polyp segmentation and monocular depth estimation in colonoscopy, ResNet50s are more suitable in polyp detection, and both architectures perform similarly in anatomical landmark recognition and pathological finding characterisation. We hope this work draws attention to the complexity of pretraining for GIE vision tasks, informs this development of more suitable approaches than the convention, and inspires further research on this topic to help advance this development.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhitong Xiong, Yi Wang, Fahong Zhang, Xiao Xiang Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models characterized by extensive parameters and trained on large-scale datasets have demonstrated remarkable efficacy across various downstream tasks for remote sensing data. Current remote sensing foundation models typically specialize in a single modality or a specific spatial resolution range, limiting their versatility for downstream datasets. While there have been attempts to develop multi-modal remote sensing foundation models, they typically employ separate vision encoders for each modality or spatial resolution, necessitating a switch in backbones contingent upon the input data. To address this issue, we introduce a simple yet effective method, termed OFA-Net (One-For-All Network): employing a single, shared Transformer backbone for multiple data modalities with different spatial resolutions. Using the masked image modeling mechanism, we pre-train a single Transformer backbone on a curated multi-modal dataset with this simple design. Then the backbone model can be used in different downstream tasks, thus forging a path towards a unified foundation backbone model in Earth vision. The proposed method is evaluated on 12 distinct downstream tasks and demonstrates promising performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: 3D lanes offer a more comprehensive understanding of the road surface geometry than 2D lanes, thereby providing crucial references for driving decisions and trajectory planning. While many efforts aim to improve prediction accuracy, we recognize that an efficient network can bring results closer to lane modeling. However, if the modeling data is imprecise, the results might not accurately capture the real-world scenario. Therefore, accurate lane modeling is essential to align prediction results closely with the environment. This study centers on efficient and accurate lane modeling, proposing a joint modeling approach that combines Bezier curves and interpolation methods. Furthermore, based on this lane modeling approach, we developed a Global2Local Lane Matching method with Bezier Control-Point and Key-Point, which serve as a comprehensive solution that leverages hierarchical features with two mathematical models to ensure a precise match. We also introduce a novel 3D Spatial Encoder, representing an exploration of 3D surround-view lane detection research. The framework is suitable for front-view or surround-view 3D lane detection. By directly outputting the key points of lanes in 3D space, it overcomes the limitations of anchor-based methods, enabling accurate prediction of closed-loop or U-shaped lanes and effective adaptation to complex road conditions. This innovative method establishes a new benchmark in front-view 3D lane detection on the Openlane dataset and achieves competitive performance in surround-view 2D lane detection on the Argoverse2 dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shyam Sundar Kannan, Byung-Cheol Min</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual place recognition is a challenging task in the field of computer vision, and autonomous robotics and vehicles, which aims to identify a location or a place from visual inputs. Contemporary methods in visual place recognition employ convolutional neural networks and utilize every region within the image for the place recognition task. However, the presence of dynamic and distracting elements in the image may impact the effectiveness of the place recognition process. Therefore, it is meaningful to focus on task-relevant regions of the image for improved recognition. In this paper, we present PlaceFormer, a novel transformer-based approach for visual place recognition. PlaceFormer employs patch tokens from the transformer to create global image descriptors, which are then used for image retrieval. To re-rank the retrieved images, PlaceFormer merges the patch tokens from the transformer to form multi-scale patches. Utilizing the transformer's self-attention mechanism, it selects patches that correspond to task-relevant areas in an image. These selected patches undergo geometric verification, generating similarity scores across different patch sizes. Subsequently, spatial scores from each patch size are fused to produce a final similarity score. This score is then used to re-rank the images initially retrieved using global image descriptors. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that PlaceFormer outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency, requiring less time and memory.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Serdar Erisen</p>
<p>Abstract: Improving the efficiency of state-of-the-art methods in semantic segmentation requires overcoming the increasing computational cost as well as issues such as fusing semantic information from global and local contexts. Based on the recent success and problems that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) encounter in semantic segmentation, this research proposes an encoder-decoder architecture with a unique efficient residual network, Efficient-ResNet. Attention-boosting gates (AbGs) and attention-boosting modules (AbMs) are deployed by aiming to fuse the equivariant and feature-based semantic information with the equivalent sizes of the output of global context of the efficient residual network in the encoder. Respectively, the decoder network is developed with the additional attention-fusion networks (AfNs) inspired by AbM. AfNs are designed to improve the efficiency in the one-to-one conversion of the semantic information by deploying additional convolution layers in the decoder part. Our network is tested on the challenging CamVid and Cityscapes datasets, and the proposed methods reveal significant improvements on the residual networks. To the best of our knowledge, the developed network, SERNet-Former, achieves state-of-the-art results (84.62 % mean IoU) on CamVid dataset and challenging results (87.35 % mean IoU) on Cityscapes validation dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bumsoo Kim, Abdul Muqeet, Kyuchul Lee, Sanghyun Seo</p>
<p>Abstract: Face re-aging is a prominent field in computer vision and graphics, with significant applications in photorealistic domains such as movies, advertising, and live streaming. Recently, the need to apply face re-aging to non-photorealistic images, like comics, illustrations, and animations, has emerged as an extension in various entertainment sectors. However, the lack of a network that can seamlessly edit the apparent age in NPR images has limited these tasks to a naive, sequential approach. This often results in unpleasant artifacts and a loss of facial attributes due to domain discrepancies. In this paper, we introduce a novel one-stage method for face re-aging combined with portrait style transfer, executed in a single generative step. We leverage existing face re-aging and style transfer networks, both trained within the same PR domain. Our method uniquely fuses distinct latent vectors, each responsible for managing aging-related attributes and NPR appearance. By adopting an exemplar-based approach, our method offers greater flexibility compared to domain-level fine-tuning approaches, which typically require separate training or fine-tuning for each domain. This effectively addresses the limitation of requiring paired datasets for re-aging and domain-level, data-driven approaches for stylization. Our experiments show that our model can effortlessly generate re-aged images while simultaneously transferring the style of examples, maintaining both natural appearance and controllability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Darshana Saravanan, Naresh Manwani, Vineet Gandhi</p>
<p>Abstract: Partial label learning (PLL) is a weakly-supervised learning paradigm where each training instance is paired with a set of candidate labels (partial label), one of which is the true label. Noisy PLL (NPLL) relaxes this constraint by allowing some partial labels to not contain the true label, enhancing the practicality of the problem. Our work centres on NPLL and presents a minimalistic framework that initially assigns pseudo-labels to images by exploiting the noisy partial labels through a weighted nearest neighbour algorithm. These pseudo-label and image pairs are then used to train a deep neural network classifier with label smoothing. The classifier's features and predictions are subsequently employed to refine and enhance the accuracy of pseudo-labels. We perform thorough experiments on seven datasets and compare against nine NPLL and PLL methods. We achieve state-of-the-art results in all studied settings from the prior literature, obtaining substantial gains in fine-grained classification and extreme noise scenarios. Further, we show the promising generalisation capability of our framework in realistic crowd-sourced datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chong Zeng, Yue Dong, Pieter Peers, Youkang Kong, Hongzhi Wu, Xin Tong</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for exerting fine-grained lighting control during text-driven diffusion-based image generation. While existing diffusion models already have the ability to generate images under any lighting condition, without additional guidance these models tend to correlate image content and lighting. Moreover, text prompts lack the necessary expressional power to describe detailed lighting setups. To provide the content creator with fine-grained control over the lighting during image generation, we augment the text-prompt with detailed lighting information in the form of radiance hints, i.e., visualizations of the scene geometry with a homogeneous canonical material under the target lighting. However, the scene geometry needed to produce the radiance hints is unknown. Our key observation is that we only need to guide the diffusion process, hence exact radiance hints are not necessary; we only need to point the diffusion model in the right direction. Based on this observation, we introduce a three stage method for controlling the lighting during image generation. In the first stage, we leverage a standard pretrained diffusion model to generate a provisional image under uncontrolled lighting. Next, in the second stage, we resynthesize and refine the foreground object in the generated image by passing the target lighting to a refined diffusion model, named DiLightNet, using radiance hints computed on a coarse shape of the foreground object inferred from the provisional image. To retain the texture details, we multiply the radiance hints with a neural encoding of the provisional synthesized image before passing it to DiLightNet. Finally, in the third stage, we resynthesize the background to be consistent with the lighting on the foreground object. We demonstrate and validate our lighting controlled diffusion model on a variety of text prompts and lighting conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhao Liu, Zhanghan Ke, Fang Liu, Nanxuan Zhao, Rynson W. H. Lau</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models trained on large-scale datasets have achieved remarkable progress in image synthesis. However, due to the randomness in the diffusion process, they often struggle with handling diverse low-level tasks that require details preservation. To overcome this limitation, we present a new Diff-Plugin framework to enable a single pre-trained diffusion model to generate high-fidelity results across a variety of low-level tasks. Specifically, we first propose a lightweight Task-Plugin module with a dual branch design to provide task-specific priors, guiding the diffusion process in preserving image content. We then propose a Plugin-Selector that can automatically select different Task-Plugins based on the text instruction, allowing users to edit images by indicating multiple low-level tasks with natural language. We conduct extensive experiments on 8 low-level vision tasks. The results demonstrate the superiority of Diff-Plugin over existing methods, particularly in real-world scenarios. Our ablations further validate that Diff-Plugin is stable, schedulable, and supports robust training across different dataset sizes.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04880">An Item is Worth a Prompt: Versatile Image Editing with Disentangled Control</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Aosong Feng, Weikang Qiu, Jinbin Bai, Xiao Zhang, Zhen Dong, Kaicheng Zhou, Rex Ying, Leandros Tassiulas</p>
<p>Abstract: Building on the success of text-to-image diffusion models (DPMs), image editing is an important application to enable human interaction with AI-generated content. Among various editing methods, editing within the prompt space gains more attention due to its capacity and simplicity of controlling semantics. However, since diffusion models are commonly pretrained on descriptive text captions, direct editing of words in text prompts usually leads to completely different generated images, violating the requirements for image editing. On the other hand, existing editing methods usually consider introducing spatial masks to preserve the identity of unedited regions, which are usually ignored by DPMs and therefore lead to inharmonic editing results. Targeting these two challenges, in this work, we propose to disentangle the comprehensive image-prompt interaction into several item-prompt interactions, with each item linked to a special learned prompt. The resulting framework, named D-Edit, is based on pretrained diffusion models with cross-attention layers disentangled and adopts a two-step optimization to build item-prompt associations. Versatile image editing can then be applied to specific items by manipulating the corresponding prompts. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results in four types of editing operations including image-based, text-based, mask-based editing, and item removal, covering most types of editing applications, all within a single unified framework. Notably, D-Edit is the first framework that can (1) achieve item editing through mask editing and (2) combine image and text-based editing. We demonstrate the quality and versatility of the editing results for a diverse collection of images through both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Jiao, Shaoxiang Chen, Zequn Jie, Jingjing Chen, Lin Ma, Yu-Gang Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Multimodal Model (LMM) is a hot research topic in the computer vision area and has also demonstrated remarkable potential across multiple disciplinary fields. A recent trend is to further extend and enhance the perception capabilities of LMMs. The current methods follow the paradigm of adapting the visual task outputs to the format of the language model, which is the main component of a LMM. This adaptation leads to convenient development of such LMMs with minimal modifications, however, it overlooks the intrinsic characteristics of diverse visual tasks and hinders the learning of perception capabilities. To address this issue, we propose a novel LMM architecture named Lumen, a Large multimodal model with versatile vision-centric capability enhancement. We decouple the LMM's learning of perception capabilities into task-agnostic and task-specific stages. Lumen first promotes fine-grained vision-language concept alignment, which is the fundamental capability for various visual tasks. Thus the output of the task-agnostic stage is a shared representation for all the tasks we address in this paper. Then the task-specific decoding is carried out by flexibly routing the shared representation to lightweight task decoders with negligible training efforts. Comprehensive experimental results on a series of vision-centric and VQA benchmarks indicate that our Lumen model not only achieves or surpasses the performance of existing LMM-based approaches in a range of vision-centric tasks while maintaining general visual understanding and instruction following capabilities.

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a complete refractive Structure-from-Motion (RSfM) framework for underwater 3D reconstruction using refractive camera setups (for both, flat- and dome-port underwater housings). Despite notable achievements in refractive multi-view geometry over the past decade, a robust, complete and publicly available solution for such tasks is not available at present, and often practical applications have to resort to approximating refraction effects by the intrinsic (distortion) parameters of a pinhole camera model. To fill this gap, we have integrated refraction considerations throughout the entire SfM process within the state-of-the-art, open-source SfM framework COLMAP. Numerical simulations and reconstruction results on synthetically generated but photo-realistic images with ground truth validate that enabling refraction does not compromise accuracy or robustness as compared to in-air reconstructions. Finally, we demonstrate the capability of our approach for large-scale refractive scenarios using a dataset consisting of nearly 6000 images.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaewoo Jung, Jisang Han, Honggyu An, Jiwon Kang, Seonghoon Park, Seungryong Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in real-time novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction. However, 3DGS heavily depends on the accurate initialization derived from Structure-from-Motion (SfM) methods. When the quality of the initial point cloud deteriorates, such as in the presence of noise or when using randomly initialized point cloud, 3DGS often undergoes large performance drops. To address this limitation, we propose a novel optimization strategy dubbed RAIN-GS (Relaing Accurate Initialization Constraint for 3D Gaussian Splatting). Our approach is based on an in-depth analysis of the original 3DGS optimization scheme and the analysis of the SfM initialization in the frequency domain. Leveraging simple modifications based on our analyses, RAIN-GS successfully trains 3D Gaussians from sub-optimal point cloud (e.g., randomly initialized point cloud), effectively relaxing the need for accurate initialization. We demonstrate the efficacy of our strategy through quantitative and qualitative comparisons on multiple datasets, where RAIN-GS trained with random point cloud achieves performance on-par with or even better than 3DGS trained with accurate SfM point cloud.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sangwon Jang, Jaehyeong Jo, Kimin Lee, Sung Ju Hwang</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have shown remarkable success in generating personalized subjects based on a few reference images. However, current methods often fail when generating multiple subjects simultaneously, resulting in mixed identities with combined attributes from different subjects. In this work, we present MuDI, a novel framework that enables multi-subject personalization by effectively decoupling identities from multiple subjects. Our main idea is to utilize segmented subjects generated by a foundation model for segmentation (Segment Anything) for both training and inference, as a form of data augmentation for training and initialization for the generation process. Moreover, we further introduce a new metric to better evaluate the performance of our method on multi-subject personalization. Experimental results show that our MuDI can produce high-quality personalized images without identity mixing, even for highly similar subjects as shown in Figure 1. Specifically, in human evaluation, MuDI obtains twice the success rate for personalizing multiple subjects without identity mixing over existing baselines and is preferred over 70% against the strongest baseline.</p>

<p>Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have achieved huge success in effectively capturing and representing 3D objects and scenes. However, several factors have impeded its further proliferation as next-generation 3D media. To establish a ubiquitous presence in everyday media formats, such as images and videos, it is imperative to devise a solution that effectively fulfills three key objectives: fast encoding and decoding time, compact model sizes, and high-quality renderings. Despite significant advancements, a comprehensive algorithm that adequately addresses all objectives has yet to be fully realized. In this work, we present CodecNeRF, a neural codec for NeRF representations, consisting of a novel encoder and decoder architecture that can generate a NeRF representation in a single forward pass. Furthermore, inspired by the recent parameter-efficient finetuning approaches, we develop a novel finetuning method to efficiently adapt the generated NeRF representations to a new test instance, leading to high-quality image renderings and compact code sizes. The proposed CodecNeRF, a newly suggested encoding-decoding-finetuning pipeline for NeRF, achieved unprecedented compression performance of more than 150x and 20x reduction in encoding time while maintaining (or improving) the image quality on widely used 3D object datasets, such as ShapeNet and Objaverse.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingyu Zheng, Haotong Qin, Xudong Ma, Mingyuan Zhang, Haojie Hao, Jiakai Wang, Zixiang Zhao, Jinyang Guo, Xianglong Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: With the advancement of diffusion models (DMs) and the substantially increased computational requirements, quantization emerges as a practical solution to obtain compact and efficient low-bit DMs. However, the highly discrete representation leads to severe accuracy degradation, hindering the quantization of diffusion models to ultra-low bit-widths. This paper proposes a novel quantization-aware training approach for DMs, namely BinaryDM. The proposed method pushes DMs' weights toward accurate and efficient binarization, considering the representation and computation properties. From the representation perspective, we present a Learnable Multi-basis Binarizer (LMB) to recover the representations generated by the binarized DM. The LMB enhances detailed information through the flexible combination of dual binary bases while applying to parameter-sparse locations of DM architectures to achieve minor burdens. From the optimization perspective, a Low-rank Representation Mimicking (LRM) is applied to assist the optimization of binarized DMs. The LRM mimics the representations of full-precision DMs in low-rank space, alleviating the direction ambiguity of the optimization process caused by fine-grained alignment. Moreover, a quick progressive warm-up is applied to BinaryDM, avoiding convergence difficulties by layerwisely progressive quantization at the beginning of training. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that BinaryDM achieves significant accuracy and efficiency gains compared to SOTA quantization methods of DMs under ultra-low bit-widths. With 1.1-bit weight and 4-bit activation (W1.1A4), BinaryDM achieves as low as 7.11 FID and saves the performance from collapse (baseline FID 39.69). As the first binarization method for diffusion models, W1.1A4 BinaryDM achieves impressive 9.3 times OPs and 24.8 times model size savings, showcasing its substantial potential for edge deployment.</p>

The sequencer also allows shared computations of the tokens proximity between context and target selection, further improving the efficiency. Experimentally, our method achieves competitive results with state-of-the-art methods while avoiding the reconstruction in the input space or additional modality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tengjun Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rise of Visual and Language Pretraining (VLP), an increasing number of downstream tasks are adopting the paradigm of pretraining followed by fine-tuning. Although this paradigm has demonstrated potential in various multimodal downstream tasks, its implementation in the remote sensing domain encounters some obstacles. Specifically, the tendency for same-modality embeddings to cluster together impedes efficient transfer learning. To tackle this issue, we review the aim of multimodal transfer learning for downstream tasks from a unified perspective, and rethink the optimization process based on three distinct objectives. We propose "Harmonized Transfer Learning and Modality Alignment (HarMA)", a method that simultaneously satisfies task constraints, modality alignment, and single-modality uniform alignment, while minimizing training overhead through parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Remarkably, without the need for external data for training, HarMA achieves state-of-the-art performance in two popular multimodal retrieval tasks in the field of remote sensing. Our experiments reveal that HarMA achieves competitive and even superior performance to fully fine-tuned models with only minimal adjustable parameters. Due to its simplicity, HarMA can be integrated into almost all existing multimodal pretraining models. We hope this method can facilitate the efficient application of large models to a wide range of downstream tasks while significantly reducing the resource consumption.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luxi Chen, Zhengyi Wang, Zihan Zhou, Tingting Gao, Hang Su, Jun Zhu, Chongxuan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Optimization-based approaches, such as score distillation sampling (SDS), show promise in zero-shot 3D generation but suffer from low efficiency, primarily due to the high number of function evaluations (NFEs) required for each sample. In this paper, we introduce score-based iterative reconstruction (SIR), an efficient and general algorithm mimicking a differentiable 3D reconstruction process to reduce the NFEs. Given a single set of images sampled from a multi-view score-based diffusion model, SIR repeatedly optimizes 3D parameters, unlike the single-step optimization in SDS. With other improvements in training, we present an efficient approach called MicroDreamer that generally applies to various 3D representations and 3D generation tasks. In particular, retaining a comparable performance, MicroDreamer is 5-20 times faster than SDS in generating neural radiance field and takes about 20 seconds to generate meshes from 3D Gaussian splatting on a single A100 GPU, halving the time of the fastest zero-shot baseline, DreamGaussian.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xujie Zhang, Ente Lin, Xiu Li, Yuxuan Luo, Michael Kampffmeyer, Xin Dong, Xiaodan Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces MMTryon, a multi-modal multi-reference VIrtual Try-ON (VITON) framework, which can generate high-quality compositional try-on results by taking a text instruction and multiple garment images as inputs. Our MMTryon addresses three problems overlooked in prior literature: 1) Support of multiple try-on items. Existing methods are commonly designed for single-item try-on tasks (e.g., upper/lower garments, dresses). 2)Specification of dressing style. Existing methods are unable to customize dressing styles based on instructions (e.g., zipped/unzipped, tuck-in/tuck-out, etc.) 3) Segmentation Dependency. They further heavily rely on category-specific segmentation models to identify the replacement regions, with segmentation errors directly leading to significant artifacts in the try-on results. To address the first two issues, our MMTryon introduces a novel multi-modality and multi-reference attention mechanism to combine the garment information from reference images and dressing-style information from text instructions. Besides, to remove the segmentation dependency, MMTryon uses a parsing-free garment encoder and leverages a novel scalable data generation pipeline to convert existing VITON datasets to a form that allows MMTryon to be trained without requiring any explicit segmentation. Extensive experiments on high-resolution benchmarks and in-the-wild test sets demonstrate MMTryon's superiority over existing SOTA methods both qualitatively and quantitatively. MMTryon's impressive performance on multi-item and style-controllable virtual try-on scenarios and its ability to try on any outfit in a large variety of scenarios from any source image, opens up a new avenue for future investigation in the fashion community.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoqi Zhao, Youwei Pang, Wei Ji, Baicheng Sheng, Jiaming Zuo, Lihe Zhang, Huchuan Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Different from the context-independent (CI) concepts such as human, car, and airplane, context-dependent (CD) concepts require higher visual understanding ability, such as camouflaged object and medical lesion. Despite the rapid advance of many CD understanding tasks in respective branches, the isolated evolution leads to their limited cross-domain generalisation and repetitive technique innovation. Since there is a strong coupling relationship between foreground and background context in CD tasks, existing methods require to train separate models in their focused domains. This restricts their real-world CD concept understanding towards artificial general intelligence (AGI). We propose a unified model with a single set of parameters, Spider, which only needs to be trained once. With the help of the proposed concept filter driven by the image-mask group prompt, Spider is able to understand and distinguish diverse strong context-dependent concepts to accurately capture the Prompter's intention. Without bells and whistles, Spider significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art specialized models in 8 different context-dependent segmentation tasks, including 4 natural scenes (salient, camouflaged, and transparent objects and shadow) and 4 medical lesions (COVID-19, polyp, breast, and skin lesion with color colonoscopy, CT, ultrasound, and dermoscopy modalities). Besides, Spider shows obvious advantages in continuous learning. It can easily complete the training of new tasks by fine-tuning parameters less than 1\% and bring a tolerable performance degradation of less than 5\% for all old tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Priya Sundaresan, Aditya Ganapathi, Harry Zhang, Shivin Devgon</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigate the problem of pixelwise correspondence for deformable objects, namely cloth and rope, by comparing both classical and learning-based methods. We choose cloth and rope because they are traditionally some of the most difficult deformable objects to analytically model with their large configuration space, and they are meaningful in the context of robotic tasks like cloth folding, rope knot-tying, T-shirt folding, curtain closing, etc. The correspondence problem is heavily motivated in robotics, with wide-ranging applications including semantic grasping, object tracking, and manipulation policies built on top of correspondences. We present an exhaustive survey of existing classical methods for doing correspondence via feature-matching, including SIFT, SURF, and ORB, and two recently published learning-based methods including TimeCycle and Dense Object Nets. We make three main contributions: (1) a framework for simulating and rendering synthetic images of deformable objects, with qualitative results demonstrating transfer between our simulated and real domains (2) a new learning-based correspondence method extending Dense Object Nets, and (3) a standardized comparison across state-of-the-art correspondence methods. Our proposed method provides a flexible, general formulation for learning temporally and spatially continuous correspondences for nonrigid (and rigid) objects. We report root mean squared error statistics for all methods and find that Dense Object Nets outperforms baseline classical methods for correspondence, and our proposed extension of Dense Object Nets performs similarly.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurately reconstructing road surfaces is pivotal for various applications especially in autonomous driving. This paper introduces a position encoding Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) framework to reconstruct road surfaces, with input as world coordinates x and y, and output as height, color, and semantic information. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated through its compatibility with a variety of road height sources like vehicle camera poses, LiDAR point clouds, and SFM point clouds, robust to the semantic noise of images like sparse labels and noise semantic prediction, and fast training speed, which indicates a promising application for rendering road surfaces with semantics, particularly in applications demanding visualization of road surface, 4D labeling, and semantic groupings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengxi Zhang, Wenhao Wu, Yu Lu, Yuxin Song, Kang Rong, Huanjin Yao, Jianbo Zhao, Fanglong Liu, Yifan Sun, Haocheng Feng, Jingdong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Current multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) suffer from ``hallucination'', occasionally generating responses that are not grounded in the input images. To tackle this challenge, one promising path is to utilize reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which steers MLLMs towards learning superior responses while avoiding inferior ones. We rethink the common practice of using binary preferences (i.e., superior, inferior), and find that adopting multi-level preferences (e.g., superior, medium, inferior) is better for two benefits: 1) It narrows the gap between adjacent levels, thereby encouraging MLLMs to discern subtle differences. 2) It further integrates cross-level comparisons (beyond adjacent-level comparisons), thus providing a broader range of comparisons with hallucination examples. To verify our viewpoint, we present the Automated Multi-level Preference (AMP) framework for MLLMs. To facilitate this framework, we first develop an automated dataset generation pipeline that provides high-quality multi-level preference datasets without any human annotators. Furthermore, we design the Multi-level Direct Preference Optimization (MDPO) algorithm to robustly conduct complex multi-level preference learning. Additionally, we propose a new hallucination benchmark, MRHal-Bench. Extensive experiments across public hallucination and general benchmarks, as well as our MRHal-Bench, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zixun Fang, Wei Zhai, Aimin Su, Hongliang Song, Kai Zhu, Mao Wang, Yu Chen, Zhiheng Liu, Yang Cao, Zheng-Jun Zha</p>
<p>Abstract: Video virtual try-on aims to transfer a clothing item onto the video of a target person. Directly applying the technique of image-based try-on to the video domain in a frame-wise manner will cause temporal-inconsistent outcomes while previous video-based try-on solutions can only generate low visual quality and blurring results. In this work, we present ViViD, a novel framework employing powerful diffusion models to tackle the task of video virtual try-on. Specifically, we design the Garment Encoder to extract fine-grained clothing semantic features, guiding the model to capture garment details and inject them into the target video through the proposed attention feature fusion mechanism. To ensure spatial-temporal consistency, we introduce a lightweight Pose Encoder to encode pose signals, enabling the model to learn the interactions between clothing and human posture and insert hierarchical Temporal Modules into the text-to-image stable diffusion model for more coherent and lifelike video synthesis. Furthermore, we collect a new dataset, which is the largest, with the most diverse types of garments and the highest resolution for the task of video virtual try-on to date. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach is able to yield satisfactory video try-on results. The dataset, codes, and weights will be publicly available.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiping Yu, Chenyang Liu, Liqin Liu, Zhenwei Shi, Zhengxia Zou</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent advancement of generative foundational models has ushered in a new era of image generation in the realm of natural images, revolutionizing art design, entertainment, environment simulation, and beyond. Despite producing high-quality samples, existing methods are constrained to generating images of scenes at a limited scale. In this paper, we present MetaEarth, a generative foundation model that breaks the barrier by scaling image generation to a global level, exploring the creation of worldwide, multi-resolution, unbounded, and virtually limitless remote sensing images. In MetaEarth, we propose a resolution-guided self-cascading generative framework, which enables the generating of images at any region with a wide range of geographical resolutions. To achieve unbounded and arbitrary-sized image generation, we design a novel noise sampling strategy for denoising diffusion models by analyzing the generation conditions and initial noise. To train MetaEarth, we construct a large dataset comprising multi-resolution optical remote sensing images with geographical information. Experiments have demonstrated the powerful capabilities of our method in generating global-scale images. Additionally, the MetaEarth serves as a data engine that can provide high-quality and rich training data for downstream tasks. Our model opens up new possibilities for constructing generative world models by simulating Earth visuals from an innovative overhead perspective.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongyi Pan, Emadeldeen Hamdan, Xin Zhu, Koushik Biswas, Ahmet Enis Cetin, Ulas Bagci</p>
<p>Abstract: Central to the Transformer architectures' effectiveness is the self-attention mechanism, a function that maps queries, keys, and values into a high-dimensional vector space. However, training the attention weights of queries, keys, and values is non-trivial from a state of random initialization. In this paper, we propose two methods. (i) We first address the initialization problem of Vision Transformers by introducing a simple, yet highly innovative, initialization approach utilizing Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients. Our proposed DCT-based attention initialization marks a significant gain compared to traditional initialization strategies; offering a robust foundation for the attention mechanism. Our experiments reveal that the DCT-based initialization enhances the accuracy of Vision Transformers in classification tasks. (ii) We also recognize that since DCT effectively decorrelates image information in the frequency domain, this decorrelation is useful for compression because it allows the quantization step to discard many of the higher-frequency components. Based on this observation, we propose a novel DCT-based compression technique for the attention function of Vision Transformers. Since high-frequency DCT coefficients usually correspond to noise, we truncate the high-frequency DCT components of the input patches. Our DCT-based compression reduces the size of weight matrices for queries, keys, and values. While maintaining the same level of accuracy, our DCT compressed Swin Transformers obtain a considerable decrease in the computational overhead.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating content across various modalities, such as images and text. However, their interpretability remains a challenge, hindering their adoption in critical applications. This research proposes a novel approach to enhance the interpretability of MLLMs by focusing on the image embedding component. We combine an open-world localization model with a MLLM, thus creating a new architecture able to simultaneously produce text and object localization outputs from the same vision embedding. The proposed architecture greatly promotes interpretability, enabling us to design a novel saliency map to explain any output token, to identify model hallucinations, and to assess model biases through semantic adversarial perturbations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuheng Ge, Haoyu Xing, Li Zhang, Xiangqian Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Creating realistic, natural, and lip-readable talking face videos remains a formidable challenge. Previous research primarily concentrated on generating and aligning single-frame images while overlooking the smoothness of frame-to-frame transitions and temporal dependencies. This often compromised visual quality and effects in practical settings, particularly when handling complex facial data and audio content, which frequently led to semantically incongruent visual illusions. Specifically, synthesized videos commonly featured disorganized lip movements, making them difficult to understand and recognize. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces the application of optical flow to guide facial image generation, enhancing inter-frame continuity and semantic consistency. We propose "OpFlowTalker", a novel approach that utilizes predicted optical flow changes from audio inputs rather than direct image predictions. This method smooths image transitions and aligns changes with semantic content. Moreover, it employs a sequence fusion technique to replace the independent generation of single frames, thus preserving contextual information and maintaining temporal coherence. We also developed an optical flow synchronization module that regulates both full-face and lip movements, optimizing visual synthesis by balancing regional dynamics. Furthermore, we introduce a Visual Text Consistency Score (VTCS) that accurately measures lip-readability in synthesized videos. Extensive empirical evidence validates the effectiveness of our approach.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce VOODOO XP: a 3D-aware one-shot head reenactment method that can generate highly expressive facial expressions from any input driver video and a single 2D portrait. Our solution is real-time, view-consistent, and can be instantly used without calibration or fine-tuning. We demonstrate our solution on a monocular video setting and an end-to-end VR telepresence system for two-way communication. Compared to 2D head reenactment methods, 3D-aware approaches aim to preserve the identity of the subject and ensure view-consistent facial geometry for novel camera poses, which makes them suitable for immersive applications. While various facial disentanglement techniques have been introduced, cutting-edge 3D-aware neural reenactment techniques still lack expressiveness and fail to reproduce complex and fine-scale facial expressions. We present a novel cross-reenactment architecture that directly transfers the driver's facial expressions to transformer blocks of the input source's 3D lifting module. We show that highly effective disentanglement is possible using an innovative multi-stage self-supervision approach, which is based on a coarse-to-fine strategy, combined with an explicit face neutralization and 3D lifted frontalization during its initial training stage. We further integrate our novel head reenactment solution into an accessible high-fidelity VR telepresence system, where any person can instantly build a personalized neural head avatar from any photo and bring it to life using the headset. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in terms of expressiveness and likeness preservation on a large set of diverse subjects and capture conditions.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents $M^3$GPT, an advanced \textbf{M}ultimodal, \textbf{M}ultitask framework for \textbf{M}otion comprehension and generation. $M^3$GPT operates on three fundamental principles. The first focuses on creating a unified representation space for various motion-relevant modalities. We employ discrete vector quantization for multimodal control and generation signals, such as text, music and motion/dance, enabling seamless integration into a large language model (LLM) with a single vocabulary. The second involves modeling model generation directly in the raw motion space. This strategy circumvents the information loss associated with discrete tokenizer, resulting in more detailed and comprehensive model generation. Third, $M^3$GPT learns to model the connections and synergies among various motion-relevant tasks. Text, the most familiar and well-understood modality for LLMs, is utilized as a bridge to establish connections between different motion tasks, facilitating mutual reinforcement. To our knowledge, $M^3$GPT is the first model capable of comprehending and generating motions based on multiple signals. Extensive experiments highlight $M^3$GPT's superior performance across various motion-relevant tasks and its powerful zero-shot generalization capabilities for extremely challenging tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinlin Liu, Kai Yu, Mengyang Feng, Xiefan Guo, Miaomiao Cui</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in human video synthesis have enabled the generation of high-quality videos through the application of stable diffusion models. However, existing methods predominantly concentrate on animating solely the human element (the foreground) guided by pose information, while leaving the background entirely static. Contrary to this, in authentic, high-quality videos, backgrounds often dynamically adjust in harmony with foreground movements, eschewing stagnancy. We introduce a technique that concurrently learns both foreground and background dynamics by segregating their movements using distinct motion representations. Human figures are animated leveraging pose-based motion, capturing intricate actions. Conversely, for backgrounds, we employ sparse tracking points to model motion, thereby reflecting the natural interaction between foreground activity and environmental changes. Training on real-world videos enhanced with this innovative motion depiction approach, our model generates videos exhibiting coherent movement in both foreground subjects and their surrounding contexts. To further extend video generation to longer sequences without accumulating errors, we adopt a clip-by-clip generation strategy, introducing global features at each step. To ensure seamless continuity across these segments, we ingeniously link the final frame of a produced clip with input noise to spawn the succeeding one, maintaining narrative flow. Throughout the sequential generation process, we infuse the feature representation of the initial reference image into the network, effectively curtailing any cumulative color inconsistencies that may otherwise arise. Empirical evaluations attest to the superiority of our method in producing videos that exhibit harmonious interplay between foreground actions and responsive background dynamics, surpassing prior methodologies in this regard.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose ID-to-3D, a method to generate identity- and text-guided 3D human heads with disentangled expressions, starting from even a single casually captured in-the-wild image of a subject. The foundation of our approach is anchored in compositionality, alongside the use of task-specific 2D diffusion models as priors for optimization. First, we extend a foundational model with a lightweight expression-aware and ID-aware architecture, and create 2D priors for geometry and texture generation, via fine-tuning only 0.2% of its available training parameters. Then, we jointly leverage a neural parametric representation for the expressions of each subject and a multi-stage generation of highly detailed geometry and albedo texture. This combination of strong face identity embeddings and our neural representation enables accurate reconstruction of not only facial features but also accessories and hair and can be meshed to provide render-ready assets for gaming and telepresence. Our results achieve an unprecedented level of identity-consistent and high-quality texture and geometry generation, generalizing to a ``world'' of unseen 3D identities, without relying on large 3D captured datasets of human assets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hastings Greer, Lin Tian, Francois-Xavier Vialard, Roland Kwitt, Raul San Jose Estepar, Marc Niethammer</p>
<p>Abstract: Image registration estimates spatial correspondences between a pair of images. These estimates are typically obtained via numerical optimization or regression by a deep network. A desirable property of such estimators is that a correspondence estimate (e.g., the true oracle correspondence) for an image pair is maintained under deformations of the input images. Formally, the estimator should be equivariant to a desired class of image transformations. In this work, we present careful analyses of the desired equivariance properties in the context of multi-step deep registration networks. Based on these analyses we 1) introduce the notions of $[U,U]$ equivariance (network equivariance to the same deformations of the input images) and $[W,U]$ equivariance (where input images can undergo different deformations); we 2) show that in a suitable multi-step registration setup it is sufficient for overall $[W,U]$ equivariance if the first step has $[W,U]$ equivariance and all others have $[U,U]$ equivariance; we 3) show that common displacement-predicting networks only exhibit $[U,U]$ equivariance to translations instead of the more powerful $[W,U]$ equivariance; and we 4) show how to achieve multi-step $[W,U]$ equivariance via a coordinate-attention mechanism combined with displacement-predicting refinement layers (CARL). Overall, our approach obtains excellent practical registration performance on several 3D medical image registration tasks and outperforms existing unsupervised approaches for the challenging problem of abdomen registration.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce a technique for the reconstruction of high-fidelity surfaces from multi-view images. Our technique uses a new point-based representation, the dipole sum, which generalizes the winding number to allow for interpolation of arbitrary per-point attributes in point clouds with noisy or outlier points. Using dipole sums allows us to represent implicit geometry and radiance fields as per-point attributes of a point cloud, which we initialize directly from structure from motion. We additionally derive Barnes-Hut fast summation schemes for accelerated forward and reverse-mode dipole sum queries. These queries facilitate the use of ray tracing to efficiently and differentiably render images with our point-based representations, and thus update their point attributes to optimize scene geometry and appearance. We evaluate this inverse rendering framework against state-of-the-art alternatives, based on ray tracing of neural representations or rasterization of Gaussian point-based representations. Our technique significantly improves reconstruction quality at equal runtimes, while also supporting more general rendering techniques such as shadow rays for direct illumination. In the supplement, we provide interactive visualizations of our results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zipeng Wang, Dan Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in synthesizing photorealistic images of large-scale scenes. However, they are often plagued by a loss of fine details and long rendering durations. 3D Gaussian Splatting has recently been introduced as a potent alternative, achieving both high-fidelity visual results and accelerated rendering performance. Nonetheless, scaling 3D Gaussian Splatting is fraught with challenges. Specifically, large-scale scenes grapples with the integration of objects across multiple scales and disparate viewpoints, which often leads to compromised efficacy as the Gaussians need to balance between detail levels. Furthermore, the generation of initialization points via COLMAP from large-scale dataset is both computationally demanding and prone to incomplete reconstructions. To address these challenges, we present Pyramidal 3D Gaussian Splatting (PyGS) with NeRF Initialization. Our approach represent the scene with a hierarchical assembly of Gaussians arranged in a pyramidal fashion. The top level of the pyramid is composed of a few large Gaussians, while each subsequent layer accommodates a denser collection of smaller Gaussians. We effectively initialize these pyramidal Gaussians through sampling a rapidly trained grid-based NeRF at various frequencies. We group these pyramidal Gaussians into clusters and use a compact weighting network to dynamically determine the influence of each pyramid level of each cluster considering camera viewpoint during rendering. Our method achieves a significant performance leap across multiple large-scale datasets and attains a rendering time that is over 400 times faster than current state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: While large multi-modal models (LMMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities across diverse tasks, their effectiveness in handling complex tasks has been limited by the prevailing single-step reasoning paradigm. To this end, this paper proposes VoCoT, a multi-step Visually grounded object-centric Chain-of-Thought reasoning framework tailored for inference with LMMs. VoCoT is characterized by two key features: (1) object-centric reasoning paths that revolve around cross-modal shared object-level information, and (2) visually grounded representation of object concepts in a multi-modal interleaved and aligned manner, which effectively bridges the modality gap within LMMs during long-term generation. Additionally, we construct an instruction dataset to facilitate LMMs in adapting to reasoning with VoCoT. By introducing VoCoT into the prevalent open-source LMM architecture, we introduce VolCano. With only 7B parameters and limited input resolution, VolCano demonstrates excellent performance across various scenarios, surpassing SOTA models, including GPT-4V, in tasks requiring complex reasoning.

In this paper, we propose a novel method, named SA-GS, for fine-grained 3D geometry reconstruction using semantic-aware 3D Gaussian Splats. Specifically, we leverage prior information stored in large vision models such as SAM and DINO to generate semantic masks. We then introduce a geometric complexity measurement function to serve as soft regularization, guiding the shape of each Gaussian Splat within specific semantic areas. Additionally, we present a method that estimates the expected number of Gaussian Splats in different semantic areas, effectively providing a lower bound for Gaussian Splats in these areas. Subsequently, we extract the point cloud using a novel probability density-based extraction method, transforming Gaussian Splats into a point cloud crucial for downstream tasks. Our method also offers the potential for detailed semantic inquiries while maintaining high image-based reconstruction results. We provide extensive experiments on publicly available large-scale scene reconstruction datasets with highly accurate point clouds as ground truth and our novel dataset. Our results demonstrate the superiority of our method over current state-of-the-art Gaussian Splats reconstruction methods by a significant margin in terms of geometric-based measurement metrics. Code and additional results will soon be available on our project page.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MM-LLMs) have demonstrated promising potential in terms of generalization and robustness when applied to different modalities. While previous works have already achieved 3D human motion generation using various approaches including language modeling, they mostly % are mostly carefully designed use specialized architecture and are restricted to single-human motion generation. Inspired by the success of MM-LLMs, we propose MotionLLM, a simple and general framework that can achieve single-human, multi-human motion generation, and motion captioning by fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs. Specifically, we encode and quantize motions into discrete LLM-understandable tokens, which results in a unified vocabulary consisting of both motion and text tokens. With only 1--3% parameters of the LLMs trained by using adapters, our single-human motion generation achieves comparable results to those diffusion models and other trained-from-scratch transformer-based models. Additionally, we show that our approach is scalable and flexible, allowing easy extension to multi-human motion generation through autoregressive generation of single-human motions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangyu Sun, Joo Chan Lee, Daniel Rho, Jong Hwan Ko, Usman Ali, Eunbyung Park</p>
<p>Abstract: The neural radiance field (NeRF) has made significant strides in representing 3D scenes and synthesizing novel views. Despite its advancements, the high computational costs of NeRF have posed challenges for its deployment in resource-constrained environments and real-time applications. As an alternative to NeRF-like neural rendering methods, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offers rapid rendering speeds while maintaining excellent image quality. However, as it represents objects and scenes using a myriad of Gaussians, it requires substantial storage to achieve high-quality representation. To mitigate the storage overhead, we propose Factorized 3D Gaussian Splatting (F-3DGS), a novel approach that drastically reduces storage requirements while preserving image quality. Inspired by classical matrix and tensor factorization techniques, our method represents and approximates dense clusters of Gaussians with significantly fewer Gaussians through efficient factorization. We aim to efficiently represent dense 3D Gaussians by approximating them with a limited amount of information for each axis and their combinations. This method allows us to encode a substantially large number of Gaussians along with their essential attributes -- such as color, scale, and rotation -- necessary for rendering using a relatively small number of elements. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that F-3DGS achieves a significant reduction in storage costs while maintaining comparable quality in rendered images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyu Zhao, Wenhang Ge, Ying-cong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual grounding is an essential tool that links user-provided text queries with query-specific regions within an image. Despite advancements in visual grounding models, their ability to comprehend complex queries remains limited. To overcome this limitation, we introduce LLM-Optic, an innovative method that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) as an optical lens to enhance existing visual grounding models in comprehending complex text queries involving intricate text structures, multiple objects, or object spatial relationships, situations that current models struggle with. LLM-Optic first employs an LLM as a Text Grounder to interpret complex text queries and accurately identify objects the user intends to locate. Then a pre-trained visual grounding model is used to generate candidate bounding boxes given the refined query by the Text Grounder. After that, LLM-Optic annotates the candidate bounding boxes with numerical marks to establish a connection between text and specific image regions, thereby linking two distinct modalities. Finally, it employs a Large Multimodal Model (LMM) as a Visual Grounder to select the marked candidate objects that best correspond to the original text query. Through LLM-Optic, we have achieved universal visual grounding, which allows for the detection of arbitrary objects specified by arbitrary human language input. Importantly, our method achieves this enhancement without requiring additional training or fine-tuning. Extensive experiments across various challenging benchmarks demonstrate that LLM-Optic achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot visual grounding capabilities.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kangye Ji, Fei Cheng, Zeqing Wang, Bohu Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Sample selection is the most straightforward technique to combat label noise, aiming to distinguish mislabeled samples during training and avoid the degradation of the robustness of the model. In the workflow, $\textit{selecting possibly clean data}$ and $\textit{model update}$ are iterative. However, their interplay and intrinsic characteristics hinder the robustness and efficiency of learning with noisy labels: 1) The model chooses clean data with selection bias, leading to the accumulated error in the model update. 2) Most selection strategies leverage partner networks or supplementary information to mitigate label corruption, albeit with increased computation resources and lower throughput speed. Therefore, we employ only one network with the jump manner update to decouple the interplay and mine more semantic information from the loss for a more precise selection. Specifically, the selection of clean data for each model update is based on one of the prior models, excluding the last iteration. The strategy of model update exhibits a jump behavior in the form. Moreover, we map the outputs of the network and labels into the same semantic feature space, respectively. In this space, a detailed and simple loss distribution is generated to distinguish clean samples more effectively. Our proposed approach achieves almost up to $2.53\times$ speedup, $0.46\times$ peak memory footprint, and superior robustness over state-of-the-art works with various noise settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiang Wang, Minghua Liu, Junjun Hu, Fan Jiang, Mu Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating realistic animated videos from static images is an important area of research in computer vision. Methods based on physical simulation and motion prediction have achieved notable advances, but they are often limited to specific object textures and motion trajectories, failing to exhibit highly complex environments and physical dynamics. In this paper, we introduce an open-domain controllable image animation method using motion priors with video diffusion models. Our method achieves precise control over the direction and speed of motion in the movable region by extracting the motion field information from videos and learning moving trajectories and strengths. Current pretrained video generation models are typically limited to producing very short videos, typically less than 30 frames. In contrast, we propose an efficient long-duration video generation method based on noise reschedule specifically tailored for image animation tasks, facilitating the creation of videos over 100 frames in length while maintaining consistency in content scenery and motion coordination. Specifically, we decompose the denoise process into two distinct phases: the shaping of scene contours and the refining of motion details. Then we reschedule the noise to control the generated frame sequences maintaining long-distance noise correlation. We conducted extensive experiments with 10 baselines, encompassing both commercial tools and academic methodologies, which demonstrate the superiority of our method.

<p>Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been widely used in various application scenarios. Since the production of a commercial GAN requires substantial computational and human resources, the copyright protection of GANs is urgently needed. This paper presents a novel fingerprinting scheme for the Intellectual Property (IP) protection of image-to-image GANs based on a trusted third party. We break through the stealthiness and robustness bottlenecks suffered by previous fingerprinting methods for classification models being naively transferred to GANs. Specifically, we innovatively construct a composite deep learning model from the target GAN and a classifier. Then we generate fingerprint samples from this composite model, and embed them in the classifier for effective ownership verification. This scheme inspires some concrete methodologies to practically protect the modern image-to-image translation GANs. Theoretical analysis proves that these methods can satisfy different security requirements necessary for IP protection. We also conduct extensive experiments to show that our solutions outperform existing strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Albin Soutif--Cormerais, Marc Masana, Joost van de Weijer, Bart{\l}omiej Twardowski</p>
<p>Abstract: In class-incremental learning, an agent with limited resources needs to learn a sequence of classification tasks, forming an ever growing classification problem, with the constraint of not being able to access data from previous tasks. The main difference with task-incremental learning, where a task-ID is available at inference time, is that the learner also needs to perform cross-task discrimination, i.e. distinguish between classes that have not been seen together. Approaches to tackle this problem are numerous and mostly make use of an external memory (buffer) of non-negligible size. In this paper, we ablate the learning of cross-task features and study its influence on the performance of basic replay strategies used for class-IL. We also define a new forgetting measure for class-incremental learning, and see that forgetting is not the principal cause of low performance. Our experimental results show that future algorithms for class-incremental learning should not only prevent forgetting, but also aim to improve the quality of the cross-task features, and the knowledge transfer between tasks. This is especially important when tasks contain limited amount of data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nan Gao, Zeyu Zhao, Zhi Zeng, Shuwu Zhang, Dongdong Weng, Yihua Bao</p>
<p>Abstract: Gesture synthesis has gained significant attention as a critical research field, aiming to produce contextually appropriate and natural gestures corresponding to speech or textual input. Although deep learning-based approaches have achieved remarkable progress, they often overlook the rich semantic information present in the text, leading to less expressive and meaningful gestures. In this letter, we propose GesGPT, a novel approach to gesture generation that leverages the semantic analysis capabilities of large language models , such as ChatGPT. By capitalizing on the strengths of LLMs for text analysis, we adopt a controlled approach to generate and integrate professional gestures and base gestures through a text parsing script, resulting in diverse and meaningful gestures. Firstly, our approach involves the development of prompt principles that transform gesture generation into an intention classification problem using ChatGPT. We also conduct further analysis on emphasis words and semantic words to aid in gesture generation. Subsequently, we construct a specialized gesture lexicon with multiple semantic annotations, decoupling the synthesis of gestures into professional gestures and base gestures. Finally, we merge the professional gestures with base gestures. Experimental results demonstrate that GesGPT effectively generates contextually appropriate and expressive gestures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongyu Yan, Jianheng Liu, Fengyu Quan, Haoyao Chen, Mengmeng Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: Actively planning sensor views during object reconstruction is crucial for autonomous mobile robots. An effective method should be able to strike a balance between accuracy and efficiency. In this paper, we propose a seamless integration of the emerging implicit representation with the active reconstruction task. We build an implicit occupancy field as our geometry proxy. While training, the prior object bounding box is utilized as auxiliary information to generate clean and detailed reconstructions. To evaluate view uncertainty, we employ a sampling-based approach that directly extracts entropy from the reconstructed occupancy probability field as our measure of view information gain. This eliminates the need for additional uncertainty maps or learning. Unlike previous methods that compare view uncertainty within a finite set of candidates, we aim to find the next-best-view (NBV) on a continuous manifold. Leveraging the differentiability of the implicit representation, the NBV can be optimized directly by maximizing the view uncertainty using gradient descent. It significantly enhances the method's adaptability to different scenarios. Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively improves reconstruction accuracy and efficiency of view planning in active reconstruction tasks.

<p>Abstract: Wheeled mobile robots need the ability to estimate their motion and the effect of their control actions for navigation planning. In this paper, we present ST-VIO, a novel approach which tightly fuses a single-track dynamics model for wheeled ground vehicles with visual inertial odometry (VIO). Our method calibrates and adapts the dynamics model online to improve the accuracy of forward prediction conditioned on future control inputs. The single-track dynamics model approximates wheeled vehicle motion under specific control inputs on flat ground using ordinary differential equations. We use a singularity-free and differentiable variant of the single-track model to enable seamless integration as dynamics factor into VIO and to optimize the model parameters online together with the VIO state variables. We validate our method with real-world data in both indoor and outdoor environments with different terrain types and wheels. In experiments, we demonstrate that ST-VIO can not only adapt to wheel or ground changes and improve the accuracy of prediction under new control inputs, but can even improve tracking accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision-based navigation systems in arable fields are an underexplored area in agricultural robot navigation. Vision systems deployed in arable fields face challenges such as fluctuating weed density, varying illumination levels, growth stages and crop row irregularities. Current solutions are often crop-specific and aimed to address limited individual conditions such as illumination or weed density. Moreover, the scarcity of comprehensive datasets hinders the development of generalised machine learning systems for navigating these fields. This paper proposes a suite of deep learning-based perception algorithms using affordable vision sensors for vision-based navigation in arable fields. Initially, a comprehensive dataset that captures the intricacies of multiple crop seasons, various crop types, and a range of field variations was compiled. Next, this study delves into the creation of robust infield perception algorithms capable of accurately detecting crop rows under diverse conditions such as different growth stages, weed density, and varying illumination. Further, it investigates the integration of crop row following with vision-based crop row switching for efficient field-scale navigation. The proposed infield navigation system was tested in commercial arable fields traversing a total distance of 4.5 km with average heading and cross-track errors of 1.24{\deg} and 3.32 cm respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Enneng Yang, Zhenyi Wang, Li Shen, Shiwei Liu, Guibing Guo, Xingwei Wang, Dacheng Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) aims to empower a model to tackle multiple tasks simultaneously. A recent development known as task arithmetic has revealed that several models, each fine-tuned for distinct tasks, can be directly merged into a single model to execute MTL without necessitating a retraining process using the initial training data. Nevertheless, this direct addition of models often leads to a significant deterioration in the overall performance of the merged model. This decline occurs due to potential conflicts and intricate correlations among the multiple tasks. Consequently, the challenge emerges of how to merge pre-trained models more effectively without using their original training data. This paper introduces an innovative technique called Adaptive Model Merging (AdaMerging). This approach aims to autonomously learn the coefficients for model merging, either in a task-wise or layer-wise manner, without relying on the original training data. Specifically, our AdaMerging method operates as an automatic, unsupervised task arithmetic scheme. It leverages entropy minimization on unlabeled test samples from the multi-task setup as a surrogate objective function to iteratively refine the merging coefficients of the multiple models. Our experimental findings across eight tasks demonstrate the efficacy of the AdaMerging scheme we put forth. Compared to the current state-of-the-art task arithmetic merging scheme, AdaMerging showcases a remarkable 11\% improvement in performance. Notably, AdaMerging also exhibits superior generalization capabilities when applied to unseen downstream tasks. Furthermore, it displays a significantly enhanced robustness to data distribution shifts that may occur during the testing phase.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ke Wang, Guillermo Ortiz-Jimenez, Rodolphe Jenatton, Mark Collier, Efi Kokiopoulou, Pascal Frossard</p>
<p>Abstract: Label noise is a pervasive problem in deep learning that often compromises the generalization performance of trained models. Recently, leveraging privileged information (PI) -- information available only during training but not at test time -- has emerged as an effective approach to mitigate this issue. Yet, existing PI-based methods have failed to consistently outperform their no-PI counterparts in terms of preventing overfitting to label noise. To address this deficiency, we introduce Pi-DUAL, an architecture designed to harness PI to distinguish clean from wrong labels. Pi-DUAL decomposes the output logits into a prediction term, based on conventional input features, and a noise-fitting term influenced solely by PI. A gating mechanism steered by PI adaptively shifts focus between these terms, allowing the model to implicitly separate the learning paths of clean and wrong labels. Empirically, Pi-DUAL achieves significant performance improvements on key PI benchmarks (e.g., +6.8% on ImageNet-PI), establishing a new state-of-the-art test set accuracy. Additionally, Pi-DUAL is a potent method for identifying noisy samples post-training, outperforming other strong methods at this task. Overall, Pi-DUAL is a simple, scalable and practical approach for mitigating the effects of label noise in a variety of real-world scenarios with PI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shunsuke Saito, Gabriel Schwartz, Tomas Simon, Junxuan Li, Giljoo Nam</p>
<p>Abstract: The fidelity of relighting is bounded by both geometry and appearance representations. For geometry, both mesh and volumetric approaches have difficulty modeling intricate structures like 3D hair geometry. For appearance, existing relighting models are limited in fidelity and often too slow to render in real-time with high-resolution continuous environments. In this work, we present Relightable Gaussian Codec Avatars, a method to build high-fidelity relightable head avatars that can be animated to generate novel expressions. Our geometry model based on 3D Gaussians can capture 3D-consistent sub-millimeter details such as hair strands and pores on dynamic face sequences. To support diverse materials of human heads such as the eyes, skin, and hair in a unified manner, we present a novel relightable appearance model based on learnable radiance transfer. Together with global illumination-aware spherical harmonics for the diffuse components, we achieve real-time relighting with all-frequency reflections using spherical Gaussians. This appearance model can be efficiently relit under both point light and continuous illumination. We further improve the fidelity of eye reflections and enable explicit gaze control by introducing relightable explicit eye models. Our method outperforms existing approaches without compromising real-time performance. We also demonstrate real-time relighting of avatars on a tethered consumer VR headset, showcasing the efficiency and fidelity of our avatars.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiankun Zuo, Ling Chen, Yanyan Shen, Michael Kwok-Po Ng, Baiying Lei, Shuqiang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Effective connectivity estimation plays a crucial role in understanding the interactions and information flow between different brain regions. However, the functional time series used for estimating effective connectivity is derived from certain software, which may lead to large computing errors because of different parameter settings and degrade the ability to model complex causal relationships between brain regions. In this paper, a brain diffuser with hierarchical transformer (BDHT) is proposed to estimate effective connectivity for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) analysis. To our best knowledge, the proposed brain diffuser is the first generative model to apply diffusion models to the application of generating and analyzing multimodal brain networks. Specifically, the BDHT leverages structural connectivity to guide the reverse processes in an efficient way. It makes the denoising process more reliable and guarantees effective connectivity estimation accuracy. To improve denoising quality, the hierarchical denoising transformer is designed to learn multi-scale features in topological space. By stacking the multi-head attention and graph convolutional network, the graph convolutional transformer (GraphConformer) module is devised to enhance structure-function complementarity and improve the ability in noise estimation. Experimental evaluations of the denoising diffusion model demonstrate its effectiveness in estimating effective connectivity. The proposed model achieves superior performance in terms of accuracy and robustness compared to existing approaches. Moreover, the proposed model can identify altered directional connections and provide a comprehensive understanding of parthenogenesis for MCI treatment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingyi Chen, Qinghua Tao, Francesco Tonin, Johan A. K. Suykens</p>
<p>Abstract: While the great capability of Transformers significantly boosts prediction accuracy, it could also yield overconfident predictions and require calibrated uncertainty estimation, which can be commonly tackled by Gaussian processes (GPs). Existing works apply GPs with symmetric kernels under variational inference to the attention kernel; however, omitting the fact that attention kernels are in essence asymmetric. Moreover, the complexity of deriving the GP posteriors remains high for large-scale data. In this work, we propose Kernel-Eigen Pair Sparse Variational Gaussian Processes (KEP-SVGP) for building uncertainty-aware self-attention where the asymmetry of attention kernels is tackled by Kernel SVD (KSVD) and a reduced complexity is acquired. Through KEP-SVGP, i) the SVGP pair induced by the two sets of singular vectors from KSVD w.r.t. the attention kernel fully characterizes the asymmetry; ii) using only a small set of adjoint eigenfunctions from KSVD, the derivation of SVGP posteriors can be based on the inversion of a diagonal matrix containing singular values, contributing to a reduction in time complexity; iii) an evidence lower bound is derived so that variational parameters and network weights can be optimized with it. Experiments verify our excellent performances and efficiency on in-distribution, distribution-shift and out-of-distribution benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) compresses the information from multiple tasks into a unified backbone to improve computational efficiency and generalization. Recent work directly merges multiple independently trained models to perform MTL instead of collecting their raw data for joint training, greatly expanding the application scenarios of MTL. However, by visualizing the representation distribution of existing model merging schemes, we find that the merged model often suffers from the dilemma of representation bias. That is, there is a significant discrepancy in the representation distribution between the merged and individual models, resulting in poor performance of merged MTL. In this paper, we propose a representation surgery solution called "Surgery" to reduce representation bias in the merged model. Specifically, Surgery is a lightweight task-specific module that takes the representation of the merged model as input and attempts to output the biases contained in the representation from the merged model. We then designed an unsupervised optimization objective that updates the Surgery module by minimizing the distance between the merged model's representation and the individual model's representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant MTL performance improvements when our Surgery module is applied to state-of-the-art (SOTA) model merging schemes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mario A. V. Saucedo, Akash Patel, Akshit Saradagi, Christoforos Kanellakis, George Nikolakopoulos</p>
<p>Abstract: In this article, we propose the novel concept of Belief Scene Graphs, which are utility-driven extensions of partial 3D scene graphs, that enable efficient high-level task planning with partial information. We propose a graph-based learning methodology for the computation of belief (also referred to as expectation) on any given 3D scene graph, which is then used to strategically add new nodes (referred to as blind nodes) that are relevant to a robotic mission. We propose the method of Computation of Expectation based on Correlation Information (CECI), to reasonably approximate real Belief/Expectation, by learning histograms from available training data. A novel Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCN) model is developed, to learn CECI from a repository of 3D scene graphs. As no database of 3D scene graphs exists for the training of the novel CECI model, we present a novel methodology for generating a 3D scene graph dataset based on semantically annotated real-life 3D spaces. The generated dataset is then utilized to train the proposed CECI model and for extensive validation of the proposed method. We establish the novel concept of \textit{Belief Scene Graphs} (BSG), as a core component to integrate expectations into abstract representations. This new concept is an evolution of the classical 3D scene graph concept and aims to enable high-level reasoning for task planning and optimization of a variety of robotics missions. The efficacy of the overall framework has been evaluated in an object search scenario, and has also been tested in a real-life experiment to emulate human common sense of unseen-objects.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kai Wang, Zhaopan Xu, Yukun Zhou, Zelin Zang, Trevor Darrell, Zhuang Liu, Yang You</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image and video generation. In this work, we demonstrate that diffusion models can also \textit{generate high-performing neural network parameters}. Our approach is simple, utilizing an autoencoder and a standard latent diffusion model. The autoencoder extracts latent representations of a subset of the trained network parameters. A diffusion model is then trained to synthesize these latent parameter representations from random noise. It then generates new representations that are passed through the autoencoder's decoder, whose outputs are ready to use as new subsets of network parameters. Across various architectures and datasets, our diffusion process consistently generates models of comparable or improved performance over trained networks, with minimal additional cost. Notably, we empirically find that the generated models are not memorizing the trained networks. Our results encourage more exploration on the versatile use of diffusion models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yue Yang, Yuqi Lin, Hong Liu, Wenqi Shao, Runjian Chen, Hailong Shang, Yu Wang, Yu Qiao, Kaipeng Zhang, Ping Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent text-to-image (T2I) models have had great success, and many benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate their performance and safety. However, they only consider explicit prompts while neglecting implicit prompts (hint at a target without explicitly mentioning it). These prompts may get rid of safety constraints and pose potential threats to the applications of these models. This position paper highlights the current state of T2I models toward implicit prompts. We present a benchmark named ImplicitBench and conduct an investigation on the performance and impacts of implicit prompts with popular T2I models. Specifically, we design and collect more than 2,000 implicit prompts of three aspects: General Symbols, Celebrity Privacy, and Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW) Issues, and evaluate six well-known T2I models' capabilities under these implicit prompts. Experiment results show that (1) T2I models are able to accurately create various target symbols indicated by implicit prompts; (2) Implicit prompts bring potential risks of privacy leakage for T2I models. (3) Constraints of NSFW in most of the evaluated T2I models can be bypassed with implicit prompts. We call for increased attention to the potential and risks of implicit prompts in the T2I community and further investigation into the capabilities and impacts of implicit prompts, advocating for a balanced approach that harnesses their benefits while mitigating their risks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanjie Ze, Gu Zhang, Kangning Zhang, Chenyuan Hu, Muhan Wang, Huazhe Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Imitation learning provides an efficient way to teach robots dexterous skills; however, learning complex skills robustly and generalizablely usually consumes large amounts of human demonstrations. To tackle this challenging problem, we present 3D Diffusion Policy (DP3), a novel visual imitation learning approach that incorporates the power of 3D visual representations into diffusion policies, a class of conditional action generative models. The core design of DP3 is the utilization of a compact 3D visual representation, extracted from sparse point clouds with an efficient point encoder. In our experiments involving 72 simulation tasks, DP3 successfully handles most tasks with just 10 demonstrations and surpasses baselines with a 24.2% relative improvement. In 4 real robot tasks, DP3 demonstrates precise control with a high success rate of 85%, given only 40 demonstrations of each task, and shows excellent generalization abilities in diverse aspects, including space, viewpoint, appearance, and instance. Interestingly, in real robot experiments, DP3 rarely violates safety requirements, in contrast to baseline methods which frequently do, necessitating human intervention. Our extensive evaluation highlights the critical importance of 3D representations in real-world robot learning. Videos, code, and data are available on https://3d-diffusion-policy.github.io .</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengru Wang, Ningyu Zhang, Ziwen Xu, Zekun Xi, Shumin Deng, Yunzhi Yao, Qishen Zhang, Linyi Yang, Jindong Wang, Huajun Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates using knowledge editing techniques to detoxify Large Language Models (LLMs). We construct a benchmark, SafeEdit, which covers nine unsafe categories with various powerful attack prompts and equips comprehensive metrics for systematic evaluation. We conduct experiments with several knowledge editing approaches, indicating that knowledge editing has the potential to detoxify LLMs with a limited impact on general performance efficiently. Then, we propose a simple yet effective baseline, dubbed Detoxifying with Intraoperative Neural Monitoring (DINM), to diminish the toxicity of LLMs within a few tuning steps via only one instance. We further provide an in-depth analysis of the internal mechanism for various detoxifying approaches, demonstrating that previous methods like SFT and DPO may merely suppress the activations of toxic parameters, while DINM mitigates the toxicity of the toxic parameters to a certain extent, making permanent adjustments. We hope that these insights could shed light on future work of developing detoxifying approaches and the underlying knowledge mechanisms of LLMs. Code and benchmark are available at https://github.com/zjunlp/EasyEdit.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiwei Chen, Chao Tang, Amir Aghabiglou, Chung San Chu, Yves Wiaux</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a new approach for non-Cartesian magnetic resonance image reconstruction. While unrolled architectures provide robustness via data-consistency layers, embedding measurement operators in Deep Neural Network (DNN) can become impractical at large scale. Alternative Plug-and-Play (PnP) approaches, where the denoising DNNs are blind to the measurement setting, are not affected by this limitation and have also proven effective, but their highly iterative nature also affects scalability. To address this scalability challenge, we leverage the "Residual-to-Residual DNN series for high-Dynamic range imaging (R2D2)" approach recently introduced in astronomical imaging. R2D2's reconstruction is formed as a series of residual images, iteratively estimated as outputs of DNNs taking the previous iteration's image estimate and associated data residual as inputs. The method can be interpreted as a learned version of the Matching Pursuit algorithm. We demonstrate R2D2 in simulation, considering radial k-space sampling acquisition sequences. Our preliminary results suggest that R2D2 achieves: (i) suboptimal performance compared to its unrolled incarnation R2D2-Net, which is however non-scalable due to the necessary embedding of NUFFT-based data-consistency layers; (ii) superior reconstruction quality to a scalable version of R2D2-Net embedding an FFT-based approximation for data consistency; (iii) superior reconstruction quality to PnP, while only requiring few iterations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hugo Caselles-Dupr\'e, Charles Mellerio, Paul H\'erent, Aliz\'ee Lopez-Persem, Benoit B\'eranger, Mathieu Soularue, Pierre Fautrel, Gauthier Vernier, Matthieu Cord</p>
<p>Abstract: The reconstruction of images observed by subjects from fMRI data collected during visual stimuli has made strong progress in the past decade, thanks to the availability of extensive fMRI datasets and advancements in generative models for image generation. However, the application of visual reconstruction has remained limited. Reconstructing visual imagination presents a greater challenge, with potentially revolutionary applications ranging from aiding individuals with disabilities to verifying witness accounts in court. The primary hurdles in this field are the absence of data collection protocols for visual imagery and the lack of datasets on the subject. Traditionally, fMRI-to-image relies on data collected from subjects exposed to visual stimuli, which poses issues for generating visual imagery based on the difference of brain activity between visual stimulation and visual imagery. For the first time, we have compiled a substantial dataset (around 6h of scans) on visual imagery along with a proposed data collection protocol. We then train a modified version of an fMRI-to-image model and demonstrate the feasibility of reconstructing images from two modes of imagination: from memory and from pure imagination. The resulting pipeline we call Mind-to-Image marks a step towards creating a technology that allow direct reconstruction of visual imagery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hangyu Lin, Chen Liu, Chengming Xu, Zhengqi Gao, Yanwei Fu, Yuan Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: Cross-modality distillation arises as an important topic for data modalities containing limited knowledge such as depth maps and high-quality sketches. Such techniques are of great importance, especially for memory and privacy-restricted scenarios where labeled training data is generally unavailable. To solve the problem, existing label-free methods leverage a few pairwise unlabeled data to distill the knowledge by aligning features or statistics between the source and target modalities. For instance, one typically aims to minimize the L2 distance or contrastive loss between the learned features of pairs of samples in the source (e.g. image) and the target (e.g. sketch) modalities. However, most algorithms in this domain only focus on the experimental results but lack theoretical insight. To bridge the gap between the theory and practical method of cross-modality distillation, we first formulate a general framework of cross-modality contrastive distillation (CMCD), built upon contrastive learning that leverages both positive and negative correspondence, towards a better distillation of generalizable features. Furthermore, we establish a thorough convergence analysis that reveals that the distance between source and target modalities significantly impacts the test error on downstream tasks within the target modality which is also validated by the empirical results. Extensive experimental results show that our algorithm outperforms existing algorithms consistently by a margin of 2-3\% across diverse modalities and tasks, covering modalities of image, sketch, depth map, and audio and tasks of recognition and segmentation.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11176">Outlier-Robust Long-Term Robotic Mapping Leveraging Ground Segmentation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyungtae Lim</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the remarkable advancements in deep learning-based perception technologies and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), one can face the failure of these approaches when robots encounter scenarios outside their modeled experiences (here, the term modeling encompasses both conventional pattern finding and data-driven approaches). In particular, because learning-based methods are prone to catastrophic failure when operated in untrained scenes, there is still a demand for conventional yet robust approaches that work out of the box in diverse scenarios, such as real-world robotic services and SLAM competitions. In addition, the dynamic nature of real-world environments, characterized by changing surroundings over time and the presence of moving objects, leads to undesirable data points that hinder a robot from localization and path planning. Consequently, methodologies that enable long-term map management, such as multi-session SLAM and static map building, become essential. Therefore, to achieve a robust long-term robotic mapping system that can work out of the box, first, I propose (i) fast and robust ground segmentation to reject the ground points, which are featureless and thus not helpful for localization and mapping. Then, by employing the concept of graduated non-convexity (GNC), I propose (ii) outlier-robust registration with ground segmentation that overcomes the presence of gross outliers within the feature matching results, and (iii) hierarchical multi-session SLAM that not only uses our proposed GNC-based registration but also employs a GNC solver to be robust against outlier loop candidates. Finally, I propose (iv) instance-aware static map building that can handle the presence of moving objects in the environment based on the observation that most moving objects in urban environments are inevitably in contact with the ground.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiali Cui, Tian Han</p>
<p>Abstract: This work studies the learning problem of the energy-based prior model and the multi-layer generator model. The multi-layer generator model, which contains multiple layers of latent variables organized in a top-down hierarchical structure, typically assumes the Gaussian prior model. Such a prior model can be limited in modelling expressivity, which results in a gap between the generator posterior and the prior model, known as the prior hole problem. Recent works have explored learning the energy-based (EBM) prior model as a second-stage, complementary model to bridge the gap. However, the EBM defined on a multi-layer latent space can be highly multi-modal, which makes sampling from such marginal EBM prior challenging in practice, resulting in ineffectively learned EBM. To tackle the challenge, we propose to leverage the diffusion probabilistic scheme to mitigate the burden of EBM sampling and thus facilitate EBM learning. Our extensive experiments demonstrate a superior performance of our diffusion-learned EBM prior on various challenging tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiyu Qin, Jinpeng Wang, Yimin Zhou, Bin Chen, Tianci Luo, Baoyi An, Tao Dai, Shutao Xia, Yaowei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Learned visual compression is an important and active task in multimedia. Existing approaches have explored various CNN- and Transformer-based designs to model content distribution and eliminate redundancy, where balancing efficacy (i.e., rate-distortion trade-off) and efficiency remains a challenge. Recently, state-space models (SSMs) have shown promise due to their long-range modeling capacity and efficiency. Inspired by this, we take the first step to explore SSMs for visual compression. We introduce MambaVC, a simple, strong and efficient compression network based on SSM. MambaVC develops a visual state space (VSS) block with a 2D selective scanning (2DSS) module as the nonlinear activation function after each downsampling, which helps to capture informative global contexts and enhances compression. On compression benchmark datasets, MambaVC achieves superior rate-distortion performance with lower computational and memory overheads. Specifically, it outperforms CNN and Transformer variants by 9.3% and 15.6% on Kodak, respectively, while reducing computation by 42% and 24%, and saving 12% and 71% of memory. MambaVC shows even greater improvements with high-resolution images, highlighting its potential and scalability in real-world applications. We also provide a comprehensive comparison of different network designs, underscoring MambaVC's advantages. Code is available at https://github.com/QinSY123/2024-MambaVC.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in tasks like the Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC), showcasing advanced textual common-sense reasoning. However, applying this reasoning to multimodal domains, where understanding text and images together is essential, remains a substantial challenge. To address this, we introduce WinoVis, a novel dataset specifically designed to probe text-to-image models on pronoun disambiguation within multimodal contexts. Utilizing GPT-4 for prompt generation and Diffusion Attentive Attribution Maps (DAAM) for heatmap analysis, we propose a novel evaluation framework that isolates the models' ability in pronoun disambiguation from other visual processing challenges. Evaluation of successive model versions reveals that, despite incremental advancements, Stable Diffusion 2.0 achieves a precision of 56.7% on WinoVis, only marginally surpassing random guessing. Further error analysis identifies important areas for future research aimed at advancing text-to-image models in their ability to interpret and interact with the complex visual world.</p>
