<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Multi-Modal Models (LMMs) have emerged as transformative tools in scientific research, yet their reliability and specific contributions to biomedical applications remain insufficiently characterized. In this study, we present \textbf{AR}tificial \textbf{I}ntelligence research assistant for \textbf{E}xpert-involved \textbf{L}earning (ARIEL), a multimodal dataset designed to benchmark and enhance two critical capabilities of LLMs and LMMs in biomedical research: summarizing extensive scientific texts and interpreting complex biomedical figures. To facilitate rigorous assessment, we create two open-source sets comprising biomedical articles and figures with designed questions. We systematically benchmark both open- and closed-source foundation models, incorporating expert-driven human evaluations conducted by doctoral-level experts. Furthermore, we improve model performance through targeted prompt engineering and fine-tuning strategies for summarizing research papers, and apply test-time computational scaling to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LMMs, achieving superior accuracy compared to human-expert corrections. We also explore the potential of using LMM Agents to generate scientific hypotheses from diverse multimodal inputs. Overall, our results delineate clear strengths and highlight significant limitations of current foundation models, providing actionable insights and guiding future advancements in deploying large-scale language and multi-modal models within biomedical research.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04646">Computational Irreducibility as the Foundation of Agency: A Formal Model Connecting Undecidability to Autonomous Behavior in Complex Systems</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Poria Azadi</p>
<p>Abstract: This article explores the emergence of autonomy and agency by connecting fundamental computational limits (decidability, completeness, computational irreducibility) with physical concepts. We introduce a formal model of a "minimal agent" operating within potentially Turing-complete environments. Using algorithmic information theory, we argue that the inherent undecidability and computational irreducibility of agent-environment interaction lead to unpredictability and novel information generation, enabling agency (effective goal-directed action). Computational irreducibility prevents full external prediction, creating necessary conditions for autonomous behavior. We relate this to computational sourcehood, where an agent is the irreducible origin of its behavior, though formalizing this concept remains challenging. Our central thesis, formally proven, is that genuine autonomy necessarily implies undecidability from an external perspective, distinguishing autonomous systems from predictable ones. We propose that agency arises when agent-environment coupling complexity allows mutual information between internal states and relevant environmental variables to increase, particularly where analytical solutions are absent and operational closure is needed for persistence. This framework links agency directly to the computational properties of interaction, offering implications for understanding consciousness, designing autonomous AI, and reconceptualizing free will in a deterministic yet computationally irreducible universe.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04674">Dynamic Location Search for Identifying Maximum Weighted Independent Sets in Complex Networks</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Enqiang Zhu, Chenkai Hao, Chanjuan Liu, Yongsheng Rao</p>
<p>Abstract: While Artificial intelligence (AI), including Generative AI, are effective at generating high-quality traffic data and optimization solutions in intelligent transportation systems (ITSs), these techniques often demand significant training time and computational resources, especially in large-scale and complex scenarios. To address this, we introduce a novel and efficient algorithm for solving the maximum weighted independent set (MWIS) problem, which can be used to model many ITSs applications, such as traffic signal control and vehicle routing. Given the NP-hard nature of the MWIS problem, our proposed algorithm, DynLS, incorporates three key innovations to solve it effectively. First, it uses a scores-based adaptive vertex perturbation (SAVP) technique to accelerate convergence, particularly in sparse graphs. Second, it includes a region location mechanism (RLM) to help escape local optima by dynamically adjusting the search space. Finally, it employs a novel variable neighborhood descent strategy, ComLS, which combines vertex exchange strategies with a reward mechanism to guide the search toward high-quality solutions. Our experimental results demonstrate DynLS's superior performance, consistently delivering high-quality solutions within 1000 seconds. DynLS outperformed five leading algorithms across 360 test instances, achieving the best solution for 350 instances and surpassing the second-best algorithm, Cyclic-Fast, by 177 instances. Moreover, DynLS matched Cyclic-Fast's convergence speed, highlighting its efficiency and practicality. This research represents a significant advancement in heuristic algorithms for the MWIS problem, offering a promising approach to aid AI techniques in optimizing intelligent transportation systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sutapa Dey Tithi, Arun Kumar Ramesh, Clara DiMarco, Xiaoyi Tian, Nazia Alam, Kimia Fazeli, Tiffany Barnes</p>
<p>Abstract: Intelligent tutoring systems have demonstrated effectiveness in teaching formal propositional logic proofs, but their reliance on template-based explanations limits their ability to provide personalized student feedback. While large language models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for dynamic feedback generation, they risk producing hallucinations or pedagogically unsound explanations. We evaluated the stepwise accuracy of LLMs in constructing multi-step symbolic logic proofs, comparing six prompting techniques across four state-of-the-art LLMs on 358 propositional logic problems. Results show that DeepSeek-V3 achieved superior performance with 84.4% accuracy on stepwise proof construction and excelled particularly in simpler rules. We further used the best-performing LLM to generate explanatory hints for 1,050 unique student problem-solving states from a logic ITS and evaluated them on 4 criteria with both an LLM grader and human expert ratings on a 20% sample. Our analysis finds that LLM-generated hints were 75% accurate and rated highly by human evaluators on consistency and clarity, but did not perform as well explaining why the hint was provided or its larger context. Our results demonstrate that LLMs may be used to augment tutoring systems with logic tutoring hints, but requires additional modifications to ensure accuracy and pedagogical appropriateness.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04822">Is there Value in Reinforcement Learning?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Lior Fox, Yonatan Loewenstein</p>
<p>Abstract: Action-values play a central role in popular Reinforcement Learing (RL) models of behavior. Yet, the idea that action-values are explicitly represented has been extensively debated. Critics had therefore repeatedly suggested that policy-gradient (PG) models should be favored over value-based (VB) ones, as a potential solution for this dilemma. Here we argue that this solution is unsatisfying. This is because PG methods are not, in fact, "Value-free" -- while they do not rely on an explicit representation of Value for acting (stimulus-response mapping), they do require it for learning. Hence, switching to PG models is, per se, insufficient for eliminating Value from models of behavior. More broadly, the requirement for a representation of Value stems from the underlying assumptions regarding the optimization objective posed by the standard RL framework, not from the particular algorithm chosen to solve it. Previous studies mostly took these standard RL assumptions for granted, as part of their conceptualization or problem modeling, while debating the different methods used to optimize it (i.e., PG or VB). We propose that, instead, the focus of the debate should shift to critically evaluating the underlying modeling assumptions. Such evaluation is particularly important from an experimental perspective. Indeed, the very notion of Value must be reconsidered when standard assumptions (e.g., risk neutrality, full-observability, Markovian environment, exponential discounting) are relaxed, as is likely in natural settings. Finally, we use the Value debate as a case study to argue in favor of a more nuanced, algorithmic rather than statistical, view of what constitutes "a model" in cognitive sciences. Our analysis suggests that besides "parametric" statistical complexity, additional aspects such as computational complexity must also be taken into account when evaluating model complexity.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04843">Large Language Models are Autonomous Cyber Defenders</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sebasti\'an R. Castro, Roberto Campbell, Nancy Lau, Octavio Villalobos, Jiaqi Duan, Alvaro A. Cardenas</p>
<p>Abstract: Fast and effective incident response is essential to prevent adversarial cyberattacks. Autonomous Cyber Defense (ACD) aims to automate incident response through Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents that plan and execute actions. Most ACD approaches focus on single-agent scenarios and leverage Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, ACD RL-trained agents depend on costly training, and their reasoning is not always explainable or transferable. Large Language Models (LLMs) can address these concerns by providing explainable actions in general security contexts. Researchers have explored LLM agents for ACD but have not evaluated them on multi-agent scenarios or interacting with other ACD agents. In this paper, we show the first study on how LLMs perform in multi-agent ACD environments by proposing a new integration to the CybORG CAGE 4 environment. We examine how ACD teams of LLM and RL agents can interact by proposing a novel communication protocol. Our results highlight the strengths and weaknesses of LLMs and RL and help us identify promising research directions to create, train, and deploy future teams of ACD agents.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04851">CRAFT: Cultural Russian-Oriented Dataset Adaptation for Focused Text-to-Image Generation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Viacheslav Vasilev, Vladimir Arkhipkin, Julia Agafonova, Tatiana Nikulina, Evelina Mironova, Alisa Shichanina, Nikolai Gerasimenko, Mikhail Shoytov, Denis Dimitrov</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the fact that popular text-to-image generation models cope well with international and general cultural queries, they have a significant knowledge gap regarding individual cultures. This is due to the content of existing large training datasets collected on the Internet, which are predominantly based on Western European or American popular culture. Meanwhile, the lack of cultural adaptation of the model can lead to incorrect results, a decrease in the generation quality, and the spread of stereotypes and offensive content. In an effort to address this issue, we examine the concept of cultural code and recognize the critical importance of its understanding by modern image generation models, an issue that has not been sufficiently addressed in the research community to date. We propose the methodology for collecting and processing the data necessary to form a dataset based on the cultural code, in particular the Russian one. We explore how the collected data affects the quality of generations in the national domain and analyze the effectiveness of our approach using the Kandinsky 3.1 text-to-image model. Human evaluation results demonstrate an increase in the level of awareness of Russian culture in the model.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04914">Enigme: Generative Text Puzzles for Evaluating Reasoning in Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> John Hawkins</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer-decoder language models are a core innovation in text based generative artificial intelligence. These models are being deployed as general-purpose intelligence systems in many applications. Central to their utility is the capacity to understand natural language commands and exploit the reasoning embedded in human text corpora to apply some form of reasoning process to a wide variety of novel tasks. To understand the limitations of this approach to generating reasoning we argue that we need to consider the architectural constraints of these systems. Consideration of the latent variable structure of transformer-decoder models allows us to design reasoning tasks that should probe the boundary of their capacity to reason. We present enigme, an open-source library for generating text-based puzzles to be used in training and evaluating reasoning skills within transformer-decoder models and future AI architectures.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04927">Belief Filtering for Epistemic Control in Linguistic State Space</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sebastian Dumbrava</p>
<p>Abstract: We examine belief filtering as a mechanism for the epistemic control of artificial agents, focusing on the regulation of internal cognitive states represented as linguistic expressions. This mechanism is developed within the Semantic Manifold framework, where belief states are dynamic, structured ensembles of natural language fragments. Belief filters act as content-aware operations on these fragments across various cognitive transitions. This paper illustrates how the inherent interpretability and modularity of such a linguistically-grounded cognitive architecture directly enable belief filtering, offering a principled approach to agent regulation. The study highlights the potential for enhancing AI safety and alignment through structured interventions in an agent's internal semantic space and points to new directions for architecturally embedded cognitive governance.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04950">Position: Epistemic Artificial Intelligence is Essential for Machine Learning Models to Know When They Do Not Know</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shireen Kudukkil Manchingal, Fabio Cuzzolin</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the impressive achievements of AI, including advancements in generative models and large language models, there remains a significant gap in the ability of AI to handle uncertainty and generalize beyond the training data. We argue that AI models, especially in autonomous systems, fail to make robust predictions when faced with unfamiliar or adversarial data, as evidenced by incidents with autonomous vehicles. Traditional machine learning approaches struggle to address these issues due to an overemphasis on data fitting and domain adaptation. This position paper posits a paradigm shift towards epistemic artificial intelligence, emphasizing the need for models to learn not only from what they know but also from their ignorance. This approach, which focuses on recognizing and managing uncertainty, offers a potential solution to improve the resilience and robustness of AI systems, ensuring that they can better handle unpredictable real-world environments.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04966">Position: The AI Conference Peer Review Crisis Demands Author Feedback and Reviewer Rewards</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaeho Kim, Yunseok Lee, Seulki Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: The peer review process in major artificial intelligence (AI) conferences faces unprecedented challenges with the surge of paper submissions (exceeding 10,000 submissions per venue), accompanied by growing concerns over review quality and reviewer responsibility. This position paper argues for the need to transform the traditional one-way review system into a bi-directional feedback loop where authors evaluate review quality and reviewers earn formal accreditation, creating an accountability framework that promotes a sustainable, high-quality peer review system. The current review system can be viewed as an interaction between three parties: the authors, reviewers, and system (i.e., conference), where we posit that all three parties share responsibility for the current problems. However, issues with authors can only be addressed through policy enforcement and detection tools, and ethical concerns can only be corrected through self-reflection. As such, this paper focuses on reforming reviewer accountability with systematic rewards through two key mechanisms: (1) a two-stage bi-directional review system that allows authors to evaluate reviews while minimizing retaliatory behavior, (2)a systematic reviewer reward system that incentivizes quality reviewing. We ask for the community's strong interest in these problems and the reforms that are needed to enhance the peer review process.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ling Yue, Nithin Somasekharan, Yadi Cao, Shaowu Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is an essential simulation tool in various engineering disciplines, but it often requires substantial domain expertise and manual configuration, creating barriers to entry. We present Foam-Agent, a multi-agent framework that automates complex OpenFOAM-based CFD simulation workflows from natural language inputs. Our innovation includes (1) a hierarchical multi-index retrieval system with specialized indices for different simulation aspects, (2) a dependency-aware file generation system that provides consistency management across configuration files, and (3) an iterative error correction mechanism that diagnoses and resolves simulation failures without human intervention. Through comprehensive evaluation on the dataset of 110 simulation tasks, Foam-Agent achieves an 83.6% success rate with Claude 3.5 Sonnet, significantly outperforming existing frameworks (55.5% for MetaOpenFOAM and 37.3% for OpenFOAM-GPT). Ablation studies demonstrate the critical contribution of each system component, with the specialized error correction mechanism providing a 36.4% performance improvement. Foam-Agent substantially lowers the CFD expertise threshold while maintaining modeling accuracy, demonstrating the potential of specialized multi-agent systems to democratize access to complex scientific simulation tools.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siyue Ren, Wanli Fu, Xinkun Zou, Chen Shen, Yi Cai, Chen Chu, Zhen Wang, Shuyue Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: The tragedy of the commons, where individual self-interest leads to collectively disastrous outcomes, is a pervasive challenge in human society. Recent studies have demonstrated that similar phenomena can arise in generative multi-agent systems (MASs). To address this challenge, this paper explores the use of reputation systems as a remedy. We propose RepuNet, a dynamic, dual-level reputation framework that models both agent-level reputation dynamics and system-level network evolution. Specifically, driven by direct interactions and indirect gossip, agents form reputations for both themselves and their peers, and decide whether to connect or disconnect other agents for future interactions. Through two distinct scenarios, we show that RepuNet effectively mitigates the 'tragedy of the commons', promoting and sustaining cooperation in generative MASs. Moreover, we find that reputation systems can give rise to rich emergent behaviors in generative MASs, such as the formation of cooperative clusters, the social isolation of exploitative agents, and the preference for sharing positive gossip rather than negative ones.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sandro Junior Della Rovere, Davide Basso, Luca Bortolussi, Mirjana Videnovic-Misic, Husni Habal</p>
<p>Abstract: The layout of analog ICs requires making complex trade-offs, while addressing device physics and variability of the circuits. This makes full automation with learning-based solutions hard to achieve. However, reinforcement learning (RL) has recently reached significant results, particularly in solving the floorplanning problem. This paper presents a hybrid method that combines RL with a beam (BS) strategy. The BS algorithm enhances the agent's inference process, allowing for the generation of flexible floorplans by accomodating various objective weightings, and addressing congestion without without the need for policy retraining or fine-tuning. Moreover, the RL agent's generalization ability stays intact, along with its efficient handling of circuit features and constraints. Experimental results show approx. 5-85% improvement in area, dead space and half-perimeter wire length compared to a standard RL application, along with higher rewards for the agent. Moreover, performance and efficiency align closely with those of existing state-of-the-art techniques.</p>

<p>Abstract: One of the goals of neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence is to exploit background knowledge to improve the performance of learning tasks. However, most of the existing frameworks focus on the simplified scenario where knowledge does not change over time and does not cover the temporal dimension. In this work we consider the much more challenging problem of knowledge-driven sequence classification where different portions of knowledge must be employed at different timesteps, and temporal relations are available. Our experimental evaluation compares multi-stage neuro-symbolic and neural-only architectures, and it is conducted on a newly-introduced benchmarking framework. Results demonstrate the challenging nature of this novel setting, and also highlight under-explored shortcomings of neuro-symbolic methods, representing a precious reference for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaohan Feng, Ruiqi Xue, Lei Yuan, Yang Yu, Ning Ding, Meiqin Liu, Bingzhao Gao, Jian Sun, Gang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Embodied artificial intelligence (Embodied AI) plays a pivotal role in the application of advanced technologies in the intelligent era, where AI systems are integrated with physical bodies that enable them to perceive, reason, and interact with their environments. Through the use of sensors for input and actuators for action, these systems can learn and adapt based on real-world feedback, allowing them to perform tasks effectively in dynamic and unpredictable environments. As techniques such as deep learning (DL), reinforcement learning (RL), and large language models (LLMs) mature, embodied AI has become a leading field in both academia and industry, with applications spanning robotics, healthcare, transportation, and manufacturing. However, most research has focused on single-agent systems that often assume static, closed environments, whereas real-world embodied AI must navigate far more complex scenarios. In such settings, agents must not only interact with their surroundings but also collaborate with other agents, necessitating sophisticated mechanisms for adaptation, real-time learning, and collaborative problem-solving. Despite increasing interest in multi-agent systems, existing research remains narrow in scope, often relying on simplified models that fail to capture the full complexity of dynamic, open environments for multi-agent embodied AI. Moreover, no comprehensive survey has systematically reviewed the advancements in this area. As embodied AI rapidly evolves, it is crucial to deepen our understanding of multi-agent embodied AI to address the challenges presented by real-world applications. To fill this gap and foster further development in the field, this paper reviews the current state of research, analyzes key contributions, and identifies challenges and future directions, providing insights to guide innovation and progress in this field.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05115">Is there a half-life for the success rates of AI agents?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Toby Ord</p>
<p>Abstract: Building on the recent empirical work of Kwa et al. (2025), I show that within their suite of research-engineering tasks the performance of AI agents on longer-duration tasks can be explained by an extremely simple mathematical model -- a constant rate of failing during each minute a human would take to do the task. This implies an exponentially declining success rate with the length of the task and that each agent could be characterised by its own half-life. This empirical regularity allows us to estimate the success rate for an agent at different task lengths. And the fact that this model is a good fit for the data is suggestive of the underlying causes of failure on longer tasks -- that they involve increasingly large sets of subtasks where failing any one fails the task. Whether this model applies more generally on other suites of tasks is unknown and an important subject for further work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anish Ganguli, Prabal Deb, Debleena Banerjee</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) assist in specialized tasks but struggle to align with evolving domain knowledge without costly fine-tuning. Domain knowledge consists of: Knowledge: Immutable facts (e.g., 'A stone is solid') and generally accepted principles (e.g., ethical standards); Refined Memory: Evolving insights shaped by business needs and real-world changes. However, a significant gap often exists between a domain expert's deep, nuanced understanding and the system's domain knowledge, which can hinder accurate information retrieval and application. Our Memory-Augmented Refinement of Knowledge (MARK) framework enables LLMs to continuously learn without retraining by leveraging structured refined memory, inspired by the Society of Mind. MARK operates through specialized agents, each serving a distinct role: Residual Refined Memory Agent: Stores and retrieves domain-specific insights to maintain context over time; User Question Refined Memory Agent: Captures user-provided facts, abbreviations, and terminology for better comprehension; LLM Response Refined Memory Agent: Extracts key elements from responses for refinement and personalization. These agents analyse stored refined memory, detect patterns, resolve contradictions, and improve response accuracy. Temporal factors like recency and frequency prioritize relevant information while discarding outdated insights. MARK enhances LLMs in multiple ways: Ground Truth Strategy: Reduces hallucinations by establishing a structured reference; Domain-Specific Adaptation: Essential for fields like healthcare, law, and manufacturing, where proprietary insights are absent from public datasets; Personalized AI Assistants: Improves virtual assistants by remembering user preferences, ensuring coherent responses over time.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05197">Societal and technological progress as sewing an ever-growing, ever-changing, patchy, and polychrome quilt</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Joel Z. Leibo, Alexander Sasha Vezhnevets, William A. Cunningham, S\'ebastien Krier, Manfred Diaz, Simon Osindero</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly placed in positions where their decisions have real consequences, e.g., moderating online spaces, conducting research, and advising on policy. Ensuring they operate in a safe and ethically acceptable fashion is thus critical. However, most solutions have been a form of one-size-fits-all "alignment". We are worried that such systems, which overlook enduring moral diversity, will spark resistance, erode trust, and destabilize our institutions. This paper traces the underlying problem to an often-unstated Axiom of Rational Convergence: the idea that under ideal conditions, rational agents will converge in the limit of conversation on a single ethics. Treating that premise as both optional and doubtful, we propose what we call the appropriateness framework: an alternative approach grounded in conflict theory, cultural evolution, multi-agent systems, and institutional economics. The appropriateness framework treats persistent disagreement as the normal case and designs for it by applying four principles: (1) contextual grounding, (2) community customization, (3) continual adaptation, and (4) polycentric governance. We argue here that adopting these design principles is a good way to shift the main alignment metaphor from moral unification to a more productive metaphor of conflict management, and that taking this step is both desirable and urgent.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mahmoud Amiri, Thomas Bocklitz</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid expansion of chemistry literature poses significant challenges for researchers seeking to efficiently access domain-specific knowledge. To support advancements in chemistry-focused natural language processing (NLP), we present ChemRxivQuest, a curated dataset of 970 high-quality question-answer (QA) pairs derived from 155 ChemRxiv preprints across 17 subfields of chemistry. Each QA pair is explicitly linked to its source text segment to ensure traceability and contextual accuracy. ChemRxivQuest was constructed using an automated pipeline that combines optical character recognition (OCR), GPT-4o-based QA generation, and a fuzzy matching technique for answer verification. The dataset emphasizes conceptual, mechanistic, applied, and experimental questions, enabling applications in retrieval-based QA systems, search engine development, and fine-tuning of domain-adapted large language models. We analyze the dataset's structure, coverage, and limitations, and outline future directions for expansion and expert validation. ChemRxivQuest provides a foundational resource for chemistry NLP research, education, and tool development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luca Marzari, Isabella Mastroeni, Alessandro Farinelli</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional methods for formal verification (FV) of deep neural networks (DNNs) are constrained by a binary encoding of safety properties, where a model is classified as either safe or unsafe (robust or not robust). This binary encoding fails to capture the nuanced safety levels within a model, often resulting in either overly restrictive or too permissive requirements. In this paper, we introduce a novel problem formulation called Abstract DNN-Verification, which verifies a hierarchical structure of unsafe outputs, providing a more granular analysis of the safety aspect for a given DNN. Crucially, by leveraging abstract interpretation and reasoning about output reachable sets, our approach enables assessing multiple safety levels during the FV process, requiring the same (in the worst case) or even potentially less computational effort than the traditional binary verification approach. Specifically, we demonstrate how this formulation allows rank adversarial inputs according to their abstract safety level violation, offering a more detailed evaluation of the model's safety and robustness. Our contributions include a theoretical exploration of the relationship between our novel abstract safety formulation and existing approaches that employ abstract interpretation for robustness verification, complexity analysis of the novel problem introduced, and an empirical evaluation considering both a complex deep reinforcement learning task (based on Habitat 3.0) and standard DNN-Verification benchmarks.</p>

  This thesis initially aims to study the pain assessment process from a clinical-theoretical perspective while exploring and examining existing automatic approaches. Building on this foundation, the primary objective of this Ph.D. project is to develop innovative computational methods for automatic pain assessment that achieve high performance and are applicable in real clinical settings. A primary goal is to thoroughly investigate and assess significant factors, including demographic elements that impact pain perception, as recognized in pain research, through a computational standpoint. Within the limits of the available data in this research area, our goal was to design, develop, propose, and offer automatic pain assessment pipelines for unimodal and multimodal configurations that are applicable to the specific requirements of different scenarios. The studies published in this Ph.D. thesis showcased the effectiveness of the proposed methods, achieving state-of-the-art results. Additionally, they paved the way for exploring new approaches in artificial intelligence, foundation models, and generative artificial intelligence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Biao Yi, Xavier Hu, Yurun Chen, Shengyu Zhang, Hongxia Yang, Fan Wu, Fei Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Cloud-based mobile agents powered by (multimodal) large language models ((M)LLMs) offer strong reasoning abilities but suffer from high latency and cost. While fine-tuned (M)SLMs enable edge deployment, they often lose general capabilities and struggle with complex tasks. To address this, we propose EcoAgent, an Edge-Cloud cOllaborative multi-agent framework for mobile automation. EcoAgent features a closed-loop collaboration among a cloud-based Planning Agent and two edge-based agents: the Execution Agent for action execution and the Observation Agent for verifying outcomes. The Observation Agent uses a Pre-Understanding Module to compress screen images into concise text, reducing token usage. In case of failure, the Planning Agent retrieves screen history and replans via a Reflection Module. Experiments on AndroidWorld show that EcoAgent maintains high task success rates while significantly reducing MLLM token consumption, enabling efficient and practical mobile automation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nataliia Klievtsova, Timotheus Kampik, Juergen Mangler, Stefanie Rinderle-Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: With the recent success of large language models (LLMs), the idea of AI-augmented Business Process Management systems is becoming more feasible. One of their essential characteristics is the ability to be conversationally actionable, allowing humans to interact with the LLM effectively to perform crucial process life cycle tasks such as process model design and redesign. However, most current research focuses on single-prompt execution and evaluation of results, rather than on continuous interaction between the user and the LLM. In this work, we aim to explore the feasibility of using LLMs to empower domain experts in the creation and redesign of process models in an iterative and effective way. The proposed conversational process model redesign (CPD) approach receives as input a process model and a redesign request by the user in natural language. Instead of just letting the LLM make changes, the LLM is employed to (a) identify process change patterns from literature, (b) re-phrase the change request to be aligned with an expected wording for the identified pattern (i.e., the meaning), and then to (c) apply the meaning of the change to the process model. This multi-step approach allows for explainable and reproducible changes. In order to ensure the feasibility of the CPD approach, and to find out how well the patterns from literature can be handled by the LLM, we performed an extensive evaluation. The results show that some patterns are hard to understand by LLMs and by users. Within the scope of the study, we demonstrated that users need support to describe the changes clearly. Overall the evaluation shows that the LLMs can handle most changes well according to a set of completeness and correctness criteria.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yashar Deldjoo, Nikhil Mehta, Maheswaran Sathiamoorthy, Shuai Zhang, Pablo Castells, Julian McAuley</p>
<p>Abstract: Recommender systems powered by generative models (Gen-RecSys) extend beyond classical item ranking by producing open-ended content, which simultaneously unlocks richer user experiences and introduces new risks. On one hand, these systems can enhance personalization and appeal through dynamic explanations and multi-turn dialogues. On the other hand, they might venture into unknown territory-hallucinating nonexistent items, amplifying bias, or leaking private information. Traditional accuracy metrics cannot fully capture these challenges, as they fail to measure factual correctness, content safety, or alignment with user intent.
  This paper makes two main contributions. First, we categorize the evaluation challenges of Gen-RecSys into two groups: (i) existing concerns that are exacerbated by generative outputs (e.g., bias, privacy) and (ii) entirely new risks (e.g., item hallucinations, contradictory explanations). Second, we propose a holistic evaluation approach that includes scenario-based assessments and multi-metric checks-incorporating relevance, factual grounding, bias detection, and policy compliance. Our goal is to provide a guiding framework so researchers and practitioners can thoroughly assess Gen-RecSys, ensuring effective personalization and responsible deployment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yusen Wu, Junwu Xiong, Xiaotie Deng</p>
<p>Abstract: Expanding the application of large language models (LLMs) to societal life, instead of primary function only as auxiliary assistants to communicate with only one person at a time, necessitates LLMs' capabilities to independently play roles in multi-user, multi-turn social agent tasks within complex social settings. However, currently the capability has not been systematically measured with available benchmarks. To address this gap, we first introduce an agent task leveling framework grounded in sociological principles. Concurrently, we propose a novel benchmark, How Social Is It (we call it HSII below), designed to assess LLM's social capabilities in comprehensive social agents tasks and benchmark representative models. HSII comprises four stages: format parsing, target selection, target switching conversation, and stable conversation, which collectively evaluate the communication and task completion capabilities of LLMs within realistic social interaction scenarios dataset, HSII-Dataset. The dataset is derived step by step from news dataset. We perform an ablation study by doing clustering to the dataset. Additionally, we investigate the impact of chain of thought (COT) method on enhancing LLMs' social performance. Since COT cost more computation, we further introduce a new statistical metric, COT-complexity, to quantify the efficiency of certain LLMs with COTs for specific social tasks and strike a better trade-off between measurement of correctness and efficiency. Various results of our experiments demonstrate that our benchmark is well-suited for evaluating social skills in LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: The complexity and difficulties of Kurdish speaker detection among its several dialects are investigated in this work. Because of its great phonetic and lexical differences, Kurdish with several dialects including Kurmanji, Sorani, and Hawrami offers special challenges for speaker recognition systems. The main difficulties in building a strong speaker identification system capable of precisely identifying speakers across several dialects are investigated in this work. To raise the accuracy and dependability of these systems, it also suggests solutions like sophisticated machine learning approaches, data augmentation tactics, and the building of thorough dialect-specific corpus. The results show that customized strategies for every dialect together with cross-dialect training greatly enhance recognition performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongxing Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing diverse data types, yet significant disparities persist between human cognitive processes and computational approaches to multimodal information integration. This research presents a systematic investigation into the parallels between human cross-modal chunking mechanisms and token representation methodologies in MLLMs. Through empirical studies comparing human performance patterns with model behaviors across visual-linguistic tasks, we demonstrate that conventional static tokenization schemes fundamentally constrain current models' capacity to simulate the dynamic, context-sensitive nature of human information processing. We propose a novel framework for dynamic cross-modal tokenization that incorporates adaptive boundaries, hierarchical representations, and alignment mechanisms grounded in cognitive science principles. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that our approach yields statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art models on benchmark tasks (+7.8% on Visual Question Answering, +5.3% on Complex Scene Description) while exhibiting more human-aligned error patterns and attention distributions. These findings contribute to the theoretical understanding of the relationship between human cognition and artificial intelligence, while providing empirical evidence for developing more cognitively plausible AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhishek Mishra, Ritesh Sur Chowdhury, Vartul Bahuguna, Isha Pandey, Ganesh Ramakrishnan</p>
<p>Abstract: Speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) aims to convert spoken input in one language to spoken output in another, typically focusing on either language translation or accent adaptation. However, effective cross-cultural communication requires handling both aspects simultaneously - translating content while adapting the speaker's accent to match the target language context. In this work, we propose a unified approach for simultaneous speech translation and change of accent, a task that remains underexplored in current literature. Our method reformulates the problem as a conditional generation task, where target speech is generated based on phonemes and guided by target speech features. Leveraging the power of diffusion models, known for high-fidelity generative capabilities, we adapt text-to-image diffusion strategies by conditioning on source speech transcriptions and generating Mel spectrograms representing the target speech with desired linguistic and accentual attributes. This integrated framework enables joint optimization of translation and accent adaptation, offering a more parameter-efficient and effective model compared to traditional pipelines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nischal Mandal, Yang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis, a pivotal task in affective computing, seeks to understand human emotions by integrating cues from language, audio, and visual signals. While many recent approaches leverage complex attention mechanisms and hierarchical architectures, we propose a lightweight, yet effective fusion-based deep learning model tailored for utterance-level emotion classification. Using the benchmark IEMOCAP dataset, which includes aligned text, audio-derived numeric features, and visual descriptors, we design a modality-specific encoder using fully connected layers followed by dropout regularization. The modality-specific representations are then fused using simple concatenation and passed through a dense fusion layer to capture cross-modal interactions. This streamlined architecture avoids computational overhead while preserving performance, achieving a classification accuracy of 92% across six emotion categories. Our approach demonstrates that with careful feature engineering and modular design, simpler fusion strategies can outperform or match more complex models, particularly in resource-constrained environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential for conducting diagnostic conversations but evaluation has been largely limited to language-only interactions, deviating from the real-world requirements of remote care delivery. Instant messaging platforms permit clinicians and patients to upload and discuss multimodal medical artifacts seamlessly in medical consultation, but the ability of LLMs to reason over such data while preserving other attributes of competent diagnostic conversation remains unknown. Here we advance the conversational diagnosis and management performance of the Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer (AMIE) through a new capability to gather and interpret multimodal data, and reason about this precisely during consultations. Leveraging Gemini 2.0 Flash, our system implements a state-aware dialogue framework, where conversation flow is dynamically controlled by intermediate model outputs reflecting patient states and evolving diagnoses. Follow-up questions are strategically directed by uncertainty in such patient states, leading to a more structured multimodal history-taking process that emulates experienced clinicians. We compared AMIE to primary care physicians (PCPs) in a randomized, blinded, OSCE-style study of chat-based consultations with patient actors. We constructed 105 evaluation scenarios using artifacts like smartphone skin photos, ECGs, and PDFs of clinical documents across diverse conditions and demographics. Our rubric assessed multimodal capabilities and other clinically meaningful axes like history-taking, diagnostic accuracy, management reasoning, communication, and empathy. Specialist evaluation showed AMIE to be superior to PCPs on 7/9 multimodal and 29/32 non-multimodal axes (including diagnostic accuracy). The results show clear progress in multimodal conversational diagnostic AI, but real-world translation needs further research.</p>

<p>Abstract: Our study presents PNN-UNet as a method for constructing deep neural networks that replicate the planarian neural network (PNN) structure in the context of 3D medical image data. Planarians typically have a cerebral structure comprising two neural cords, where the cerebrum acts as a coordinator, and the neural cords serve slightly different purposes within the organism's neurological system. Accordingly, PNN-UNet comprises a Deep-UNet and a Wide-UNet as the nerve cords, with a densely connected autoencoder performing the role of the brain. This distinct architecture offers advantages over both monolithic (UNet) and modular networks (Ensemble-UNet). Our outcomes on a 3D MRI hippocampus dataset, with and without data augmentation, demonstrate that PNN-UNet outperforms the baseline UNet and several other UNet variants in image segmentation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Although large language models have demonstrated the potential for personalized advertising recommendations in experimental environments, in actual operations, how advertising recommendation systems can be combined with measures such as user privacy protection and data security is still an area worthy of in-depth discussion. To this end, this paper studies the personalized risks and regulatory strategies of large language models in digital advertising. This study first outlines the principles of Large Language Model (LLM), especially the self-attention mechanism based on the Transformer architecture, and how to enable the model to understand and generate natural language text. Then, the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model and the attention mechanism are combined to construct an algorithmic model for personalized advertising recommendations and user factor risk protection. The specific steps include: data collection and preprocessing, feature selection and construction, using large language models such as BERT for advertising semantic embedding, and ad recommendations based on user portraits. Then, local model training and data encryption are used to ensure the security of user privacy and avoid the leakage of personal data. This paper designs an experiment for personalized advertising recommendation based on a large language model of BERT and verifies it with real user data. The experimental results show that BERT-based advertising push can effectively improve the click-through rate and conversion rate of advertisements. At the same time, through local model training and privacy protection mechanisms, the risk of user privacy leakage can be reduced to a certain extent.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Madhur Jindal, Saurabh Deshpande</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) represent a significant advancement in artificial intelligence by integrating image-processing capabilities with textual understanding, thereby enhancing user interactions and expanding application domains. However, their increased complexity introduces novel safety and ethical challenges, particularly in multi-modal and multi-turn conversations. Traditional safety evaluation frameworks, designed for text-based, single-turn interactions, are inadequate for addressing these complexities. To bridge this gap, we introduce the REVEAL (Responsible Evaluation of Vision-Enabled AI LLMs) Framework, a scalable and automated pipeline for evaluating image-input harms in VLLMs. REVEAL includes automated image mining, synthetic adversarial data generation, multi-turn conversational expansion using crescendo attack strategies, and comprehensive harm assessment through evaluators like GPT-4o.
  We extensively evaluated five state-of-the-art VLLMs, GPT-4o, Llama-3.2, Qwen2-VL, Phi3.5V, and Pixtral, across three important harm categories: sexual harm, violence, and misinformation. Our findings reveal that multi-turn interactions result in significantly higher defect rates compared to single-turn evaluations, highlighting deeper vulnerabilities in VLLMs. Notably, GPT-4o demonstrated the most balanced performance as measured by our Safety-Usability Index (SUI) followed closely by Pixtral. Additionally, misinformation emerged as a critical area requiring enhanced contextual defenses. Llama-3.2 exhibited the highest MT defect rate ($16.55 \%$) while Qwen2-VL showed the highest MT refusal rate ($19.1 \%$).</p>

<p>Abstract: The ThEdu series pursues the smooth transition from an intuitive way of doing mathematics at secondary school to a more formal approach to the subject in STEM education while favoring software support for this transition by exploiting the power of theorem-proving technologies.  What follows is a brief description of how the present volume contributes to this enterprise.  The 13th International Workshop on Theorem Proving Components for Educational Software (ThEdu'24), was a satellite event of the CADE29, part of IJCAR 2024, Nancy, France. ThEdu'24 was a vibrant workshop, with one invited talk by Jeremy Avigad (Carnegie Mellon University) and 14 submitted talks. An open call for papers was then issued and attracted 9 submissions. Eight of those submissions have been accepted by our reviewers. The resulting revised papers are collected in the present volume. The contributions in this volume are a faithful representation of the wide spectrum of ThEdu, ranging from those more focused on the automated deduction research, not losing track of the possible applications in an educational setting, to those focused on the applications, in educational settings, of automated deduction tools and methods. We, the volume editors, hope that this collection of papers will further promote the development of theorem-proving-based software and that it will allow to improve the mutual understanding between computer scientists, mathematicians, and stakeholders in education. While this volume goes to press, the next edition of the ThEdu workshop is being prepared: ThEdu'25 will be a satellite event of the 30th international Conference on Automated DEduction (CADE-30), July 28th - August 2nd, 2025, Stuttgart, Germany.

Five distinct deep-learning models were trained on a comprehensive dataset of cuneiform characters and evaluated according to critical performance metrics, including accuracy and precision. Two models demonstrated outstanding performance and were subsequently assessed using cuneiform symbols from the Hammurabi law acquisition, notably Hammurabi Law 1. Each model effectively recognized the relevant Akkadian meanings of the symbols and delivered precise English translations. Future work will investigate ensemble and stacking approaches to optimize performance, utilizing hybrid architectures to improve detection accuracy and reliability. This research explores the linguistic relationships between Akkadian, an ancient Mesopotamian language, and Arabic, emphasizing their historical and cultural linkages. This study demonstrates the capability of deep learning to decipher ancient scripts by merging computational linguistics with archaeology, therefore providing significant insights for the comprehension and conservation of human history.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Robin Chhabra, Farzaneh Abdollahi</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a geometric neural network-based tracking controller for systems evolving on matrix Lie groups under unknown dynamics, actuator faults, and bounded disturbances. Leveraging the left-invariance of the tangent bundle of matrix Lie groups, viewed as an embedded submanifold of the vector space $\R^{N\times N}$, we propose a set of learning rules for neural network weights that are intrinsically compatible with the Lie group structure and do not require explicit parameterization. Exploiting the geometric properties of Lie groups, this approach circumvents parameterization singularities and enables a global search for optimal weights. The ultimate boundedness of all error signals -- including the neural network weights, the coordinate-free configuration error function, and the tracking velocity error -- is established using Lyapunov's direct method. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we provide illustrative simulation results for decentralized formation control of multi-agent systems on the Special Euclidean group.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sriram Gopalakrishnan, Sunandita Patra</p>
<p>Abstract: The Query-By-Document (QBD) problem is an information retrieval problem where the query is a document, and the retrieved candidates are documents that match the query document, often in a domain or query specific manner. This can be crucial for tasks such as patent matching, legal or compliance case retrieval, and academic literature review. Existing retrieval methods, including keyword search and document embeddings, can be optimized with domain-specific datasets to improve QBD search performance. However, creating these domain-specific datasets is often costly and time-consuming. Our work introduces a process to generate custom QBD-search datasets and compares a set of methods to use in this problem, which we refer to as QBD-RankedDatagen. We provide a comparative analysis of our proposed methods in terms of cost, speed, and the human interface with the domain experts. The methods we compare leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) which can incorporate domain expert input to produce document scores and rankings, as well as explanations for human review. The process and methods for it that we present can significantly reduce human effort in dataset creation for custom domains while still obtaining sufficient expert knowledge for tuning retrieval models. We evaluate our methods on QBD datasets from the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) and finetune the parameters of the BM25 model -- which is used in many industrial-strength search engines like OpenSearch -- using the generated data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kenneth Li, Yida Chen, Fernanda Vi\'egas, Martin Wattenberg</p>
<p>Abstract: In large language model (LLM) pretraining, data quality is believed to determine model quality. In this paper, we re-examine the notion of "quality" from the perspective of pre- and post-training co-design. Specifically, we explore the possibility that pre-training on more toxic data can lead to better control in post-training, ultimately decreasing a model's output toxicity. First, we use a toy experiment to study how data composition affects the geometry of features in the representation space. Next, through controlled experiments with Olmo-1B models trained on varying ratios of clean and toxic data, we find that the concept of toxicity enjoys a less entangled linear representation as the proportion of toxic data increases. Furthermore, we show that although toxic data increases the generational toxicity of the base model, it also makes the toxicity easier to remove. Evaluations on Toxigen and Real Toxicity Prompts demonstrate that models trained on toxic data achieve a better trade-off between reducing generational toxicity and preserving general capabilities when detoxifying techniques such as inference-time intervention (ITI) are applied. Our findings suggest that, with post-training taken into account, bad data may lead to good models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohit Chaudhary, Chirag Jain, Preethu Rose Anish</p>
<p>Abstract: App reviews are a critical source of user feedback, offering valuable insights into an app's performance, features, usability, and overall user experience. Effectively analyzing these reviews is essential for guiding app development, prioritizing feature updates, and enhancing user satisfaction. Classifying reviews into functional and non-functional requirements play a pivotal role in distinguishing feedback related to specific app features (functional requirements) from feedback concerning broader quality attributes, such as performance, usability, and reliability (non-functional requirements). Both categories are integral to informed development decisions. Traditional approaches to classifying app reviews are hindered by the need for large, domain-specific datasets, which are often costly and time-consuming to curate. This study explores the potential of zero-shot learning with ChatGPT for classifying app reviews into four categories: functional requirement, non-functional requirement, both, or neither. We evaluate ChatGPT's performance on a benchmark dataset of 1,880 manually annotated reviews from ten diverse apps spanning multiple domains. Our findings demonstrate that ChatGPT achieves a robust F1 score of 0.842 in review classification, despite certain challenges and limitations. Additionally, we examine how factors such as review readability and length impact classification accuracy and conduct a manual analysis to identify review categories more prone to misclassification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pedro Pinacho-Davidson, Fernando Gutierrez, Pablo Zapata, Rodolfo Vergara, Pablo Aqueveque</p>
<p>Abstract: The emergence of Generative AI (Gen AI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled more advanced chatbots capable of human-like interactions. However, these conversational agents introduce a broader set of operational risks that extend beyond traditional cybersecurity considerations. In this work, we propose a novel, instrumented risk-assessment metric that simultaneously evaluates potential threats to three key stakeholders: the service-providing organization, end users, and third parties. Our approach incorporates the technical complexity required to induce erroneous behaviors in the chatbot--ranging from non-induced failures to advanced prompt-injection attacks--as well as contextual factors such as the target industry, user age range, and vulnerability severity. To validate our metric, we leverage Garak, an open-source framework for LLM vulnerability testing. We further enhance Garak to capture a variety of threat vectors (e.g., misinformation, code hallucinations, social engineering, and malicious code generation). Our methodology is demonstrated in a scenario involving chatbots that employ retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), showing how the aggregated risk scores guide both short-term mitigation and longer-term improvements in model design and deployment. The results underscore the importance of multi-dimensional risk assessments in operationalizing secure, reliable AI-driven conversational systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuai Gong, Tiange Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: The Tang (618 to 907) and Song (960 to 1279) dynasties witnessed an extraordinary flourishing of Chinese cultural expression, where floral motifs served as a dynamic medium for both poetic sentiment and artistic design. While previous scholarship has examined these domains independently, the systematic correlation between evolving literary emotions and visual culture remains underexplored. This study addresses that gap by employing BERT-based sentiment analysis to quantify emotional patterns in floral imagery across Tang Song poetry, then validating these patterns against contemporaneous developments in decorative arts.Our approach builds upon recent advances in computational humanities while remaining grounded in traditional sinological methods. By applying a fine tuned BERT model to analyze peony and plum blossom imagery in classical poetry, we detect measurable shifts in emotional connotations between the Tang and Song periods. These textual patterns are then cross berenced with visual evidence from textiles, ceramics, and other material culture, revealing previously unrecognized synergies between literary expression and artistic representation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sriram Mandalika, Harsha Vardhan, Athira Nambiar</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual Learning entails progressively acquiring knowledge from new data while retaining previously acquired knowledge, thereby mitigating ``Catastrophic Forgetting'' in neural networks. Our work presents a novel uncertainty-driven Unsupervised Continual Learning framework using Generative Replay, namely ``Replay to Remember (R2R)''. The proposed R2R architecture efficiently uses unlabelled and synthetic labelled data in a balanced proportion using a cluster-level uncertainty-driven feedback mechanism and a VLM-powered generative replay module. Unlike traditional memory-buffer methods that depend on pretrained models and pseudo-labels, our R2R framework operates without any prior training. It leverages visual features from unlabeled data and adapts continuously using clustering-based uncertainty estimation coupled with dynamic thresholding. Concurrently, a generative replay mechanism along with DeepSeek-R1 powered CLIP VLM produces labelled synthetic data representative of past experiences, resembling biological visual thinking that replays memory to remember and act in new, unseen tasks. Extensive experimental analyses are carried out in CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CINIC-10, SVHN and TinyImageNet datasets. Our proposed R2R approach improves knowledge retention, achieving a state-of-the-art performance of 98.13%, 73.06%, 93.41%, 95.18%, 59.74%, respectively, surpassing state-of-the-art performance by over 4.36%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jack O'Hagan, Andrew Keane, Andrew Flynn</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial Intelligence has advanced significantly in recent years thanks to innovations in the design and training of artificial neural networks (ANNs). Despite these advancements, we still understand relatively little about how elementary forms of ANNs learn, fail to learn, and generate false information without the intent to deceive, a phenomenon known as `confabulation'. To provide some foundational insight, in this paper we analyse how confabulation occurs in reservoir computers (RCs): a dynamical system in the form of an ANN. RCs are particularly useful to study as they are known to confabulate in a well-defined way: when RCs are trained to reconstruct the dynamics of a given attractor, they sometimes construct an attractor that they were not trained to construct, a so-called `untrained attractor' (UA). This paper sheds light on the role played by UAs when reconstruction fails and their influence when modelling transitions between reconstructed attractors. Based on our results, we conclude that UAs are an intrinsic feature of learning systems whose state spaces are bounded, and that this means of confabulation may be present in systems beyond RCs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Sparse observations and coarse-resolution climate models limit effective regional decision-making, underscoring the need for robust downscaling. However, existing AI methods struggle with generalization across variables and geographies and are constrained by the quadratic complexity of Vision Transformer (ViT) self-attention. We introduce ORBIT-2, a scalable foundation model for global, hyper-resolution climate downscaling. ORBIT-2 incorporates two key innovations: (1) Residual Slim ViT (Reslim), a lightweight architecture with residual learning and Bayesian regularization for efficient, robust prediction; and (2) TILES, a tile-wise sequence scaling algorithm that reduces self-attention complexity from quadratic to linear, enabling long-sequence processing and massive parallelism. ORBIT-2 scales to 10 billion parameters across 32,768 GPUs, achieving up to 1.8 ExaFLOPS sustained throughput and 92-98% strong scaling efficiency. It supports downscaling to 0.9 km global resolution and processes sequences up to 4.2 billion tokens. On 7 km resolution benchmarks, ORBIT-2 achieves high accuracy with R^2 scores in the range of 0.98 to 0.99 against observation data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vahan Martirosyan, Jhony H. Giraldo, Fragkiskos D. Malliaros</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved significant success across various domains by leveraging graph structures in data. Existing spectral GNNs, which use low-degree polynomial filters to capture graph spectral properties, may not fully identify the graph's spectral characteristics because of the polynomial's small degree. However, increasing the polynomial degree is computationally expensive and beyond certain thresholds leads to performance plateaus or degradation. In this paper, we introduce the Piecewise Constant Spectral Graph Neural Network(PieCoN) to address these challenges. PieCoN combines constant spectral filters with polynomial filters to provide a more flexible way to leverage the graph structure. By adaptively partitioning the spectrum into intervals, our approach increases the range of spectral properties that can be effectively learned. Experiments on nine benchmark datasets, including both homophilic and heterophilic graphs, demonstrate that PieCoN is particularly effective on heterophilic datasets, highlighting its potential for a wide range of applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nishikanta Mohanty, Bikash K. Behera, Badsah Mukherjee, Christopher Ferrie</p>
<p>Abstract: Data imputation is a critical step in data pre-processing, particularly for datasets with missing or unreliable values. This study introduces a novel quantum-inspired imputation framework evaluated on the UCI Diabetes dataset, which contains biologically implausible missing values across several clinical features. The method integrates Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with quantum-assisted rotations, optimized through gradient-free classical optimizers -COBYLA, Simulated Annealing, and Differential Evolution to reconstruct missing values while preserving statistical fidelity. Reconstructed values are constrained within +/-2 standard deviations of original feature distributions, avoiding unrealistic clustering around central tendencies. This approach achieves a substantial and statistically significant improvement, including an average reduction of over 85% in Wasserstein distance and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test p-values between 0.18 and 0.22, compared to p-values > 0.99 in classical methods such as Mean, KNN, and MICE. The method also eliminates zero-value artifacts and enhances the realism and variability of imputed data. By combining quantum-inspired transformations with a scalable classical framework, this methodology provides a robust solution for imputation tasks in domains such as healthcare and AI pipelines, where data quality and integrity are crucial.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kusha Sareen, Morgane M Moss, Alessandro Sordoni, Rishabh Agarwal, Arian Hosseini</p>
<p>Abstract: Prevalent reinforcement learning~(RL) methods for fine-tuning LLM reasoners, such as GRPO or Leave-one-out PPO, abandon the learned value function in favor of empirically estimated returns. This hinders test-time compute scaling that relies on using the value-function for verification. In this work, we propose RL$^V$ that augments any ``value-free'' RL method by jointly training the LLM as both a reasoner and a generative verifier using RL-generated data, adding verification capabilities without significant overhead. Empirically, RL$^V$ boosts MATH accuracy by over 20\% with parallel sampling and enables $8-32\times$ efficient test-time compute scaling compared to the base RL method. RL$^V$ also exhibits strong generalization capabilities for both easy-to-hard and out-of-domain tasks. Furthermore, RL$^V$ achieves $1.2-1.6\times$ higher performance when jointly scaling parallel and sequential test-time compute with a long reasoning R1 model.</p>

<p>Abstract: Hallucinations remain a persistent challenge for LLMs. RAG aims to reduce hallucinations by grounding responses in contexts. However, even when provided context, LLMs still frequently introduce unsupported information or contradictions. This paper presents our efforts to measure LLM hallucinations with a focus on summarization tasks, assessing how often various LLMs introduce hallucinations when summarizing documents. We discuss Vectara's existing LLM hallucination leaderboard, based on the Hughes Hallucination Evaluation Model (HHEM). While HHEM and Vectara's Hallucination Leaderboard have garnered great research interest, we examine challenges faced by HHEM and current hallucination detection methods by analyzing the effectiveness of these methods on existing hallucination datasets. To address these limitations, we propose FaithJudge, an LLM-as-a-judge approach guided by few-shot human hallucination annotations, which substantially improves automated LLM hallucination evaluation over current methods. We introduce an enhanced hallucination leaderboard centered on FaithJudge, alongside our current hallucination leaderboard, enabling more reliable benchmarking of LLMs for hallucinations in RAG.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifei Gao, Chengpeng Wang, Pengxiang Huang, Xuwei Liu, Mingwei Zheng, Xiangyu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: There has been a growing interest in translating C code to Rust due to Rust's robust memory and thread safety guarantees. Tools such as C2RUST enable syntax-guided transpilation from C to semantically equivalent Rust code. However, the resulting Rust programs often rely heavily on unsafe constructs--particularly raw pointers--which undermines Rust's safety guarantees. This paper aims to improve the memory safety of Rust programs generated by C2RUST by eliminating raw pointers. Specifically, we propose a peephole raw pointer rewriting technique that lifts raw pointers in individual functions to appropriate Rust data structures. Technically, PR2 employs decision-tree-based prompting to guide the pointer lifting process. Additionally, it leverages code change analysis to guide the repair of errors introduced during rewriting, effectively addressing errors encountered during compilation and test case execution. We implement PR2 as a prototype and evaluate it using gpt-4o-mini on 28 real-world C projects. The results show that PR2 successfully eliminates 13.22% of local raw pointers across these projects, significantly enhancing the safety of the translated Rust code. On average, PR2 completes the transformation of a project in 5.44 hours, at an average cost of $1.46.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> I-Chun Arthur Liu, Jason Chen, Gaurav Sukhatme, Daniel Seita</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning bimanual manipulation is challenging due to its high dimensionality and tight coordination required between two arms. Eye-in-hand imitation learning, which uses wrist-mounted cameras, simplifies perception by focusing on task-relevant views. However, collecting diverse demonstrations remains costly, motivating the need for scalable data augmentation. While prior work has explored visual augmentation in single-arm settings, extending these approaches to bimanual manipulation requires generating viewpoint-consistent observations across both arms and producing corresponding action labels that are both valid and feasible. In this work, we propose Diffusion for COordinated Dual-arm Data Augmentation (D-CODA), a method for offline data augmentation tailored to eye-in-hand bimanual imitation learning that trains a diffusion model to synthesize novel, viewpoint-consistent wrist-camera images for both arms while simultaneously generating joint-space action labels. It employs constrained optimization to ensure that augmented states involving gripper-to-object contacts adhere to constraints suitable for bimanual coordination. We evaluate D-CODA on 5 simulated and 3 real-world tasks. Our results across 2250 simulation trials and 300 real-world trials demonstrate that it outperforms baselines and ablations, showing its potential for scalable data augmentation in eye-in-hand bimanual manipulation.

<p>Abstract: Existing methods for image alignment struggle in cases involving feature-sparse regions, extreme scale and field-of-view differences, and large deformations, often resulting in suboptimal accuracy. Robustness to these challenges improves through iterative refinement of the transformation field while focusing on critical regions in multi-scale image representations. We thus propose Auto-Regressive Transformation (ART), a novel method that iteratively estimates the coarse-to-fine transformations within an auto-regressive framework. Leveraging hierarchical multi-scale features, our network refines the transformations using randomly sampled points at each scale. By incorporating guidance from the cross-attention layer, the model focuses on critical regions, ensuring accurate alignment even in challenging, feature-limited conditions. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate that ART significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, establishing it as a powerful new method for precise image alignment with broad applicability.</p>

<p>Abstract: The integration of machine learning (ML) in cyber physical systems (CPS) is a complex task due to the challenges that arise in terms of real-time decision making, safety, reliability, device heterogeneity, and data privacy. There are also open research questions that must be addressed in order to fully realize the potential of ML in CPS. Federated learning (FL), a distributed approach to ML, has become increasingly popular in recent years. It allows models to be trained using data from decentralized sources. This approach has been gaining popularity in the CPS field, as it integrates computer, communication, and physical processes. Therefore, the purpose of this work is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the most recent developments of FL-CPS, including the numerous application areas, system topologies, and algorithms developed in recent years. The paper starts by discussing recent advances in both FL and CPS, followed by their integration. Then, the paper compares the application of FL in CPS with its applications in the internet of things (IoT) in further depth to show their connections and distinctions. Furthermore, the article scrutinizes how FL is utilized in critical CPS applications, e.g., intelligent transportation systems, cybersecurity services, smart cities, and smart healthcare solutions. The study also includes critical insights and lessons learned from various FL-CPS implementations. The paper's concluding section delves into significant concerns and suggests avenues for further research in this fast-paced and dynamic era.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lianbo Ma, Jianlun Ma, Yuee Zhou, Guoyang Xie, Qiang He, Zhichao Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Mixed Precision Quantization (MPQ) has become an essential technique for optimizing neural network by determining the optimal bitwidth per layer. Existing MPQ methods, however, face a major hurdle: they require a computationally expensive search for quantization policies on large-scale datasets. To resolve this issue, we introduce a novel approach that first searches for quantization policies on small datasets and then generalizes them to large-scale datasets. This approach simplifies the process, eliminating the need for large-scale quantization fine-tuning and only necessitating model weight adjustment. Our method is characterized by three key techniques: sharpness-aware minimization for enhanced quantization generalization, implicit gradient direction alignment to handle gradient conflicts among different optimization objectives, and an adaptive perturbation radius to accelerate optimization. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results validate our approach. Using the CIFAR10 dataset (just 0.5\% the size of ImageNet training data) for MPQ policy search, we achieved equivalent accuracy on ImageNet with a significantly lower computational cost, while improving efficiency by up to 150% over the baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: Quantum computing offers theoretical advantages over classical computing for specific tasks, yet the boundary of practical quantum advantage remains an open question. To investigate this boundary, it is crucial to understand whether, and how, classical machines can learn and simulate quantum algorithms. Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated strong reasoning abilities, prompting exploration into their potential for this challenge. In this work, we introduce GroverGPT-2, an LLM-based method for simulating Grover's algorithm using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and quantum-native tokenization. Building on its predecessor, GroverGPT-2 performs simulation directly from quantum circuit representations while producing logically structured and interpretable outputs. Our results show that GroverGPT-2 can learn and internalize quantum circuit logic through efficient processing of quantum-native tokens, providing direct evidence that classical models like LLMs can capture the structure of quantum algorithms. Furthermore, GroverGPT-2 outputs interleave circuit data with natural language, embedding explicit reasoning into the simulation. This dual capability positions GroverGPT-2 as a prototype for advancing machine understanding of quantum algorithms and modeling quantum circuit logic. We also identify an empirical scaling law for GroverGPT-2 with increasing qubit numbers, suggesting a path toward scalable classical simulation. These findings open new directions for exploring the limits of classical simulatability, enhancing quantum education and research, and laying groundwork for future foundation models in quantum computing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziqing Qiao, Yongheng Deng, Jiali Zeng, Dong Wang, Lai Wei, Fandong Meng, Jie Zhou, Ju Ren, Yaoxue Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) perform strongly in complex reasoning tasks via Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, but often suffer from verbose outputs caused by redundant content, increasing computational overhead, and degrading user experience. Existing compression methods either operate post-hoc pruning, risking disruption to reasoning coherence, or rely on sampling-based selection, which fails to intervene effectively during generation. In this work, we introduce a confidence-guided perspective to explain the emergence of redundant reflection in LRMs, identifying two key patterns: Confidence Deficit, where the model reconsiders correct steps due to low internal confidence, and Termination Delay, where reasoning continues even after reaching a confident answer. Based on this analysis, we propose ConCISE (Confidence-guided Compression In Step-by-step Efficient Reasoning), a framework that simplifies reasoning chains by reinforcing the model's confidence during inference, thus preventing the generation of redundant reflection steps. It integrates Confidence Injection to stabilize intermediate steps and Early Stopping to terminate reasoning when confidence is sufficient. Extensive experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning LRMs on ConCISE-generated data yields significantly shorter outputs, reducing length by up to approximately 50% under SimPO, while maintaining high task accuracy. ConCISE consistently outperforms existing baselines across multiple reasoning benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingruo Yuan, Ben Kao, Tien-Hsuan Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval of legal knowledge by the general public is a challenging problem due to the technicality of the professional knowledge and the lack of fundamental understanding by laypersons on the subject. Traditional information retrieval techniques assume that users are capable of formulating succinct and precise queries for effective document retrieval. In practice, however, the wide gap between the highly technical contents and untrained users makes legal knowledge retrieval very difficult. We propose a methodology, called QBR, which employs a Questions Bank (QB) as an effective medium for bridging the knowledge gap. We show how the QB is used to derive training samples to enhance the embedding of knowledge units within documents, which leads to effective fine-grained knowledge retrieval. We discuss and evaluate through experiments various advantages of QBR over traditional methods. These include more accurate, efficient, and explainable document retrieval, better comprehension of retrieval results, and highly effective fine-grained knowledge retrieval. We also present some case studies and show that QBR achieves social impact by assisting citizens to resolve everyday legal concerns.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tharindu Fernando, Clinton Fookes, Sridha Sridharan, Simon Denman</p>
<p>Abstract: Remarkable advancements in generative AI technology have given rise to a spectrum of novel deepfake categories with unprecedented leaps in their realism, and deepfakes are increasingly becoming a nuisance to law enforcement authorities and the general public. In particular, we observe alarming levels of confusion, deception, and loss of faith regarding multimedia content within society caused by face deepfakes, and existing deepfake detectors are struggling to keep up with the pace of improvements in deepfake generation. This is primarily due to their reliance on specific forgery artifacts, which limits their ability to generalise and detect novel deepfake types. To combat the spread of malicious face deepfakes, this paper proposes a new strategy that leverages coarse-to-fine spatial information, semantic information, and their interactions while ensuring feature distinctiveness and reducing the redundancy of the modelled features. A novel feature orthogonality-based disentanglement strategy is introduced to ensure branch-level and cross-branch feature disentanglement, which allows us to integrate multiple feature vectors without adding complexity to the feature space or compromising generalisation. Comprehensive experiments on three public benchmarks: FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF, and the Deepfake Detection Challenge (DFDC) show that these design choices enable the proposed approach to outperform current state-of-the-art methods by 5% on the Celeb-DF dataset and 7% on the DFDC dataset in a cross-dataset evaluation setting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cong Qi, Yeqing Chen, Jie Zhang, Wei Zhi</p>
<p>Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revealed complex cellular heterogeneity, but recent studies emphasize that understanding biological function also requires modeling cell-cell communication (CCC), the signaling interactions mediated by ligand-receptor pairs that coordinate cellular behavior. Tools like CellChat have demonstrated that CCC plays a critical role in processes such as cell differentiation, tissue regeneration, and immune response, and that transcriptomic data inherently encodes rich information about intercellular signaling. We propose CCCVAE, a novel variational autoencoder framework that incorporates CCC signals into single-cell representation learning. By leveraging a communication-aware kernel derived from ligand-receptor interactions and a sparse Gaussian process, CCCVAE encodes biologically informed priors into the latent space. Unlike conventional VAEs that treat each cell independently, CCCVAE encourages latent embeddings to reflect both transcriptional similarity and intercellular signaling context. Empirical results across four scRNA-seq datasets show that CCCVAE improves clustering performance, achieving higher evaluation scores than standard VAE baselines. This work demonstrates the value of embedding biological priors into deep generative models for unsupervised single-cell analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiyang Han, Masaaki Imaizumi</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we provide the first precise distributional characterization of gradient descent iterates for general multi-layer neural networks under the canonical single-index regression model, in the `finite-width proportional regime' where the sample size and feature dimension grow proportionally while the network width and depth remain bounded. Our non-asymptotic state evolution theory captures Gaussian fluctuations in first-layer weights and concentration in deeper-layer weights, and remains valid for non-Gaussian features.
  Our theory differs from existing neural tangent kernel (NTK), mean-field (MF) theories and tensor program (TP) in several key aspects. First, our theory operates in the finite-width regime whereas these existing theories are fundamentally infinite-width. Second, our theory allows weights to evolve from individual initializations beyond the lazy training regime, whereas NTK and MF are either frozen at or only weakly sensitive to initialization, and TP relies on special initialization schemes. Third, our theory characterizes both training and generalization errors for general multi-layer neural networks beyond the uniform convergence regime, whereas existing theories study generalization almost exclusively in two-layer settings.
  As a statistical application, we show that vanilla gradient descent can be augmented to yield consistent estimates of the generalization error at each iteration, which can be used to guide early stopping and hyperparameter tuning. As a further theoretical implication, we show that despite model misspecification, the model learned by gradient descent retains the structure of a single-index function with an effective signal determined by a linear combination of the true signal and the initialization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shun Taguchi, Hideki Deguchi, Takumi Hamazaki, Hiroyuki Sakai</p>
<p>Abstract: This study introduces SpatialPrompting, a novel framework that harnesses the emergent reasoning capabilities of off-the-shelf multimodal large language models to achieve zero-shot spatial reasoning in three-dimensional (3D) environments. Unlike existing methods that rely on expensive 3D-specific fine-tuning with specialized 3D inputs such as point clouds or voxel-based features, SpatialPrompting employs a keyframe-driven prompt generation strategy. This framework uses metrics such as vision-language similarity, Mahalanobis distance, field of view, and image sharpness to select a diverse and informative set of keyframes from image sequences and then integrates them with corresponding camera pose data to effectively abstract spatial relationships and infer complex 3D structures. The proposed framework not only establishes a new paradigm for flexible spatial reasoning that utilizes intuitive visual and positional cues but also achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on benchmark datasets, such as ScanQA and SQA3D, across several metrics. The proposed method effectively eliminates the need for specialized 3D inputs and fine-tuning, offering a simpler and more scalable alternative to conventional approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ramteja Sajja, Yusuf Sermet, Ibrahim Demir</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in AI have catalyzed the adoption of intelligent educational tools, yet many semantic retrieval systems remain ill-suited to the unique linguistic and structural characteristics of academic content. This study presents two open-source embedding models fine-tuned for educational question answering, particularly in the context of course syllabi. A synthetic dataset of 3,197 sentence pairs, spanning synonymous terminology, paraphrased questions, and implicit-explicit mappings, was constructed through a combination of manual curation and large language model (LLM)-assisted generation. Two training strategies were evaluated: (1) a baseline model fine-tuned using MultipleNegativesRankingLoss (MNRL), and (2) a dual-loss model that combines MNRL with CosineSimilarityLoss to improve both semantic ranking and similarity calibration. Evaluations were conducted on 28 university course syllabi using a fixed set of natural language questions categorized into course, faculty, and teaching assistant information. Results demonstrate that both fine-tuned models outperform strong open-source baselines, including all-MiniLM-L6-v2 and multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1, and that the dual-loss model narrows the performance gap with high-performing proprietary embeddings such as OpenAI's text-embedding-3 series. This work contributes reusable, domain-aligned embedding models and provides a replicable framework for educational semantic retrieval, supporting downstream applications such as academic chatbots, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, and learning management system (LMS) integrations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaqi Zheng, Qing Ling, Yerong Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: Although deep learning models have demonstrated remarkable potential in weather prediction, most of them overlook either the \textbf{physics} of the underlying weather evolution or the \textbf{topology} of the Earth's surface. In light of these disadvantages, we develop PASSAT, a novel Physics-ASSisted And Topology-informed deep learning model for weather prediction. PASSAT attributes the weather evolution to two key factors: (i) the advection process that can be characterized by the advection equation and the Navier-Stokes equation; (ii) the Earth-atmosphere interaction that is difficult to both model and calculate. PASSAT also takes the topology of the Earth's surface into consideration, other than simply treating it as a plane. With these considerations, PASSAT numerically solves the advection equation and the Navier-Stokes equation on the spherical manifold, utilizes a spherical graph neural network to capture the Earth-atmosphere interaction, and generates the initial velocity fields that are critical to solving the advection equation from the same spherical graph neural network. In the $5.625^\circ$-resolution ERA5 data set, PASSAT outperforms both the state-of-the-art deep learning-based weather prediction models and the operational numerical weather prediction model IFS T42.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yonghong Li, Xiuzhuang Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Trustworthy depression prediction based on deep learning, incorporating both predictive reliability and algorithmic fairness across diverse demographic groups, is crucial for clinical application. Recently, achieving reliable depression predictions through uncertainty quantification has attracted increasing attention. However, few studies have focused on the fairness of uncertainty quantification (UQ) in depression prediction. In this work, we investigate the algorithmic fairness of UQ, namely Equal Opportunity Coverage (EOC) fairness, and propose Fair Uncertainty Quantification (FUQ) for depression prediction. FUQ pursues reliable and fair depression predictions through group-based analysis. Specifically, we first group all the participants by different sensitive attributes and leverage conformal prediction to quantify uncertainty within each demographic group, which provides a theoretically guaranteed and valid way to quantify uncertainty for depression prediction and facilitates the investigation of fairness across different demographic groups. Furthermore, we propose a fairness-aware optimization strategy that formulates fairness as a constrained optimization problem under EOC constraints. This enables the model to preserve predictive reliability while adapting to the heterogeneous uncertainty levels across demographic groups, thereby achieving optimal fairness. Through extensive evaluations on several visual and audio depression datasets, our approach demonstrates its effectiveness.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04939">Structural Alignment in Link Prediction</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeffrey Seathr\'un Sardina</p>
<p>Abstract: While Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have become increasingly popular across various scientific disciplines for their ability to model and interlink huge quantities of data, essentially all real-world KGs are known to be incomplete. As such, with the growth of KG use has been a concurrent development of machine learning tools designed to predict missing information in KGs, which is referred to as the Link Prediction Task. The majority of state-of-the-art link predictors to date have followed an embedding-based paradigm. In this paradigm, it is assumed that the information content of a KG is best represented by the (individual) vector representations of its nodes and edges, and that therefore node and edge embeddings are particularly well-suited to performing link prediction.
  This thesis proposes an alternative perspective on the field's approach to link prediction and KG data modelling. Specifically, this work re-analyses KGs and state-of-the-art link predictors from a graph-structure-first perspective that models the information content of a KG in terms of whole triples, rather than individual nodes and edges.
  Following a literature review and two core sets of experiments, this thesis concludes that a structure-first perspective on KGs and link prediction is both viable and useful for understanding KG learning and for enabling cross-KG transfer learning for the link prediction task. This observation is used to create and propose the Structural Alignment Hypothesis, which postulates that link prediction can be understood and modelled as a structural task.

An Irish-language translation dictionary of machine learning terms (the Focl\'oir Tr\'achtais) created for this work is open-sourced as well.</p>

<p>Abstract: Thanks to recent advancements in scalable deep architectures and large-scale pretraining, text-to-video generation has achieved unprecedented capabilities in producing high-fidelity, instruction-following content across a wide range of styles, enabling applications in advertising, entertainment, and education. However, these models' ability to render precise on-screen text, such as captions or mathematical formulas, remains largely untested, posing significant challenges for applications requiring exact textual accuracy. In this work, we introduce T2VTextBench, the first human-evaluation benchmark dedicated to evaluating on-screen text fidelity and temporal consistency in text-to-video models. Our suite of prompts integrates complex text strings with dynamic scene changes, testing each model's ability to maintain detailed instructions across frames. We evaluate ten state-of-the-art systems, ranging from open-source solutions to commercial offerings, and find that most struggle to generate legible, consistent text. These results highlight a critical gap in current video generators and provide a clear direction for future research aimed at enhancing textual manipulation in video synthesis.</p>

<p>Abstract: Chain-of-thoughts (CoT) requires large language models (LLMs) to generate intermediate steps before reaching the final answer, and has been proven effective to help LLMs solve complex reasoning tasks. However, the inner mechanism of CoT still remains largely unclear. In this paper, we empirically study the role of CoT tokens in LLMs on two compositional tasks: multi-digit multiplication and dynamic programming. While CoT is essential for solving these problems, we find that preserving only tokens that store intermediate results would achieve comparable performance. Furthermore, we observe that storing intermediate results in an alternative latent form will not affect model performance. We also randomly intervene some values in CoT, and notice that subsequent CoT tokens and the final answer would change correspondingly. These findings suggest that CoT tokens may function like variables in computer programs but with potential drawbacks like unintended shortcuts and computational complexity limits between tokens.

<p>Abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs), widely recognized for their potential to generate high-quality samples, tend to go unnoticed in representation learning. While recent progress has highlighted their potential for capturing visual semantics, adapting DPMs to graph representation learning remains in its infancy. In this paper, we introduce Graffe, a self-supervised diffusion model proposed for graph representation learning. It features a graph encoder that distills a source graph into a compact representation, which, in turn, serves as the condition to guide the denoising process of the diffusion decoder. To evaluate the effectiveness of our model, we first explore the theoretical foundations of applying diffusion models to representation learning, proving that the denoising objective implicitly maximizes the conditional mutual information between data and its representation. Specifically, we prove that the negative logarithm of the denoising score matching loss is a tractable lower bound for the conditional mutual information. Empirically, we conduct a series of case studies to validate our theoretical insights. In addition, Graffe delivers competitive results under the linear probing setting on node and graph classification tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on 9 of the 11 real-world datasets. These findings indicate that powerful generative models, especially diffusion models, serve as an effective tool for graph representation learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyu Zhang, Sergey Bashkirov, Dun Yang, Michael Taylor, Xue Bin Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-objective optimization problems, which require the simultaneous optimization of multiple terms, are prevalent across numerous applications. Existing multi-objective optimization methods often rely on manually tuned aggregation functions to formulate a joint optimization target. The performance of such hand-tuned methods is heavily dependent on careful weight selection, a time-consuming and laborious process. These limitations also arise in the setting of reinforcement-learning-based motion tracking for physically simulated characters, where intricately crafted reward functions are typically used to achieve high-fidelity results. Such solutions not only require domain expertise and significant manual adjustment, but also limit the applicability of the resulting reward function across diverse skills. To bridge this gap, we present a novel adversarial multi-objective optimization technique that is broadly applicable to a range of multi-objective optimization problems, including motion tracking. The proposed adversarial differential discriminator receives a single positive sample, yet is still effective at guiding the optimization process. We demonstrate that our technique can enable characters to closely replicate a variety of acrobatic and agile behaviors, achieving comparable quality to state-of-the-art motion-tracking methods, without relying on manually tuned reward functions.

Additionally, the product moments, including covariance and correlation, reveal the relationships between multiple random variables. On the other hand, the primary focus of causal inference is the evaluation of causal effects, which are defined as the difference between two potential outcomes. While traditional causal effect assessment focuses on the average causal effect, this work provides definitions, identification theorems, and bounds for moments and product moments of causal effects to analyze their distribution and relationships. We conduct experiments to illustrate the estimation of the moments of causal effects from finite samples and demonstrate their practical application using a real-world medical dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract: The miniaturisation of sensors and processors, the advancements in connected edge intelligence, and the exponential interest in Artificial Intelligence are boosting the affirmation of autonomous nano-size drones in the Internet of Robotic Things ecosystem. However, achieving safe autonomous navigation and high-level tasks such as exploration and surveillance with these tiny platforms is extremely challenging due to their limited resources. This work focuses on enabling the safe and autonomous flight of a pocket-size, 30-gram platform called Crazyflie 2.1 in a partially known environment. We propose a novel AI-aided, vision-based reactive planning method for obstacle avoidance under the ambit of Integrated Sensing, Computing and Communication paradigm. We deal with the constraints of the nano-drone by splitting the navigation task into two parts: a deep learning-based object detector runs on the edge (external hardware) while the planning algorithm is executed onboard. The results show the ability to command the drone at $\sim8$ frames-per-second and a model performance reaching a COCO mean-average-precision of $60.8$. Field experiments demonstrate the feasibility of the solution with the drone flying at a top speed of $1$ m/s while steering away from an obstacle placed in an unknown position and reaching the target destination. The outcome highlights the compatibility of the communication delay and the model performance with the requirements of the real-time navigation task. We provide a feasible alternative to a fully onboard implementation that can be extended to autonomous exploration with nano-drones.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Brian Choi, Shu Wang, Isabelle Choi, Kun Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: With the widespread deployment of deep neural network (DNN) models, dynamic watermarking techniques are being used to protect the intellectual property of model owners. However, recent studies have shown that existing watermarking schemes are vulnerable to watermark removal and ambiguity attacks. Besides, the vague criteria for determining watermark presence further increase the likelihood of such attacks. In this paper, we propose a secure DNN watermarking scheme named ChainMarks, which generates secure and robust watermarks by introducing a cryptographic chain into the trigger inputs and utilizes a two-phase Monte Carlo method for determining watermark presence. First, ChainMarks generates trigger inputs as a watermark dataset by repeatedly applying a hash function over a secret key, where the target labels associated with trigger inputs are generated from the digital signature of model owner. Then, the watermarked model is produced by training a DNN over both the original and watermark datasets. To verify watermarks, we compare the predicted labels of trigger inputs with the target labels and determine ownership with a more accurate decision threshold that considers the classification probability of specific models. Experimental results show that ChainMarks exhibits higher levels of robustness and security compared to state-of-the-art watermarking schemes. With a better marginal utility, ChainMarks provides a higher probability guarantee of watermark presence in DNN models with the same level of watermark accuracy.</p>

In this study, we investigate the path-specific probability of necessity and sufficiency (PNS) to decompose the total PNS into path-specific components along distinct causal pathways between treatment and outcome, incorporating two mediators. We define the path-specific PNS for decomposition and provide an identification theorem.

To address this issue, recent studies have introduced several variant algorithms of ICL that achieve permutation invariance. However, many of these do not exhibit comparable performance with the standard auto-regressive ICL algorithm. In this work, we identify two crucial elements in the design of an invariant ICL algorithm: information non-leakage and context interdependence, which are not simultaneously achieved by any of the existing methods. These investigations lead us to the proposed Invariant ICL (InvICL), a methodology designed to achieve invariance in ICL while ensuring the two properties. Empirically, our findings reveal that InvICL surpasses previous models, both invariant and non-invariant, in most benchmark datasets, showcasing superior generalization capabilities across varying input lengths.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lang Nie, Chunyu Lin, Kang Liao, Yun Zhang, Shuaicheng Liu, Yao Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: We retarget video stitching to an emerging issue, named warping shake, which unveils the temporal content shakes induced by sequentially unsmooth warps when extending image stitching to video stitching. Even if the input videos are stable, the stitched video can inevitably cause undesired warping shakes and affect the visual experience. To address this issue, we propose StabStitch++, a novel video stitching framework to realize spatial stitching and temporal stabilization with unsupervised learning simultaneously. First, different from existing learning-based image stitching solutions that typically warp one image to align with another, we suppose a virtual midplane between original image planes and project them onto it. Concretely, we design a differentiable bidirectional decomposition module to disentangle the homography transformation and incorporate it into our spatial warp, evenly spreading alignment burdens and projective distortions across two views. Then, inspired by camera paths in video stabilization, we derive the mathematical expression of stitching trajectories in video stitching by elaborately integrating spatial and temporal warps. Finally, a warp smoothing model is presented to produce stable stitched videos with a hybrid loss to simultaneously encourage content alignment, trajectory smoothness, and online collaboration. Compared with StabStitch that sacrifices alignment for stabilization, StabStitch++ makes no compromise and optimizes both of them simultaneously, especially in the online mode. To establish an evaluation benchmark and train the learning framework, we build a video stitching dataset with a rich diversity in camera motions and scenes. Experiments exhibit that StabStitch++ surpasses current solutions in stitching performance, robustness, and efficiency, offering compelling advancements in this field by building a real-time online video stitching system.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Roberto Dillon,  Arushi</p>
<p>Abstract: Continuous authentication systems leveraging free-text keyboard dynamics offer a promising additional layer of security in a multifactor authentication setup that can be used in a transparent way with no impact on user experience. This study investigates the efficacy of behavioral biometrics by employing an Agent-Based Model (ABM) to simulate diverse typing profiles across mechanical and membrane keyboards. Specifically, we generated synthetic keystroke data from five unique agents, capturing features related to dwell time, flight time, and error rates within sliding 5-second windows updated every second. Two machine learning approaches, One-Class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM) and Random Forest (RF), were evaluated for user verification. Results revealed a stark contrast in performance: while One-Class SVM failed to differentiate individual users within each group, Random Forest achieved robust intra-keyboard user recognition (Accuracy > 0.7) but struggled to generalize across keyboards for the same user, highlighting the significant impact of keyboard hardware on typing behavior. These findings suggest that: (1) keyboard-specific user profiles may be necessary for reliable authentication, and (2) ensemble methods like RF outperform One-Class SVM in capturing fine-grained user-specific patterns.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Waldemar Hahn, Jan-Niklas Eckardt, Christoph R\"ollig, Martin Sedlmayr, Jan Moritz Middeke, Markus Wolfien</p>
<p>Abstract: The generation of synthetic clinical trial data offers a promising approach to mitigating privacy concerns and data accessibility limitations in medical research. However, ensuring that synthetic datasets maintain high fidelity, utility, and adherence to domain-specific constraints remains a key challenge. While hyperparameter optimization (HPO) has been shown to improve generative model performance, the effectiveness of different optimization strategies for synthetic clinical data remains unclear. This study systematically evaluates four HPO strategies across eight generative models, comparing single-metric optimization against compound metric optimization approaches. Our results demonstrate that HPO consistently improves synthetic data quality, with TVAE, CTGAN, and CTAB-GAN+ achieving improvements of up to 60%, 39%, and 38%, respectively. Compound metric optimization outperformed single-metric strategies, producing more balanced and generalizable synthetic datasets. Interestingly, HPO alone is insufficient to ensure clinically valid synthetic data, as all models exhibited violations of fundamental survival constraints. Preprocessing and postprocessing played a crucial role in reducing these violations, as models lacking robust processing steps produced invalid data in up to 61% of cases. These findings underscore the necessity of integrating explicit domain knowledge alongside HPO to create high quality synthetic datasets. Our study provides actionable recommendations for improving synthetic data generation, with future research needed to refine metric selection and validate these findings on larger datasets to enhance clinical applicability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Navya Sonal Agarwal, Jan Philipp Schneider, Kanchana Vaishnavi Gandikota, Syed Muhammad Kazim, John Meshreki, Ivo Ihrke, Michael Moeller</p>
<p>Abstract: The computational imaging technique of Fourier Ptychographic Microscopy (FPM) enables high-resolution imaging with a wide field of view and can serve as an extremely valuable tool, e.g. in the classification of cells in medical applications. However, reconstructing a high-resolution image from tens or even hundreds of measurements is computationally expensive, particularly for a wide field of view. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the idea of classifying the image content in the FPM measurements directly without performing a reconstruction step first. We show that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) can extract meaningful information from measurement sequences, significantly outperforming the classification on a single band-limited image (up to 12 %) while being significantly more efficient than a reconstruction of a high-resolution image. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a learned multiplexing of several raw measurements allows maintaining the classification accuracy while reducing the amount of data (and consequently also the acquisition time) significantly.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chunyu Xie, Bin Wang, Fanjing Kong, Jincheng Li, Dawei Liang, Gengshen Zhang, Dawei Leng, Yuhui Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) excels in multimodal tasks such as image-text retrieval and zero-shot classification but struggles with fine-grained understanding due to its focus on coarse-grained short captions. To address this, we propose Fine-Grained CLIP (FG-CLIP), which enhances fine-grained understanding through three key innovations. First, we leverage large multimodal models to generate 1.6 billion long caption-image pairs for capturing global-level semantic details. Second, a high-quality dataset is constructed with 12 million images and 40 million region-specific bounding boxes aligned with detailed captions to ensure precise, context-rich representations. Third, 10 million hard fine-grained negative samples are incorporated to improve the model's ability to distinguish subtle semantic differences. Corresponding training methods are meticulously designed for these data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FG-CLIP outperforms the original CLIP and other state-of-the-art methods across various downstream tasks, including fine-grained understanding, open-vocabulary object detection, image-text retrieval, and general multimodal benchmarks. These results highlight FG-CLIP's effectiveness in capturing fine-grained image details and improving overall model performance.

<p>Abstract: On-device learning has emerged as a promising direction for AI development, particularly because of its potential to reduce latency issues and mitigate privacy risks associated with device-server communication, while improving energy efficiency. Despite these advantages, significant memory and computational constraints still represent major challenges for its deployment. Drawing on previous studies on low-rank decomposition methods that address activation memory bottlenecks in backpropagation, we propose a novel shortcut approach as an alternative. Our analysis and experiments demonstrate that our method can reduce activation memory usage, even up to $120.09\times$ compared to vanilla training, while also reducing overall training FLOPs up to $1.86\times$ when evaluated on traditional benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Steven Jorgensen, Erik Hemberg, Jamal Toutouh, Una-May O'Reilly</p>
<p>Abstract: This study explores a novel approach to neural network pruning using evolutionary computation, focusing on simultaneously pruning the encoder and decoder of an autoencoder. We introduce two new mutation operators that use layer activations to guide weight pruning. Our findings reveal that one of these activation-informed operators outperforms random pruning, resulting in more efficient autoencoders with comparable performance to canonically trained models. Prior work has established that autoencoder training is effective and scalable with a spatial coevolutionary algorithm that cooperatively coevolves a population of encoders with a population of decoders, rather than one autoencoder. We evaluate how the same activity-guided mutation operators transfer to this context. We find that random pruning is better than guided pruning, in the coevolutionary setting. This suggests activation-based guidance proves more effective in low-dimensional pruning environments, where constrained sample spaces can lead to deviations from true uniformity in randomization. Conversely, population-driven strategies enhance robustness by expanding the total pruning dimensionality, achieving statistically uniform randomness that better preserves system dynamics. We experiment with pruning according to different schedules and present best combinations of operator and schedule for the canonical and coevolving populations cases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyan Hu, Kayo Yin, Michael I. Jordan, Jacob Steinhardt, Lijie Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: To perform in-context learning, language models must extract signals from individual few-shot examples, aggregate these into a learned prediction rule, and then apply this rule to new examples. How is this implemented in the forward pass of modern transformer models? To study this, we consider a structured family of few-shot learning tasks for which the true prediction rule is to add an integer $k$ to the input. We find that Llama-3-8B attains high accuracy on this task for a range of $k$, and localize its few-shot ability to just three attention heads via a novel optimization approach. We further show the extracted signals lie in a six-dimensional subspace, where four of the dimensions track the unit digit and the other two dimensions track overall magnitude. We finally examine how these heads extract information from individual few-shot examples, identifying a self-correction mechanism in which mistakes from earlier examples are suppressed by later examples. Our results demonstrate how tracking low-dimensional subspaces across a forward pass can provide insight into fine-grained computational structures.</p>

<p>Abstract: Small and medium sized businesses often struggle with data driven decision making do to a lack of advanced analytics tools, especially in African countries where they make up a majority of the workforce. Though many tools exist they are not designed to fit into the ways of working of SMB workers who are mobile first, have limited time to learn new workflows, and for whom social and business are tightly coupled. To address this, the Dukawalla prototype was created. This intelligent assistant bridges the gap between raw business data, and actionable insights by leveraging voice interaction and the power of generative AI. Dukawalla provides an intuitive way for business owners to interact with their data, aiding in informed decision making. This paper examines Dukawalla's deployment across SMBs in Nairobi, focusing on their experiences using this voice based assistant to streamline data collection and provide business insights</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bojian Yin, Federico Corradi</p>
<p>Abstract: Backpropagation (BP) is the cornerstone of deep learning, but its reliance on global gradient synchronization limits scalability and imposes significant memory overhead. We propose Stochastic Variational Propagation (SVP), a scalable alternative that reframes training as hierarchical variational inference. SVP treats layer activations as latent variables and optimizes local Evidence Lower Bounds (ELBOs), enabling independent, local updates while preserving global coherence. However, directly applying KL divergence in layer-wise ELBOs risks inter-layer's representation collapse due to excessive compression. To prevent this, SVP projects activations into low-dimensional spaces via fixed random matrices, ensuring information preservation and representational diversity. Combined with a feature alignment loss for inter-layer consistency, SVP achieves competitive accuracy with BP across diverse architectures (MLPs, CNNs, Transformers) and datasets (MNIST to ImageNet), reduces memory usage by up to 4x, and significantly improves scalability. More broadly, SVP introduces a probabilistic perspective to deep representation learning, opening pathways toward more modular and interpretable neural network design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Peng, Kang Liu, Jianchen Hu, Meng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Prompt learning is one of the most effective paradigms for adapting pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to the biomedical image classification tasks in few shot scenarios. However, most of the current prompt learning methods only used the text prompts and ignored the particular structures (such as the complex anatomical structures and subtle pathological features) in the biomedical images. In this work, we propose Biomed-DPT, a knowledge-enhanced dual modality prompt tuning technique. In designing the text prompt, Biomed-DPT constructs a dual prompt including the template-driven clinical prompts and the large language model (LLM)-driven domain-adapted prompts, then extracts the clinical knowledge from the domain-adapted prompts through the knowledge distillation technique. In designing the vision prompt, Biomed-DPT introduces the zero vector as a soft prompt to leverage attention re-weighting so that the focus on non-diagnostic regions and the recognition of non-critical pathological features are avoided. Biomed-DPT achieves an average classification accuracy of 66.14\% across 11 biomedical image datasets covering 9 modalities and 10 organs, with performance reaching 78.06\% in base classes and 75.97\% in novel classes, surpassing the Context Optimization (CoOp) method by 6.20\%, 3.78\%, and 8.04\%, respectively.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yixin Cheng, Hongcheng Guo, Yangming Li, Leonid Sigal</p>
<p>Abstract: Text watermarking aims to subtly embed statistical signals into text by controlling the Large Language Model (LLM)'s sampling process, enabling watermark detectors to verify that the output was generated by the specified model. The robustness of these watermarking algorithms has become a key factor in evaluating their effectiveness. Current text watermarking algorithms embed watermarks in high-entropy tokens to ensure text quality. In this paper, we reveal that this seemingly benign design can be exploited by attackers, posing a significant risk to the robustness of the watermark. We introduce a generic efficient paraphrasing attack, the Self-Information Rewrite Attack (SIRA), which leverages the vulnerability by calculating the self-information of each token to identify potential pattern tokens and perform targeted attack. Our work exposes a widely prevalent vulnerability in current watermarking algorithms. The experimental results show SIRA achieves nearly 100% attack success rates on seven recent watermarking methods with only 0.88 USD per million tokens cost. Our approach does not require any access to the watermark algorithms or the watermarked LLM and can seamlessly transfer to any LLM as the attack model, even mobile-level models. Our findings highlight the urgent need for more robust watermarking.</p>

<p>Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) enhance interpretability by explaining predictions through human-understandable concepts but typically assume that training and test data share the same distribution. This assumption often fails under domain shifts, leading to degraded performance and poor generalization. To address these limitations and improve the robustness of CBMs, we propose the Concept-based Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (CUDA) framework. CUDA is designed to: (1) align concept representations across domains using adversarial training, (2) introduce a relaxation threshold to allow minor domain-specific differences in concept distributions, thereby preventing performance drop due to over-constraints of these distributions, (3) infer concepts directly in the target domain without requiring labeled concept data, enabling CBMs to adapt to diverse domains, and (4) integrate concept learning into conventional domain adaptation (DA) with theoretical guarantees, improving interpretability and establishing new benchmarks for DA. Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art CBM and DA methods on real-world datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the high penetration of renewables, traditional model-based power system operation is challenged to deliver economic, stable, and robust decisions. Machine learning has emerged as a powerful modeling tool for capturing complex dynamics to address these challenges. However, its separate design often lacks systematic integration with existing methods. To fill the gap, this paper proposes a holistic framework of Learning-Augmented Power System Operations (LAPSO, pronounced as Lap-So). Adopting a native optimization perspective, LAPSO is centered on the operation stage and aims to break the boundary between temporally siloed power system tasks, such as forecast, operation and control, while unifying the objectives of machine learning and model-based optimizations at both training and inference stages. Systematic analysis and simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of applying LAPSO in designing new integrated algorithms, such as stability-constrained optimization (SCO) and objective-based forecasting (OBF), while enabling end-to-end tracing of different sources of uncertainties. In addition, a dedicated Python package-lapso is introduced to automatically augment existing power system optimization models with learnable components.

It categorizes the research into three perspectives: robustness, aiming to design models resilient to "gaming"; fairness, analyzing the societal impacts of such systems; and improvement/causality, recognizing situations where strategic actions lead to genuine personal or societal improvement. The paper introduces a unified framework encapsulating models for these perspectives, including offline, online, and causal settings, and highlights key challenges such as differentiating between gaming and improvement and addressing heterogeneity among agents. By synthesizing findings from diverse works, we outline theoretical advancements and practical solutions for robust, fair, and causally-informed incentive-aware ML systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Learning to cooperate in distributed partially observable environments with no communication abilities poses significant challenges for multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MARL). This paper addresses key concerns in this domain, focusing on inferring state representations from individual agent observations and leveraging these representations to enhance agents' exploration and collaborative task execution policies. To this end, we propose a novel state modelling framework for cooperative MARL, where agents infer meaningful belief representations of the non-observable state, with respect to optimizing their own policies, while filtering redundant and less informative joint state information. Building upon this framework, we propose the MARL SMPE algorithm. In SMPE, agents enhance their own policy's discriminative abilities under partial observability, explicitly by incorporating their beliefs into the policy network, and implicitly by adopting an adversarial type of exploration policies which encourages agents to discover novel, high-value states while improving the discriminative abilities of others. Experimentally, we show that SMPE outperforms state-of-the-art MARL algorithms in complex fully cooperative tasks from the MPE, LBF, and RWARE benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kun Peng, Chaodong Tong, Cong Cao, Hao Peng, Qian Li, Guanlin Wu, Lei Jiang, Yanbing Liu, Philip S. Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Aspect sentiment triplet extraction (ASTE) aims to extract triplets composed of aspect terms, opinion terms, and sentiment polarities from given sentences. The table tagging method is a popular approach to addressing this task, which encodes a sentence into a 2-dimensional table, allowing for the tagging of relations between any two words. Previous efforts have focused on designing various downstream relation learning modules to better capture interactions between tokens in the table, revealing that a stronger capability to capture relations can lead to greater improvements in the model. Motivated by this, we attempt to directly utilize transformer layers as downstream relation learning modules. Due to the powerful semantic modeling capability of transformers, it is foreseeable that this will lead to excellent improvement. However, owing to the quadratic relation between the length of the table and the length of the input sentence sequence, using transformers directly faces two challenges: overly long table sequences and unfair local attention interaction. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Table-Transformer (T-T) for the tagging-based ASTE method. Specifically, we introduce a stripe attention mechanism with a loop-shift strategy to tackle these challenges. The former modifies the global attention mechanism to only attend to a 2-dimensional local attention window, while the latter facilitates interaction between different attention windows. Extensive and comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the T-T, as a downstream relation learning module, achieves state-of-the-art performance with lower computational costs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaixin Wang, Tianlin Li, Xiaoyu Zhang, Chong Wang, Weisong Sun, Yang Liu, Bin Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Code large language models (CodeLLMs) and agents have shown great promise in tackling complex software engineering tasks.Compared to traditional software engineering methods, CodeLLMs and agents offer stronger abilities, and can flexibly process inputs and outputs in both natural and code. Benchmarking plays a crucial role in evaluating the capabilities of CodeLLMs and agents, guiding their development and deployment. However, despite their growing significance, there remains a lack of comprehensive reviews of benchmarks for CodeLLMs and agents. To bridge this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive review of existing benchmarks for CodeLLMs and agents, studying and analyzing 181 benchmarks from 461 relevant papers, covering the different phases of the software development life cycle (SDLC). Our findings reveal a notable imbalance in the coverage of current benchmarks, with approximately 60% focused on the software development phase in SDLC, while requirements engineering and software design phases receive minimal attention at only 5% and 3%, respectively. Additionally, Python emerges as the dominant programming language across the reviewed benchmarks. Finally, this paper highlights the challenges of current research and proposes future directions, aiming to narrow the gap between the theoretical capabilities of CodeLLMs and agents and their application in real-world scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmed Abdelreheem, Filippo Aleotti, Jamie Watson, Zawar Qureshi, Abdelrahman Eldesokey, Peter Wonka, Gabriel Brostow, Sara Vicente, Guillermo Garcia-Hernando</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce the novel task of Language-Guided Object Placement in Real 3D Scenes. Our model is given a 3D scene's point cloud, a 3D asset, and a textual prompt broadly describing where the 3D asset should be placed. The task here is to find a valid placement for the 3D asset that respects the prompt. Compared with other language-guided localization tasks in 3D scenes such as grounding, this task has specific challenges: it is ambiguous because it has multiple valid solutions, and it requires reasoning about 3D geometric relationships and free space. We inaugurate this task by proposing a new benchmark and evaluation protocol. We also introduce a new dataset for training 3D LLMs on this task, as well as the first method to serve as a non-trivial baseline. We believe that this challenging task and our new benchmark could become part of the suite of benchmarks used to evaluate and compare generalist 3D LLM models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benjamin A. Cohen, Jonathan Fhima, Meishar Meisel, Baskin Meital, Luis Filipe Nakayama, Eran Berkowitz, Joachim A. Behar</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has enabled Vision Transformers (ViTs) to learn robust representations from large-scale natural image datasets, enhancing their generalization across domains. In retinal imaging, foundation models pretrained on either natural or ophthalmic data have shown promise, but the benefits of in-domain pretraining remain uncertain. To investigate this, we benchmark six SSL-pretrained ViTs on seven digital fundus image (DFI) datasets totaling 70,000 expert-annotated images for the task of moderate-to-late age-related macular degeneration (AMD) identification. Our results show that iBOT pretrained on natural images achieves the highest out-of-distribution generalization, with AUROCs of 0.80-0.97, outperforming domain-specific models, which achieved AUROCs of 0.78-0.96 and a baseline ViT-L with no pretraining, which achieved AUROCs of 0.68-0.91. These findings highlight the value of foundation models in improving AMD identification and challenge the assumption that in-domain pretraining is necessary. Furthermore, we release BRAMD, an open-access dataset (n=587) of DFIs with AMD labels from Brazil.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhui Xu, Hanze Dong, Lei Wang, Doyen Sahoo, Junnan Li, Caiming Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable progress on complex tasks by generating extended chains of thought (CoT). However, their uncontrolled output lengths pose significant challenges for real-world deployment, where inference-time budgets on tokens, latency, or compute are strictly constrained. We propose Elastic Reasoning, a novel framework for scalable chain of thoughts that explicitly separates reasoning into two phases--thinking and solution--with independently allocated budgets. At test time, Elastic Reasoning prioritize that completeness of solution segments, significantly improving reliability under tight resource constraints. To train models that are robust to truncated thinking, we introduce a lightweight budget-constrained rollout strategy, integrated into GRPO, which teaches the model to reason adaptively when the thinking process is cut short and generalizes effectively to unseen budget constraints without additional training. Empirical results on mathematical (AIME, MATH500) and programming (LiveCodeBench, Codeforces) benchmarks demonstrate that Elastic Reasoning performs robustly under strict budget constraints, while incurring significantly lower training cost than baseline methods. Remarkably, our approach also produces more concise and efficient reasoning even in unconstrained settings. Elastic Reasoning offers a principled and practical solution to the pressing challenge of controllable reasoning at scale.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chintan B. Maniyar, Minakshi Kumar, Gengchen Mai</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate building segmentation from high-resolution RGB imagery remains challenging due to spectral similarity with non-building features, shadows, and irregular building geometries. In this study, we present a comprehensive deep learning framework for multiscale building segmentation using RGB aerial and satellite imagery with spatial resolutions ranging from 0.4m to 2.7m. We curate a diverse, multi-sensor dataset and introduce feature-augmented inputs by deriving secondary representations including Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Visible Difference Vegetation Index (VDVI), Morphological Building Index (MBI), and Sobel edge filters from RGB channels. These features guide a Res-U-Net architecture in learning complex spatial patterns more effectively. We also propose training policies incorporating layer freezing, cyclical learning rates, and SuperConvergence to reduce training time and resource usage. Evaluated on a held-out WorldView-3 image, our model achieves an overall accuracy of 96.5%, an F1-score of 0.86, and an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.80, outperforming existing RGB-based benchmarks. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of combining multi-resolution imagery, feature augmentation, and optimized training strategies for robust building segmentation in remote sensing applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pungponhavoan Tep, Marc Bernacki</p>
<p>Abstract: Grain growth simulation is crucial for predicting metallic material microstructure evolution during annealing and resulting final mechanical properties, but traditional partial differential equation-based methods are computationally expensive, creating bottlenecks in materials design and manufacturing. In this work, we introduce a machine learning framework that combines a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory networks with an Autoencoder to efficiently predict grain growth evolution. Our approach captures both spatial and temporal aspects of grain evolution while encoding high-dimensional grain structure data into a compact latent space for pattern learning, enhanced by a novel composite loss function combining Mean Squared Error, Structural Similarity Index Measurement, and Boundary Preservation to maintain structural integrity of grain boundary topology of the prediction. Results demonstrated that our machine learning approach accelerates grain growth prediction by up to \SI{89}{\times} faster, reducing computation time from \SI{10}{\minute} to approximately \SI{10}{\second} while maintaining high-fidelity predictions. The best model (S-30-30) achieving a structural similarity score of \SI{86.71}{\percent} and mean grain size error of just \SI{0.07}{\percent}. All models accurately captured grain boundary topology, morphology, and size distributions. This approach enables rapid microstructural prediction for applications where conventional simulations are prohibitively time-consuming, potentially accelerating innovation in materials science and manufacturing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Runfeng Li, Mikhail Okunev, Zixuan Guo, Anh Ha Duong, Christian Richardt, Matthew O'Toole, James Tompkin</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a method to reconstruct dynamic scenes from monocular continuous-wave time-of-flight (C-ToF) cameras using raw sensor samples that achieves similar or better accuracy than neural volumetric approaches and is 100x faster. Quickly achieving high-fidelity dynamic 3D reconstruction from a single viewpoint is a significant challenge in computer vision. In C-ToF radiance field reconstruction, the property of interest-depth-is not directly measured, causing an additional challenge. This problem has a large and underappreciated impact upon the optimization when using a fast primitive-based scene representation like 3D Gaussian splatting, which is commonly used with multi-view data to produce satisfactory results and is brittle in its optimization otherwise. We incorporate two heuristics into the optimization to improve the accuracy of scene geometry represented by Gaussians. Experimental results show that our approach produces accurate reconstructions under constrained C-ToF sensing conditions, including for fast motions like swinging baseball bats. https://visual.cs.brown.edu/gftorf</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kejie Zhao, Wenjia Hua, Aiersi Tuerhong, Luziwei Leng, Yuxin Ma, Qinghua Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, spiking neural networks (SNNs), deployed on neuromorphic chips, provide highly efficient solutions on edge devices in different scenarios. However, their ability to adapt to distribution shifts after deployment has become a crucial challenge. Online test-time adaptation (OTTA) offers a promising solution by enabling models to dynamically adjust to new data distributions without requiring source data or labeled target samples. Nevertheless, existing OTTA methods are largely designed for traditional artificial neural networks and are not well-suited for SNNs. To address this gap, we propose a low-power, neuromorphic chip-friendly online test-time adaptation framework, aiming to enhance model generalization under distribution shifts. The proposed approach is called Threshold Modulation (TM), which dynamically adjusts the firing threshold through neuronal dynamics-inspired normalization, being more compatible with neuromorphic hardware. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in improving the robustness of SNNs against distribution shifts while maintaining low computational cost. The proposed method offers a practical solution for online test-time adaptation of SNNs, providing inspiration for the design of future neuromorphic chips. The demo code is available at github.com/NneurotransmitterR/TM-OTTA-SNN.</p>

<p>Abstract: Oblique decision trees have attracted attention due to their potential for improved classification performance over traditional axis-aligned decision trees. However, methods that rely on exhaustive search to find oblique splits face computational challenges. As a result, they have not been widely explored. We introduce a novel algorithm, Classification and Regression Tree - Exhaustive Linear Combinations (CART-ELC), for inducing oblique decision trees that performs an exhaustive search on a restricted set of hyperplanes. We then investigate the algorithm's computational complexity and its predictive capabilities. Our results demonstrate that CART-ELC consistently achieves competitive performance on small datasets, often yielding statistically significant improvements in classification accuracy relative to existing decision tree induction algorithms, while frequently producing shallower, simpler, and thus more interpretable trees.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reasoning capabilities of large language models are primarily studied for English, even when pretrained models are multilingual. In this work, we investigate to what extent English reasoning finetuning with long chain-of-thoughts (CoTs) can generalize across languages. First, we find that scaling up inference compute for English-centric reasoning language models (RLMs) improves multilingual mathematical reasoning across many languages including low-resource languages, to an extent where they outperform models twice their size. Second, we reveal that while English-centric RLM's CoTs are naturally predominantly English, they consistently follow a quote-and-think pattern to reason about quoted non-English inputs. Third, we discover an effective strategy to control the language of long CoT reasoning, and we observe that models reason better and more efficiently in high-resource languages. Finally, we observe poor out-of-domain reasoning generalization, in particular from STEM to cultural commonsense knowledge, even for English. Overall, we demonstrate the potentials, study the mechanisms and outline the limitations of crosslingual generalization of English reasoning test-time scaling. We conclude that practitioners should let English-centric RLMs reason in high-resource languages, while further work is needed to improve reasoning in low-resource languages and out-of-domain contexts.</p>

<p>Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) offers a potential boon for AI safety as it allows monitoring a model's CoT to try to understand its intentions and reasoning processes. However, the effectiveness of such monitoring hinges on CoTs faithfully representing models' actual reasoning processes. We evaluate CoT faithfulness of state-of-the-art reasoning models across 6 reasoning hints presented in the prompts and find: (1) for most settings and models tested, CoTs reveal their usage of hints in at least 1% of examples where they use the hint, but the reveal rate is often below 20%, (2) outcome-based reinforcement learning initially improves faithfulness but plateaus without saturating, and (3) when reinforcement learning increases how frequently hints are used (reward hacking), the propensity to verbalize them does not increase, even without training against a CoT monitor. These results suggest that CoT monitoring is a promising way of noticing undesired behaviors during training and evaluations, but that it is not sufficient to rule them out. They also suggest that in settings like ours where CoT reasoning is not necessary, test-time monitoring of CoTs is unlikely to reliably catch rare and catastrophic unexpected behaviors.</p>

<p>Abstract: Pioneering token-based works such as Chameleon and Emu3 have established a foundation for multimodal unification but face challenges of high training computational overhead and limited comprehension performance due to a lack of high-level semantics. In this paper, we introduce TokLIP, a visual tokenizer that enhances comprehension by semanticizing vector-quantized (VQ) tokens and incorporating CLIP-level semantics while enabling end-to-end multimodal autoregressive training with standard VQ tokens. TokLIP integrates a low-level discrete VQ tokenizer with a ViT-based token encoder to capture high-level continuous semantics. Unlike previous approaches (e.g., VILA-U) that discretize high-level features, TokLIP disentangles training objectives for comprehension and generation, allowing the direct application of advanced VQ tokenizers without the need for tailored quantization operations. Our empirical results demonstrate that TokLIP achieves exceptional data efficiency, empowering visual tokens with high-level semantic understanding while enhancing low-level generative capacity, making it well-suited for autoregressive Transformers in both comprehension and generation tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ran Zhang, Wei Zhao, Lieve Macken, Steffen Eger</p>
<p>Abstract: The impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) has extended into literary domains. However, existing evaluation metrics prioritize mechanical accuracy over artistic expression and tend to overrate machine translation (MT) as being superior to experienced professional human translation. In the long run, this bias could result in a permanent decline in translation quality and cultural authenticity. In response to the urgent need for a specialized literary evaluation metric, we introduce TransProQA, a novel, reference-free, LLM-based question-answering (QA) framework designed specifically for literary translation evaluation. TransProQA uniquely integrates insights from professional literary translators and researchers, focusing on critical elements in literary quality assessment such as literary devices, cultural understanding, and authorial voice. Our extensive evaluation shows that while literary-finetuned XCOMET-XL yields marginal gains, TransProQA substantially outperforms current metrics, achieving up to 0.07 gain in correlation (ACC-EQ and Kendall's tau) and surpassing the best state-of-the-art (SOTA) metrics by over 15 points in adequacy assessments. Incorporating professional translator insights as weights further improves performance, highlighting the value of translator inputs. Notably, TransProQA approaches human-level evaluation performance comparable to trained linguistic annotators. It demonstrates broad applicability to open-source models such as LLaMA3.3-70b and Qwen2.5-32b, indicating its potential as an accessible and training-free literary evaluation metric and a valuable tool for evaluating texts that require local processing due to copyright or ethical considerations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Direct alignment methods are increasingly used for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, these methods suffer from the issues of verbosity and likelihood displacement, which can be driven by the noisy preference pairs that induce similar likelihood for preferred and dispreferred responses. The contributions of this paper are two-fold. First, we propose a new preference alignment method based on comparison oracles and provide the convergence guarantee for its basic scheme. Second, we improve our method using some heuristics and conduct the experiments to demonstrate the flexibility and compatibility of practical scheme in improving the performance of LLMs using noisy preference pairs. Evaluations are conducted across multiple base and instruction-tuned models (Mistral-7B, Llama-3-8B and Gemma-2-9B) with benchmarks (AlpacaEval 2, MT-Bench and Arena-Hard). Experimental results show the effectiveness of our method as an alternative to addressing the limitations of existing direct alignment methods. A highlight of our work is that we evidence the importance of designing specialized methods for preference pairs with distinct likelihood margin, which complements the recent findings in \citet{Razin-2025-Unintentional}.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present StreamBridge, a simple yet effective framework that seamlessly transforms offline Video-LLMs into streaming-capable models. It addresses two fundamental challenges in adapting existing models into online scenarios: (1) limited capability for multi-turn real-time understanding, and (2) lack of proactive response mechanisms. Specifically, StreamBridge incorporates (1) a memory buffer combined with a round-decayed compression strategy, supporting long-context multi-turn interactions, and (2) a decoupled, lightweight activation model that can be effortlessly integrated into existing Video-LLMs, enabling continuous proactive responses. To further support StreamBridge, we construct Stream-IT, a large-scale dataset tailored for streaming video understanding, featuring interleaved video-text sequences and diverse instruction formats. Extensive experiments show that StreamBridge significantly improves the streaming understanding capabilities of offline Video-LLMs across various tasks, outperforming even proprietary models such as GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro. Simultaneously, it achieves competitive or superior performance on standard video understanding benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose Flow-GRPO, the first method integrating online reinforcement learning (RL) into flow matching models. Our approach uses two key strategies: (1) an ODE-to-SDE conversion that transforms a deterministic Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) into an equivalent Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) that matches the original model's marginal distribution at all timesteps, enabling statistical sampling for RL exploration; and (2) a Denoising Reduction strategy that reduces training denoising steps while retaining the original inference timestep number, significantly improving sampling efficiency without performance degradation. Empirically, Flow-GRPO is effective across multiple text-to-image tasks. For complex compositions, RL-tuned SD3.5 generates nearly perfect object counts, spatial relations, and fine-grained attributes, boosting GenEval accuracy from $63\%$ to $95\%$. In visual text rendering, its accuracy improves from $59\%$ to $92\%$, significantly enhancing text generation. Flow-GRPO also achieves substantial gains in human preference alignment. Notably, little to no reward hacking occurred, meaning rewards did not increase at the cost of image quality or diversity, and both remained stable in our experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qijie Ding, Jie Yin, Daokun Zhang, Junbin Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Entity alignment (EA) aims at identifying equivalent entity pairs across different knowledge graphs (KGs) that refer to the same real-world identity. To circumvent the shortage of seed alignments provided for training, recent EA models utilize pseudo-labeling strategies to iteratively add unaligned entity pairs predicted with high confidence to the seed alignments for model training. However, the adverse impact of confirmation bias during pseudo-labeling has been largely overlooked, thus hindering entity alignment performance. To systematically combat confirmation bias for pseudo-labeling-based entity alignment, we propose a Unified Pseudo-Labeling framework for Entity Alignment (UPL-EA) that explicitly eliminates pseudo-labeling errors to boost the accuracy of entity alignment. UPL-EA consists of two complementary components: (1) Optimal Transport (OT)-based pseudo-labeling uses discrete OT modeling as an effective means to determine entity correspondences and reduce erroneous matches across two KGs. An effective criterion is derived to infer pseudo-labeled alignments that satisfy one-to-one correspondences; (2) Parallel pseudo-label ensembling refines pseudo-labeled alignments by combining predictions over multiple models independently trained in parallel. The ensembled pseudo-labeled alignments are thereafter used to augment seed alignments to reinforce subsequent model training for alignment inference. The effectiveness of UPL-EA in eliminating pseudo-labeling errors is both theoretically supported and experimentally validated. Our extensive results and in-depth analyses demonstrate the superiority of UPL-EA over 15 competitive baselines and its utility as a general pseudo-labeling framework for entity alignment.</p>

<p>Abstract: Which fairness metrics are appropriately applicable in your contexts? There may be instances of discordance regarding the perception of fairness, even when the outcomes comply with established fairness metrics. Several questionnaire-based surveys have been conducted to evaluate fairness metrics with human perceptions of fairness. However, these surveys were limited in scope, including only a few hundred participants within a single country. In this study, we conduct an international survey to evaluate public perceptions of various fairness metrics in decision-making scenarios. We collected responses from 1,000 participants in each of China, France, Japan, and the United States, amassing a total of 4,000 participants, to analyze the preferences of fairness metrics.

<p>Abstract: Although AI has become increasingly smart, its wisdom has not kept pace. In this article, we examine what is known about human wisdom and sketch a vision of its AI counterpart. We analyze human wisdom as a set of strategies for solving intractable problems-those outside the scope of analytic techniques-including both object-level strategies like heuristics [for managing problems] and metacognitive strategies like intellectual humility, perspective-taking, or context-adaptability [for managing object-level strategies]. We argue that AI systems particularly struggle with metacognition; improved metacognition would lead to AI more robust to novel environments, explainable to users, cooperative with others, and safer in risking fewer misaligned goals with human users. We discuss how wise AI might be benchmarked, trained, and implemented.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhouliang Yu, Yuhuan Yuan, Tim Z. Xiao, Fuxiang Frank Xia, Jie Fu, Ge Zhang, Ge Lin, Weiyang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Solving complex planning problems requires Large Language Models (LLMs) to explicitly model the state transition to avoid rule violations, comply with constraints, and ensure optimality-a task hindered by the inherent ambiguity of natural language. To overcome such ambiguity, Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) is leveraged as a planning abstraction that enables precise and formal state descriptions. With PDDL, we can generate a symbolic world model where classic searching algorithms, such as A*, can be seamlessly applied to find optimal plans. However, directly generating PDDL domains with current LLMs remains an open challenge due to the lack of PDDL training data. To address this challenge, we propose to scale up the test-time computation of LLMs to enhance their PDDL reasoning capabilities, thereby enabling the generation of high-quality PDDL domains. Specifically, we introduce a simple yet effective algorithm, which first employs a Best-of-N sampling approach to improve the quality of the initial solution and then refines the solution in a fine-grained manner with verbalized machine learning. Our method outperforms o1-mini by a considerable margin in the generation of PDDL domains, achieving over 50\% success rate on two tasks (i.e., generating PDDL domains from natural language description or PDDL problems). This is done without requiring additional training. By taking advantage of PDDL as state abstraction, our method is able to outperform current state-of-the-art methods on almost all competition-level planning tasks.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07503">Recursive Inference Scaling: A Winning Path to Scalable Inference in Language and Multimodal Systems</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ibrahim Alabdulmohsin, Xiaohua Zhai</p>
<p>Abstract: Inspired by recent findings on the fractal geometry of language, we introduce Recursive INference Scaling (RINS) as a complementary, plug-in recipe for scaling inference time in language and multimodal systems. RINS is a particular form of recursive depth that significantly outperforms +55 other variants, including the recent "repeat-all-over" (RAO) strategy in Mobile LLM (Liu et al., 2024) and latent recurrent thinking (Geiping et al., 2025). Unlike prior works, we carry out our comparisons on a compute-matched regime, and demonstrate that for a fixed model size and training compute budget, RINS substantially improves language modeling performance. It also generalizes beyond pure language tasks, delivering gains in multimodal systems, including a +2% improvement in 0-shot ImageNet accuracy for SigLIP-B/16. Additionally, by deriving data scaling laws, we show that RINS improves both the asymptotic performance limits and the scaling exponents. More importantly, with light-weight (linear) adapters (comprising <1% of model parameters) and stochastic dropout, RINS offers a no-regret strategy, meaning that RINS-enabled pretraining improves performance in language modeling even when recursive depth is not applied at inference time. This corresponds to improving performance on a training compute-, parameter-, and inference-matched regime, suggesting its potential as a viable component of LLM pretraining!</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents a simple, effective, and cost-efficient strategy to improve LLM performance by scaling test-time compute. Our strategy builds upon the repeated-sampling-then-voting framework, with a novel twist: incorporating multiple models, even weaker ones, to leverage their complementary strengths that potentially arise from diverse training data and paradigms. By using consistency as a signal, our strategy dynamically switches between models. Theoretical analysis highlights the efficiency and performance advantages of our strategy. Extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate that our strategy not only outperforms self-consistency and state-of-the-art multi-agent debate approaches, but also significantly reduces inference costs. Additionally, ModelSwitch requires only a few comparable LLMs to achieve optimal performance and can be extended with verification methods, demonstrating the potential of leveraging multiple LLMs in the generation-verification paradigm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ning Wang, Zihan Yan, Weiyang Li, Chuan Ma, He Chen, Tao Xiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Embodied agents exhibit immense potential across a multitude of domains, making the assurance of their behavioral safety a fundamental prerequisite for their widespread deployment. However, existing research predominantly concentrates on the security of general large language models, lacking specialized methodologies for establishing safety benchmarks and input moderation tailored to embodied agents. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces a novel input moderation framework, meticulously designed to safeguard embodied agents. This framework encompasses the entire pipeline, including taxonomy definition, dataset curation, moderator architecture, model training, and rigorous evaluation. Notably, we introduce EAsafetyBench, a meticulously crafted safety benchmark engineered to facilitate both the training and stringent assessment of moderators specifically designed for embodied agents. Furthermore, we propose Pinpoint, an innovative prompt-decoupled input moderation scheme that harnesses a masked attention mechanism to effectively isolate and mitigate the influence of functional prompts on moderation tasks. Extensive experiments conducted on diverse benchmark datasets and models validate the feasibility and efficacy of the proposed approach. The results demonstrate that our methodologies achieve an impressive average detection accuracy of 94.58%, surpassing the performance of existing state-of-the-art techniques, alongside an exceptional moderation processing time of merely 0.002 seconds per instance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zheng Zhang, Nuoqian Xiao, Qi Chai, Deheng Ye, Hao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated impressive capabilities in social deduction games (SDGs) like Werewolf, where strategic reasoning and social deception are essential. However, current approaches remain limited to textual information, ignoring crucial multimodal cues such as facial expressions and tone of voice that humans naturally use to communicate. Moreover, existing SDG agents primarily focus on inferring other players' identities without modeling how others perceive themselves or fellow players. To address these limitations, we use One Night Ultimate Werewolf (ONUW) as a testbed and present MultiMind, the first framework integrating multimodal information into SDG agents. MultiMind processes facial expressions and vocal tones alongside verbal content, while employing a Theory of Mind (ToM) model to represent each player's suspicion levels toward others. By combining this ToM model with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), our agent identifies communication strategies that minimize suspicion directed at itself. Through comprehensive evaluation in both agent-versus-agent simulations and studies with human players, we demonstrate MultiMind's superior performance in gameplay. Our work presents a significant advancement toward LLM agents capable of human-like social reasoning across multimodal domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Malte Luttermann, Jan Speller, Marcel Gehrke, Tanya Braun, Ralf M\"oller, Mattis Hartwig</p>
<p>Abstract: Probabilistic relational models such as parametric factor graphs enable efficient (lifted) inference by exploiting the indistinguishability of objects. In lifted inference, a representative of indistinguishable objects is used for computations. To obtain a relational (i.e., lifted) representation, the Advanced Colour Passing (ACP) algorithm is the state of the art. The ACP algorithm, however, requires underlying distributions, encoded as potential-based factorisations, to exactly match to identify and exploit indistinguishabilities. Hence, ACP is unsuitable for practical applications where potentials learned from data inevitably deviate even if associated objects are indistinguishable. To mitigate this problem, we introduce the $\varepsilon$-Advanced Colour Passing ($\varepsilon$-ACP) algorithm, which allows for a deviation of potentials depending on a hyperparameter $\varepsilon$. $\varepsilon$-ACP efficiently uncovers and exploits indistinguishabilities that are not exact. We prove that the approximation error induced by $\varepsilon$-ACP is strictly bounded and our experiments show that the approximation error is close to zero in practice.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sebastian Dumbrava</p>
<p>Abstract: This monograph presents a modular cognitive architecture for artificial intelligence grounded in the formal modeling of belief as structured semantic state. Belief states are defined as dynamic ensembles of linguistic expressions embedded within a navigable manifold, where operators enable assimilation, abstraction, nullification, memory, and introspection. Drawing from philosophy, cognitive science, and neuroscience, we develop a layered framework that enables self-regulating epistemic agents capable of reflective, goal-directed thought. At the core of this framework is the epistemic vacuum: a class of semantically inert cognitive states that serves as the conceptual origin of belief space. From this foundation, the Null Tower arises as a generative structure recursively built through internal representational capacities. The theoretical constructs are designed to be implementable in both symbolic and neural systems, including large language models, hybrid agents, and adaptive memory architectures. This work offers a foundational substrate for constructing agents that reason, remember, and regulate their beliefs in structured, interpretable ways.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alberto Hern\'andez-Espinosa, Felipe S. Abrah\~ao, Olaf Witkowski, Hector Zenil</p>
<p>Abstract: The AI alignment problem, which focusses on ensuring that artificial intelligence (AI), including AGI and ASI, systems act according to human values, presents profound challenges. With the progression from narrow AI to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Superintelligence, fears about control and existential risk have escalated. Here, we investigate whether embracing inevitable AI misalignment can be a contingent strategy to foster a dynamic ecosystem of competing agents as a viable path to steer them in more human-aligned trends and mitigate risks. We explore how misalignment may serve and should be promoted as a counterbalancing mechanism to team up with whichever agents are most aligned to human interests, ensuring that no single system dominates destructively. The main premise of our contribution is that misalignment is inevitable because full AI-human alignment is a mathematical impossibility from Turing-complete systems, which we also offer as a proof in this contribution, a feature then inherited to AGI and ASI systems. We introduce and test change-of-opinion attacks based on this kind of perturbation and intervention analysis to study how agents may neutralise friendly or unfriendly AIs through cooperation and competition. We show that open models are more diverse and that most likely guardrails implemented in proprietary models are successful at steering and controlling to some extent the agents' range of opinion and sentiment change with possible positive and negative consequences in what we believe are signs of a neuro-symbolic approach even if shallow.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qianjun Pan, Wenkai Ji, Yuyang Ding, Junsong Li, Shilian Chen, Junyi Wang, Jie Zhou, Qin Chen, Min Zhang, Yulan Wu, Liang He</p>
<p>Abstract: This survey explores recent advancements in reasoning large language models (LLMs) designed to mimic "slow thinking" - a reasoning process inspired by human cognition, as described in Kahneman's Thinking, Fast and Slow. These models, like OpenAI's o1, focus on scaling computational resources dynamically during complex tasks, such as math reasoning, visual reasoning, medical diagnosis, and multi-agent debates. We present the development of reasoning LLMs and list their key technologies. By synthesizing over 100 studies, it charts a path toward LLMs that combine human-like deep thinking with scalable efficiency for reasoning. The review breaks down methods into three categories: (1) test-time scaling dynamically adjusts computation based on task complexity via search and sampling, dynamic verification; (2) reinforced learning refines decision-making through iterative improvement leveraging policy networks, reward models, and self-evolution strategies; and (3) slow-thinking frameworks (e.g., long CoT, hierarchical processes) that structure problem-solving with manageable steps. The survey highlights the challenges and further directions of this domain. Understanding and advancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs is crucial for unlocking their full potential in real-world applications, from scientific discovery to decision support systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gerrit Gro{\ss}mann, Larisa Ivanova, Sai Leela Poduru, Mohaddeseh Tabrizian, Islam Mesabah, David A. Selby, Sebastian J. Vollmer</p>
<p>Abstract: According to Yuval Noah Harari, large-scale human cooperation is driven by shared narratives that encode common beliefs and values. This study explores whether such narratives can similarly nudge LLM agents toward collaboration. We use a finitely repeated public goods game in which LLM agents choose either cooperative or egoistic spending strategies. We prime agents with stories highlighting teamwork to different degrees and test how this influences negotiation outcomes. Our experiments explore four questions:(1) How do narratives influence negotiation behavior? (2) What differs when agents share the same story versus different ones? (3) What happens when the agent numbers grow? (4) Are agents resilient against self-serving negotiators? We find that story-based priming significantly affects negotiation strategies and success rates. Common stories improve collaboration, benefiting each agent. By contrast, priming agents with different stories reverses this effect, and those agents primed toward self-interest prevail. We hypothesize that these results carry implications for multi-agent system design and AI alignment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marie Davidsen Buhl, Jacob Pfau, Benjamin Hilton, Geoffrey Irving</p>
<p>Abstract: If AI systems match or exceed human capabilities on a wide range of tasks, it may become difficult for humans to efficiently judge their actions -- making it hard to use human feedback to steer them towards desirable traits. One proposed solution is to leverage another superhuman system to point out flaws in the system's outputs via a debate. This paper outlines the value of debate for AI safety, as well as the assumptions and further research required to make debate work. It does so by sketching an ``alignment safety case'' -- an argument that an AI system will not autonomously take actions which could lead to egregious harm, despite being able to do so. The sketch focuses on the risk of an AI R\&D agent inside an AI company sabotaging research, for example by producing false results. To prevent this, the agent is trained via debate, subject to exploration guarantees, to teach the system to be honest. Honesty is maintained throughout deployment via online training. The safety case rests on four key claims: (1) the agent has become good at the debate game, (2) good performance in the debate game implies that the system is mostly honest, (3) the system will not become significantly less honest during deployment, and (4) the deployment context is tolerant of some errors. We identify open research problems that, if solved, could render this a compelling argument that an AI system is safe.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Athena Psalta, Vasileios Tsironis, Konstantinos Karantzalos</p>
<p>Abstract: Data association is a crucial component for any multiple object tracking (MOT) method that follows the tracking-by-detection paradigm. To generate complete trajectories such methods employ a data association process to establish assignments between detections and existing targets during each timestep. Recent data association approaches try to solve either a multi-dimensional linear assignment task or a network flow minimization problem or tackle it via multiple hypotheses tracking. However, during inference an optimization step that computes optimal assignments is required for every sequence frame inducing additional complexity to any given solution. To this end, in the context of this work we introduce Transformer-based Assignment Decision Network (TADN) that tackles data association without the need of any explicit optimization during inference. In particular, TADN can directly infer assignment pairs between detections and active targets in a single forward pass of the network. We have integrated TADN in a rather simple MOT framework, designed a novel training strategy for efficient end-to-end training and demonstrated the high potential of our approach for online visual tracking-by-detection MOT on several popular benchmarks, i.e. MOT17, MOT20 and UA-DETRAC. Our proposed approach demonstrates strong performance in most evaluation metrics despite its simple nature as a tracker lacking significant auxiliary components such as occlusion handling or re-identification. The implementation of our method is publicly available at https://github.com/psaltaath/tadn-mot.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep learning has significantly advanced medical imaging analysis (MIA), achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse clinical tasks. However, its success largely depends on large-scale, high-quality labeled datasets, which are costly and time-consuming to obtain due to the need for expert annotation. To mitigate this limitation, label-efficient deep learning methods have emerged to improve model performance under limited supervision by leveraging labeled, unlabeled, and weakly labeled data. In this survey, we systematically review over 350 peer-reviewed studies and present a comprehensive taxonomy of label-efficient learning methods in MIA. These methods are categorized into four labeling paradigms: no label, insufficient label, inexact label, and label refinement. For each category, we analyze representative techniques across imaging modalities and clinical applications, highlighting shared methodological principles and task-specific adaptations. We also examine the growing role of health foundation models (HFMs) in enabling label-efficient learning through large-scale pre-training and transfer learning, enhancing the use of limited annotations in downstream tasks. Finally, we identify current challenges and future directions to facilitate the translation of label-efficient learning from research promise to everyday clinical care.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samiul Based Shuvo, Tasnia Binte Mamun</p>
<p>Abstract: Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, and early detection is crucial for improving patient outcomes. Nevertheless, early diagnosis of cancer is a major challenge, particularly in low-resource settings where access to medical resources and trained radiologists is limited. The objective of this study is to propose an automated end-to-end deep learning-based framework for the early detection and classification of lung nodules, specifically for low-resource settings. The proposed framework consists of three stages: lung segmentation using a modified 3D U-Net named 3D Res-U-Net, nodule detection using YOLO-v5, and classification with a Vision Transformer-based architecture. We evaluated the proposed framework on a publicly available dataset, LUNA16. The proposed framework's performance was measured using the respective domain's evaluation matrices. The proposed framework achieved a 98.82% lung segmentation dice score while detecting the lung nodule with 0.76 mAP@50 from the segmented lung, at a low false-positive rate. The performance of both networks of the proposed framework was compared with other studies and found to outperform them regarding segmentation and detection accuracy. Additionally, our proposed Vision transformer network obtained an accuracy of 93.57%, which is 1.21% higher than the state-of-the-art networks. Our proposed end-to-end deep learning-based framework can effectively segment lungs, and detect and classify lung nodules, specifically in low-resource settings with limited access to radiologists. The proposed framework outperforms existing studies regarding all the respective evaluation metrics. The proposed framework can potentially improve the accuracy and efficiency of lung cancer screening in low-resource settings, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yehonatan Avidan, Qianyi Li, Haim Sompolinsky</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial neural networks have revolutionized machine learning in recent years, but a complete theoretical framework for their learning process is still lacking. Substantial advances were achieved for wide networks, within two disparate theoretical frameworks: the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), which assumes linearized gradient descent dynamics, and the Bayesian Neural Network Gaussian Process (NNGP). We unify these two theories using gradient descent learning with an additional noise in an ensemble of wide deep networks. We construct an analytical theory for the network input-output function and introduce a new time-dependent Neural Dynamical Kernel (NDK) from which both NTK and NNGP kernels are derived. We identify two learning phases: a gradient-driven learning phase, dominated by loss minimization, in which the time scale is governed by the initialization variance. It is followed by a slow diffusive learning stage, where the parameters sample the solution space, with a time constant decided by the noise and the Bayesian prior variance. The two variance parameters strongly affect the performance in the two regimes, especially in sigmoidal neurons. In contrast to the exponential convergence of the mean predictor in the initial phase, the convergence to the equilibrium is more complex and may behave nonmonotonically. By characterizing the diffusive phase, our work sheds light on representational drift in the brain, explaining how neural activity changes continuously without degrading performance, either by ongoing gradient signals that synchronize the drifts of different synapses or by architectural biases that generate task-relevant information that is robust against the drift process. This work closes the gap between the NTK and NNGP theories, providing a comprehensive framework for the learning process of deep wide neural networks and for analyzing dynamics in biological circuits.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Georgi Ganev, Emiliano De Cristofaro</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative models producing synthetic data are meant to provide a privacy-friendly approach to releasing data. However, their privacy guarantees are only considered robust when models satisfy Differential Privacy (DP). Alas, this is not a ubiquitous standard, as many leading companies (and, in fact, research papers) use ad-hoc privacy metrics based on testing the statistical similarity between synthetic and real data.
  In this paper, we examine the privacy metrics used in real-world synthetic data deployments and demonstrate their unreliability in several ways. First, we provide counter-examples where severe privacy violations occur even if the privacy tests pass and instantiate accurate membership and attribute inference attacks with minimal cost. We then introduce ReconSyn, a reconstruction attack that generates multiple synthetic datasets that are considered private by the metrics but actually leak information unique to individual records. We show that ReconSyn recovers 78-100% of the outliers in the train data with only black-box access to a single fitted generative model and the privacy metrics. In the process, we show that applying DP only to the model does not mitigate this attack, as using privacy metrics breaks the end-to-end DP pipeline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingyuan Wang, Barry Cardiff, Antoine Frapp\'e, Benoit Larras, Deepu John</p>
<p>Abstract: Conventional deep learning (DL) model compression and scaling methods focus on altering the model's components, impacting the results across all samples uniformly. However, since samples vary in difficulty, a dynamic model that adapts computation based on sample complexity offers a novel perspective for compression and scaling. Despite this potential, existing dynamic models are typically monolithic and model-specific, limiting their generalizability as broad compression and scaling methods. Additionally, most deployed DL systems are fixed, unable to adjust their scale once deployed and, therefore, cannot adapt to the varying real-time demands. This paper introduces DyCE, a dynamically configurable system that can adjust the performance-complexity trade-off of a DL model at runtime without requiring re-initialization or redeployment on inference hardware. DyCE achieves this by adding small exit networks to intermediate layers of the original model, allowing computation to terminate early if acceptable results are obtained. DyCE also decouples the design of an efficient dynamic model, facilitating easy adaptation to new base models and potential general use in compression and scaling. We also propose methods for generating optimized configurations and determining the types and positions of exit networks to achieve desired performance and complexity trade-offs. By enabling simple configuration switching, DyCE provides fine-grained performance tuning in real-time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DyCE through image classification tasks using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). DyCE significantly reduces computational complexity by 23.5% for ResNet152 and 25.9% for ConvNextv2-tiny on ImageNet, with accuracy reductions of less than 0.5%.</p>

Compared to traditional IoT fields, CIoT differs notably in target users, product types, and design approaches. While offering convenience to users, it also raises new security and privacy concerns. Network traffic analysis, a widely used technique in the security community, has been extensively applied to investigate these concerns about CIoT. Compared to traditional network traffic analysis in fields like mobile apps and websites, CIoT introduces unique characteristics that pose new challenges and research opportunities. Researchers have made significant contributions in this area. To aid researchers in understanding the application of traffic analysis tools for assessing CIoT security and privacy risks, this survey reviews 310 publications on traffic analysis within the CIoT security and privacy domain from January 2018 to June 2024, focusing on three research questions. Our work: 1) outlines the CIoT traffic analysis process and highlights its differences from general network traffic analysis. 2) summarizes and classifies existing research into four categories according to its application objectives: device fingerprinting, user activity inference, malicious traffic detection, and measurement. 3) explores emerging challenges and potential future research directions based on each step of the CIoT traffic analysis process. This will provide new insights to the community and guide the industry towards safer product designs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guanghui Wang, Dexi Liu, Jian-Yun Nie, Qizhi Wan, Rong Hu, Xiping Liu, Wanlong Liu, Jiaming Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in event argument extraction (EAE) involve incorporating useful auxiliary information into models during training and inference, such as retrieved instances and event templates. These methods face two challenges: (1) the retrieval results may be irrelevant and (2) templates are developed independently for each event without considering their possible relationship. In this work, we propose DEGAP to address these challenges through a simple yet effective components: dual prefixes, i.e. learnable prompt vectors, where the instance-oriented prefix and template-oriented prefix are trained to learn information from different event instances and templates. Additionally, we propose an event-guided adaptive gating mechanism, which can adaptively leverage possible connections between different events and thus capture relevant information from the prefix. Finally, these event-guided prefixes provide relevant information as cues to EAE model without retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance on four datasets (ACE05, RAMS, WIKIEVENTS, and MLEE). Further analysis shows the impact of different components.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yutao Sun, Mingshuai Chen, Tiancheng Zhao, Kangjia Zhao, He Li, Jintao Chen, Zhongyi Wang, Liqiang Lu, Xinkui Zhao, Shuiguang Deng, Jianwei Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence is rapidly encroaching on the field of service regulation. However, existing AI-based regulation techniques are often tailored to specific application domains and thus are difficult to generalize in an automated manner. This paper presents Horae, a unified specification language for modeling (multimodal) regulation rules across a diverse set of domains. We showcase how Horae facilitates an intelligent service regulation pipeline by further exploiting a fine-tuned large language model named RuleGPT that automates the Horae modeling process, thereby yielding an end-to-end framework for fully automated intelligent service regulation. The feasibility and effectiveness of our framework are demonstrated over a benchmark of various real-world regulation domains. In particular, we show that our open-sourced, fine-tuned RuleGPT with 7B parameters suffices to outperform GPT-3.5 and perform on par with GPT-4o.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Meiziniu Li, Dongze Li, Jianmeng Liu, Jialun Cao, Yongqiang Tian, Shing-Chi Cheung</p>
<p>Abstract: Differential testing offers a promising strategy to alleviate the test oracle problem by comparing the test results between alternative implementations. However, existing differential testing techniques for deep learning (DL) libraries are limited by the key challenges of finding alternative implementations (called counterparts) for a given API and subsequently generating diverse test inputs. To address the two challenges, this paper introduces DLLens, an LLM-enhanced differential testing technique for DL libraries. To address the first challenge, DLLens incorporates an LLM-based counterpart synthesis workflow, with the insight that the counterpart of a given DL library API's computation could be successfully synthesized through certain composition and adaptation of the APIs from another DL library. To address the second challenge, DLLens incorporates a static analysis technique that extracts the path constraints from the implementations of a given API and its counterpart to guide diverse test input generation. The extraction is facilitated by LLM's knowledge of the concerned DL library and its upstream libraries.
  We evaluate DLLens on two popular DL libraries, TensorFlow and PyTorch. Our evaluation shows that DLLens synthesizes counterparts for 1.84 times as many APIs as those found by state-of-the-art techniques on these libraries. Moreover, under the same time budget, DLLens covers 7.23% more branches and detects 1.88 times as many bugs as state-of-the-art techniques on 200 randomly sampled APIs. DLLens has successfully detected 71 bugs in recent TensorFlow and PyTorch libraries. Among them, 59 are confirmed by developers, including 46 confirmed as previously unknown bugs, and 10 of these previously unknown bugs have been fixed in the latest version of TensorFlow and PyTorch.</p>

<p>Abstract: Memorization in language models is typically treated as a homogenous phenomenon, neglecting the specifics of the memorized data. We instead model memorization as the effect of a set of complex factors that describe each sample and relate it to the model and corpus. To build intuition around these factors, we break memorization down into a taxonomy: recitation of highly duplicated sequences, reconstruction of inherently predictable sequences, and recollection of sequences that are neither. We demonstrate the usefulness of our taxonomy by using it to construct a predictive model for memorization. By analyzing dependencies and inspecting the weights of the predictive model, we find that different factors influence the likelihood of memorization differently depending on the taxonomic category.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yasir Ali Farrukh, Syed Wali, Irfan Khan, Nathaniel D. Bastian</p>
<p>Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of cybersecurity, the integration of flow-level and packet-level information for real-time intrusion detection remains a largely untapped area of research. This paper introduces "XG-NID," a novel framework that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to fuse flow-level and packet-level data within a heterogeneous graph structure, offering a comprehensive analysis of network traffic. Leveraging a heterogeneous graph neural network (GNN) with graph-level classification, XG-NID uniquely enables real-time inference while effectively capturing the intricate relationships between flow and packet payload data. Unlike traditional GNN-based methodologies that predominantly analyze historical data, XG-NID is designed to accommodate the heterogeneous nature of network traffic, providing a robust and real-time defense mechanism. Our framework extends beyond mere classification; it integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate detailed, human-readable explanations and suggest potential remedial actions, ensuring that the insights produced are both actionable and comprehensible. Additionally, we introduce a new set of flow features based on temporal information, further enhancing the contextual and explainable inferences provided by our model. To facilitate practical application and accessibility, we developed "GNN4ID," an open-source tool that enables the extraction and transformation of raw network traffic into the proposed heterogeneous graph structure, seamlessly integrating flow and packet-level data. Our comprehensive quantitative comparative analysis demonstrates that XG-NID achieves an F1 score of 97\% in multi-class classification, outperforming existing baseline and state-of-the-art methods. This sets a new standard in Network Intrusion Detection Systems by combining innovative data fusion with enhanced interpretability and real-time capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunze Man, Shuhong Zheng, Zhipeng Bao, Martial Hebert, Liang-Yan Gui, Yu-Xiong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Complex 3D scene understanding has gained increasing attention, with scene encoding strategies playing a crucial role in this success. However, the optimal scene encoding strategies for various scenarios remain unclear, particularly compared to their image-based counterparts. To address this issue, we present a comprehensive study that probes various visual encoding models for 3D scene understanding, identifying the strengths and limitations of each model across different scenarios. Our evaluation spans seven vision foundation encoders, including image-based, video-based, and 3D foundation models. We evaluate these models in four tasks: Vision-Language Scene Reasoning, Visual Grounding, Segmentation, and Registration, each focusing on different aspects of scene understanding. Our evaluations yield key findings: DINOv2 demonstrates superior performance, video models excel in object-level tasks, diffusion models benefit geometric tasks, and language-pretrained models show unexpected limitations in language-related tasks. These insights challenge some conventional understandings, provide novel perspectives on leveraging visual foundation models, and highlight the need for more flexible encoder selection in future vision-language and scene-understanding tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Blaine Hoak, Patrick McDaniel</p>
<p>Abstract: The influence of textures on machine learning models has been an ongoing investigation, specifically in texture bias/learning, interpretability, and robustness. However, due to the lack of large and diverse texture data available, the findings in these works have been limited, as more comprehensive evaluations have not been feasible. Image generative models are able to provide data creation at scale, but utilizing these models for texture synthesis has been unexplored and poses additional challenges both in creating accurate texture images and validating those images. In this work, we introduce an extensible methodology and corresponding new dataset for generating high-quality, diverse texture images capable of supporting a broad set of texture-based tasks. Our pipeline consists of: (1) developing prompts from a range of descriptors to serve as input to text-to-image models, (2) adopting and adapting Stable Diffusion pipelines to generate and filter the corresponding images, and (3) further filtering down to the highest quality images. Through this, we create the Prompted Textures Dataset (PTD), a dataset of 362,880 texture images that span 56 textures. During the process of generating images, we find that NSFW safety filters in image generation pipelines are highly sensitive to texture (and flag up to 60\% of our texture images), uncovering a potential bias in these models and presenting unique challenges when working with texture data. Through both standard metrics and a human evaluation, we find that our dataset is high quality and diverse. Our dataset is available for download at https://zenodo.org/records/15359142.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jemin Lee, Sihyeong Park, Jinse Kwon, Jihun Oh, Yongin Kwon</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantization has gained attention as a promising solution for the cost-effective deployment of large and small language models. However, most prior work has been limited to perplexity or basic knowledge tasks and lacks a comprehensive evaluation of recent models like Llama-3.3. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of instruction-tuned models spanning 1B to 405B parameters, applying four quantization methods across 13 datasets. Our findings reveal that (1) quantized models generally surpass smaller FP16 baselines, yet they often struggle with instruction-following and hallucination detection; (2) FP8 consistently emerges as the most robust option across tasks, and AWQ tends to outperform GPTQ in weight-only quantization; (3) smaller models can suffer severe accuracy drops at 4-bit quantization, while 70B-scale models maintain stable performance; (4) notably, \textit{hard} tasks do not always experience the largest accuracy losses, indicating that quantization magnifies a model's inherent weaknesses rather than simply correlating with task difficulty; and (5) an LLM-based judge (MT-Bench) highlights significant performance declines in coding and STEM tasks, though reasoning may sometimes improve.</p>

<p>Abstract: Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans are frequently performed in clinical settings. Opportunistic CT involves repurposing routine CT images to extract diagnostic information and is an emerging tool for detecting underdiagnosed conditions such as sarcopenia, hepatic steatosis, and ascites. This study utilizes deep learning methods to promote accurate diagnosis and clinical documentation. We analyze 2,674 inpatient CT scans to identify discrepancies between imaging phenotypes (characteristics derived from opportunistic CT scans) and their corresponding documentation in radiology reports and ICD coding. Through our analysis, we find that only 0.5%, 3.2%, and 30.7% of scans diagnosed with sarcopenia, hepatic steatosis, and ascites (respectively) through either opportunistic imaging or radiology reports were ICD-coded. Our findings demonstrate opportunistic CT's potential to enhance diagnostic precision and accuracy of risk adjustment models, offering advancements in precision medicine.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12183">To CoT or not to CoT? Chain-of-thought helps mainly on math and symbolic reasoning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zayne Sprague, Fangcong Yin, Juan Diego Rodriguez, Dongwei Jiang, Manya Wadhwa, Prasann Singhal, Xinyu Zhao, Xi Ye, Kyle Mahowald, Greg Durrett</p>
<p>Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) via prompting is the de facto method for eliciting reasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs). But for what kinds of tasks is this extra ``thinking'' really helpful? To analyze this, we conducted a quantitative meta-analysis covering over 100 papers using CoT and ran our own evaluations of 20 datasets across 14 models. Our results show that CoT gives strong performance benefits primarily on tasks involving math or logic, with much smaller gains on other types of tasks. On MMLU, directly generating the answer without CoT leads to almost identical accuracy as CoT unless the question or model's response contains an equals sign, indicating symbolic operations and reasoning. Following this finding, we analyze the behavior of CoT on these problems by separating planning and execution and comparing against tool-augmented LLMs. Much of CoT's gain comes from improving symbolic execution, but it underperforms relative to using a symbolic solver. Our results indicate that CoT can be applied selectively, maintaining performance while saving inference costs. Furthermore, they suggest a need to move beyond prompt-based CoT to new paradigms that better leverage intermediate computation across the whole range of LLM applications.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13138">Learning to Compare Hardware Designs for High-Level Synthesis</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunsheng Bai, Atefeh Sohrabizadeh, Zijian Ding, Rongjian Liang, Weikai Li, Ding Wang, Haoxing Ren, Yizhou Sun, Jason Cong</p>
<p>Abstract: High-level synthesis (HLS) is an automated design process that transforms high-level code into hardware designs, enabling the rapid development of hardware accelerators. HLS relies on pragmas, which are directives inserted into the source code to guide the synthesis process, and pragmas have various settings and values that significantly impact the resulting hardware design. State-of-the-art ML-based HLS methods, such as HARP, first train a deep learning model, typically based on graph neural networks (GNNs) applied to graph-based representations of the source code and pragmas. They then perform design space exploration (DSE) to explore the pragma design space, rank candidate designs using the model, and return the top designs. However, traditional DSE methods face challenges due to the highly nonlinear relationship between pragma settings and performance metrics, along with complex interactions between pragmas that affect performance in non-obvious ways.
  To address these challenges, we propose compareXplore, a novel approach that learns to compare hardware designs for effective HLS optimization. CompareXplore introduces a hybrid loss function that combines pairwise preference learning with pointwise performance prediction, enabling the model to capture both relative preferences and absolute performance. Moreover, we introduce a novel node difference attention module that focuses on the most informative differences between designs, enabling the model to identify critical pragmas impacting performance. CompareXplore adopts a two-stage DSE, where a pointwise prediction model is used for the initial design pruning, followed by a pairwise comparison stage for precise performance verification. In extensive experiments, compareXplore achieves significant improvements in ranking metrics and generates high-quality HLS results for the selected designs, outperforming the existing SOTA method.</p>

<p>Abstract: Anomaly detection in multivariate time series is challenging as heterogeneous subsequence anomalies may occur. Reconstruction-based methods, which focus on learning normal patterns in the frequency domain to detect diverse abnormal subsequences, achieve promising results, while still falling short on capturing fine-grained frequency characteristics and channel correlations. To contend with the limitations, we introduce CATCH, a framework based on frequency patching. We propose to patchify the frequency domain into frequency bands, which enhances its ability to capture fine-grained frequency characteristics. To perceive appropriate channel correlations, we propose a Channel Fusion Module (CFM), which features a patch-wise mask generator and a masked-attention mechanism. Driven by a bi-level multi-objective optimization algorithm, the CFM is encouraged to iteratively discover appropriate patch-wise channel correlations, and to cluster relevant channels while isolating adverse effects from irrelevant channels. Extensive experiments on 10 real-world datasets and 12 synthetic datasets demonstrate that CATCH achieves state-of-the-art performance. We make our code and datasets available at https://github.com/decisionintelligence/CATCH.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) often struggle with culture-specific knowledge, particularly in languages other than English and in underrepresented cultural contexts. To evaluate their understanding of such knowledge, we introduce WorldCuisines, a massive-scale benchmark for multilingual and multicultural, visually grounded language understanding. This benchmark includes a visual question answering (VQA) dataset with text-image pairs across 30 languages and dialects, spanning 9 language families and featuring over 1 million data points, making it the largest multicultural VQA benchmark to date. It includes tasks for identifying dish names and their origins. We provide evaluation datasets in two sizes (12k and 60k instances) alongside a training dataset (1 million instances). Our findings show that while VLMs perform better with correct location context, they struggle with adversarial contexts and predicting specific regional cuisines and languages. To support future research, we release a knowledge base with annotated food entries and images along with the VQA data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed artificial intelligence by advancing natural language understanding and generation, enabling applications across fields beyond healthcare, software engineering, and conversational systems. Despite these advancements in the past few years, LLMs have shown considerable vulnerabilities, particularly to prompt injection and jailbreaking attacks. This review analyzes the state of research on these vulnerabilities and presents available defense strategies. We roughly categorize attack approaches into prompt-based, model-based, multimodal, and multilingual, covering techniques such as adversarial prompting, backdoor injections, and cross-modality exploits. We also review various defense mechanisms, including prompt filtering, transformation, alignment techniques, multi-agent defenses, and self-regulation, evaluating their strengths and shortcomings. We also discuss key metrics and benchmarks used to assess LLM safety and robustness, noting challenges like the quantification of attack success in interactive contexts and biases in existing datasets. Identifying current research gaps, we suggest future directions for resilient alignment strategies, advanced defenses against evolving attacks, automation of jailbreak detection, and consideration of ethical and societal impacts. This review emphasizes the need for continued research and cooperation within the AI community to enhance LLM security and ensure their safe deployment.</p>

This enables the model to focus more effectively on relevant content while reducing the influence of irrelevant information and generating accurate answers.

<p>Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become more prevalent, concerns about their safety, ethics, and potential biases have risen. Systematically evaluating LLMs' risk decision-making tendencies and attitudes, particularly in the ethical domain, has become crucial. This study innovatively applies the Domain-Specific Risk-Taking (DOSPERT) scale from cognitive science to LLMs and proposes a novel Ethical Decision-Making Risk Attitude Scale (EDRAS) to assess LLMs' ethical risk attitudes in depth. We further propose a novel approach integrating risk scales and role-playing to quantitatively evaluate systematic biases in LLMs. Through systematic evaluation and analysis of multiple mainstream LLMs, we assessed the "risk personalities" of LLMs across multiple domains, with a particular focus on the ethical domain, and revealed and quantified LLMs' systematic biases towards different groups. This research helps understand LLMs' risk decision-making and ensure their safe and reliable application. Our approach provides a tool for identifying and mitigating biases, contributing to fairer and more trustworthy AI systems. The code and data are available.</p>

Our method processes a floor map with additional features of the walls to generate indoor pathloss maps. We systematically evaluate the effects of architectural choices, data augmentation strategies, and feature engineering techniques. Our findings indicate that extensive augmentation significantly improves generalization, while feature engineering is crucial in low-data regimes.

<p>Abstract: Ensuring cultural values alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) remains a critical challenge, as these models often embed Western-centric biases from their training data, leading to misrepresentations and fairness concerns in cross-cultural applications. Existing approaches such as role assignment and few-shot learning struggle to address these limitations effectively due to their reliance on pre-trained knowledge, limited scalability, and inability to capture nuanced cultural values. To address these issues, we propose ValuesRAG, a novel and effective framework that applies Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with In-Context Learning (ICL) to integrate cultural and demographic knowledge dynamically during text generation. Leveraging the World Values Survey (WVS) dataset, ValuesRAG first generates summaries of values for each individual. We subsequently curate several representative regional datasets to serve as test datasets and retrieve relevant summaries of values based on demographic features, followed by a reranking step to select the top-k relevant summaries. We evaluate ValuesRAG using 6 diverse regional datasets and show that it consistently outperforms baselines: including zero-shot, role-assignment, few-shot, and hybrid methods, both in main experiments and ablation settings. Notably, ValuesRAG achieves the best overall performance over prior methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in fostering culturally aligned and inclusive AI systems. Our findings underscore the potential of dynamic retrieval-based methods to bridge the gap between global LLM capabilities and localized cultural values.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kayvon Mazooji, Ilan Shomorony</p>
<p>Abstract: Clustering is often a challenging problem because of the inherent ambiguity in what the "correct" clustering should be. Even when the number of clusters $K$ is known, this ambiguity often still exists, particularly when there is variation in density among different clusters, and clusters have multiple relatively separated regions of high density. In this paper we propose an information-theoretic characterization of when a $K$-clustering is ambiguous, and design an algorithm that recovers the clustering whenever it is unambiguous. This characterization formalizes the situation when two high density regions within a cluster are separable enough that they look more like two distinct clusters than two truly distinct clusters in the $K$-clustering. The algorithm first identifies $K$ partial clusters (or "seeds") using a density-based approach, and then adds unclustered points to the initial $K$ partial clusters in a greedy manner to form a complete clustering. We implement and test a version of the algorithm that is modified to effectively handle overlapping clusters, and observe that it requires little parameter selection and displays improved performance on many datasets compared to widely used algorithms for non-convex cluster recovery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vignav Ramesh, Kenneth Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Communication between multiple language model (LM) agents has been shown to scale up the reasoning ability of LMs. While natural language has been the dominant medium for inter-LM communication, it is not obvious this should be the standard: not only does natural language communication incur high inference costs that scale quickly with the number of both agents and messages, but also the decoding process abstracts away too much rich information that could be otherwise accessed from the internal activations. In this work, we propose a simple technique whereby LMs communicate via activations; concretely, we pause an LM $\textit{B}$'s computation at an intermediate layer, combine its current activation with another LM $\textit{A}$'s intermediate activation via some function $\textit{f}$, then pass $\textit{f}$'s output into the next layer of $\textit{B}$ and continue the forward pass till decoding is complete. This approach scales up LMs on new tasks with zero additional parameters and data, and saves a substantial amount of compute over natural language communication. We test our method with various functional forms $\textit{f}$ on two experimental setups--multi-player coordination games and reasoning benchmarks--and find that it achieves up to $27.0\%$ improvement over natural language communication across datasets with $<$$1/4$ the compute, illustrating the superiority and robustness of activations as an alternative "language" for communication between LMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rashid Mushkani, Hugo Berard, Allison Cohen, Shin Koeski</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a Right to AI, which asserts that individuals and communities should meaningfully participate in the development and governance of the AI systems that shape their lives. Motivated by the increasing deployment of AI in critical domains and inspired by Henri Lefebvre's concept of the Right to the City, we reconceptualize AI as a societal infrastructure, rather than merely a product of expert design. In this paper, we critically evaluate how generative agents, large-scale data extraction, and diverse cultural values bring new complexities to AI oversight. The paper proposes that grassroots participatory methodologies can mitigate biased outcomes and enhance social responsiveness. It asserts that data is socially produced and should be managed and owned collectively. Drawing on Sherry Arnstein's Ladder of Citizen Participation and analyzing nine case studies, the paper develops a four-tier model for the Right to AI that situates the current paradigm and envisions an aspirational future. It proposes recommendations for inclusive data ownership, transparent design processes, and stakeholder-driven oversight. We also discuss market-led and state-centric alternatives and argue that participatory approaches offer a better balance between technical efficiency and democratic legitimacy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaixi Bao, Chenhao Li, Yarden As, Andreas Krause, Marco Hutter</p>
<p>Abstract: Agents trained via reinforcement learning (RL) often struggle to perform well on tasks that differ from those encountered during training. This limitation presents a challenge to the broader deployment of RL in diverse and dynamic task settings. In this work, we introduce memory augmentation, a memory-based RL approach to improve task generalization. Our approach leverages task-structured augmentations to simulate plausible out-of-distribution scenarios and incorporates memory mechanisms to enable context-aware policy adaptation. Trained on a predefined set of tasks, our policy demonstrates the ability to generalize to unseen tasks through memory augmentation without requiring additional interactions with the environment. Through extensive simulation experiments and real-world hardware evaluations on legged locomotion tasks, we demonstrate that our approach achieves zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks while maintaining robust in-distribution performance and high sample efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elahe Salari, Zohreh Azimifar</p>
<p>Abstract: Texture synthesis is a fundamental task in computer vision, whose goal is to generate visually realistic and structurally coherent textures for a wide range of applications, from graphics to scientific simulations. While traditional methods like tiling and patch-based techniques often struggle with complex textures, recent advancements in deep learning have transformed this field. In this paper, we propose ViT-SGAN, a new hybrid model that fuses Vision Transformers (ViTs) with a Spatial Generative Adversarial Network (SGAN) to address the limitations of previous methods. By incorporating specialized texture descriptors such as mean-variance (mu, sigma) and textons into the self-attention mechanism of ViTs, our model achieves superior texture synthesis. This approach enhances the model's capacity to capture complex spatial dependencies, leading to improved texture quality that is superior to state-of-the-art models, especially for regular and irregular textures. Comparison experiments with metrics such as FID, IS, SSIM, and LPIPS demonstrate the substantial improvement of ViT-SGAN, which underlines its efficiency in generating diverse realistic textures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jocelyn Dzuong</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent surge in advanced generative models, such as diffusion models and generative adversarial networks (GANs), has led to an alarming rise in AI-generated images across various domains on the web. While such technologies offer benefits such as democratizing artistic creation, they also pose challenges in misinformation, digital forgery, and authenticity verification. Additionally, the uncredited use of AI-generated images in media and marketing has sparked significant backlash from online communities. In response to this, we introduce DejAIvu, a Chrome Web extension that combines real-time AI-generated image detection with saliency-based explainability while users browse the web. Using an ONNX-optimized deep learning model, DejAIvu automatically analyzes images on websites such as Google Images, identifies AI-generated content using model inference, and overlays a saliency heatmap to highlight AI-related artifacts. Our approach integrates efficient in-browser inference, gradient-based saliency analysis, and a seamless user experience, ensuring that AI detection is both transparent and interpretable. We also evaluate DejAIvu across multiple pretrained architectures and benchmark datasets, demonstrating high accuracy and low latency, making it a practical and deployable tool for enhancing AI image accountability.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenjing Zhang, Xuejiao Lei, Zhaoxiang Liu, Ning Wang, Zhenhong Long, Peijun Yang, Jiaojiao Zhao, Minjie Hua, Chaoyang Ma, Kai Wang, Shiguo Lian</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, the DeepSeek series of models, leveraging their exceptional reasoning capabilities and open-source strategy, is reshaping the global AI landscape. Despite these advantages, they exhibit significant safety deficiencies. Research conducted by Robust Intelligence, a subsidiary of Cisco, in collaboration with the University of Pennsylvania, revealed that DeepSeek-R1 has a 100\% attack success rate when processing harmful prompts. Additionally, multiple safety companies and research institutions have confirmed critical safety vulnerabilities in this model. As models demonstrating robust performance in Chinese and English, DeepSeek models require equally crucial safety assessments in both language contexts. However, current research has predominantly focused on safety evaluations in English environments, leaving a gap in comprehensive assessments of their safety performance in Chinese contexts. In response to this gap, this study introduces CHiSafetyBench, a Chinese-specific safety evaluation benchmark. This benchmark systematically evaluates the safety of DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-V3 in Chinese contexts, revealing their performance across safety categories. The experimental results quantify the deficiencies of these two models in Chinese contexts, providing key insights for subsequent improvements. It should be noted that, despite our efforts to establish a comprehensive, objective, and authoritative evaluation benchmark, the selection of test samples, characteristics of data distribution, and the setting of evaluation criteria may inevitably introduce certain biases into the evaluation results. We will continuously optimize the evaluation benchmark and periodically update this report to provide more comprehensive and accurate assessment outcomes. Please refer to the latest version of the paper for the most recent evaluation results and conclusions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weipeng Huang, Qin Li, Yang Xiao, Cheng Qiao, Tie Cai, Junwei Liang, Neil J. Hurley, Guangyuan Piao</p>
<p>Abstract: Noise in data appears to be inevitable in most real-world machine learning applications and would cause severe overfitting problems. Not only can data features contain noise, but labels are also prone to be noisy due to human input. In this paper, rather than noisy label learning in multiclass classifications, we instead focus on the less explored area of noisy label learning for multilabel classifications. Specifically, we investigate the post-correction of predictions generated from classifiers learned with noisy labels. The reasons are two-fold. Firstly, this approach can directly work with the trained models to save computational resources. Secondly, it could be applied on top of other noisy label correction techniques to achieve further improvements. To handle this problem, we appeal to deep generative approaches that are possible for uncertainty estimation. Our model posits that label noise arises from a stochastic shift in the latent variable, providing a more robust and beneficial means for noisy learning. We develop both unsupervised and semi-supervised learning methods for our model. The extensive empirical study presents solid evidence to that our approach is able to consistently improve the independent models and performs better than a number of existing methods across various noisy label settings. Moreover, a comprehensive empirical analysis of the proposed method is carried out to validate its robustness, including sensitivity analysis and an ablation study, among other elements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leonardo Berti, Gjergji Kasneci</p>
<p>Abstract: Price Trend Prediction (PTP) based on Limit Order Book (LOB) data is a fundamental challenge in financial markets. Despite advances in deep learning, existing models fail to generalize across different market conditions and assets. Surprisingly, by adapting a simple MLP-based architecture to LOB, we show that we surpass SoTA performance; thus, challenging the necessity of complex architectures. Unlike past work that shows robustness issues, we propose TLOB, a transformer-based model that uses a dual attention mechanism to capture spatial and temporal dependencies in LOB data. This allows it to adaptively focus on the market microstructure, making it particularly effective for longer-horizon predictions and volatile market conditions. We also introduce a new labeling method that improves on previous ones, removing the horizon bias. We evaluate TLOB's effectiveness across four horizons, using the established FI-2010 benchmark, a NASDAQ and a Bitcoin dataset. TLOB outperforms SoTA methods in every dataset and horizon. Additionally, we empirically show how stock price predictability has declined over time, -6.68 in F1-score, highlighting the growing market efficiency. Predictability must be considered in relation to transaction costs, so we experimented with defining trends using an average spread, reflecting the primary transaction cost. The resulting performance deterioration underscores the complexity of translating trend classification into profitable trading strategies. We argue that our work provides new insights into the evolving landscape of stock price trend prediction and sets a strong foundation for future advancements in financial AI. We release the code at https://github.com/LeonardoBerti00/TLOB.</p>

<p>Abstract: Stellar flare events are critical observational samples for astronomical research; however, recorded flare events remain limited. Stellar flare forecasting can provide additional flare event samples to support research efforts. Despite this potential, no specialized models for stellar flare forecasting have been proposed to date. In this paper, we present extensive experimental evidence demonstrating that both stellar physical properties and historical flare records are valuable inputs for flare forecasting tasks. We then introduce FLARE (Forecasting Light-curve-based Astronomical Records via features Ensemble), the first-of-its-kind large model specifically designed for stellar flare forecasting. FLARE integrates stellar physical properties and historical flare records through a novel Soft Prompt Module and Residual Record Fusion Module. Our experiments on the publicly available Kepler light curve dataset demonstrate that FLARE achieves superior performance compared to other methods across all evaluation metrics. Finally, we validate the forecast capability of our model through a comprehensive case study.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matthew Barker, Andrew Bell, Evan Thomas, James Carr, Thomas Andrews, Umang Bhatt</p>
<p>Abstract: While Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a popular technique for improving Large Language Model (LLM) systems, it introduces a large number of choices, parameters and hyperparameters that must be made or tuned. This includes the LLM, embedding, and ranker models themselves, as well as hyperparameters governing individual RAG components. Yet, collectively optimizing the entire configuration in a RAG or LLM system remains under-explored - especially in multi-objective settings - due to intractably large solution spaces, noisy objective evaluations, and the high cost of evaluations. In this work, we introduce the first approach for multi-objective parameter optimization of cost, latency, safety and alignment over entire LLM and RAG systems. We find that Bayesian optimization methods significantly outperform baseline approaches, obtaining a superior Pareto front on two new RAG benchmark tasks. We conclude our work with important considerations for practitioners who are designing multi-objective RAG systems, highlighting nuances such as how optimal configurations may not generalize across tasks and objectives.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rashid Mushkani, Shravan Nayak, Hugo Berard, Allison Cohen, Shin Koseki, Hadrien Bertrand</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce the Local Intersectional Visual Spaces (LIVS) dataset, a benchmark for multi-criteria alignment, developed through a two-year participatory process with 30 community organizations to support the pluralistic alignment of text-to-image (T2I) models in inclusive urban planning. The dataset encodes 37,710 pairwise comparisons across 13,462 images, structured along six criteria - Accessibility, Safety, Comfort, Invitingness, Inclusivity, and Diversity - derived from 634 community-defined concepts. Using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), we fine-tune Stable Diffusion XL to reflect multi-criteria spatial preferences and evaluate the LIVS dataset and the fine-tuned model through four case studies: (1) DPO increases alignment with annotated preferences, particularly when annotation volume is high; (2) preference patterns vary across participant identities, underscoring the need for intersectional data; (3) human-authored prompts generate more distinctive visual outputs than LLM-generated ones, influencing annotation decisiveness; and (4) intersectional groups assign systematically different ratings across criteria, revealing the limitations of single-objective alignment. While DPO improves alignment under specific conditions, the prevalence of neutral ratings indicates that community values are heterogeneous and often ambiguous. LIVS provides a benchmark for developing T2I models that incorporate local, stakeholder-driven preferences, offering a foundation for context-aware alignment in spatial design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Run He, Di Fang, Yicheng Xu, Yawen Cui, Ming Li, Cen Chen, Ziqian Zeng, Huiping Zhuang</p>
<p>Abstract: Exemplar-Free Class-Incremental Learning (EFCIL) aims to sequentially learn from distinct categories without retaining exemplars but easily suffers from catastrophic forgetting of learned knowledge. While existing EFCIL methods leverage knowledge distillation to alleviate forgetting, they still face two critical challenges: semantic shift and decision bias. Specifically, the embeddings of old tasks shift in the embedding space after learning new tasks, and the classifier becomes biased towards new tasks due to training solely with new data, thereby hindering the balance between old and new knowledge. To address these issues, we propose the Dual-Projection Shift Estimation and Classifier Reconstruction (DPCR) approach for EFCIL. DPCR effectively estimates semantic shift through a dual-projection, which combines a learnable transformation with a row-space projection to capture both task-wise and category-wise shifts. Furthermore, to mitigate decision bias, DPCR employs ridge regression to reformulate classifier training as a reconstruction process. This reconstruction exploits previous information encoded in covariance and prototype of each class after calibration with estimated shift, thereby reducing decision bias. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, across various datasets, DPCR effectively balances old and new tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art EFCIL methods.</p>

In this study, we systematically examine the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in managing tasks within Intelligent Outpatient Referral (IOR) systems and propose a comprehensive evaluation framework specifically designed for such systems. This framework comprises two core tasks: static evaluation, which focuses on evaluating the ability of predefined outpatient referrals, and dynamic evaluation, which evaluates capabilities of refining outpatient referral recommendations through iterative dialogues. Our findings suggest that LLMs offer limited advantages over BERT-like models, but show promise in asking effective questions during interactive dialogues.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rashid Mushkani, Hugo Berard, Shin Koseki</p>
<p>Abstract: Cities are not monolithic; they are arenas of negotiation among groups that hold varying needs, values, and experiences. Conventional methods of urban assessment -- from standardized surveys to AI-driven evaluations -- frequently rely on a single consensus metric (e.g., an average measure of inclusivity or safety). Although such aggregations simplify design decisions, they risk obscuring the distinct perspectives of marginalized populations. In this paper, we present findings from a community-centered study in Montreal involving 35 residents with diverse demographic and social identities, particularly wheelchair users, seniors, and LGBTQIA2+ individuals. Using rating and ranking tasks on 20 urban sites, we observe that disagreements are systematic rather than random, reflecting structural inequalities, differing cultural values, and personal experiences of safety and accessibility.
  Based on these empirical insights, we propose negotiative alignment, an AI framework that treats disagreement as an essential input to be preserved, analyzed, and addressed. Negotiative alignment builds on pluralistic models by dynamically updating stakeholder preferences through multi-agent negotiation mechanisms, ensuring no single perspective is marginalized. We outline how this framework can be integrated into urban analytics -- and other decision-making contexts -- to retain minority viewpoints, adapt to changing stakeholder concerns, and enhance fairness and accountability. The study demonstrates that preserving and engaging with disagreement, rather than striving for an artificial consensus, can produce more equitable and responsive AI-driven outcomes in urban design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Farnoush Bayatmakou, Reza Taleei, Milad Amir Toutounchian, Arash Mohammadi</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite advancements in Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems, breast cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths among women worldwide. Recent breakthroughs in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have shown significant promise in development of advanced Deep Learning (DL) architectures for breast cancer diagnosis through mammography. In this context, the paper focuses on the integration of AI within a Human-Centric workflow to enhance breast cancer diagnostics. Key challenges are, however, largely overlooked such as reliance on detailed tumor annotations and susceptibility to missing views, particularly during test time. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid, multi-scale and multi-view Swin Transformer-based framework (MSMV-Swin) that enhances diagnostic robustness and accuracy. The proposed MSMV-Swin framework is designed to work as a decision-support tool, helping radiologists analyze multi-view mammograms more effectively. More specifically, the MSMV-Swin framework leverages the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to isolate the breast lobe, reducing background noise and enabling comprehensive feature extraction. The multi-scale nature of the proposed MSMV-Swin framework accounts for tumor-specific regions as well as the spatial characteristics of tissues surrounding the tumor, capturing both localized and contextual information. The integration of contextual and localized data ensures that MSMV-Swin's outputs align with the way radiologists interpret mammograms, fostering better human-AI interaction and trust. A hybrid fusion structure is then designed to ensure robustness against missing views, a common occurrence in clinical practice when only a single mammogram view is available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuting Guo, Abeed Sarker</p>
<p>Abstract: The application of large language models (LLMs) to healthcare information extraction has emerged as a promising approach. This study evaluates the classification performance of five open-source LLMs: GEMMA-3-27B-IT, LLAMA3-70B, LLAMA4-109B, DEEPSEEK-R1-DISTILL-LLAMA-70B, and DEEPSEEK-V3-0324-UD-Q2_K_XL, across six healthcare-related classification tasks involving both social media data (breast cancer, changes in medication regimen, adverse pregnancy outcomes, potential COVID-19 cases) and clinical data (stigma labeling, medication change discussion). We report precision, recall, and F1 scores with 95% confidence intervals for all model-task combinations. Our findings reveal significant performance variability between LLMs, with DeepSeekV3 emerging as the strongest overall performer, achieving the highest F1 scores in four tasks. Notably, models generally performed better on social media tasks compared to clinical data tasks, suggesting potential domain-specific challenges. GEMMA-3-27B-IT demonstrated exceptionally high recall despite its smaller parameter count, while LLAMA4-109B showed surprisingly underwhelming performance compared to its predecessor LLAMA3-70B, indicating that larger parameter counts do not guarantee improved classification results. We observed distinct precision-recall trade-offs across models, with some favoring sensitivity over specificity and vice versa. These findings highlight the importance of task-specific model selection for healthcare applications, considering the particular data domain and precision-recall requirements rather than model size alone.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuheng Ding, Yusong Wang, Bo Qiang, Jie Yu, Qi Li, Yiran Zhou, Zhenmin Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Natural products, as metabolites from microorganisms, animals, or plants, exhibit diverse biological activities, making them crucial for drug discovery. Nowadays, existing deep learning methods for natural products research primarily rely on supervised learning approaches designed for specific downstream tasks. However, such one-model-for-a-task paradigm often lacks generalizability and leaves significant room for performance improvement. Additionally, existing molecular characterization methods are not well-suited for the unique tasks associated with natural products. To address these limitations, we have pre-trained a foundation model for natural products based on their unique properties. Our approach employs a novel pretraining strategy that is especially tailored to natural products. By incorporating contrastive learning and masked graph learning objectives, we emphasize evolutional information from molecular scaffolds while capturing side-chain information. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in various downstream tasks related to natural product mining and drug discovery. We first compare taxonomy classification with synthesized molecule-focused baselines to demonstrate that current models are inadequate for understanding natural synthesis. Furthermore, by diving into a fine-grained analysis at both the gene and microbial levels, NaFM demonstrates the ability to capture evolutionary information. Eventually, our method is experimented with virtual screening, illustrating informative natural product representations that can lead to more effective identification of potential drug candidates.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Erhan Karakoca, H\"useyin \c{C}evik, \.Ibrahim H\"okelek, Ali G\"or\c{c}in</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural receivers have recently become a popular topic, where the received signals can be directly decoded by data driven mechanisms such as machine learning and deep learning. In this paper, we propose two novel neural network based orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) receivers performing channel estimation and equalization tasks and directly predicting log likelihood ratios (LLRs) from the received in phase and quadrature phase (IQ) signals. The first network, the Dual Attention Transformer (DAT), employs a state of the art (SOTA) transformer architecture with an attention mechanism. The second network, the Residual Dual Non Local Attention Network (RDNLA), utilizes a parallel residual architecture with a non local attention block. The bit error rate (BER) and block error rate (BLER) performance of various SOTA neural receiver architectures is compared with our proposed methods across different signal to noise ratio (SNR) levels. The simulation results show that DAT and RDNLA outperform both traditional communication systems and existing neural receiver models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peiding Wang, Li Zhang, Fang Liu, Lin Shi, Minxiao Li, Bo Shen, An Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in code generation tasks and have become indispensable programming assistants for developers. However, existing code generation benchmarks primarily assess the functional correctness of code generated by LLMs in single-turn interactions, offering limited insight into their capabilities to generate code that strictly follows users' instructions, especially in multi-turn interaction scenarios. In this paper, we introduce CodeIF-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' instruction-following capabilities in interactive code generation. Specifically, CodeIF-Bench incorporates nine types of verifiable instructions aligned with the real-world software development requirements, which can be independently and objectively validated through specified test cases, facilitating the evaluation of instruction-following capability in multi-turn interactions. We evaluate nine prominent LLMs using CodeIF-Bench, and the experimental results reveal a significant disparity between their basic programming capability and instruction-following capability, particularly as task complexity, context length, and the number of dialogue rounds increase.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jakob Schoeffer, Maria De-Arteaga, Jonathan Elmer</p>
<p>Abstract: The design of AI systems to assist human decision-making typically requires the availability of labels to train and evaluate supervised models. Frequently, however, these labels are unknown, and different ways of estimating them involve unverifiable assumptions or arbitrary choices. In this work, we introduce the concept of label indeterminacy and derive important implications in high-stakes AI-assisted decision-making. We present an empirical study in a healthcare context, focusing specifically on predicting the recovery of comatose patients after resuscitation from cardiac arrest. Our study shows that label indeterminacy can result in models that perform similarly when evaluated on patients with known labels, but vary drastically in their predictions for patients where labels are unknown. After demonstrating crucial ethical implications of label indeterminacy in this high-stakes context, we discuss takeaways for evaluation, reporting, and design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sebasti\'an Barbas Laina, Simon Boche, Sotiris Papatheodorou, Simon Schaefer, Jaehyung Jung, Stefan Leutenegger</p>
<p>Abstract: Geometrically accurate and semantically expressive map representations have proven invaluable to facilitate robust and safe mobile robot navigation and task planning. Nevertheless, real-time, open-vocabulary semantic understanding of large-scale unknown environments is still an open problem. In this paper we present FindAnything, an open-world mapping and exploration framework that incorporates vision-language information into dense volumetric submaps. Thanks to the use of vision-language features, FindAnything bridges the gap between pure geometric and open-vocabulary semantic information for a higher level of understanding while allowing to explore any environment without the help of any external source of ground-truth pose information. We represent the environment as a series of volumetric occupancy submaps, resulting in a robust and accurate map representation that deforms upon pose updates when the underlying SLAM system corrects its drift, allowing for a locally consistent representation between submaps. Pixel-wise vision-language features are aggregated from efficient SAM (eSAM)-generated segments, which are in turn integrated into object-centric volumetric submaps, providing a mapping from open-vocabulary queries to 3D geometry that is scalable also in terms of memory usage. The open-vocabulary map representation of FindAnything achieves state-of-the-art semantic accuracy in closed-set evaluations on the Replica dataset. This level of scene understanding allows a robot to explore environments based on objects or areas of interest selected via natural language queries. Our system is the first of its kind to be deployed on resource-constrained devices, such as MAVs, leveraging vision-language information for real-world robotic tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haozhe Wang, Chao Qu, Zuming Huang, Wei Chu, Fangzhen Lin, Wenhu Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, slow-thinking systems like GPT-o1 and DeepSeek-R1 have demonstrated great potential in solving challenging problems through explicit reflection. They significantly outperform the best fast-thinking models, such as GPT-4o, on various math and science benchmarks. However, their multimodal reasoning capabilities remain on par with fast-thinking models. For instance, GPT-o1's performance on benchmarks like MathVista, MathVerse, and MathVision is similar to fast-thinking models. In this paper, we aim to enhance the slow-thinking capabilities of vision-language models using reinforcement learning (without relying on distillation) to advance the state of the art. First, we adapt the GRPO algorithm with a novel technique called Selective Sample Replay (SSR) to address the vanishing advantages problem. While this approach yields strong performance, the resulting RL-trained models exhibit limited self-reflection or self-verification. To further encourage slow-thinking, we introduce Forced Rethinking, which appends a rethinking trigger token to the end of rollouts in RL training, explicitly enforcing a self-reflection reasoning step. By combining these two techniques, our model, VL-Rethinker, advances state-of-the-art scores on MathVista, MathVerse to achieve 80.4%, 63.5% respectively. VL-Rethinker also achieves open-source SoTA on multi-disciplinary benchmarks such as MathVision, MMMU-Pro, EMMA, and MEGA-Bench, narrowing the gap with OpenAI-o1. Our empirical results show the effectiveness of our approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dohyeon Lee, Jun-Gill Kang, Soohee Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Drones, like most airborne aerial vehicles, face inherent disadvantages in achieving agile flight due to their limited thrust capabilities. These physical constraints cannot be fully addressed through advancements in control algorithms alone. Drawing inspiration from the winged flying squirrel, this paper proposes a highly maneuverable drone equipped with agility-enhancing foldable wings. By leveraging collaborative control between the conventional propeller system and the foldable wings-coordinated through the Thrust-Wing Coordination Control (TWCC) framework-the controllable acceleration set is expanded, enabling the generation of abrupt vertical forces that are unachievable with traditional wingless drones. The complex aerodynamics of the foldable wings are modeled using a physics-assisted recurrent neural network (paRNN), which calibrates the angle of attack (AOA) to align with the real aerodynamic behavior of the wings. The additional air resistance generated by appropriately deploying these wings significantly improves the tracking performance of the proposed "flying squirrel" drone. The model is trained on real flight data and incorporates flat-plate aerodynamic principles. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed flying squirrel drone achieves a 13.1% improvement in tracking performance, as measured by root mean square error (RMSE), compared to a conventional wingless drone.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jo-Ku Cheng, Zeren Zhang, Ran Chen, Jingyang Deng, Ziran Qin, Jinwen Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose GeoUni, the first unified geometry expert model capable of generating problem solutions and diagrams within a single framework in a way that enables the creation of unique and individualized geometry problems. Traditionally, solving geometry problems and generating diagrams have been treated as separate tasks in machine learning, with no models successfully integrating both to support problem creation. However, we believe that mastery in geometry requires frictionless integration of all of these skills, from solving problems to visualizing geometric relationships, and finally, crafting tailored problems. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that GeoUni, with only 1.5B parameters, achieves performance comparable to larger models such as DeepSeek-R1 with 671B parameters in geometric reasoning tasks. GeoUni also excels in generating precise geometric diagrams, surpassing both text-to-image models and unified models, including the GPT-4o image generation. Most importantly, GeoUni is the only model capable of successfully generating textual problems with matching diagrams based on specific knowledge points, thus offering a wider range of capabilities that extend beyond current models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Magnus Petersen, Roberto Covino</p>
<p>Abstract: Characterizing conformational transitions in physical systems remains a fundamental challenge in the computational sciences. Traditional sampling methods like molecular dynamics (MD) or MCMC often struggle with the high-dimensional nature of molecular systems and the high energy barriers of transitions between stable states. While these transitions are rare events in simulation timescales, they often represent the most biologically significant processes - for example, the conformational change of an ion channel protein from its closed to open state, which controls cellular ion flow and is crucial for neural signaling. Such transitions in real systems may take milliseconds to seconds but could require months or years of continuous simulation to observe even once. We present a method that reformulates transition path generation as a continuous optimization problem solved through physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) inspired by string methods for minimum-energy path (MEP) generation. By representing transition paths as implicit neural functions and leveraging automatic differentiation with differentiable molecular dynamics force fields, our method enables the efficient discovery of physically realistic transition pathways without requiring expensive path sampling. We demonstrate our method's effectiveness on two proteins, including an explicitly hydrated bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) system with over 8,300 atoms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hong Zhang, Zhongjie Duan, Xingjun Wang, Yuze Zhao, Weiyi Lu, Zhipeng Di, Yixuan Xu, Yingda Chen, Yu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Unified multimodal large language models (MLLMs) aim to integrate multimodal understanding and generation abilities through a single framework. Despite their versatility, existing open-source unified models exhibit performance gaps against domain-specific architectures. To bridge this gap, we present Nexus-Gen, a unified model that synergizes the language reasoning capabilities of LLMs with the image synthesis power of diffusion models. To align the embedding space of the LLM and diffusion model, we conduct a dual-phase alignment training process. (1) The autoregressive LLM learns to predict image embeddings conditioned on multimodal inputs, while (2) the vision decoder is trained to reconstruct high-fidelity images from these embeddings. During training the LLM, we identified a critical discrepancy between the autoregressive paradigm's training and inference phases, where error accumulation in continuous embedding space severely degrades generation quality. To avoid this issue, we introduce a prefilled autoregression strategy that prefills input sequence with position-embedded special tokens instead of continuous embeddings. Through dual-phase training, Nexus-Gen has developed the integrated capability to comprehensively address the image understanding, generation and editing tasks. All models, datasets, and codes are published at https://github.com/modelscope/Nexus-Gen.git to facilitate further advancements across the field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenkai Zhang, Yiming Lei, Zeming Liu, Haitao Leng, Shaoguo Liu, Tingting Gao, Qingjie Liu, Yunhong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid development of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), an increasing number of benchmarks have been established to evaluate the video understanding capabilities of these models. However, these benchmarks focus on standalone videos and mainly assess "visual elements" like human actions and object states. In reality, contemporary videos often encompass complex and continuous narratives, typically presented as a series. To address this challenge, we propose SeriesBench, a benchmark consisting of 105 carefully curated narrative-driven series, covering 28 specialized tasks that require deep narrative understanding. Specifically, we first select a diverse set of drama series spanning various genres. Then, we introduce a novel long-span narrative annotation method, combined with a full-information transformation approach to convert manual annotations into diverse task formats. To further enhance model capacity for detailed analysis of plot structures and character relationships within series, we propose a novel narrative reasoning framework, PC-DCoT. Extensive results on SeriesBench indicate that existing MLLMs still face significant challenges in understanding narrative-driven series, while PC-DCoT enables these MLLMs to achieve performance improvements. Overall, our SeriesBench and PC-DCoT highlight the critical necessity of advancing model capabilities to understand narrative-driven series, guiding the future development of MLLMs. SeriesBench is publicly available at https://github.com/zackhxn/SeriesBench-CVPR2025.</p>

<p>Abstract: Effective data visualization requires not only technical proficiency but also a deep understanding of the domain-specific context in which data exists. This context often includes tacit knowledge about data provenance, quality, and intended use, which is rarely explicit in the dataset itself. We present the Data Therapist, a web-based tool that helps domain experts externalize this implicit knowledge through a mixed-initiative process combining iterative Q&A with interactive annotation. Powered by a large language model, the system analyzes user-supplied datasets, prompts users with targeted questions, and allows annotation at varying levels of granularity. The resulting structured knowledge base can inform both human and automated visualization design. We evaluated the tool in a qualitative study involving expert pairs from Molecular Biology, Accounting, Political Science, and Usable Security. The study revealed recurring patterns in how experts reason about their data and highlights areas where AI support can improve visualization design.</p>

Arguments and counter-arguments have been proposed based upon thought experiments, anecdotal conversations between LLMs and humans, statistical linguistic analysis, philosophical considerations, and more. In this brief paper we present a counter-argument based upon a thought experiment and semi-formal considerations leading to an inherent ambiguity barrier which prevents LLMs from having any understanding of what their amazingly fluent dialogues mean.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ji\v{r}\'i Mili\v{c}ka, Anna Marklov\'a, Ond\v{r}ej Drobil, Eva Posp\'i\v{s}ilov\'a</p>
<p>Abstract: This study investigates whether individuals can learn to accurately discriminate between human-written and AI-produced texts when provided with immediate feedback, and if they can use this feedback to recalibrate their self-perceived competence. We also explore the specific criteria individuals rely upon when making these decisions, focusing on textual style and perceived readability.
  We used GPT-4o to generate several hundred texts across various genres and text types comparable to Koditex, a multi-register corpus of human-written texts. We then presented randomized text pairs to 254 Czech native speakers who identified which text was human-written and which was AI-generated. Participants were randomly assigned to two conditions: one receiving immediate feedback after each trial, the other receiving no feedback until experiment completion. We recorded accuracy in identification, confidence levels, response times, and judgments about text readability along with demographic data and participants' engagement with AI technologies prior to the experiment.
  Participants receiving immediate feedback showed significant improvement in accuracy and confidence calibration. Participants initially held incorrect assumptions about AI-generated text features, including expectations about stylistic rigidity and readability. Notably, without feedback, participants made the most errors precisely when feeling most confident -- an issue largely resolved among the feedback group.
  The ability to differentiate between human and AI-generated texts can be effectively learned through targeted training with explicit feedback, which helps correct misconceptions about AI stylistic features and readability, as well as potential other variables that were not explored, while facilitating more accurate self-assessment. This finding might be particularly important in educational contexts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunfeng Ge, Jiawei Li, Yiji Zhao, Haomin Wen, Zhao Li, Meikang Qiu, Hongyan Li, Ming Jin, Shirui Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-Time Series generation holds significant potential to address challenges such as data sparsity, imbalance, and limited availability of multimodal time series datasets across domains. While diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in Text-to-X (e.g., vision and audio data) generation, their use in time series generation remains in its nascent stages. Existing approaches face two critical limitations: (1) the lack of systematic exploration of general-proposed time series captions, which are often domain-specific and struggle with generalization; and (2) the inability to generate time series of arbitrary lengths, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios. In this work, we first categorize time series captions into three levels: point-level, fragment-level, and instance-level. Additionally, we introduce a new fragment-level dataset containing over 600,000 high-resolution time series-text pairs. Second, we propose Text-to-Series (T2S), a diffusion-based framework that bridges the gap between natural language and time series in a domain-agnostic manner. T2S employs a length-adaptive variational autoencoder to encode time series of varying lengths into consistent latent embeddings. On top of that, T2S effectively aligns textual representations with latent embeddings by utilizing Flow Matching and employing Diffusion Transformer as the denoiser. We train T2S in an interleaved paradigm across multiple lengths, allowing it to generate sequences of any desired length. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that T2S achieves state-of-the-art performance across 13 datasets spanning 12 domains.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present Rapid Attention Distillation to Linear Attention Decoders at Scale (RADLADS), a protocol for rapidly converting softmax attention transformers into linear attention decoder models, along with two new RWKV-variant architectures, and models converted from popular Qwen2.5 open source models in 7B, 32B, and 72B sizes. Our conversion process requires only 350-700M tokens, less than 0.005% of the token count used to train the original teacher models. Converting to our 72B linear attention model costs less than \$2,000 USD at today's prices, yet quality at inference remains close to the original transformer. These models achieve state-of-the-art downstream performance across a set of standard benchmarks for linear attention models of their size. We release all our models on HuggingFace under the Apache 2.0 license, with the exception of our 72B models which are also governed by the Qwen License Agreement.

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03149">Motion-compensated cardiac MRI using low-rank diffeomorphic flow (DMoCo)</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Joseph Kettelkamp, Ludovica Romanin, Sarv Priya, Mathews Jacob</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce an unsupervised motion-compensated image reconstruction algorithm for free-breathing and ungated 3D cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We express the image volume corresponding to each specific motion phase as the deformation of a single static image template. The main contribution of the work is the low-rank model for the compact joint representation of the family of diffeomorphisms, parameterized by the motion phases. The diffeomorphism at a specific motion phase is obtained by integrating a parametric velocity field along a path connecting the reference template phase to the motion phase. The velocity field at different phases is represented using a low-rank model. The static template and the low-rank motion model parameters are learned directly from the k-space data in an unsupervised fashion. The more constrained motion model is observed to offer improved recovery compared to current motion-resolved and motion-compensated algorithms for free-breathing 3D cine MRI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Parv Kapoor, Ian Higgins, Nikhil Keetha, Jay Patrikar, Brady Moon, Zelin Ye, Yao He, Ivan Cisneros, Yaoyu Hu, Changliu Liu, Eunsuk Kang, Sebastian Scherer</p>
<p>Abstract: Assured safe-separation is essential for achieving seamless high-density operation of airborne vehicles in a shared airspace. To equip resource-constrained aerial systems with this safety-critical capability, we present ViSafe, a high-speed vision-only airborne collision avoidance system. ViSafe offers a full-stack solution to the Detect and Avoid (DAA) problem by tightly integrating a learning-based edge-AI framework with a custom multi-camera hardware prototype designed under SWaP-C constraints. By leveraging perceptual input-focused control barrier functions (CBF) to design, encode, and enforce safety thresholds, ViSafe can provide provably safe runtime guarantees for self-separation in high-speed aerial operations. We evaluate ViSafe's performance through an extensive test campaign involving both simulated digital twins and real-world flight scenarios. By independently varying agent types, closure rates, interaction geometries, and environmental conditions (e.g., weather and lighting), we demonstrate that ViSafe consistently ensures self-separation across diverse scenarios. In first-of-its-kind real-world high-speed collision avoidance tests with closure rates reaching 144 km/h, ViSafe sets a new benchmark for vision-only autonomous collision avoidance, establishing a new standard for safety in high-speed aerial navigation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinhai Hu, Wang Ling Goh, Yuan Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are transforming analog circuit design by automating device-level tuning and enabling system-level co-optimization. This paper integrates two approaches: (1) AI-assisted transistor sizing using Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization (MOBO) for direct circuit parameter optimization, demonstrated on a linearly tunable transconductor; and (2) AI-integrated circuit transfer function modeling for system-level optimization in a keyword spotting (KWS) application, demonstrated by optimizing an analog bandpass filter within a machine learning training loop. The combined insights highlight how AI can improve analog performance, reduce design iteration effort, and jointly optimize analog components and application-level metrics.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03838">IntelliCardiac: An Intelligent Platform for Cardiac Image Segmentation and Classification</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ting Yu Tsai, An Yu, Meghana Spurthi Maadugundu, Ishrat Jahan Mohima, Umme Habiba Barsha, Mei-Hwa F. Chen, Balakrishnan Prabhakaran, Ming-Ching Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: Precise and effective processing of cardiac imaging data is critical for the identification and management of the cardiovascular diseases. We introduce IntelliCardiac, a comprehensive, web-based medical image processing platform for the automatic segmentation of 4D cardiac images and disease classification, utilizing an AI model trained on the publicly accessible ACDC dataset. The system, intended for patients, cardiologists, and healthcare professionals, offers an intuitive interface and uses deep learning models to identify essential heart structures and categorize cardiac diseases. The system supports analysis of both the right and left ventricles as well as myocardium, and then classifies patient's cardiac images into five diagnostic categories: dilated cardiomyopathy, myocardial infarction, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, right ventricular abnormality, and no disease. IntelliCardiac combines a deep learning-based segmentation model with a two-step classification pipeline. The segmentation module gains an overall accuracy of 92.6%. The classification module, trained on characteristics taken from segmented heart structures, achieves 98% accuracy in five categories. These results exceed the performance of the existing state-of-the-art methods that integrate both segmentation and classification models. IntelliCardiac, which supports real-time visualization, workflow integration, and AI-assisted diagnostics, has great potential as a scalable, accurate tool for clinical decision assistance in cardiac imaging and diagnosis.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04165">TS-SNN: Temporal Shift Module for Spiking Neural Networks</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Kairong Yu, Tianqing Zhang, Qi Xu, Gang Pan, Hongwei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are increasingly recognized for their biological plausibility and energy efficiency, positioning them as strong alternatives to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in neuromorphic computing applications. SNNs inherently process temporal information by leveraging the precise timing of spikes, but balancing temporal feature utilization with low energy consumption remains a challenge. In this work, we introduce Temporal Shift module for Spiking Neural Networks (TS-SNN), which incorporates a novel Temporal Shift (TS) module to integrate past, present, and future spike features within a single timestep via a simple yet effective shift operation. A residual combination method prevents information loss by integrating shifted and original features. The TS module is lightweight, requiring only one additional learnable parameter, and can be seamlessly integrated into existing architectures with minimal additional computational cost. TS-SNN achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like CIFAR-10 (96.72\%), CIFAR-100 (80.28\%), and ImageNet (70.61\%) with fewer timesteps, while maintaining low energy consumption. This work marks a significant step forward in developing efficient and accurate SNN architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aditi Ramaswamy, Hana Chockler, Melane Navaratnarajah</p>
<p>Abstract: Creativity of generative AI models has been a subject of scientific debate in the last years, without a conclusive answer. In this paper, we study creativity from a practical perspective and introduce quantitative measures that help the user to choose a suitable AI model for a given task. We evaluated our measures on a number of popular image-to-image generation models, and the results of this suggest that our measures conform to human intuition.</p>
