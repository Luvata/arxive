<p><b>Authors:</b> Changkun Liu, Shuai Chen, Yash Bhalgat, Siyan Hu, Zirui Wang, Ming Cheng, Victor Adrian Prisacariu, Tristan Braud</p>
<p>Abstract: We leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as a scene representation and propose a novel test-time camera pose refinement framework, GSLoc. This framework enhances the localization accuracy of state-of-the-art absolute pose regression and scene coordinate regression methods. The 3DGS model renders high-quality synthetic images and depth maps to facilitate the establishment of 2D-3D correspondences. GSLoc obviates the need for training feature extractors or descriptors by operating directly on RGB images, utilizing the 3D vision foundation model, MASt3R, for precise 2D matching. To improve the robustness of our model in challenging outdoor environments, we incorporate an exposure-adaptive module within the 3DGS framework. Consequently, GSLoc enables efficient pose refinement given a single RGB query and a coarse initial pose estimation. Our proposed approach surpasses leading NeRF-based optimization methods in both accuracy and runtime across indoor and outdoor visual localization benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on two indoor datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Javid Akhavan, Chaitanya Krishna Vallabh, Xianyun Zhao, Souran Manoochehri</p>
<p>Abstract: In metal Additive Manufacturing (AM), monitoring the temperature of the Melt Pool (MP) is crucial for ensuring part quality, process stability, defect prevention, and overall process optimization. Traditional methods, are slow to converge and require extensive manual effort to translate data into actionable insights, rendering them impractical for real-time monitoring and control. To address this challenge, we propose an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based solution aimed at reducing manual data processing reliance and improving the efficiency of transitioning from data to insight. In our study, we utilize a dataset comprising dual-wavelength real-time process monitoring data and corresponding temperature maps. We introduce a deep learning model called the "Binocular model," which exploits dual input observations to perform a precise analysis of MP temperature in Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF). Through advanced deep learning techniques, we seamlessly convert raw data into temperature maps, significantly streamlining the process and enabling batch processing at a rate of up to 750 frames per second, approximately 1000 times faster than conventional methods. Our Binocular model achieves high accuracy in temperature estimation, evidenced by a 0.95 R-squared score, while simultaneously enhancing processing efficiency by a factor of $\sim1000x$ times. This model directly addresses the challenge of real-time MP temperature monitoring and offers insights into the encountered constraints and the benefits of our Deep Learning-based approach. By combining efficiency and precision, our work contributes to the advancement of temperature monitoring in L-PBF, thus driving progress in the field of metal AM.</p>

Kirschke</p>
<p>Abstract: Stroke remains a leading cause of global morbidity and mortality, placing a heavy socioeconomic burden. Over the past decade, advances in endovascular reperfusion therapy and the use of CT and MRI imaging for treatment guidance have significantly improved patient outcomes and are now standard in clinical practice. To develop machine learning algorithms that can extract meaningful and reproducible models of brain function for both clinical and research purposes from stroke images - particularly for lesion identification, brain health quantification, and prognosis - large, diverse, and well-annotated public datasets are essential. While only a few datasets with (sub-)acute stroke data were previously available, several large, high-quality datasets have recently been made publicly accessible. However, these existing datasets include only MRI data. In contrast, our dataset is the first to offer comprehensive longitudinal stroke data, including acute CT imaging with angiography and perfusion, follow-up MRI at 2-9 days, as well as acute and longitudinal clinical data up to a three-month outcome. The dataset includes a training dataset of n = 150 and a test dataset of n = 100 scans. Training data is publicly available, while test data will be used exclusively for model validation. We are making this dataset available as part of the 2024 edition of the Ischemic Stroke Lesion Segmentation (ISLES) challenge (https://www.isles-challenge.org/), which continuously aims to establish benchmark methods for acute and sub-acute ischemic stroke lesion segmentation, aiding in creating open stroke imaging datasets and evaluating cutting-edge image processing algorithms.</p>

<p>Abstract: Defining script types and establishing classification criteria for medieval handwriting is a central aspect of palaeographical analysis. However, existing typologies often encounter methodological challenges, such as descriptive limitations and subjective criteria. We propose an interpretable deep learning-based approach to morphological script type analysis, which enables systematic and objective analysis and contributes to bridging the gap between qualitative observations and quantitative measurements. More precisely, we adapt a deep instance segmentation method to learn comparable character prototypes, representative of letter morphology, and provide qualitative and quantitative tools for their comparison and analysis. We demonstrate our approach by applying it to the Textualis Formata script type and its two subtypes formalized by A. Derolez: Northern and Southern Textualis</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Josh Goldman, John K. Tsotsos</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved impressive performance on many computer vision benchmarks in recent years. However, can we be confident that impressive performance on benchmarks will translate to strong performance in real-world environments? Many environments in the real world are safety critical, and even slight model failures can be catastrophic. Therefore, it is crucial to test models rigorously before deployment. We argue, through both statistical theory and empirical evidence, that selecting representative image datasets for testing a model is likely implausible in many domains. Furthermore, performance statistics calculated with non-representative image datasets are highly unreliable. As a consequence, we cannot guarantee that models which perform well on withheld test images will also perform well in the real world. Creating larger and larger datasets will not help, and bias aware datasets cannot solve this problem either. Ultimately, there is little statistical foundation for evaluating models using withheld test sets. We recommend that future evaluation methodologies focus on assessing a model's decision-making process, rather than metrics such as accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anh-Dung Dinh, Daochang Liu, Chang Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Enforcing guidance throughout the entire sampling process often proves counterproductive due to the model-fitting issue., where samples are generated to match the classifier's parameters rather than generalizing the expected condition. This work identifies and quantifies the problem, demonstrating that reducing or excluding guidance at numerous timesteps can mitigate this issue. By distributing the guidance densely in the early stages of the process, we observe a significant improvement in image quality and diversity while also reducing the required guidance timesteps by nearly 40%. This approach addresses a major challenge in applying guidance effectively to generative tasks. Consequently, our proposed method, termed Compress Guidance, allows for the exclusion of a substantial number of guidance timesteps while still surpassing baseline models in image quality. We validate our approach through benchmarks on label conditional and text-to-image generative tasks across various datasets and models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zi-Xiang Xia, Sudeep Fadadu, Yi Shi, Louis Foucard</p>
<p>Abstract: Advances in machine learning algorithms for sensor fusion have significantly improved the detection and prediction of other road users, thereby enhancing safety. However, even a small angular displacement in the sensor's placement can cause significant degradation in output, especially at long range. In this paper, we demonstrate a simple yet generic and efficient multi-task learning approach that not only detects misalignment between different sensor modalities but is also robust against them for long-range perception. Along with the amount of misalignment, our method also predicts calibrated uncertainty, which can be useful for filtering and fusing predicted misalignment values over time. In addition, we show that the predicted misalignment parameters can be used for self-correcting input sensor data, further improving the perception performance under sensor misalignment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sanjay Bhargav Dharavath, Tanmoy Dam, Supriyo Chakraborty, Prithwiraj Roy, Aniruddha Maiti</p>
<p>Abstract: The field of autonomous vehicles (AVs) predominantly leverages multi-modal integration of LiDAR and camera data to achieve better performance compared to using a single modality. However, the fusion process encounters challenges in detecting distant objects due to the disparity between the high resolution of cameras and the sparse data from LiDAR. Insufficient integration of global perspectives with local-level details results in sub-optimal fusion performance.To address this issue, we have developed an innovative two-stage fusion process called Quantum Inverse Contextual Vision Transformers (Q-ICVT). This approach leverages adiabatic computing in quantum concepts to create a novel reversible vision transformer known as the Global Adiabatic Transformer (GAT). GAT aggregates sparse LiDAR features with semantic features in dense images for cross-modal integration in a global form. Additionally, the Sparse Expert of Local Fusion (SELF) module maps the sparse LiDAR 3D proposals and encodes position information of the raw point cloud onto the dense camera feature space using a gating point fusion approach. Our experiments show that Q-ICVT achieves an mAPH of 82.54 for L2 difficulties on the Waymo dataset, improving by 1.88% over current state-of-the-art fusion methods. We also analyze GAT and SELF in ablation studies to highlight the impact of Q-ICVT. Our code is available at https://github.com/sanjay-810/Qicvt Q-ICVT</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alex N. Wang, Christopher Hoang, Yuwen Xiong, Yann LeCun, Mengye Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning has driven significant progress in learning from single-subject, iconic images. However, there are still unanswered questions about the use of minimally-curated, naturalistic video data, which contain dense scenes with many independent objects, imbalanced class distributions, and varying object sizes. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that combines an invariance-based SSL objective on pooled representations with a dense SSL objective that enforces equivariance to optical flow warping. Our findings indicate that a unified objective applied at multiple feature scales is essential for learning effective image representations from high-resolution, naturalistic videos. We validate our approach on the BDD100K driving video dataset and the Walking Tours first-person video dataset, demonstrating its ability to capture spatial understanding from a dense objective and semantic understanding via a pooled representation objective.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yufan He, Pengfei Guo, Yucheng Tang, Andriy Myronenko, Vishwesh Nath, Ziyue Xu, Dong Yang, Can Zhao, Daguang Xu, Wenqi Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Since the release of Segment Anything 2 (SAM2), the medical imaging community has been actively evaluating its performance for 3D medical image segmentation. However, different studies have employed varying evaluation pipelines, resulting in conflicting outcomes that obscure a clear understanding of SAM2's capabilities and potential applications. We shortly review existing benchmarks and point out that the SAM2 paper clearly outlines a zero-shot evaluation pipeline, which simulates user clicks iteratively for up to eight iterations. We reproduced this interactive annotation simulation on 3D CT datasets and provided the results and code~\url{https://github.com/Project-MONAI/VISTA}. Our findings reveal that directly applying SAM2 on 3D medical imaging in a zero-shot manner is far from satisfactory. It is prone to generating false positives when foreground objects disappear, and annotating more slices cannot fully offset this tendency. For smaller single-connected objects like kidney and aorta, SAM2 performs reasonably well but for most organs it is still far behind state-of-the-art 3D annotation methods. More research and innovation are needed for 3D medical imaging community to use SAM2 correctly.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rise of computer vision applications in the real world puts the security of the deep neural networks at risk. Recent works demonstrate that convolutional neural networks are susceptible to adversarial examples - where the input images look similar to the natural images but are classified incorrectly by the model. To provide a rebuttal to this problem, we propose a new method to build robust deep neural networks against adversarial attacks by reformulating the saddle point optimization problem in \cite{madry2017towards}. Our proposed method offers significant resistance and a concrete security guarantee against multiple adversaries. The goal of this paper is to act as a stepping stone for a new variation of deep learning models which would lead towards fully robust deep learning models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sadia Ilyas, Ido Freeman, Matthias Rottmann</p>
<p>Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) object detection is a critical task focused on detecting objects that originate from a data distribution different from that of the training data. In this study, we investigate to what extent state-of-the-art open-vocabulary object detectors can detect unusual objects in street scenes, which are considered as OOD or rare scenarios with respect to common street scene datasets. Specifically, we evaluate their performance on the OoDIS Benchmark, which extends RoadAnomaly21 and RoadObstacle21 from SegmentMeIfYouCan, as well as LostAndFound, which was recently extended to object level annotations. The objective of our study is to uncover short-comings of contemporary object detectors in challenging real-world, and particularly in open-world scenarios. Our experiments reveal that open vocabulary models are promising for OOD object detection scenarios, however far from perfect. Substantial improvements are required before they can be reliably deployed in real-world applications. We benchmark four state-of-the-art open-vocabulary object detection models on three different datasets. Noteworthily, Grounding DINO achieves the best results on RoadObstacle21 and LostAndFound in our study with an AP of 48.3% and 25.4% respectively. YOLO-World excels on RoadAnomaly21 with an AP of 21.2%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manuel Weber, Carly Beneke, Clyde Wheeler</p>
<p>Abstract: Regular measurement of carbon stock in the world's forests is critical for carbon accounting and reporting under national and international climate initiatives, and for scientific research, but has been largely limited in scalability and temporal resolution due to a lack of ground based assessments. Increasing efforts have been made to address these challenges by incorporating remotely sensed data. We present a new methodology which uses multi-sensor, multi-spectral imagery at a resolution of 10 meters and a deep learning based model which unifies the prediction of above ground biomass density (AGBD), canopy height (CH), canopy cover (CC) as well as uncertainty estimations for all three quantities. The model is trained on millions of globally sampled GEDI-L2/L4 measurements. We validate the capability of our model by deploying it over the entire globe for the year 2023 as well as annually from 2016 to 2023 over selected areas. The model achieves a mean absolute error for AGBD (CH, CC) of 26.1 Mg/ha (3.7 m, 9.9 %) and a root mean squared error of 50.6 Mg/ha (5.4 m, 15.8 %) on a globally sampled test dataset, demonstrating a significant improvement over previously published results. We also report the model performance against independently collected ground measurements published in the literature, which show a high degree of correlation across varying conditions. We further show that our pre-trained model facilitates seamless transferability to other GEDI variables due to its multi-head architecture.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seth Z. Zhao, Hao Xiang, Chenfeng Xu, Xin Xia, Bolei Zhou, Jiaqi Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) cooperative perception methods rely on accurate multi-agent 3D annotations. Nevertheless, it is time-consuming and expensive to collect and annotate real-world data, especially for V2X systems. In this paper, we present a self-supervised learning method for V2X cooperative perception, which utilizes the vast amount of unlabeled 3D V2X data to enhance the perception performance. Beyond simply extending the previous pre-training methods for point-cloud representation learning, we introduce a novel self-supervised Cooperative Pretraining framework (termed as CooPre) customized for a collaborative scenario. We point out that cooperative point-cloud sensing compensates for information loss among agents. This motivates us to design a novel proxy task for the 3D encoder to reconstruct LiDAR point clouds across different agents. Besides, we develop a V2X bird-eye-view (BEV) guided masking strategy which effectively allows the model to pay attention to 3D features across heterogeneous V2X agents (i.e., vehicles and infrastructure) in the BEV space. Noticeably, such a masking strategy effectively pretrains the 3D encoder and is compatible with mainstream cooperative perception backbones. Our approach, validated through extensive experiments on representative datasets (i.e., V2X-Real, V2V4Real, and OPV2V), leads to a performance boost across all V2X settings. Additionally, we demonstrate the framework's improvements in cross-domain transferability, data efficiency, and robustness under challenging scenarios. The code will be made publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohsen Asghari Ilani, Leila Amini, Hossein Karimi, Maryam Shavali Kuhshuri</p>
<p>Abstract: Numerous image processing techniques (IPTs) have been employed to detect crack defects, offering an alternative to human-conducted onsite inspections. These IPTs manipulate images to extract defect features, particularly cracks in surfaces produced through Additive Manufacturing (AM). This article presents a vision-based approach that utilizes deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for crack detection in AM surfaces. Traditional image processing techniques face challenges with diverse real-world scenarios and varying crack types. To overcome these challenges, our proposed method leverages CNNs, eliminating the need for extensive feature extraction. Annotation for CNN training is facilitated by LabelImg without the requirement for additional IPTs. The trained CNN, enhanced by OpenCV preprocessing techniques, achieves an outstanding 99.54% accuracy on a dataset of 14,982 annotated images with resolutions of 1536 x 1103 pixels. Evaluation metrics exceeding 96% precision, 98% recall, and a 97% F1-score highlight the precision and effectiveness of the entire process.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianqi Ding, Dawei Xiang</p>
<p>Abstract: With the increasing growth of industrialization, more and more industries are relying on machine automation for production. However, defect detection in large-scale production machinery is becoming increasingly important. Due to their large size and height, it is often challenging for professionals to conduct defect inspections on such large machinery. For example, the inspection of aging and misalignment of components on tall machinery like towers requires companies to assign dedicated personnel. Employees need to climb the towers and either visually inspect or take photos to detect safety hazards in these large machines. Direct visual inspection is limited by its low level of automation, lack of precision, and safety concerns associated with personnel climbing the towers. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a system based on neural network modeling (NeRF) of 3D twin models. By comparing two digital models, this system enables defect detection at the 3D interface of an object.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Melissa R Dale, Anil Jain, Arun Ross</p>
<p>Abstract: The use of multiple modalities (e.g., face and fingerprint) or multiple algorithms (e.g., three face comparators) has shown to improve the recognition accuracy of an operational biometric system. Over time a biometric system may evolve to add new modalities, retire old modalities, or be merged with other biometric systems. This can lead to scenarios where there are missing scores corresponding to the input probe set. Previous work on this topic has focused on either the verification or identification tasks, but not both. Further, the proportion of missing data considered has been less than 50%. In this work, we study the impact of missing score data for both the verification and identification tasks. We show that the application of various score imputation methods along with simple sum fusion can improve recognition accuracy, even when the proportion of missing scores increases to 90%. Experiments show that fusion after score imputation outperforms fusion with no imputation. Specifically, iterative imputation with K nearest neighbors consistently surpasses other imputation methods in both the verification and identification tasks, regardless of the amount of scores missing, and provides imputed values that are consistent with the ground truth complete dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sifan Wang, Junfeng Liao, Ye Yuan, Riquan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as an excellent solution for performing deep learning on different data owners without exchanging raw data. However, statistical heterogeneity in FL presents a key challenge, leading to a phenomenon of skewness in local model parameter distributions that researchers have largely overlooked. In this work, we propose the concept of parameter skew to describe the phenomenon that can substantially affect the accuracy of global model parameter estimation. Additionally, we introduce FedSA, an aggregation strategy to obtain a high-quality global model, to address the implication from parameter skew. Specifically, we categorize parameters into high-dispersion and low-dispersion groups based on the coefficient of variation. For high-dispersion parameters, Micro-Classes (MIC) and Macro-Classes (MAC) represent the dispersion at the micro and macro levels, respectively, forming the foundation of FedSA. To evaluate the effectiveness of FedSA, we conduct extensive experiments with different FL algorithms on three computer vision datasets. FedSA outperforms eight state-of-the-art baselines by about 4.7% in test accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chuandong Liu, Shuguo Jiang, Xingxing Weng, Lei Yu, Pengcheng Li, Gui-Song Xia</p>
<p>Abstract: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation, which efficiently addresses the limitation of acquiring dense annotations, is essential for 3D scene understanding. Most methods leverage the teacher model to generate pseudo labels, and then guide the learning of the student model on unlabeled scenes. However, they focus only on points with pseudo labels while directly overlooking points without pseudo labels, namely intra-scene inconsistency, leading to semantic ambiguity. Moreover, inter-scene correlation between labeled and unlabeled scenes contribute to transferring rich annotation information, yet this has not been explored for the semi-supervised tasks. To address these two problems, we propose to explore scene coherence for semi-supervised 3D semantic segmentation, dubbed CoScene. Inspired by the unstructured and unordered nature of the point clouds, our CoScene adopts the straightforward point erasure strategy to ensure the intra-scene consistency. Moreover, patch-based data augmentation is proposed to enhance the inter-scene information transfer between labeled and unlabeled scenes at both scene and instance levels. Extensive experimental results on SemanticKITTI and nuScenes show that our approach outperforms existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siwei Tu, Weidong Yang, Ben Fei</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have been widely utilized for image restoration. However, previous blind image restoration methods still need to assume the type of degradation model while leaving the parameters to be optimized, limiting their real-world applications. Therefore, we aim to tame generative diffusion prior for universal blind image restoration dubbed BIR-D, which utilizes an optimizable convolutional kernel to simulate the degradation model and dynamically update the parameters of the kernel in the diffusion steps, enabling it to achieve blind image restoration results even in various complex situations. Besides, based on mathematical reasoning, we have provided an empirical formula for the chosen of adaptive guidance scale, eliminating the need for a grid search for the optimal parameter. Experimentally, Our BIR-D has demonstrated superior practicality and versatility than off-the-shelf unsupervised methods across various tasks both on real-world and synthetic datasets, qualitatively and quantitatively. BIR-D is able to fulfill multi-guidance blind image restoration. Moreover, BIR-D can also restore images that undergo multiple and complicated degradations, demonstrating the practical applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fan Liu, Wenwen Cai, Jian Huo, Chuanyi Zhang, Delong Chen, Jun Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Few-shot classification (FSC) is a fundamental yet challenging task in computer vision that involves recognizing novel classes from limited data. While previous methods have focused on enhancing visual features or incorporating additional modalities, Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) offer a promising alternative due to their rich knowledge and strong visual perception. However, LVLMs risk learning specific response formats rather than effectively extracting useful information from support data in FSC tasks. In this paper, we investigate LVLMs' performance in FSC and identify key issues such as insufficient learning and the presence of severe positional biases. To tackle the above challenges, we adopt the meta-learning strategy to teach models "learn to learn". By constructing a rich set of meta-tasks for instruction fine-tuning, LVLMs enhance the ability to extract information from few-shot support data for classification. Additionally, we further boost LVLM's few-shot learning capabilities through label augmentation and candidate selection in the fine-tuning and inference stage, respectively. Label augmentation is implemented via a character perturbation strategy to ensure the model focuses on support information. Candidate selection leverages attribute descriptions to filter out unreliable candidates and simplify the task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance on both general and fine-grained datasets. Furthermore, our candidate selection strategy has been proven beneficial for training-free LVLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangyu Zhao, Yuehan Zhang, Wenlong Zhang, Xiao-Ming Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: The fashion domain encompasses a variety of real-world multimodal tasks, including multimodal retrieval and multimodal generation. The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence generated content, particularly in technologies like large language models for text generation and diffusion models for visual generation, have sparked widespread research interest in applying these multimodal models in the fashion domain. However, tasks involving embeddings, such as image-to-text or text-to-image retrieval, have been largely overlooked from this perspective due to the diverse nature of the multimodal fashion domain. And current research on multi-task single models lack focus on image generation. In this work, we present UniFashion, a unified framework that simultaneously tackles the challenges of multimodal generation and retrieval tasks within the fashion domain, integrating image generation with retrieval tasks and text generation tasks. UniFashion unifies embedding and generative tasks by integrating a diffusion model and LLM, enabling controllable and high-fidelity generation. Our model significantly outperforms previous single-task state-of-the-art models across diverse fashion tasks, and can be readily adapted to manage complex vision-language tasks. This work demonstrates the potential learning synergy between multimodal generation and retrieval, offering a promising direction for future research in the fashion domain.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saleh Sargolzaei, Luis Rueda</p>
<p>Abstract: This study explores the potential of Modern Hopfield Networks (MHN) in improving the ability of computer vision models to handle out-of-distribution data. While current computer vision models can generalize to unseen samples from the same distribution, they are susceptible to minor perturbations such as blurring, which limits their effectiveness in real-world applications. We suggest integrating MHN into the baseline models to enhance their robustness. This integration can be implemented during the test time for any model and combined with any adversarial defense method. Our research shows that the proposed integration consistently improves model performance on the MNIST-C dataset, achieving a state-of-the-art increase of 13.84% in average corruption accuracy, a 57.49% decrease in mean Corruption Error (mCE), and a 60.61% decrease in relative mCE compared to the baseline model. Additionally, we investigate the capability of MHN to converge to the original non-corrupted data. Notably, our method does not require test-time adaptation or augmentation with corruptions, underscoring its practical viability for real-world deployment.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiao Han, Chen Zhu, Xiangyu Zhao, Hengshu Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual geo-localization demands in-depth knowledge and advanced reasoning skills to associate images with real-world geographic locations precisely. In general, traditional methods based on data-matching are hindered by the impracticality of storing adequate visual records of global landmarks. Recently, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated the capability of geo-localization through Visual Question Answering (VQA), enabling a solution that does not require external geo-tagged image records. However, the performance of a single LVLM is still limited by its intrinsic knowledge and reasoning capabilities. Along this line, in this paper, we introduce a novel visual geo-localization framework called \name\ that integrates the inherent knowledge of multiple LVLM agents via inter-agent communication to achieve effective geo-localization of images. Furthermore, our framework employs a dynamic learning strategy to optimize the communication patterns among agents, reducing unnecessary discussions among agents and improving the efficiency of the framework. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we construct GeoGlobe, a novel dataset for visual geo-localization tasks. Extensive testing on the dataset demonstrates that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this work, we discuss evaluating video foundation models in a fair and robust manner. Unlike language or image foundation models, many video foundation models are evaluated with differing parameters (such as sampling rate, number of frames, pretraining steps, etc.), making fair and robust comparisons challenging. Therefore, we present a carefully designed evaluation framework for measuring two core capabilities of video comprehension: appearance and motion understanding. Our findings reveal that existing video foundation models, whether text-supervised like UMT or InternVideo2, or self-supervised like V-JEPA, exhibit limitations in at least one of these capabilities. As an alternative, we introduce TWLV-I, a new video foundation model that constructs robust visual representations for both motion- and appearance-based videos. Based on the average top-1 accuracy of linear probing on five action recognition benchmarks, pretrained only on publicly accessible datasets, our model shows a 4.6%p improvement compared to V-JEPA (ViT-L) and a 7.7%p improvement compared to UMT (ViT-L). Even when compared to much larger models, our model demonstrates a 7.2%p improvement compared to DFN (ViT-H), a 2.7%p improvement compared to V-JEPA~(ViT-H) and a 2.8%p improvement compared to InternVideo2 (ViT-g). We provide embedding vectors obtained by TWLV-I from videos of several commonly used video benchmarks, along with evaluation source code that can directly utilize these embeddings.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengyi Lu, Hao Liang, Xiao Wang, Xinqiang Yan, Yuankai Huo</p>
<p>Abstract: Ultrahigh field (UHF) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) provides a higher signal-to-noise ratio and, thereby, higher spatial resolution. However, UHF MRI introduces challenges such as transmit radiofrequency (RF) field (B1+) inhomogeneities, leading to uneven flip angles and image intensity anomalies. These issues can significantly degrade imaging quality and its medical applications. This study addresses B1+ field homogeneity through a novel deep learning-based strategy. Traditional methods like Magnitude Least Squares (MLS) optimization have been effective but are time-consuming and dependent on the patient's presence. Recent machine learning approaches, such as RF Shim Prediction by Iteratively Projected Ridge Regression and deep learning frameworks, have shown promise but face limitations like extensive training times and oversimplified architectures. We propose a two-step deep learning strategy. First, we obtain the desired reference RF shimming weights from multi-channel B1+ fields using random-initialized Adaptive Moment Estimation. Then, we employ Residual Networks (ResNets) to train a model that maps B1+ fields to target RF shimming outputs. Our approach does not rely on pre-calculated reference optimizations for the testing process and efficiently learns residual functions. Comparative studies with traditional MLS optimization demonstrate our method's advantages in terms of speed and accuracy. The proposed strategy achieves a faster and more efficient RF shimming design, significantly improving imaging quality at UHF. This advancement holds potential for broader applications in medical imaging and diagnostics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chingis Oinar, Miao Cao, Shanshan Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: Mercari is the largest C2C e-commerce marketplace in Japan, having more than 20 million active monthly users. Search being the fundamental way to discover desired items, we have always had a substantial amount of data with implicit feedback. Although we actively take advantage of that to provide the best service for our users, the correlation of implicit feedback for such tasks as image quality assessment is not trivial. Many traditional lines of research in Machine Learning (ML) are similarly motivated by the insatiable appetite of Deep Learning (DL) models for well-labelled training data. Weak supervision is about leveraging higher-level and/or noisier supervision over unlabeled data. Large Language Models (LLMs) are being actively studied and used for data labelling tasks. We present how we leverage a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to enable LLM to produce image aesthetics labels that correlate well with human behavior in e-commerce settings. Leveraging LLMs is more cost-effective compared to explicit human judgment, while significantly improving the explainability of deep image quality evaluation which is highly important for customer journey optimization at Mercari. We propose a cost-efficient LLM-driven approach for assessing and predicting image quality in e-commerce settings, which is very convenient for proof-of-concept testing. We show that our LLM-produced labels correlate with user behavior on Mercari. Finally, we show our results from an online experimentation, where we achieved a significant growth in sales on the web platform.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper aims to generate physically-layered 3D humans from text prompts. Existing methods either generate 3D clothed humans as a whole or support only tight and simple clothing generation, which limits their applications to virtual try-on and part-level editing. To achieve physically-layered 3D human generation with reusable and complex clothing, we propose a novel layer-wise dressed human representation based on a physically-decoupled diffusion model. Specifically, to achieve layer-wise clothing generation, we propose a dual-representation decoupling framework for generating clothing decoupled from the human body, in conjunction with an innovative multi-layer fusion volume rendering method. To match the clothing with different body shapes, we propose an SMPL-driven implicit field deformation network that enables the free transfer and reuse of clothing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach not only achieves state-of-the-art layered 3D human generation with complex clothing but also supports virtual try-on and layered human animation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andr\'e D\"orsch, Torsten Schlett, Peter Munch, Christian Rathgeb, Christoph Busch</p>
<p>Abstract: Quality assessment algorithms measure the quality of a captured biometric sample. Since the sample quality strongly affects the recognition performance of a biometric system, it is essential to only process samples of sufficient quality and discard samples of low-quality. Even though quality assessment algorithms are not intended to yield very different quality scores across demographic groups, quality score discrepancies are possible, resulting in different discard ratios. To ensure that quality assessment algorithms do not take demographic characteristics into account when assessing sample quality and consequently to ensure that the quality algorithms perform equally for all individuals, it is crucial to develop a fairness measure. In this work we propose and compare multiple fairness measures for evaluating quality components across demographic groups. Proposed measures, could be used as potential candidates for an upcoming standard in this important field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhihao Li, Yao Du, Yang Liu, Yan Zhang, Yufang Liu, Mengdi Zhang, Xunliang Cai</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models have recently experienced rapid developments and excel in various multi-modal tasks. However, they still struggle with mathematical geometric problem solving, which requires exceptional visual perception proficiency. Existing MLLMs mostly optimize the LLM backbone to acquire geometric reasoning capabilities, while rarely emphasizing improvements in visual comprehension. In this paper, we first investigate the visual perception performance of MLLMs when facing geometric diagrams. Our findings reveal that current MLLMs severely suffer from inaccurate geometric perception and hallucinations. To address these limitations, we propose EAGLE, a novel two-stage end-to-end visual enhancement MLLM framework designed to ElevAte Geometric reasoning through LLM-Empowered visual instruction tuning. Specifically, in the preliminary stage, we feed geometric image-caption pairs into our MLLM that contains a fully fine-tuning CLIP ViT and a frozen LLM, aiming to endow our model with basic geometric knowledge. In the subsequent advanced stage, we incorporate LoRA modules into the vision encoder and unfreeze the LLM backbone. This enables the model to leverage the inherent CoT rationales within question-answer pairs, guiding the MLLM to focus on nuanced visual cues and enhancing its overall perceptual capacity. Moreover, we optimize the cross-modal projector in both stages to foster adaptive visual-linguistic alignments. After the two-stage visual enhancement, we develop the geometry expert model EAGLE-7B. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. For example, on the GeoQA benchmark, EAGLE-7B not only surpasses the exemplary G-LLaVA 7B model by 2.9%, but also marginally outperforms the larger G-LLaVA 13B model. On the MathVista benchmark, EAGLE-7B achieves remarkable 3.8% improvements compared with the proprietary model GPT-4V.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Szymon Op{\l}atek, Dawid Rymarczyk, Bartosz Zieli\'nski</p>
<p>Abstract: Prototypical parts networks, such as ProtoPNet, became popular due to their potential to produce more genuine explanations than post-hoc methods. However, for a long time, this potential has been strictly theoretical, and no systematic studies have existed to support it. That changed recently with the introduction of the FunnyBirds benchmark, which includes metrics for evaluating different aspects of explanations.
  However, this benchmark employs attribution maps visualization for all explanation techniques except for the ProtoPNet, for which the bounding boxes are used. This choice significantly influences the metric scores and questions the conclusions stated in FunnyBirds publication.
  In this study, we comprehensively compare metric scores obtained for two types of ProtoPNet visualizations: bounding boxes and similarity maps. Our analysis indicates that employing similarity maps aligns better with the essence of ProtoPNet, as evidenced by different metric scores obtained from FunnyBirds. Therefore, we advocate using similarity maps as a visualization technique for prototypical parts networks in explainability evaluation benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minhyeok Lee, Suhwan Cho, Chajin Shin, Jungho Lee, Sunghun Yang, Sangyoun Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Propagation-based video inpainting using optical flow at the pixel or feature level has recently garnered significant attention. However, it has limitations such as the inaccuracy of optical flow prediction and the propagation of noise over time. These issues result in non-uniform noise and time consistency problems throughout the video, which are particularly pronounced when the removed area is large and involves substantial movement. To address these issues, we propose a novel First Frame Filling Video Diffusion Inpainting model (FFF-VDI). We design FFF-VDI inspired by the capabilities of pre-trained image-to-video diffusion models that can transform the first frame image into a highly natural video. To apply this to the video inpainting task, we propagate the noise latent information of future frames to fill the masked areas of the first frame's noise latent code. Next, we fine-tune the pre-trained image-to-video diffusion model to generate the inpainted video. The proposed model addresses the limitations of existing methods that rely on optical flow quality, producing much more natural and temporally consistent videos. This proposed approach is the first to effectively integrate image-to-video diffusion models into video inpainting tasks. Through various comparative experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed model can robustly handle diverse inpainting types with high quality.</p>

Existing methods often overlook the significant differences in feature space caused by the large gap in scale between the teacher and student models. This limitation hampers the efficiency of knowledge transfer during the distillation process. Furthermore, the complex backgrounds in UAV images make it challenging for the student model to efficiently learn the object features. In this paper, we propose a novel knowledge distillation framework for UAV-OD. Specifically, a progressive distillation approach is designed to alleviate the feature gap between teacher and student models. Then a new feature alignment method is provided to extract object-related features for enhancing student model's knowledge reception efficiency. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. The results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance in two UAV-OD datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingwei Sun, Xuchong Zhang, Changfeng Sun, Qicheng Bai, Hongbin Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-View Diffusion Models (MVDMs) enable remarkable improvements in the field of 3D geometric reconstruction, but the issue regarding intellectual property has received increasing attention due to unauthorized imitation. Recently, some works have utilized adversarial attacks to protect copyright. However, all these works focus on single-image generation tasks which only need to consider the inner feature of images. Previous methods are inefficient in attacking MVDMs because they lack the consideration of disrupting the geometric and visual consistency among the generated multi-view images. This paper is the first to address the intellectual property infringement issue arising from MVDMs. Accordingly, we propose a novel latent feature and attention dual erasure attack to disrupt the distribution of latent feature and the consistency across the generated images from multi-view and multi-domain simultaneously. The experiments conducted on SOTA MVDMs indicate that our approach achieves superior performances in terms of attack effectiveness, transferability, and robustness against defense methods. Therefore, this paper provides an efficient solution to protect 3D assets from MVDMs-based 3D geometry reconstruction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Shang, Dongwei Ren, Wanying Zhang, Qilong Wang, Pengfei Zhu, Wangmeng Zuo</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern consumer cameras commonly employ the rolling shutter (RS) imaging mechanism, via which images are captured by scanning scenes row-by-row, resulting in RS distortion for dynamic scenes. To correct RS distortion, existing methods adopt a fully supervised learning manner that requires high framerate global shutter (GS) images as ground-truth for supervision. In this paper, we propose an enhanced Self-supervised learning framework for Dual reversed RS distortion Correction (SelfDRSC++). Firstly, we introduce a lightweight DRSC network that incorporates a bidirectional correlation matching block to refine the joint optimization of optical flows and corrected RS features, thereby improving correction performance while reducing network parameters. Subsequently, to effectively train the DRSC network, we propose a self-supervised learning strategy that ensures cycle consistency between input and reconstructed dual reversed RS images. The RS reconstruction in SelfDRSC++ can be interestingly formulated as a specialized instance of video frame interpolation, where each row in reconstructed RS images is interpolated from predicted GS images by utilizing RS distortion time maps. By achieving superior performance while simplifying the training process, SelfDRSC++ enables feasible one-stage self-supervised training. Additionally, besides start and end RS scanning time, SelfDRSC++ allows supervision of GS images at arbitrary intermediate scanning times, thus enabling the learned DRSC network to generate high framerate GS videos.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guo Pu, Yiming Zhao, Zhouhui Lian</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent single-view 3D generative methods have made significant advancements by leveraging knowledge distilled from extensive 3D object datasets. However, challenges persist in the synthesis of 3D scenes from a single view, primarily due to the complexity of real-world environments and the limited availability of high-quality prior resources. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach called Pano2Room, designed to automatically reconstruct high-quality 3D indoor scenes from a single panoramic image. These panoramic images can be easily generated using a panoramic RGBD inpainter from captures at a single location with any camera. The key idea is to initially construct a preliminary mesh from the input panorama, and iteratively refine this mesh using a panoramic RGBD inpainter while collecting photo-realistic 3D-consistent pseudo novel views. Finally, the refined mesh is converted into a 3D Gaussian Splatting field and trained with the collected pseudo novel views. This pipeline enables the reconstruction of real-world 3D scenes, even in the presence of large occlusions, and facilitates the synthesis of photo-realistic novel views with detailed geometry. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments have been conducted to validate the superiority of our method in single-panorama indoor novel synthesis compared to the state-of-the-art.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bohao Xing, Zitong Yu, Xin Liu, Kaishen Yuan, Qilang Ye, Weicheng Xie, Huanjing Yue, Jingyu Yang, Heikki K\"alvi\"ainen</p>
<p>Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) is an important research topic in emotional artificial intelligence. In recent decades, researchers have made remarkable progress. However, current FER paradigms face challenges in generalization, lack semantic information aligned with natural language, and struggle to process both images and videos within a unified framework, making their application in multimodal emotion understanding and human-computer interaction difficult. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently achieved success, offering advantages in addressing these issues and potentially overcoming the limitations of current FER paradigms. However, directly applying pre-trained MLLMs to FER still faces several challenges. Our zero-shot evaluations of existing open-source MLLMs on FER indicate a significant performance gap compared to GPT-4V and current supervised state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. In this paper, we aim to enhance MLLMs' capabilities in understanding facial expressions. We first generate instruction data for five FER datasets with Gemini. We then propose a novel MLLM, named EMO-LLaMA, which incorporates facial priors from a pretrained facial analysis network to enhance human facial information. Specifically, we design a Face Info Mining module to extract both global and local facial information. Additionally, we utilize a handcrafted prompt to introduce age-gender-race attributes, considering the emotional differences across different human groups. Extensive experiments show that EMO-LLaMA achieves SOTA-comparable or competitive results across both static and dynamic FER datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yili Li, Jing Yu, Keke Gai, Bang Liu, Gang Xiong, Qi Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Current text-video retrieval methods mainly rely on cross-modal matching between queries and videos to calculate their similarity scores, which are then sorted to obtain retrieval results. This method considers the matching between each candidate video and the query, but it incurs a significant time cost and will increase notably with the increase of candidates. Generative models are common in natural language processing and computer vision, and have been successfully applied in document retrieval, but their application in multimodal retrieval remains unexplored. To enhance retrieval efficiency, in this paper, we introduce a model-based video indexer named T2VIndexer, which is a sequence-to-sequence generative model directly generating video identifiers and retrieving candidate videos with constant time complexity. T2VIndexer aims to reduce retrieval time while maintaining high accuracy. To achieve this goal, we propose video identifier encoding and query-identifier augmentation approaches to represent videos as short sequences while preserving their semantic information. Our method consistently enhances the retrieval efficiency of current state-of-the-art models on four standard datasets. It enables baselines with only 30\%-50\% of the original retrieval time to achieve better retrieval performance on MSR-VTT (+1.0%), MSVD (+1.8%), ActivityNet (+1.5%), and DiDeMo (+0.2%).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ioannis Sarridis, Christos Koutlis, Symeon Papadopoulos, Christos Diou</p>
<p>Abstract: Computer vision (CV) datasets often exhibit biases that are perpetuated by deep learning models. While recent efforts aim to mitigate these biases and foster fair representations, they fail in complex real-world scenarios. In particular, existing methods excel in controlled experiments involving benchmarks with single-attribute injected biases, but struggle with multi-attribute biases being present in well-established CV datasets. Here, we introduce BAdd, a simple yet effective method that allows for learning fair representations invariant to the attributes introducing bias by incorporating features representing these attributes into the backbone. BAdd is evaluated on seven benchmarks and exhibits competitive performance, surpassing state-of-the-art methods on both single- and multi-attribute benchmarks. Notably, BAdd achieves +27.5% and +5.5% absolute accuracy improvements on the challenging multi-attribute benchmarks, FB-Biased-MNIST and CelebA, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wanshui Gan, Fang Liu, Hongbin Xu, Ningkai Mo, Naoto Yokoya</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce GaussianOcc, a systematic method that investigates the two usages of Gaussian splatting for fully self-supervised and efficient 3D occupancy estimation in surround views. First, traditional methods for self-supervised 3D occupancy estimation still require ground truth 6D poses from sensors during training. To address this limitation, we propose Gaussian Splatting for Projection (GSP) module to provide accurate scale information for fully self-supervised training from adjacent view projection. Additionally, existing methods rely on volume rendering for final 3D voxel representation learning using 2D signals (depth maps, semantic maps), which is both time-consuming and less effective. We propose Gaussian Splatting from Voxel space (GSV) to leverage the fast rendering properties of Gaussian splatting. As a result, the proposed GaussianOcc method enables fully self-supervised (no ground truth pose) 3D occupancy estimation in competitive performance with low computational cost (2.7 times faster in training and 5 times faster in rendering).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aditya Gulati, Bruno Lepri, Nuria Oliver</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, there have been significant advancements in computer vision which have led to the widespread deployment of image recognition and generation systems in socially relevant applications, from hiring to security screening. However, the prevalence of biases within these systems has raised significant ethical and social concerns. The most extensively studied biases in this context are related to gender, race and age. Yet, other biases are equally pervasive and harmful, such as lookism, i.e., the preferential treatment of individuals based on their physical appearance. Lookism remains under-explored in computer vision but can have profound implications not only by perpetuating harmful societal stereotypes but also by undermining the fairness and inclusivity of AI technologies. Thus, this paper advocates for the systematic study of lookism as a critical bias in computer vision models. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature, we identify three areas of intersection between lookism and computer vision. We illustrate them by means of examples and a user study. We call for an interdisciplinary approach to address lookism, urging researchers, developers, and policymakers to prioritize the development of equitable computer vision systems that respect and reflect the diversity of human appearances.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengzhi Zhong, Xiaoyu Guo, Defeng Huang, Xiaojun Peng, Yian Li, Qijun Zhao, Shuiwang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, the field of visual tracking has made significant progress with the application of large-scale training datasets. These datasets have supported the development of sophisticated algorithms, enhancing the accuracy and stability of visual object tracking. However, most research has primarily focused on favorable illumination circumstances, neglecting the challenges of tracking in low-ligh environments. In low-light scenes, lighting may change dramatically, targets may lack distinct texture features, and in some scenarios, targets may not be directly observable. These factors can lead to a severe decline in tracking performance. To address this issue, we introduce LLOT, a benchmark specifically designed for Low-Light Object Tracking. LLOT comprises 269 challenging sequences with a total of over 132K frames, each carefully annotated with bounding boxes. This specially designed dataset aims to promote innovation and advancement in object tracking techniques for low-light conditions, addressing challenges not adequately covered by existing benchmarks. To assess the performance of existing methods on LLOT, we conducted extensive tests on 39 state-of-the-art tracking algorithms. The results highlight a considerable gap in low-light tracking performance. In response, we propose H-DCPT, a novel tracker that incorporates historical and darkness clue prompts to set a stronger baseline. H-DCPT outperformed all 39 evaluated methods in our experiments, demonstrating significant improvements. We hope that our benchmark and H-DCPT will stimulate the development of novel and accurate methods for tracking objects in low-light conditions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yonglin Tian, Songlin Bai, Zhiyao Luo, Yutong Wang, Yisheng Lv, Fei-Yue Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Occupancy prediction has attracted intensive attention and shown great superiority in the development of autonomous driving systems. The fine-grained environmental representation brought by occupancy prediction in terms of both geometry and semantic information has facilitated the general perception and safe planning under open scenarios. However, it also brings high computation costs and heavy parameters in existing works that utilize voxel-based 3d dense representation and Transformer-based quadratic attention. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a Mamba-based occupancy prediction method (MambaOcc) adopting BEV features to ease the burden of 3D scenario representation, and linear Mamba-style attention to achieve efficient long-range perception. Besides, to address the sensitivity of Mamba to sequence order, we propose a local adaptive reordering (LAR) mechanism with deformable convolution and design a hybrid BEV encoder comprised of convolution layers and Mamba. Extensive experiments on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset demonstrate that MambaOcc achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency. For example, compared to FlashOcc, MambaOcc delivers superior results while reducing the number of parameters by 42\% and computational costs by 39\%.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kim Yu-Ji, Hyunwoo Ha, Kim Youwang, Jaeheung Surh, Hyowon Ha, Tae-Hyun Oh</p>
<p>Abstract: Reconstructing 3D from a single view image is a long-standing challenge. One of the popular approaches to tackle this problem is learning-based methods, but dealing with the test cases unfamiliar with training data (Out-of-distribution; OoD) introduces an additional challenge. To adapt for unseen samples in test time, we propose MeTTA, a test-time adaptation (TTA) exploiting generative prior. We design joint optimization of 3D geometry, appearance, and pose to handle OoD cases with only a single view image. However, the alignment between the reference image and the 3D shape via the estimated viewpoint could be erroneous, which leads to ambiguity. To address this ambiguity, we carefully design learnable virtual cameras and their self-calibration. In our experiments, we demonstrate that MeTTA effectively deals with OoD scenarios at failure cases of existing learning-based 3D reconstruction models and enables obtaining a realistic appearance with physically based rendering (PBR) textures.</p>

In this paper, we introduce TrackGo, a novel approach that leverages free-form masks and arrows for conditional video generation.

This design leverages our observation that the attention map of these layers can accurately activate regions corresponding to motion in videos. Our experimental results demonstrate that our new approach, enhanced by the TrackAdapter, achieves state-of-the-art performance on key metrics such as FVD, FID, and ObjMC scores.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaoze Zhang, Yuming Zhang, Yu Zhao, Yue Zhang, Feiyu Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge distillation is widely applied in various fundamental vision models to enhance the performance of compact models. Existing knowledge distillation methods focus on designing different distillation targets to acquire knowledge from teacher models. However, these methods often overlook the efficient utilization of distilled information, crudely coupling different types of information, making it difficult to explain how the knowledge from the teacher network aids the student network in learning. This paper proposes a novel knowledge distillation framework, Local Attention Knowledge Distillation (LAKD), which more efficiently utilizes the distilled information from teacher networks, achieving higher interpretability and competitive performance. The framework establishes an independent interactive training mechanism through a separation-decoupling mechanism and non-directional activation mapping. LAKD decouples the teacher's features and facilitates progressive interaction training from simple to complex. Specifically, the student network is divided into local modules with independent gradients to decouple the knowledge transferred from the teacher. The non-directional activation mapping helps the student network integrate knowledge from different local modules by learning coarse-grained feature knowledge. We conducted experiments on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets, and the results show that our LAKD method significantly outperforms existing methods, consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance across different datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shangkun Sun, Xiaoyu Liang, Songlin Fan, Wenxu Gao, Wei Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-driven video editing has recently experienced rapid development. Despite this, evaluating edited videos remains a considerable challenge. Current metrics tend to fail to align with human perceptions, and effective quantitative metrics for video editing are still notably absent. To address this, we introduce E-Bench, a benchmark suite tailored to the assessment of text-driven video editing. This suite includes E-Bench DB, a video quality assessment (VQA) database for video editing. E-Bench DB encompasses a diverse set of source videos featuring various motions and subjects, along with multiple distinct editing prompts, editing results from 8 different models, and the corresponding Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) from 24 human annotators. Based on E-Bench DB, we further propose E-Bench QA, a quantitative human-aligned measurement for the text-driven video editing task. In addition to the aesthetic, distortion, and other visual quality indicators that traditional VQA methods emphasize, E-Bench QA focuses on the text-video alignment and the relevance modeling between source and edited videos. It proposes a new assessment network for video editing that attains superior performance in alignment with human preferences. To the best of our knowledge, E-Bench introduces the first quality assessment dataset for video editing and an effective subjective-aligned quantitative metric for this domain.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Umaima Rahman, Abhishek Basu, Muhammad Uzair Khattak, Aniq Ur Rahman</p>
<p>Abstract: This study explores the concept of cross-disease transferability (XDT) in medical imaging, focusing on the potential of binary classifiers trained on one disease to perform zero-shot classification on another disease affecting the same organ. Utilizing chest X-rays (CXR) as the primary modality, we investigate whether a model trained on one pulmonary disease can make predictions about another novel pulmonary disease, a scenario with significant implications for medical settings with limited data on emerging diseases. The XDT framework leverages the embedding space of a vision encoder, which, through kernel transformation, aids in distinguishing between diseased and non-diseased classes in the latent space. This capability is especially beneficial in resource-limited environments or in regions with low prevalence of certain diseases, where conventional diagnostic practices may fail. However, the XDT framework is currently limited to binary classification, determining only the presence or absence of a disease rather than differentiating among multiple diseases. This limitation underscores the supplementary role of XDT to traditional diagnostic tests in clinical settings. Furthermore, results show that XDT-CXR as a framework is able to make better predictions compared to other zero-shot learning (ZSL) baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minghao Han, Linhao Qu, Dingkang Yang, Xukun Zhang, Xiaoying Wang, Lihua Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) has become a standard paradigm for weakly supervised classification of whole slide images (WSI). However, this paradigm relies on the use of a large number of labelled WSIs for training. The lack of training data and the presence of rare diseases present significant challenges for these methods. Prompt tuning combined with the pre-trained Vision-Language models (VLMs) is an effective solution to the Few-shot Weakly Supervised WSI classification (FSWC) tasks. Nevertheless, applying prompt tuning methods designed for natural images to WSIs presents three significant challenges: 1) These methods fail to fully leverage the prior knowledge from the VLM's text modality; 2) They overlook the essential multi-scale and contextual information in WSIs, leading to suboptimal results; and 3) They lack exploration of instance aggregation methods. To address these problems, we propose a Multi-Scale and Context-focused Prompt Tuning (MSCPT) method for FSWC tasks. Specifically, MSCPT employs the frozen large language model to generate pathological visual language prior knowledge at multi-scale, guiding hierarchical prompt tuning. Additionally, we design a graph prompt tuning module to learn essential contextual information within WSI, and finally, a non-parametric cross-guided instance aggregation module has been introduced to get the WSI-level features. Based on two VLMs, extensive experiments and visualizations on three datasets demonstrated the powerful performance of our MSCPT.</p>

<p>Abstract: The creation of increasingly vivid 3D virtual digital humans has become a hot topic in recent years. Currently, most speech-driven work focuses on training models to learn the relationship between phonemes and visemes to achieve more realistic lips. However, they fail to capture the correlations between emotions and facial expressions effectively. To solve this problem, we propose a new model, termed EmoFace. EmoFace employs a novel Mesh Attention mechanism, which helps to learn potential feature dependencies between mesh vertices in time and space. We also adopt, for the first time to our knowledge, an effective self-growing training scheme that combines teacher-forcing and scheduled sampling in a 3D face animation task. Additionally, since EmoFace is an autoregressive model, there is no requirement that the first frame of the training data must be a silent frame, which greatly reduces the data limitations and contributes to solve the current dilemma of insufficient datasets. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on our proposed high-quality reconstructed 3D emotional facial animation dataset, 3D-RAVDESS ($5.0343\times 10^{-5}$mm for LVE and $1.0196\times 10^{-5}$mm for EVE), and publicly available dataset VOCASET ($2.8669\times 10^{-5}$mm for LVE and $0.4664\times 10^{-5}$mm for EVE), demonstrate that our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lo\"ic Denis (EPFL), Emanuele Dalsasso (EPFL), Florence Tupin (IMAGES, IDS)</p>
<p>Abstract: Reducing speckle fluctuations in multi-channel SAR images is essential in many applications of SAR imaging such as polarimetric classification or interferometric height estimation. While single-channel despeckling has widely benefited from the application of deep learning techniques, extensions to multi-channel SAR images are much more challenging.This paper introduces MuChaPro, a generic framework that exploits existing single-channel despeckling methods. The key idea is to generate numerous single-channel projections, restore these projections, and recombine them into the final multi-channel estimate. This simple approach is shown to be effective in polarimetric and/or interferometric modalities. A special appeal of MuChaPro is the possibility to apply a self-supervised training strategy to learn sensor-specific networks for single-channel despeckling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chongkai Yu, Anqi Li, Xiaochao Qu, Luoqi Liu, Ting Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The advent of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) marks a significant milestone for interactive segmentation using generalist models. As a late fusion model, SAM extracts image embeddings once and merges them with prompts in later interactions. This strategy limits the models ability to extract detailed information from the prompted target zone. Current specialist models utilize the early fusion strategy that encodes the combination of images and prompts to target the prompted objects, yet repetitive complex computations on the images result in high latency. The key to these issues is efficiently synergizing the images and prompts. We propose SAM-REF, a two-stage refinement framework that fully integrates images and prompts globally and locally while maintaining the accuracy of early fusion and the efficiency of late fusion. The first-stage GlobalDiff Refiner is a lightweight early fusion network that combines the whole image and prompts, focusing on capturing detailed information for the entire object. The second-stage PatchDiff Refiner locates the object detail window according to the mask and prompts, then refines the local details of the object. Experimentally, we demonstrated the high effectiveness and efficiency of our method in tackling complex cases with multiple interactions. Our SAM-REF model outperforms the current state-of-the-art method in most metrics on segmentation quality without compromising efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuhong Liu, Xiang Chen, Hongming Chen, Quanfeng Xu, Mingrui Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Reconstruction under adverse rainy conditions poses significant challenges due to reduced visibility and the distortion of visual perception. These conditions can severely impair the quality of geometric maps, which is essential for applications ranging from autonomous planning to environmental monitoring. In response to these challenges, this study introduces the novel task of 3D Reconstruction in Rainy Environments (3DRRE), specifically designed to address the complexities of reconstructing 3D scenes under rainy conditions. To benchmark this task, we construct the HydroViews dataset that comprises a diverse collection of both synthesized and real-world scene images characterized by various intensities of rain streaks and raindrops. Furthermore, we propose DeRainGS, the first 3DGS method tailored for reconstruction in adverse rainy environments. Extensive experiments across a wide range of rain scenarios demonstrate that our method delivers state-of-the-art performance, remarkably outperforming existing occlusion-free methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dimitrios Karageorgiou, Quentin Bammey, Valentin Porcellini, Bertrand Goupil, Denis Teyssou, Symeon Papadopoulos</p>
<p>Abstract: Synthetic images disseminated online significantly differ from those used during the training and evaluation of the state-of-the-art detectors. In this work, we analyze the performance of synthetic image detectors as deceptive synthetic images evolve throughout their online lifespan. Our study reveals that, despite advancements in the field, current state-of-the-art detectors struggle to distinguish between synthetic and real images in the wild. Moreover, we show that the time elapsed since the initial online appearance of a synthetic image negatively affects the performance of most detectors. Ultimately, by employing a retrieval-assisted detection approach, we demonstrate the feasibility to maintain initial detection performance throughout the whole online lifespan of an image and enhance the average detection efficacy across several state-of-the-art detectors by 6.7% and 7.8% for balanced accuracy and AUC metrics, respectively.</p>

<p>Abstract: The semantic segmentation of high-resolution remote sensing images plays a crucial role in downstream applications such as urban planning and disaster assessment. However, existing Transformer-based methods suffer from the constraint between accuracy and efficiency. To overcome this dilemma, we propose UNetMamba, a novel Mamba-based semantic segmentation model. It incorporates a Mamba Segmentation Decoder (MSD) that can efficiently decode the complex information within high-resolution images, and a Local Supervision Module (LSM), which is train-only but can significantly enhance the perception of local contents. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UNet-Mamba outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with the mIoU increased by 0.87% on LoveDA and 0.36% on ISPRS Vaihingen, while achieving high efficiency through light weight, low memory footprint and low computational cost.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunfang Niu, Lingxiang Wu, Dong Yi, Jie Peng, Ning Jiang, Haiying Wu, Jinqiao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Fashion image editing aims to modify a person's appearance based on a given instruction. Existing methods require auxiliary tools like segmenters and keypoint extractors, lacking a flexible and unified framework. Moreover, these methods are limited in the variety of clothing types they can handle, as most datasets focus on people in clean backgrounds and only include generic garments such as tops, pants, and dresses. These limitations restrict their applicability in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we first extend an existing dataset for human generation to include a wider range of apparel and more complex backgrounds. This extended dataset features people wearing diverse items such as tops, pants, dresses, skirts, headwear, scarves, shoes, socks, and bags. Additionally, we propose AnyDesign, a diffusion-based method that enables mask-free editing on versatile areas. Users can simply input a human image along with a corresponding prompt in either text or image format. Our approach incorporates Fashion DiT, equipped with a Fashion-Guidance Attention (FGA) module designed to fuse explicit apparel types and CLIP-encoded apparel features. Both Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method delivers high-quality fashion editing and outperforms contemporary text-guided fashion editing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abiao Li, Chenlei Lv, Guofeng Mei, Yifan Zuo, Jian Zhang, Yuming Fang</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning meaningful local and global information remains a challenge in point cloud segmentation tasks. When utilizing local information, prior studies indiscriminately aggregates neighbor information from different classes to update query points, potentially compromising the distinctive feature of query points. In parallel, inaccurate modeling of long-distance contextual dependencies when utilizing global information can also impact model performance. To address these issues, we propose GSTran, a novel transformer network tailored for the segmentation task. The proposed network mainly consists of two principal components: a local geometric transformer and a global semantic transformer. In the local geometric transformer module, we explicitly calculate the geometric disparity within the local region. This enables amplifying the affinity with geometrically similar neighbor points while suppressing the association with other neighbors. In the global semantic transformer module, we design a multi-head voting strategy. This strategy evaluates semantic similarity across the entire spatial range, facilitating the precise capture of contextual dependencies. Experiments on ShapeNetPart and S3DIS benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing its superiority over other algorithms.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Duc-Hai Pham, Duc Dung Nguyen, Hoang-Anh Pham, Ho Lai Tuan, Phong Ha Nguyen, Khoi Nguyen, Rang Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate prediction of 3D semantic occupancy from 2D visual images is vital in enabling autonomous agents to comprehend their surroundings for planning and navigation. State-of-the-art methods typically employ fully supervised approaches, necessitating a huge labeled dataset acquired through expensive LiDAR sensors and meticulous voxel-wise labeling by human annotators. The resource-intensive nature of this annotating process significantly hampers the application and scalability of these methods. We introduce a novel semi-supervised framework to alleviate the dependency on densely annotated data. Our approach leverages 2D foundation models to generate essential 3D scene geometric and semantic cues, facilitating a more efficient training process. Our framework exhibits notable properties: (1) Generalizability, applicable to various 3D semantic scene completion approaches, including 2D-3D lifting and 3D-2D transformer methods. (2) Effectiveness, as demonstrated through experiments on SemanticKITTI and NYUv2, wherein our method achieves up to 85% of the fully-supervised performance using only 10% labeled data. This approach not only reduces the cost and labor associated with data annotation but also demonstrates the potential for broader adoption in camera-based systems for 3D semantic occupancy prediction.</p>

The IRP enhances defect detection accuracy through a cyclic data refinement strategy, iteratively removing misleading data points to improve model performance and robustness. We validate the IRP's effectiveness using two benchmark datasets, Kolektor SDD2 (KSDD2) and MVTec AD, covering a wide range of industrial products and defect types. Our experimental results demonstrate that the IRP consistently outperforms traditional anomaly detection models, particularly in environments with high noise levels.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minheng Ni, Chenfei Wu, Huaying Yuan, Zhengyuan Yang, Ming Gong, Lijuan Wang, Zicheng Liu, Wangmeng Zuo, Nan Duan</p>
<p>Abstract: With the advancement of generative models, the synthesis of different sensory elements such as music, visuals, and speech has achieved significant realism. However, the approach to generate multi-sensory outputs has not been fully explored, limiting the application on high-value scenarios such as of directing a film. Developing a movie director agent faces two major challenges: (1) Lack of parallelism and online scheduling with production steps: In the production of multi-sensory films, there are complex dependencies between different sensory elements, and the production time for each element varies. (2) Diverse needs and clear communication demands with users: Users often cannot clearly express their needs until they see a draft, which requires human-computer interaction and iteration to continually adjust and optimize the film content based on user feedback. To address these issues, we introduce AutoDirector, an interactive multi-sensory composition framework that supports long shots, special effects, music scoring, dubbing, and lip-syncing. This framework improves the efficiency of multi-sensory film production through automatic scheduling and supports the modification and improvement of interactive tasks to meet user needs. AutoDirector not only expands the application scope of human-machine collaboration but also demonstrates the potential of AI in collaborating with humans in the role of a film director to complete multi-sensory films.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaochen Zhang, Zekun Qi, Runpei Dong, Xiuxiu Bai, Xing Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Point cloud analysis has achieved significant development and is well-performed in multiple downstream tasks like point cloud classification and segmentation, etc. Being conscious of the simplicity of the position encoding structure in Transformer-based architectures, we attach importance to the position encoding as a high-dimensional part and the patch encoder to offer multi-scale information. Together with the sequential Transformer, the whole module with position encoding comprehensively constructs a multi-scale feature abstraction module that considers both the local parts from the patch and the global parts from center points as position encoding. With only a few parameters, the position embedding module fits the setting of PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning) tasks pretty well. Thus we unfreeze these parameters as a fine-tuning part. At the same time, we review the existing prompt and adapter tuning methods, proposing a fresh way of prompts and synthesizing them with adapters as dynamic adjustments. Our Proposed method of PEFT tasks, namely PPT, with only 1.05% of parameters for training, gets state-of-the-art results in several mainstream datasets, such as 95.01% accuracy in the ScanObjectNN OBJ_BG dataset.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11571">CHOTA: A Higher Order Accuracy Metric for Cell Tracking</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Timo Kaiser, Vladimir Ulman, Bodo Rosenhahn</p>
<p>Abstract: The evaluation of cell tracking results steers the development of tracking methods, significantly impacting biomedical research. This is quantitatively achieved by means of evaluation metrics. Unfortunately, current metrics favor local correctness and weakly reward global coherence, impeding high-level biological analysis. To also foster global coherence, we propose the CHOTA metric (Cell-specific Higher Order Tracking Accuracy) which unifies the evaluation of all relevant aspects of cell tracking: cell detections and local associations, global coherence, and lineage tracking. We achieve this by introducing a new definition of the term 'trajectory' that includes the entire cell lineage and by including this into the well-established HOTA metric from general multiple object tracking. Furthermore, we provide a detailed survey of contemporary cell tracking metrics to compare our novel CHOTA metric and to show its advantages. All metrics are extensively evaluated on state-of-the-art real-data cell tracking results and synthetic results that simulate specific tracking errors. We show that CHOTA is sensitive to all tracking errors and gives a good indication of the biologically relevant capability of a method to reconstruct the full lineage of cells. It introduces a robust and comprehensive alternative to the currently used metrics in cell tracking. Python code is available at https://github.com/CellTrackingChallenge/py-ctcmetrics .</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gabriel E. Lima, Rayson Laroca, Eduardo Santos, Eduil Nascimento Jr., David Menotti</p>
<p>Abstract: Vehicle information recognition is crucial in various practical domains, particularly in criminal investigations. Vehicle Color Recognition (VCR) has garnered significant research interest because color is a visually distinguishable attribute of vehicles and is less affected by partial occlusion and changes in viewpoint. Despite the success of existing methods for this task, the relatively low complexity of the datasets used in the literature has been largely overlooked. This research addresses this gap by compiling a new dataset representing a more challenging VCR scenario. The images - sourced from six license plate recognition datasets - are categorized into eleven colors, and their annotations were validated using official vehicle registration information. We evaluate the performance of four deep learning models on a widely adopted dataset and our proposed dataset to establish a benchmark. The results demonstrate that our dataset poses greater difficulty for the tested models and highlights scenarios that require further exploration in VCR. Remarkably, nighttime scenes account for a significant portion of the errors made by the best-performing model. This research provides a foundation for future studies on VCR, while also offering valuable insights for the field of fine-grained vehicle classification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmed S. Abdelrahman, Mohamed Abdel-Aty, Dongdong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Computer vision has advanced research methodologies, enhancing system services across various fields. It is a core component in traffic monitoring systems for improving road safety; however, these monitoring systems don't preserve the privacy of pedestrians who appear in the videos, potentially revealing their identities. Addressing this issue, our paper introduces Video-to-Text Pedestrian Monitoring (VTPM), which monitors pedestrian movements at intersections and generates real-time textual reports, including traffic signal and weather information. VTPM uses computer vision models for pedestrian detection and tracking, achieving a latency of 0.05 seconds per video frame. Additionally, it detects crossing violations with 90.2% accuracy by incorporating traffic signal data. The proposed framework is equipped with Phi-3 mini-4k to generate real-time textual reports of pedestrian activity while stating safety concerns like crossing violations, conflicts, and the impact of weather on their behavior with latency of 0.33 seconds. To enhance comprehensive analysis of the generated textual reports, Phi-3 medium is fine-tuned for historical analysis of these generated textual reports. This fine-tuning enables more reliable analysis about the pedestrian safety at intersections, effectively detecting patterns and safety critical events. The proposed VTPM offers a more efficient alternative to video footage by using textual reports reducing memory usage, saving up to 253 million percent, eliminating privacy issues, and enabling comprehensive interactive historical analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cheng-Yi Lee, Cheng-Chang Tsai, Chia-Mu Yu, Chun-Shien Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual State Space Model (VSS) has demonstrated remarkable performance in various computer vision tasks. However, in the process of development, backdoor attacks have brought severe challenges to security. Such attacks cause an infected model to predict target labels when a specific trigger is activated, while the model behaves normally on benign samples. In this paper, we conduct systematic experiments to comprehend on robustness of VSS through the lens of backdoor attacks, specifically how the state space model (SSM) mechanism affects robustness. We first investigate the vulnerability of VSS to different backdoor triggers and reveal that the SSM mechanism, which captures contextual information within patches, makes the VSS model more susceptible to backdoor triggers compared to models without SSM. Furthermore, we analyze the sensitivity of the VSS model to patch processing techniques and discover that these triggers are effectively disrupted. Based on these observations, we consider an effective backdoor for the VSS model that recurs in each patch to resist patch perturbations. Extensive experiments across three datasets and various backdoor attacks reveal that the VSS model performs comparably to Transformers (ViTs) but is less robust than the Gated CNNs, which comprise only stacked Gated CNN blocks without SSM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xu Dong, Xinran Liu, Wanqing Li, Anthony Adeyemi-Ejeye, Andrew Gilbert</p>
<p>Abstract: Long-term Action Quality Assessment (AQA) evaluates the execution of activities in videos. However, the length presents challenges in fine-grained interpretability, with current AQA methods typically producing a single score by averaging clip features, lacking detailed semantic meanings of individual clips. Long-term videos pose additional difficulty due to the complexity and diversity of actions, exacerbating interpretability challenges. While query-based transformer networks offer promising long-term modeling capabilities, their interpretability in AQA remains unsatisfactory due to a phenomenon we term Temporal Skipping, where the model skips self-attention layers to prevent output degradation. To address this, we propose an attention loss function and a query initialization method to enhance performance and interpretability. Additionally, we introduce a weight-score regression module designed to approximate the scoring patterns observed in human judgments and replace conventional single-score regression, improving the rationality of interpretability. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on three real-world, long-term AQA benchmarks. Our code is available at: https://github.com/dx199771/Interpretability-AQA</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Paul Ungermann, Armin Ettenhofer, Matthias Nie{\ss}ner, Barbara Roessle</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has shown impressive novel view synthesis results; nonetheless, it is vulnerable to dynamic objects polluting the input data of an otherwise static scene, so called distractors. Distractors have severe impact on the rendering quality as they get represented as view-dependent effects or result in floating artifacts. Our goal is to identify and ignore such distractors during the 3D Gaussian optimization to obtain a clean reconstruction. To this end, we take a self-supervised approach that looks at the image residuals during the optimization to determine areas that have likely been falsified by a distractor. In addition, we leverage a pretrained segmentation network to provide object awareness, enabling more accurate exclusion of distractors. This way, we obtain segmentation masks of distractors to effectively ignore them in the loss formulation. We demonstrate that our approach is robust to various distractors and strongly improves rendering quality on distractor-polluted scenes, improving PSNR by 1.86dB compared to 3D Gaussian Splatting.</p>

<p>Abstract: Assembly state recognition facilitates the execution of assembly procedures, offering feedback to enhance efficiency and minimize errors. However, recognizing assembly states poses challenges in scalability, since parts are frequently updated, and the robustness to execution errors remains underexplored. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an approach based on representation learning and the novel intermediate-state informed loss function modification (ISIL). ISIL leverages unlabeled transitions between states and demonstrates significant improvements in clustering and classification performance for all tested architectures and losses. Despite being trained exclusively on images without execution errors, thorough analysis on error states demonstrates that our approach accurately distinguishes between correct states and states with various types of execution errors. The integration of the proposed algorithm can offer meaningful assistance to workers and mitigate unexpected losses due to procedural mishaps in industrial settings.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liyao Jiang, Negar Hassanpour, Mohammad Salameh, Mohan Sai Singamsetti, Fengyu Sun, Wei Lu, Di Niu</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating high-quality images given a text prompt. However, ensuring the prompt-image alignment remains a considerable challenge, i.e., generating images that faithfully align with the prompt's semantics. Recent works attempt to improve the faithfulness by optimizing the latent code, which potentially could cause the latent code to go out-of-distribution and thus produce unrealistic images. In this paper, we propose FRAP, a simple, yet effective approach based on adaptively adjusting the per-token prompt weights to improve prompt-image alignment and authenticity of the generated images. We design an online algorithm to adaptively update each token's weight coefficient, which is achieved by minimizing a unified objective function that encourages object presence and the binding of object-modifier pairs. Through extensive evaluations, we show FRAP generates images with significantly higher prompt-image alignment to prompts from complex datasets, while having a lower average latency compared to recent latent code optimization methods, e.g., 4 seconds faster than D&B on the COCO-Subject dataset. Furthermore, through visual comparisons and evaluation on the CLIP-IQA-Real metric, we show that FRAP not only improves prompt-image alignment but also generates more authentic images with realistic appearances. We also explore combining FRAP with prompt rewriting LLM to recover their degraded prompt-image alignment, where we observe improvements in both prompt-image alignment and image quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rory Ward, John G. Breslin, Peter Corcoran</p>
<p>Abstract: Adding color to black-and-white speaker videos automatically is a highly desirable technique. It is an artistic process that requires interactivity with humans for the best results. Many existing automatic video colorization systems provide little opportunity for the user to guide the colorization process. In this work, we introduce a novel automatic speaker video colorization system which provides controllability to the user while also maintaining high colorization quality relative to state-of-the-art techniques. We name this system ControlCol. ControlCol performs 3.5% better than the previous state-of-the-art DeOldify on the Grid and Lombard Grid datasets when PSNR, SSIM, FID and FVD are used as metrics. This result is also supported by our human evaluation, where in a head-to-head comparison, ControlCol is preferred 90% of the time to DeOldify. Example videos can be seen in the supplementary material.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11721">Iterative Object Count Optimization for Text-to-image Diffusion Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Oz Zafar, Lior Wolf, Idan Schwartz</p>
<p>Abstract: We address a persistent challenge in text-to-image models: accurately generating a specified number of objects. Current models, which learn from image-text pairs, inherently struggle with counting, as training data cannot depict every possible number of objects for any given object. To solve this, we propose optimizing the generated image based on a counting loss derived from a counting model that aggregates an object\'s potential. Employing an out-of-the-box counting model is challenging for two reasons: first, the model requires a scaling hyperparameter for the potential aggregation that varies depending on the viewpoint of the objects, and second, classifier guidance techniques require modified models that operate on noisy intermediate diffusion steps. To address these challenges, we propose an iterated online training mode that improves the accuracy of inferred images while altering the text conditioning embedding and dynamically adjusting hyperparameters. Our method offers three key advantages: (i) it can consider non-derivable counting techniques based on detection models, (ii) it is a zero-shot plug-and-play solution facilitating rapid changes to the counting techniques and image generation methods, and (iii) the optimized counting token can be reused to generate accurate images without additional optimization. We evaluate the generation of various objects and show significant improvements in accuracy. The project page is available at https://ozzafar.github.io/count_token.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aniek Eijpe, Valentina Corbetta, Kalina Chupetlovska, Regina Beets-Tan, Wilson Silva</p>
<p>Abstract: Cross-modal medical image segmentation presents a significant challenge, as different imaging modalities produce images with varying resolutions, contrasts, and appearances of anatomical structures. We introduce compositionality as an inductive bias in a cross-modal segmentation network to improve segmentation performance and interpretability while reducing complexity. The proposed network is an end-to-end cross-modal segmentation framework that enforces compositionality on the learned representations using learnable von Mises-Fisher kernels. These kernels facilitate content-style disentanglement in the learned representations, resulting in compositional content representations that are inherently interpretable and effectively disentangle different anatomical structures. The experimental results demonstrate enhanced segmentation performance and reduced computational costs on multiple medical datasets. Additionally, we demonstrate the interpretability of the learned compositional features. Code and checkpoints will be publicly available at: https://github.com/Trustworthy-AI-UU-NKI/Cross-Modal-Segmentation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuliang Cai, Mohammad Rostami</p>
<p>Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) have shown significant performance boost in various application domains. However, adopting them to deal with several sequentially encountered tasks has been challenging because finetuning a VLM on a task normally leads to reducing its generalization power and the capacity of learning new tasks as well as causing catastrophic forgetting on previously learned tasks. Enabling using VLMs in multimodal continual learning (CL) settings can help to address such scenarios. To improve generalization capacity and prevent catastrophic forgetting, we propose a novel prompt-based CL method for VLMs, namely $\textbf{Clu}$ster-based $\textbf{Mo}$dality Fusion Prompt (\textbf{CluMo}). We design a novel \textbf{Key-Key-Prompt} pair, where each prompt is associated with a visual prompt key and a textual prompt key. We adopt a two-stage training strategy. During the first stage, the single-modal keys are trained via $K$-means clustering algorithm to help select the best semantically matched prompt. During the second stage, the prompt keys are frozen, the selected prompt is attached to the input for training the VLM in the CL scenario. Experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves SOTA performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Phuc D. A. Nguyen, Minh Luu, Anh Tran, Cuong Pham, Khoi Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: Open-Vocab 3D Instance Segmentation methods (OV-3DIS) have recently demonstrated their ability to generalize to unseen objects. However, these methods still depend on predefined class names during testing, restricting the autonomy of agents. To mitigate this constraint, we propose a novel problem termed Open-Ended 3D Instance Segmentation (OE-3DIS), which eliminates the necessity for predefined class names during testing. Moreover, we contribute a comprehensive set of strong baselines, derived from OV-3DIS approaches and leveraging 2D Multimodal Large Language Models. To assess the performance of our OE-3DIS system, we introduce a novel Open-Ended score, evaluating both the semantic and geometric quality of predicted masks and their associated class names, alongside the standard AP score. Our approach demonstrates significant performance improvements over the baselines on the ScanNet200 and ScanNet++ datasets. Remarkably, our method surpasses the performance of Open3DIS, the current state-of-the-art method in OV-3DIS, even in the absence of ground-truth object class names.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shehreen Azad, Yash Jain, Rishit Garg, Yogesh S Rawat, Vibhav Vineet</p>
<p>Abstract: Geometric understanding is crucial for navigating and interacting with our environment. While large Vision Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities, deploying them in real-world scenarios necessitates a comparable geometric understanding in visual perception. In this work, we focus on the geometric comprehension of these models; specifically targeting the depths and heights of objects within a scene. Our observations reveal that, although VLMs excel in basic geometric properties perception such as shape and size, they encounter significant challenges in reasoning about the depth and height of objects. To address this, we introduce a suite of benchmark datasets encompassing Synthetic 2D, Synthetic 3D, and Real-World scenarios to rigorously evaluate these aspects. We benchmark 17 state-of-the-art VLMs using these datasets and find that they consistently struggle with both depth and height perception. Our key insights include detailed analyses of the shortcomings in depth and height reasoning capabilities of VLMs and the inherent bias present in these models. This study aims to pave the way for the development of VLMs with enhanced geometric understanding, crucial for real-world applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yulin Ren, Xin Li, Mengxi Guo, Bingchen Li, Shijie Zhao, Zhibo Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: We present MambaCSR, a simple but effective framework based on Mamba for the challenging compressed image super-resolution (CSR) task. Particularly, the scanning strategies of Mamba are crucial for effective contextual knowledge modeling in the restoration process despite it relying on selective state space modeling for all tokens. In this work, we propose an efficient dual-interleaved scanning paradigm (DIS) for CSR, which is composed of two scanning strategies: (i) hierarchical interleaved scanning is designed to comprehensively capture and utilize the most potential contextual information within an image by simultaneously taking advantage of the local window-based and sequential scanning methods; (ii) horizontal-to-vertical interleaved scanning is proposed to reduce the computational cost by leaving the redundancy between the scanning of different directions. To overcome the non-uniform compression artifacts, we also propose position-aligned cross-scale scanning to model multi-scale contextual information. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks have shown the great performance of our MambaCSR in the compressed image super-resolution task. The code will be soon available in~\textcolor{magenta}{\url{https://github.com/renyulin-f/MambaCSR}}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiqiang Wu, Yingjie Liu, Hanlin Dong, Xuan Tang, Jian Yang, Bo Jin, Mingsong Chen, Xian Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Introducing Group Equivariant Convolution (GConv) empowers models to explore symmetries hidden in visual data, improving their performance. However, in real-world scenarios, objects or scenes often exhibit perturbations of a symmetric system, specifically a deviation from a symmetric architecture, which can be characterized by a non-trivial action of a symmetry group, known as Symmetry-Breaking. Traditional GConv methods are limited by the strict operation rules in the group space, only ensuring features remain strictly equivariant under limited group transformations, making it difficult to adapt to Symmetry-Breaking or non-rigid transformations. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel Relaxed Rotation GConv (R2GConv) with our defined Relaxed Rotation-Equivariant group $\mathbf{R}_4$. Furthermore, we propose a Relaxed Rotation-Equivariant Network (R2Net) as the backbone and further develop the Symmetry-Breaking Object Detector (SBDet) for 2D object detection built upon it. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed R2GConv in natural image classification tasks, and SBDet achieves excellent performance in object detection tasks with improved generalization capabilities and robustness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chetraj Pandey, Anli Ji, Jinsu Hong, Rafal A. Angryk, Berkay Aydin</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel loss function aimed at optimizing the binary flare prediction problem by embedding the intrinsic ordinal flare characteristics into the binary cross-entropy (BCE) loss function. This modification is intended to provide the model with better guidance based on the ordinal characteristics of the data and improve the overall performance of the models. For our experiments, we employ a ResNet34-based model with transfer learning to predict $\geq$M-class flares by utilizing the shape-based features of magnetograms of active region (AR) patches spanning from $-$90$^{\circ}$ to $+$90$^{\circ}$ of solar longitude as our input data. We use a composite skill score (CSS) as our evaluation metric, which is calculated as the geometric mean of the True Skill Score (TSS) and the Heidke Skill Score (HSS) to rank and compare our models' performance. The primary contributions of this work are as follows: (i) We introduce a novel approach to encode ordinality into a binary loss function showing an application to solar flare prediction, (ii) We enhance solar flare forecasting by enabling flare predictions for each AR across the entire solar disk, without any longitudinal restrictions, and evaluate and compare performance. (iii) Our candidate model, optimized with the proposed loss function, shows an improvement of $\sim$7%, $\sim$4%, and $\sim$3% for AR patches within $\pm$30$^\circ$, $\pm$60$^\circ$, and $\pm$90$^\circ$ of solar longitude, respectively in terms of CSS, when compared with standard BCE. Additionally, we demonstrate the ability to issue flare forecasts for ARs in near-limb regions (regions between $\pm$60$^{\circ}$ to $\pm$90$^{\circ}$) with a CSS=0.34 (TSS=0.50 and HSS=0.23), expanding the scope of AR-based models for solar flare prediction. This advances the reliability of solar flare forecasts, leading to more effective prediction capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haipeng Zhou, Honqiu Wang, Tian Ye, Zhaohu Xing, Jun Ma, Ping Li, Qiong Wang, Lei Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Video Shadow Detection (VSD) aims to detect the shadow masks with frame sequence. Existing works suffer from inefficient temporal learning. Moreover, few works address the VSD problem by considering the characteristic (i.e., boundary) of shadow. Motivated by this, we propose a Timeline and Boundary Guided Diffusion (TBGDiff) network for VSD where we take account of the past-future temporal guidance and boundary information jointly. In detail, we design a Dual Scale Aggregation (DSA) module for better temporal understanding by rethinking the affinity of the long-term and short-term frames for the clipped video. Next, we introduce Shadow Boundary Aware Attention (SBAA) to utilize the edge contexts for capturing the characteristics of shadows. Moreover, we are the first to introduce the Diffusion model for VSD in which we explore a Space-Time Encoded Embedding (STEE) to inject the temporal guidance for Diffusion to conduct shadow detection. Benefiting from these designs, our model can not only capture the temporal information but also the shadow property. Extensive experiments show that the performance of our approach overtakes the state-of-the-art methods, verifying the effectiveness of our components.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11795">EE-MLLM: A Data-Efficient and Compute-Efficient Multimodal Large Language Model</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Feipeng Ma, Yizhou Zhou, Hebei Li, Zilong He, Siying Wu, Fengyun Rao, Yueyi Zhang, Xiaoyan Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: In the realm of multimodal research, numerous studies leverage substantial image-text pairs to conduct modal alignment learning, transforming Large Language Models (LLMs) into Multimodal LLMs and excelling in a variety of visual-language tasks. The prevailing methodologies primarily fall into two categories: self-attention-based and cross-attention-based methods. While self-attention-based methods offer superior data efficiency due to their simple MLP architecture, they often suffer from lower computational efficiency due to concatenating visual and textual tokens as input for LLM. Conversely, cross-attention-based methods, although less data-efficient due to additional learnable parameters, exhibit higher computational efficiency by avoiding long sequence input for LLM. To address these trade-offs, we introduce the Data-Efficient and Compute-Efficient Multimodal Large Language Model (EE-MLLM). Without introducing additional modules or learnable parameters, EE-MLLM achieves both data and compute efficiency. Specifically, we modify the original self-attention mechanism in MLLM to a composite attention mechanism. This mechanism has two key characteristics: 1) Eliminating the computational overhead of self-attention within visual tokens to achieve compute efficiency, and 2) Reusing the weights on each layer of LLM to facilitate effective modality alignment between vision and language for data efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of EE-MLLM across a range of benchmarks, including general-purpose datasets like MMBench and SeedBench, as well as fine-grained tasks such as TextVQA and DocVQA.</p>

<p>Abstract: Traditional visual storytelling is complex, requiring specialized knowledge and substantial resources, yet often constrained by human creativity and creation precision. While Large Language Models (LLMs) enhance visual storytelling, current approaches often limit themselves to 2D visuals or oversimplify stories through motion synthesis and behavioral simulation, failing to create comprehensive, multi-dimensional narratives. To this end, we present Story3D-Agent, a pioneering approach that leverages the capabilities of LLMs to transform provided narratives into 3D-rendered visualizations. By integrating procedural modeling, our approach enables precise control over multi-character actions and motions, as well as diverse decorative elements, ensuring the long-range and dynamic 3D representation. Furthermore, our method supports narrative extension through logical reasoning, ensuring that generated content remains consistent with existing conditions. We have thoroughly evaluated our Story3D-Agent to validate its effectiveness, offering a basic framework to advance 3D story representation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chun-Yen Shih, Li-Xuan Peng, Jia-Wei Liao, Ernie Chu, Cheng-Fu Chou, Jun-Cheng Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion Models have emerged as powerful generative models for high-quality image synthesis, with many subsequent image editing techniques based on them. However, the ease of text-based image editing introduces significant risks, such as malicious editing for scams or intellectual property infringement. Previous works have attempted to safeguard images from diffusion-based editing by adding imperceptible perturbations. These methods are costly and specifically target prevalent Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), while Pixel-domain Diffusion Models (PDMs) remain largely unexplored and robust against such attacks. Our work addresses this gap by proposing a novel attacking framework with a feature representation attack loss that exploits vulnerabilities in denoising UNets and a latent optimization strategy to enhance the naturalness of protected images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in attacking dominant PDM-based editing methods (e.g., SDEdit) while maintaining reasonable protection fidelity and robustness against common defense methods. Additionally, our framework is extensible to LDMs, achieving comparable performance to existing approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiuwei Xu, Huangxing Chen, Linqing Zhao, Ziwei Wang, Jie Zhou, Jiwen Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Embodied tasks require the agent to fully understand 3D scenes simultaneously with its exploration, so an online, real-time, fine-grained and highly-generalized 3D perception model is desperately needed. Since high-quality 3D data is limited, directly training such a model in 3D is almost infeasible. Meanwhile, vision foundation models (VFM) has revolutionized the field of 2D computer vision with superior performance, which makes the use of VFM to assist embodied 3D perception a promising direction. However, most existing VFM-assisted 3D perception methods are either offline or too slow that cannot be applied in practical embodied tasks. In this paper, we aim to leverage Segment Anything Model (SAM) for real-time 3D instance segmentation in an online setting. This is a challenging problem since future frames are not available in the input streaming RGB-D video, and an instance may be observed in several frames so object matching between frames is required. To address these challenges, we first propose a geometric-aware query lifting module to represent the 2D masks generated by SAM by 3D-aware queries, which is then iteratively refined by a dual-level query decoder. In this way, the 2D masks are transferred to fine-grained shapes on 3D point clouds. Benefit from the query representation for 3D masks, we can compute the similarity matrix between the 3D masks from different views by efficient matrix operation, which enables real-time inference. Experiments on ScanNet, ScanNet200, SceneNN and 3RScan show our method achieves leading performance even compared with offline methods. Our method also demonstrates great generalization ability in several zero-shot dataset transferring experiments and show great potential in open-vocabulary and data-efficient setting. Code and demo are available at https://xuxw98.github.io/ESAM/, with only one RTX 3090 GPU required for training and evaluation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable perceptual and reasoning abilities, typically comprising a Vision Encoder, an Adapter, and a Large Language Model (LLM). The adapter serves as the critical bridge between the visual and language components. However, training adapters with image-level supervision often results in significant misalignment, undermining the LLMs' capabilities and limiting the potential of Multimodal LLMs. To address this, we introduce Supervised Embedding Alignment (SEA), a token-level alignment method that leverages vision-language pre-trained models, such as CLIP, to align visual tokens with the LLM's embedding space through contrastive learning. This approach ensures a more coherent integration of visual and language representations, enhancing the performance and interpretability of multimodal LLMs while preserving their inherent capabilities. Extensive experiments show that SEA effectively improves MLLMs, particularly for smaller models, without adding extra data or inference computation. SEA also lays the groundwork for developing more general and adaptable solutions to enhance multimodal systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce Synthetic Playground (SynPlay), a new synthetic human dataset that aims to bring out the diversity of human appearance in the real world. We focus on two factors to achieve a level of diversity that has not yet been seen in previous works: i) realistic human motions and poses and ii) multiple camera viewpoints towards human instances. We first use a game engine and its library-provided elementary motions to create games where virtual players can take less-constrained and natural movements while following the game rules (i.e., rule-guided motion design as opposed to detail-guided design). We then augment the elementary motions with real human motions captured with a motion capture device. To render various human appearances in the games from multiple viewpoints, we use seven virtual cameras encompassing the ground and aerial views, capturing abundant aerial-vs-ground and dynamic-vs-static attributes of the scene. Through extensive and carefully-designed experiments, we show that using SynPlay in model training leads to enhanced accuracy over existing synthetic datasets for human detection and segmentation. The benefit of SynPlay becomes even greater for tasks in the data-scarce regime, such as few-shot and cross-domain learning tasks. These results clearly demonstrate that SynPlay can be used as an essential dataset with rich attributes of complex human appearances and poses suitable for model pretraining. SynPlay dataset comprising over 73k images and 6.5M human instances, is available for download at https://synplaydataset.github.io/.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have exhibited proficiencies across many visual tasks. Although numerous well-known benchmarks exist to evaluate model performance, they increasingly have insufficient headroom. As such, there is a pressing need for a new generation of benchmarks challenging enough for the next generation of LMMs. One area that LMMs show potential is graph analysis, specifically, the tasks an analyst might typically perform when interpreting figures such as estimating the mean, intercepts or correlations of functions and data series. In this work, we introduce GRAB, a graph analysis benchmark, fit for current and future frontier LMMs. Our benchmark is entirely synthetic, ensuring high-quality, noise-free questions. GRAB is comprised of 2170 questions, covering four tasks and 23 graph properties. We evaluate 20 LMMs on GRAB, finding it to be a challenging benchmark, with the highest performing model attaining a score of just 21.7%. Finally, we conduct various ablations to investigate where the models succeed and struggle. We release GRAB to encourage progress in this important, growing domain.</p>

To address this, various safety mechanisms and red teaming attack methods are proposed to enhance or expose the T2I model's capability to generate unsuitable content. However, many red teaming attack methods assume knowledge of the text encoders, limiting their practical usage. In this work, we rethink the case of \textit{purely black-box} attacks without prior knowledge of the T2l model. To overcome the unavailability of gradients and the inability to optimize attacks within a discrete prompt space, we propose DiffZOO which applies Zeroth Order Optimization to procure gradient approximations and harnesses both C-PRV and D-PRV to enhance attack prompts within the discrete prompt domain. We evaluated our method across multiple safety mechanisms of the T2I diffusion model and online servers. Experiments on multiple state-of-the-art safety mechanisms show that DiffZOO attains an 8.5% higher average attack success rate than previous works, hence its promise as a practical red teaming tool for T2l models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kai-liang Lu, Yu-meng Su, Cheng Qiu, Zhuo Bi, Wen-jun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper compared physics-informed neural network (PINN), conventional neural network (NN) and numerical discretization methods on solving differential equations through literature research. We formalized the mathematical framework and computational flow of the soft-constrained PINN method for solving differential equations (e.g., ODEs/PDEs). Its working mechanism and its accuracy and efficiency were experimentally verified by solving typical linear and non-linear oscillator ODEs. The implementation of the PINN method based on DeepXDE is not only light code and efficient in training, but also flexible across platforms. PINN greatly reduces the need for labeled data: when the nonlinearity of the ODE is weak, a very small amount of supervised training data plus a small amount of collocation points are sufficient to predict the solution; in the minimalist case, only one or two training points (with initial values) are needed for first- or second-order ODEs, respectively. Strongly nonlinear ODE also require only an appropriate increase in the number of training and collocation points, which still has significant advantages over conventional NN. With the aid of collocation points and the use of physical information, PINN has the ability to extrapolate data outside the time domain covered by the training set, and is robust to noisy data, thus with enhanced generalization capabilities. Training is accelerated when the gains obtained along with the reduction in the amount of data outweigh the delay caused by the increase in the loss function terms. The soft-constrained PINN method can easily impose a physical law (e.g., energy conservation) constraint by adding a regularization term to the total loss function, thus improving the solution performance of ODEs that obey this physical law.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengwei Xie, Siang Chen, Dingchang Hu, Yixiang Dai, Kaiqin Yang, Guijin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: In the context of human-robot interaction and collaboration scenarios, robotic grasping still encounters numerous challenges. Traditional grasp detection methods generally analyze the entire scene to predict grasps, leading to redundancy and inefficiency. In this work, we reconsider 6-DoF grasp detection from a target-referenced perspective and propose a Target-Oriented Grasp Network (TOGNet). TOGNet specifically targets local, object-agnostic region patches to predict grasps more efficiently. It integrates seamlessly with multimodal human guidance, including language instructions, pointing gestures, and interactive clicks. Thus our system comprises two primary functional modules: a guidance module that identifies the target object in 3D space and TOGNet, which detects region-focal 6-DoF grasps around the target, facilitating subsequent motion planning. Through 50 target-grasping simulation experiments in cluttered scenes, our system achieves a success rate improvement of about 13.7%. In real-world experiments, we demonstrate that our method excels in various target-oriented grasping scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohit Prabhushankar, Kiran Kokilepersaud, Jorge Quesada, Yavuz Yarici, Chen Zhou, Mohammad Alotaibi, Ghassan AlRegib, Ahmad Mustafa, Yusufjon Kumakov</p>
<p>Abstract: Crowdsourcing annotations has created a paradigm shift in the availability of labeled data for machine learning. Availability of large datasets has accelerated progress in common knowledge applications involving visual and language data. However, specialized applications that require expert labels lag in data availability. One such application is fault segmentation in subsurface imaging. Detecting, tracking, and analyzing faults has broad societal implications in predicting fluid flows, earthquakes, and storing excess atmospheric CO$_2$. However, delineating faults with current practices is a labor-intensive activity that requires precise analysis of subsurface imaging data by geophysicists. In this paper, we propose the $\texttt{CRACKS}$ dataset to detect and segment faults in subsurface images by utilizing crowdsourced resources. We leverage Amazon Mechanical Turk to obtain fault delineations from sections of the Netherlands North Sea subsurface images from (i) $26$ novices who have no exposure to subsurface data and were shown a video describing and labeling faults, (ii) $8$ practitioners who have previously interacted and worked on subsurface data, (iii) one geophysicist to label $7636$ faults in the region. Note that all novices, practitioners, and the expert segment faults on the same subsurface volume with disagreements between and among the novices and practitioners. Additionally, each fault annotation is equipped with the confidence level of the annotator. The paper provides benchmarks on detecting and segmenting the expert labels, given the novice and practitioner labels.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zixuan Liu, Hanwen Xu, Addie Woicik, Linda G. Shapiro, Marian Blazes, Yue Wu, Cecilia S. Lee, Aaron Y. Lee, Sheng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has become critical for diagnosing retinal diseases as it enables 3D images of the retina and optic nerve. OCT acquisition is fast, non-invasive, affordable, and scalable. Due to its broad applicability, massive numbers of OCT images have been accumulated in routine exams, making it possible to train large-scale foundation models that can generalize to various diagnostic tasks using OCT images. Nevertheless, existing foundation models for OCT only consider 2D image slices, overlooking the rich 3D structure. Here, we present OCTCube, a 3D foundation model pre-trained on 26,605 3D OCT volumes encompassing 1.62 million 2D OCT images. OCTCube is developed based on 3D masked autoencoders and exploits FlashAttention to reduce the larger GPU memory usage caused by modeling 3D volumes. OCTCube outperforms 2D models when predicting 8 retinal diseases in both inductive and cross-dataset settings, indicating that utilizing the 3D structure in the model instead of 2D data results in significant improvement. OCTCube further shows superior performance on cross-device prediction and when predicting systemic diseases, such as diabetes and hypertension, further demonstrating its strong generalizability. Finally, we propose a contrastive-self-supervised-learning-based OCT-IR pre-training framework (COIP) for cross-modality analysis on OCT and infrared retinal (IR) images, where the OCT volumes are embedded using OCTCube. We demonstrate that COIP enables accurate alignment between OCT and IR en face images. Collectively, OCTCube, a 3D OCT foundation model, demonstrates significantly better performance against 2D models on 27 out of 29 tasks and comparable performance on the other two tasks, paving the way for AI-based retinal disease diagnosis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christos Constantinou, Georgios Ioannides, Aman Chadha, Aaron Elkins, Edwin Simpson</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) data is crucial in machine learning applications to mitigate the risk of model overconfidence, thereby enhancing the reliability and safety of deployed systems. The majority of existing OOD detection methods predominantly address uni-modal inputs, such as images or texts. In the context of multi-modal documents, there is a notable lack of extensive research on the performance of these methods, which have primarily been developed with a focus on computer vision tasks. We propose a novel methodology termed as attention head masking (AHM) for multi-modal OOD tasks in document classification systems. Our empirical results demonstrate that the proposed AHM method outperforms all state-of-the-art approaches and significantly decreases the false positive rate (FPR) compared to existing solutions up to 7.5\%. This methodology generalizes well to multi-modal data, such as documents, where visual and textual information are modeled under the same Transformer architecture. To address the scarcity of high-quality publicly available document datasets and encourage further research on OOD detection for documents, we introduce FinanceDocs, a new document AI dataset. Our code and dataset are publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingya Zhang, Limei Gu, Tingshen Ling, Xianping Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: In the field of medical image segmentation, models based on both CNN and Transformer have been thoroughly investigated. However, CNNs have limited modeling capabilities for long-range dependencies, making it challenging to exploit the semantic information within images fully. On the other hand, the quadratic computational complexity poses a challenge for Transformers. State Space Models (SSMs), such as Mamba, have been recognized as a promising method. They not only demonstrate superior performance in modeling long-range interactions, but also preserve a linear computational complexity. The hybrid mechanism of SSM (State Space Model) and Transformer, after meticulous design, can enhance its capability for efficient modeling of visual features. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that integrating the self-attention mechanism into the hybrid part behind the layers of Mamba's architecture can greatly improve the modeling capacity to capture long-range spatial dependencies. In this paper, leveraging the hybrid mechanism of SSM, we propose a U-shape architecture model for medical image segmentation, named Hybird Transformer vision Mamba UNet (HTM-UNet). We conduct comprehensive experiments on the ISIC17, ISIC18, CVC-300, CVC-ClinicDB, Kvasir, CVC-ColonDB, ETIS-Larib PolypDB public datasets and ZD-LCI-GIM private dataset. The results indicate that HTM-UNet exhibits competitive performance in medical image segmentation tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/simzhangbest/HMT-Unet.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tajamul Ashraf, Janibul Bashir</p>
<p>Abstract: One of the major challenges of the twenty-first century is climate change, evidenced by rising sea levels, melting glaciers, and increased storm frequency. Accurate temperature forecasting is vital for understanding and mitigating these impacts. Traditional data-driven models often use recurrent neural networks (RNNs) but face limitations in parallelization, especially with longer sequences. To address this, we introduce a novel approach based on the FocalNet Transformer architecture. Our Focal modulation Attention Encoder (FATE) framework operates in a multi-tensor format, utilizing tensorized modulation to capture spatial and temporal nuances in meteorological data. Comparative evaluations against existing transformer encoders, 3D CNNs, LSTM, and ConvLSTM models show that FATE excels at identifying complex patterns in temperature data. Additionally, we present a new labeled dataset, the Climate Change Parameter dataset (CCPD), containing 40 years of data from Jammu and Kashmir on seven climate-related parameters. Experiments with real-world temperature datasets from the USA, Canada, and Europe show accuracy improvements of 12\%, 23\%, and 28\%, respectively, over current state-of-the-art models. Our CCPD dataset also achieved a 24\% improvement in accuracy. To support reproducible research, we have released the source code and pre-trained FATE model at \href{https://github.com/Tajamul21/FATE}{https://github.com/Tajamul21/FATE}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wuxin Wang, Weicheng Ni, Tao Han, Lei Bai, Boheng Duan, Kaijun Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning (DL) have led to the development of several Large Weather Models (LWMs) that rival state-of-the-art (SOTA) numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems. Up to now, these models still rely on traditional NWP-generated analysis fields as input and are far from being an autonomous system. While researchers are exploring data-driven data assimilation (DA) models to generate accurate initial fields for LWMs, the lack of a standard benchmark impedes the fair evaluation among different data-driven DA algorithms. Here, we introduce DABench, a benchmark dataset utilizing ERA5 data as ground truth to guide the development of end-to-end data-driven weather prediction systems. DABench contributes four standard features: (1) sparse and noisy simulated observations under the guidance of the observing system simulation experiment method; (2) a skillful pre-trained weather prediction model to generate background fields while fairly evaluating the impact of assimilation outcomes on predictions; (3) standardized evaluation metrics for model comparison; (4) a strong baseline called the DA Transformer (DaT). DaT integrates the four-dimensional variational DA prior knowledge into the Transformer model and outperforms the SOTA in physical state reconstruction, named 4DVarNet. Furthermore, we exemplify the development of an end-to-end data-driven weather prediction system by integrating DaT with the prediction model. Researchers can leverage DABench to develop their models and compare performance against established baselines, which will benefit the future advancements of data-driven weather prediction systems. The code is available on this Github repository and the dataset is available at the Baidu Drive.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiao Mo, Yukang Ding, Jinhua Hao, Qiang Zhu, Ming Sun, Chao Zhou, Feiyu Chen, Shuyuan Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning-based methods have shown remarkable performance in single JPEG artifacts removal task. However, existing methods tend to degrade on double JPEG images, which are prevalent in real-world scenarios. To address this issue, we propose Offset-Aware Partition Transformer for double JPEG artifacts removal, termed as OAPT. We conduct an analysis of double JPEG compression that results in up to four patterns within each 8x8 block and design our model to cluster the similar patterns to remedy the difficulty of restoration. Our OAPT consists of two components: compression offset predictor and image reconstructor. Specifically, the predictor estimates pixel offsets between the first and second compression, which are then utilized to divide different patterns. The reconstructor is mainly based on several Hybrid Partition Attention Blocks (HPAB), combining vanilla window-based self-attention and sparse attention for clustered pattern features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OAPT outperforms the state-of-the-art method by more than 0.16dB in double JPEG image restoration task. Moreover, without increasing any computation cost, the pattern clustering module in HPAB can serve as a plugin to enhance other transformer-based image restoration methods.

<p>Abstract: Embodied learning for object-centric robotic manipulation is a rapidly developing and challenging area in embodied AI. It is crucial for advancing next-generation intelligent robots and has garnered significant interest recently. Unlike data-driven machine learning methods, embodied learning focuses on robot learning through physical interaction with the environment and perceptual feedback, making it especially suitable for robotic manipulation. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of the latest advancements in this field and categorize the existing work into three main branches: 1) Embodied perceptual learning, which aims to predict object pose and affordance through various data representations; 2) Embodied policy learning, which focuses on generating optimal robotic decisions using methods such as reinforcement learning and imitation learning; 3) Embodied task-oriented learning, designed to optimize the robot's performance based on the characteristics of different tasks in object grasping and manipulation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuan Zhao, Zhenqi Jia, Rui Liu, De Hu, Feilong Bao, Guanglai Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatic Video Dubbing (AVD) aims to take the given script and generate speech that aligns with lip motion and prosody expressiveness. Current AVD models mainly utilize visual information of the current sentence to enhance the prosody of synthesized speech. However, it is crucial to consider whether the prosody of the generated dubbing aligns with the multimodal context, as the dubbing will be combined with the original context in the final video. This aspect has been overlooked in previous studies. To address this issue, we propose a Multimodal Context-aware video Dubbing model, termed \textbf{MCDubber}, to convert the modeling object from a single sentence to a longer sequence with context information to ensure the consistency of the global context prosody. MCDubber comprises three main components: (1) A context duration aligner aims to learn the context-aware alignment between the text and lip frames; (2) A context prosody predictor seeks to read the global context visual sequence and predict the context-aware global energy and pitch; (3) A context acoustic decoder ultimately predicts the global context mel-spectrogram with the assistance of adjacent ground-truth mel-spectrograms of the target sentence. Through this process, MCDubber fully considers the influence of multimodal context on the prosody expressiveness of the current sentence when dubbing. The extracted mel-spectrogram belonging to the target sentence from the output context mel-spectrograms is the final required dubbing audio. Extensive experiments on the Chem benchmark dataset demonstrate that our MCDubber significantly improves dubbing expressiveness compared to all advanced baselines.

It optimizes intrinsic parameters of the light field camera model, the 3D coordinates of a sparse set of scene points and camera poses in a single bundle adjustment defined directly on micro image points.
  We show that LiFCal can reliably and repeatably calibrate a focused plenoptic camera using different input sequences, providing intrinsic camera parameters extremely close to state-of-the-art methods, while offering two main advantages: it can be applied in a target-free scene, and it is implemented online in a complete and continuous pipeline.
  Furthermore, we demonstrate the quality of the obtained camera parameters in downstream tasks like depth estimation and SLAM.

<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) in Deep Learning (DL)-automated medical image segmentation helps preserving privacy by enabling collaborative model training without sharing patient data. However, FL faces challenges with data heterogeneity among institutions, leading to suboptimal global models. Integrating Disentangled Representation Learning (DRL) in FL can enhance robustness by separating data into distinct representations. Existing DRL methods assume heterogeneity lies solely in style features, overlooking content-based variability like lesion size and shape. We propose FedGS, a novel FL aggregation method, to improve segmentation performance on small, under-represented targets while maintaining overall efficacy. FedGS demonstrates superior performance over FedAvg, particularly for small lesions, across PolypGen and LiTS datasets.

<p>Abstract: We scrutinize the structural and operational aspects of deep learning models, particularly focusing on the nuances of learnable parameters (weight) statistics, distribution, node interaction, and visualization. By establishing correlations between variance in weight patterns and overall network performance, we investigate the varying (optimal and suboptimal) performances of various deep-learning models. Our empirical analysis extends across widely recognized datasets such as MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10, and various deep learning models such as deep neural networks (DNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and vision transformer (ViT), enabling us to pinpoint characteristics of learnable parameters that correlate with successful networks. Through extensive experiments on the diverse architectures of deep learning models, we shed light on the critical factors that influence the functionality and efficiency of DNNs. Our findings reveal that successful networks, irrespective of datasets or models, are invariably similar to other successful networks in their converged weights statistics and distribution, while poor-performing networks vary in their weights. In addition, our research shows that the learnable parameters of widely varied deep learning models such as DNN, CNN, and ViT exhibit similar learning characteristics.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study proposes a novel approach to extract stylistic features of Jiehua: the utilization of the Fine-tuned Stable Diffusion Model with ControlNet (FSDMC) to refine depiction techniques from artists' Jiehua. The training data for FSDMC is based on the opensource Jiehua artist's work collected from the Internet, which were subsequently manually constructed in the format of (Original Image, Canny Edge Features, Text Prompt). By employing the optimal hyperparameters identified in this paper, it was observed FSDMC outperforms CycleGAN, another mainstream style transfer model. FSDMC achieves FID of 3.27 on the dataset and also surpasses CycleGAN in terms of expert evaluation. This not only demonstrates the model's high effectiveness in extracting Jiehua's style features, but also preserves the original pre-trained semantic information. The findings of this study suggest that the application of FSDMC with appropriate hyperparameters can enhance the efficacy of the Stable Diffusion Model in the field of traditional art style migration tasks, particularly within the context of Jiehua.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenye Lou, Qing Xu, Zekun Jiang, Xiangjian He, Zhen Chen, Yi Wang, Chenxin Li, Maggie M. He, Wenting Duan</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain-generalized nuclei segmentation refers to the generalizability of models to unseen domains based on knowledge learned from source domains and is challenged by various image conditions, cell types, and stain strategies. Recently, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has made great success in universal image segmentation by interactive prompt modes (e.g., point and box). Despite its strengths, the original SAM presents limited adaptation to medical images. Moreover, SAM requires providing manual bounding box prompts for each object to produce satisfactory segmentation masks, so it is laborious in nuclei segmentation scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a domain-generalizable framework for nuclei image segmentation, abbreviated to NuSegDG. Specifically, we first devise a Heterogeneous Space Adapter (HS-Adapter) to learn multi-dimensional feature representations of different nuclei domains by injecting a small number of trainable parameters into the image encoder of SAM. To alleviate the labor-intensive requirement of manual prompts, we introduce a Gaussian-Kernel Prompt Encoder (GKP-Encoder) to generate density maps driven by a single point, which guides segmentation predictions by mixing position prompts and semantic prompts. Furthermore, we present a Two-Stage Mask Decoder (TSM-Decoder) to effectively convert semantic masks to instance maps without the manual demand for morphological shape refinement. Based on our experimental evaluations, the proposed NuSegDG demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in nuclei instance segmentation, exhibiting superior domain generalization capabilities.

<p>Abstract: Current video generation models excel at creating short, realistic clips, but struggle with longer, multi-scene videos. We introduce \texttt{DreamFactory}, an LLM-based framework that tackles this challenge. \texttt{DreamFactory} leverages multi-agent collaboration principles and a Key Frames Iteration Design Method to ensure consistency and style across long videos. It utilizes Chain of Thought (COT) to address uncertainties inherent in large language models. \texttt{DreamFactory} generates long, stylistically coherent, and complex videos. Evaluating these long-form videos presents a challenge. We propose novel metrics such as Cross-Scene Face Distance Score and Cross-Scene Style Consistency Score. To further research in this area, we contribute the Multi-Scene Videos Dataset containing over 150 human-rated videos.</p>

<p>Abstract: Learning from demonstrations has shown to be an effective approach to robotic manipulation, especially with the recently collected large-scale robot data with teleoperation systems. Building an efficient teleoperation system across diverse robot platforms has become more crucial than ever. However, there is a notable lack of cost-effective and user-friendly teleoperation systems for different end-effectors, e.g., anthropomorphic robot hands and grippers, that can operate across multiple platforms. To address this issue, we develop ACE, a cross-platform visual-exoskeleton system for low-cost dexterous teleoperation. Our system utilizes a hand-facing camera to capture 3D hand poses and an exoskeleton mounted on a portable base, enabling accurate real-time capture of both finger and wrist poses. Compared to previous systems, which often require hardware customization according to different robots, our single system can generalize to humanoid hands, arm-hands, arm-gripper, and quadruped-gripper systems with high-precision teleoperation. This enables imitation learning for complex manipulation tasks on diverse platforms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Konrad Heidler, Lichao Mou, Di Hu, Pu Jin, Guangyao Li, Chuang Gan, Ji-Rong Wen, Xiao Xiang Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Many current deep learning approaches make extensive use of backbone networks pre-trained on large datasets like ImageNet, which are then fine-tuned to perform a certain task. In remote sensing, the lack of comparable large annotated datasets and the wide diversity of sensing platforms impedes similar developments. In order to contribute towards the availability of pre-trained backbone networks in remote sensing, we devise a self-supervised approach for pre-training deep neural networks. By exploiting the correspondence between geo-tagged audio recordings and remote sensing imagery, this is done in a completely label-free manner, eliminating the need for laborious manual annotation. For this purpose, we introduce the SoundingEarth dataset, which consists of co-located aerial imagery and audio samples all around the world. Using this dataset, we then pre-train ResNet models to map samples from both modalities into a common embedding space, which encourages the models to understand key properties of a scene that influence both visual and auditory appearance. To validate the usefulness of the proposed approach, we evaluate the transfer learning performance of pre-trained weights obtained against weights obtained through other means. By fine-tuning the models on a number of commonly used remote sensing datasets, we show that our approach outperforms existing pre-training strategies for remote sensing imagery. The dataset, code and pre-trained model weights will be available at https://github.com/khdlr/SoundingEarth.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Debaditya Roy, Basura Fernando</p>
<p>Abstract: The problem of anticipating human actions is an inherently uncertain one. However, we can reduce this uncertainty if we have a sense of the goal that the actor is trying to achieve. Here, we present an action anticipation model that leverages goal information for the purpose of reducing the uncertainty in future predictions. Since we do not possess goal information or the observed actions during inference, we resort to visual representation to encapsulate information about both actions and goals. Through this, we derive a novel concept called abstract goal which is conditioned on observed sequences of visual features for action anticipation. We design the abstract goal as a distribution whose parameters are estimated using a variational recurrent network. We sample multiple candidates for the next action and introduce a goal consistency measure to determine the best candidate that follows from the abstract goal. Our method obtains impressive results on the very challenging Epic-Kitchens55 (EK55), EK100, and EGTEA Gaze+ datasets. We obtain absolute improvements of +13.69, +11.24, and +5.19 for Top-1 verb, Top-1 noun, and Top-1 action anticipation accuracy respectively over prior state-of-the-art methods for seen kitchens (S1) of EK55. Similarly, we also obtain significant improvements in the unseen kitchens (S2) set for Top-1 verb (+10.75), noun (+5.84) and action (+2.87) anticipation. Similar trend is observed for EGTEA Gaze+ dataset, where absolute improvement of +9.9, +13.1 and +6.8 is obtained for noun, verb, and action anticipation. It is through the submission of this paper that our method is currently the new state-of-the-art for action anticipation in EK55 and EGTEA Gaze+ https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/20071#results Code available at https://github.com/debadityaroy/Abstract_Goal</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingxuan Liu, Subhankar Roy, Zhun Zhong, Nicu Sebe, Elisa Ricci</p>
<p>Abstract: Discovering novel concepts in unlabelled datasets and in a continuous manner is an important desideratum of lifelong learners. In the literature such problems have been partially addressed under very restricted settings, where novel classes are learned by jointly accessing a related labelled set (e.g., NCD) or by leveraging only a supervisedly pre-trained model (e.g., class-iNCD). In this work we challenge the status quo in class-iNCD and propose a learning paradigm where class discovery occurs continuously and truly unsupervisedly, without needing any related labelled set. In detail, we propose to exploit the richer priors from strong self-supervised pre-trained models (PTM). To this end, we propose simple baselines, composed of a frozen PTM backbone and a learnable linear classifier, that are not only simple to implement but also resilient under longer learning scenarios. We conduct extensive empirical evaluation on a multitude of benchmarks and show the effectiveness of our proposed baselines when compared with sophisticated state-of-the-art methods. The code is open source.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Meng You, Junhui Hou</p>
<p>Abstract: The challenge of dynamic view synthesis from dynamic monocular videos, i.e., synthesizing novel views for free viewpoints given a monocular video of a dynamic scene captured by a moving camera, mainly lies in accurately modeling the \textbf{dynamic objects} of a scene using limited 2D frames, each with a varying timestamp and viewpoint. Existing methods usually require pre-processed 2D optical flow and depth maps by off-the-shelf methods to supervise the network, making them suffer from the inaccuracy of the pre-processed supervision and the ambiguity when lifting the 2D information to 3D. In this paper, we tackle this challenge in an unsupervised fashion. Specifically, we decouple the motion of the dynamic objects into object motion and camera motion, respectively regularized by proposed unsupervised surface consistency and patch-based multi-view constraints. The former enforces the 3D geometric surfaces of moving objects to be consistent over time, while the latter regularizes their appearances to be consistent across different viewpoints. Such a fine-grained motion formulation can alleviate the learning difficulty for the network, thus enabling it to produce not only novel views with higher quality but also more accurate scene flows and depth than existing methods requiring extra supervision.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinlong Li, Runsheng Xu, Xinyu Liu, Jin Ma, Baolu Li, Qin Zou, Jiaqi Ma, Hongkai Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Typically, object detection methods for autonomous driving that rely on supervised learning make the assumption of a consistent feature distribution between the training and testing data, this such assumption may fail in different weather conditions. Due to the domain gap, a detection model trained under clear weather may not perform well in foggy and rainy conditions. Overcoming detection bottlenecks in foggy and rainy weather is a real challenge for autonomous vehicles deployed in the wild. To bridge the domain gap and improve the performance of object detection in foggy and rainy weather, this paper presents a novel framework for domain-adaptive object detection. The adaptations at both the image-level and object-level are intended to minimize the differences in image style and object appearance between domains. Furthermore, in order to improve the model's performance on challenging examples, we introduce a novel adversarial gradient reversal layer that conducts adversarial mining on difficult instances in addition to domain adaptation. Additionally, we suggest generating an auxiliary domain through data augmentation to enforce a new domain-level metric regularization. Experimental findings on public benchmark exhibit a substantial enhancement in object detection specifically for foggy and rainy driving scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hoang Trieu Vy Le, Audrey Repetti, Nelly Pustelnik</p>
<p>Abstract: A common approach to solve inverse imaging problems relies on finding a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the original unknown image, by solving a minimization problem. In thiscontext, iterative proximal algorithms are widely used, enabling to handle non-smooth functions and linear operators. Recently, these algorithms have been paired with deep learning strategies, to further improve the estimate quality. In particular, proximal neural networks (PNNs) have been introduced, obtained by unrolling a proximal algorithm as for finding a MAP estimate, but over a fixed number of iterations, with learned linear operators and parameters. As PNNs are based on optimization theory, they are very flexible, and can be adapted to any image restoration task, as soon as a proximal algorithm can solve it. They further have much lighter architectures than traditional networks. In this article we propose a unified framework to build PNNs for the Gaussian denoising task, based on both the dual-FB and the primal-dual Chambolle-Pock algorithms. We further show that accelerated inertial versions of these algorithms enable skip connections in the associated NN layers. We propose different learning strategies for our PNN framework, and investigate their robustness (Lipschitz property) and denoising efficiency. Finally, we assess the robustness of our PNNs when plugged in a forward-backward algorithm for an image deblurring problem.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuan He, Jin Yuan, Kailun Yang, Zhenchao Zeng, Zhiyong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, transformer-based methods have shown exceptional performance in monocular 3D object detection, which can predict 3D attributes from a single 2D image. These methods typically use visual and depth representations to generate query points on objects, whose quality plays a decisive role in the detection accuracy. However, current unsupervised attention mechanisms without any geometry appearance awareness in transformers are susceptible to producing noisy features for query points, which severely limits the network performance and also makes the model have a poor ability to detect multi-category objects in a single training process. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a novel ``Supervised Shape&Scale-perceptive Deformable Attention'' (S$^3$-DA) module for monocular 3D object detection. Concretely, S$^3$-DA utilizes visual and depth features to generate diverse local features with various shapes and scales and predict the corresponding matching distribution simultaneously to impose valuable shape&scale perception for each query. Benefiting from this, S$^3$-DA effectively estimates receptive fields for query points belonging to any category, enabling them to generate robust query features. Besides, we propose a Multi-classification-based Shape&Scale Matching (MSM) loss to supervise the above process. Extensive experiments on KITTI and Waymo Open datasets demonstrate that S$^3$-DA significantly improves the detection accuracy, yielding state-of-the-art performance of single-category and multi-category 3D object detection in a single training process compared to the existing approaches.

<p><b>Authors:</b> You-Ming Chang, Chen Yeh, Wei-Chen Chiu, Ning Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep generative models can create remarkably photorealistic fake images while raising concerns about misinformation and copyright infringement, known as deepfake threats. Deepfake detection technique is developed to distinguish between real and fake images, where the existing methods typically learn classifiers in the image domain or various feature domains. However, the generalizability of deepfake detection against emerging and more advanced generative models remains challenging. In this paper, being inspired by the zero-shot advantages of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), we propose a novel approach called AntifakePrompt, using VLMs (e.g., InstructBLIP) and prompt tuning techniques to improve the deepfake detection accuracy over unseen data. We formulate deepfake detection as a visual question answering problem, and tune soft prompts for InstructBLIP to answer the real/fake information of a query image. We conduct full-spectrum experiments on datasets from a diversity of 3 held-in and 20 held-out generative models, covering modern text-to-image generation, image editing and adversarial image attacks. These testing datasets provide useful benchmarks in the realm of deepfake detection for further research. Moreover, results demonstrate that (1) the deepfake detection accuracy can be significantly and consistently improved (from 71.06% to 92.11%, in average accuracy over unseen domains) using pretrained vision-language models with prompt tuning; (2) our superior performance is at less cost of training data and trainable parameters, resulting in an effective and efficient solution for deepfake detection.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weijie Li, Yang Wei, Tianpeng Liu, Yuenan Hou, Yuxuan Li, Zhen Liu, Yongxiang Liu, Li Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The growing Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data has the potential to build a foundation model through Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods, which can achieve various SAR Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) tasks with pre-training in large-scale unlabeled data and fine-tuning in small labeled samples. SSL aims to construct supervision signals directly from the data, which minimizes the need for expensive expert annotation and maximizes the use of the expanding data pool for a foundational model. This study investigates an effective SSL method for SAR ATR, which can pave the way for a foundation model in SAR ATR. The primary obstacles faced in SSL for SAR ATR are the small targets in remote sensing and speckle noise in SAR images, corresponding to the SSL approach and signals. To overcome these challenges, we present a novel Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture for SAR ATR (SAR-JEPA), which leverages local masked patches to predict the multi-scale SAR gradient representations of unseen context. The key aspect of SAR-JEPA is integrating SAR domain features to ensure high-quality self-supervised signals as target features. Besides, we employ local masks and multi-scale features to accommodate the various small targets in remote sensing. By fine-tuning and evaluating our framework on three target recognition datasets (vehicle, ship, and aircraft) with four other datasets as pre-training, we demonstrate its outperformance over other SSL methods and its effectiveness with increasing SAR data. This study showcases the potential of SSL for SAR target recognition across diverse targets, scenes, and sensors.Our codes and weights are available in \url{https://github.com/waterdisappear/SAR-JEPA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kuan-Chih Huang, Yi-Hsuan Tsai, Ming-Hsuan Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Weakly supervised 3D object detection aims to learn a 3D detector with lower annotation cost, e.g., 2D labels. Unlike prior work which still relies on few accurate 3D annotations, we propose a framework to study how to leverage constraints between 2D and 3D domains without requiring any 3D labels. Specifically, we employ visual data from three perspectives to establish connections between 2D and 3D domains. First, we design a feature-level constraint to align LiDAR and image features based on object-aware regions. Second, the output-level constraint is developed to enforce the overlap between 2D and projected 3D box estimations. Finally, the training-level constraint is utilized by producing accurate and consistent 3D pseudo-labels that align with the visual data. We conduct extensive experiments on the KITTI dataset to validate the effectiveness of the proposed three constraints. Without using any 3D labels, our method achieves favorable performance against state-of-the-art approaches and is competitive with the method that uses 500-frame 3D annotations.

<p>Abstract: Occupancy prediction reconstructs 3D structures of surrounding environments. It provides detailed information for autonomous driving planning and navigation. However, most existing methods heavily rely on the LiDAR point clouds to generate occupancy ground truth, which is not available in the vision-based system. In this paper, we propose an OccNeRF method for training occupancy networks without 3D supervision. Different from previous works which consider a bounded scene, we parameterize the reconstructed occupancy fields and reorganize the sampling strategy to align with the cameras' infinite perceptive range. The neural rendering is adopted to convert occupancy fields to multi-camera depth maps, supervised by multi-frame photometric consistency. Moreover, for semantic occupancy prediction, we design several strategies to polish the prompts and filter the outputs of a pretrained open-vocabulary 2D segmentation model. Extensive experiments for both self-supervised depth estimation and 3D occupancy prediction tasks on nuScenes and SemanticKITTI datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emilio Morales-Juarez, Gibran Fuentes-Pineda</p>
<p>Abstract: Although the capacity of deep generative models for image generation, such as Diffusion Models (DMs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), has dramatically improved in recent years, much of their success can be attributed to computationally expensive architectures. This has limited their adoption and use to research laboratories and companies with large resources, while significantly raising the carbon footprint for training, fine-tuning, and inference. In this work, we present LadaGAN, an efficient generative adversarial network that is built upon a novel Transformer block named Ladaformer. The main component of this block is a linear additive-attention mechanism that computes a single attention vector per head instead of the quadratic dot-product attention. We employ Ladaformer in both the generator and discriminator, which reduces the computational complexity and overcomes the training instabilities often associated with Transformer GANs. LadaGAN consistently outperforms existing convolutional and Transformer GANs on benchmark datasets at different resolutions while being significantly more efficient. Moreover, LadaGAN shows competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art multi-step generative models (e.g. DMs) using orders of magnitude less computational resources.</p>

<p>Abstract: The social media-fuelled explosion of fake news and misinformation supported by tampered images has led to growth in the development of models and datasets for image manipulation detection. However, existing detection methods mostly treat media objects in isolation, without considering the impact of specific manipulations on viewer perception. Forensic datasets are usually analyzed based on the manipulation operations and corresponding pixel-based masks, but not on the semantics of the manipulation, i.e., type of scene, objects, and viewers' attention to scene content. The semantics of the manipulation play an important role in spreading misinformation through manipulated images. In an attempt to encourage further development of semantic-aware forensic approaches to understand visual misinformation, we propose a framework to analyze the trends of visual and semantic saliency in popular image manipulation datasets and their impact on detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anindya Mondal, Sauradip Nag, Xiatian Zhu, Anjan Dutta</p>
<p>Abstract: Object counting is pivotal for understanding the composition of scenes. Previously, this task was dominated by class-specific methods, which have gradually evolved into more adaptable class-agnostic strategies. However, these strategies come with their own set of limitations, such as the need for manual exemplar input and multiple passes for multiple categories, resulting in significant inefficiencies. This paper introduces a more practical approach enabling simultaneous counting of multiple object categories using an open-vocabulary framework. Our solution, OmniCount, stands out by using semantic and geometric insights (priors) from pre-trained models to count multiple categories of objects as specified by users, all without additional training. OmniCount distinguishes itself by generating precise object masks and leveraging varied interactive prompts via the Segment Anything Model for efficient counting. To evaluate OmniCount, we created the OmniCount-191 benchmark, a first-of-its-kind dataset with multi-label object counts, including points, bounding boxes, and VQA annotations. Our comprehensive evaluation in OmniCount-191, alongside other leading benchmarks, demonstrates OmniCount's exceptional performance, significantly outpacing existing solutions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaobin Hu, Xu Peng, Donghao Luo, Xiaozhong Ji, Jinlong Peng, Zhengkai Jiang, Jiangning Zhang, Taisong Jin, Chengjie Wang, Rongrong Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to the difficulty and labor-consuming nature of getting highly accurate or matting annotations, there only exists a limited amount of highly accurate labels available to the public. To tackle this challenge, we propose a DiffuMatting which inherits the strong Everything generation ability of diffusion and endows the power of "matting anything". Our DiffuMatting can 1). act as an anything matting factory with high accurate annotations 2). be well-compatible with community LoRAs or various conditional control approaches to achieve the community-friendly art design and controllable generation. Specifically, inspired by green-screen-matting, we aim to teach the diffusion model to paint on a fixed green screen canvas. To this end, a large-scale greenscreen dataset (Green100K) is collected as a training dataset for DiffuMatting. Secondly, a green background control loss is proposed to keep the drawing board as a pure green color to distinguish the foreground and background. To ensure the synthesized object has more edge details, a detailed-enhancement of transition boundary loss is proposed as a guideline to generate objects with more complicated edge structures. Aiming to simultaneously generate the object and its matting annotation, we build a matting head to make a green color removal in the latent space of the VAE decoder. Our DiffuMatting shows several potential applications (e.g., matting-data generator, community-friendly art design and controllable generation). As a matting-data generator, DiffuMatting synthesizes general object and portrait matting sets, effectively reducing the relative MSE error by 15.4% in General Object Matting and 11.4% in Portrait Matting tasks. The dataset is released in our project page at \url{https://diffumatting.github.io}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qunjie Zhou, Maxim Maximov, Or Litany, Laura Leal-Taix\'e</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we propose the use of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) as a scene representation for visual localization. Recently, NeRF has been employed to enhance pose regression and scene coordinate regression models by augmenting the training database, providing auxiliary supervision through rendered images, or serving as an iterative refinement module. We extend its recognized advantages -- its ability to provide a compact scene representation with realistic appearances and accurate geometry -- by exploring the potential of NeRF's internal features in establishing precise 2D-3D matches for localization. To this end, we conduct a comprehensive examination of NeRF's implicit knowledge, acquired through view synthesis, for matching under various conditions. This includes exploring different matching network architectures, extracting encoder features at multiple layers, and varying training configurations. Significantly, we introduce NeRFMatch, an advanced 2D-3D matching function that capitalizes on the internal knowledge of NeRF learned via view synthesis. Our evaluation of NeRFMatch on standard localization benchmarks, within a structure-based pipeline, sets a new state-of-the-art for localization performance on Cambridge Landmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiazhen Liu, Yuhan Fu, Ruobing Xie, Runquan Xie, Xingwu Sun, Fengzong Lian, Zhanhui Kang, Xirong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hallucinate, resulting in an emerging topic of visual hallucination evaluation (VHE). We introduce in this paper PhD, a large-scale benchmark for VHE. The essence of VHE is to ask an MLLM the right questions concerning a specific image. Depending on what to ask (objects, attributes, sentiment, etc.) and how the questions are asked, we structure PhD along two dimensions, i.e. task and mode. Five visual recognition tasks, ranging from low-level (object / attribute recognition) to middle-level (sentiment / position recognition and counting), are considered. Besides a normal visual QA mode, which we term VHE-base, PhD also asks questions with inaccurate context (VHE-iac) or with incorrect context (VHE-icc), or with AI-generated counter common sense images (VHE-ccs). We construct PhD by a ChatGPT-assisted semi-automated pipeline, encompassing four pivotal modules: task-specific hallucinatory element (hitem) selection, hitem-embedded question generation, inaccurate / incorrect context generation, and CCS image generation. With over 102k VQA triplets in total, PhD reveals considerable variability in MLLMs' performance across various modes, offering valuable insights into the nature of hallucination issues. As such, PhD stands as a potent tool not only for VHE but may also play a significant role in the refinement of MLLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunlong Tang, Daiki Shimada, Jing Bi, Mingqian Feng, Hang Hua, Chenliang Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language and multimodal domains. By fine-tuning multimodal LLMs with temporal annotations from well-annotated datasets, e.g., dense video captioning datasets, their temporal understanding capacity in video-language tasks can be obtained. However, there is a notable lack of untrimmed audio-visual video datasets with precise temporal annotations for events. This deficiency hinders LLMs from learning the alignment between time, audio-visual events, and text tokens, thus impairing their ability to temporally localize audio-visual events in videos. To address this gap, we introduce PU-VALOR, a comprehensive audio-visual dataset comprising over 114,000 pseudo-untrimmed videos with detailed temporal annotations. PU-VALOR is derived from the large-scale but coarse-annotated audio-visual dataset VALOR, through a subtle method involving event-based video clustering, random temporal scaling, and permutation. By fine-tuning a multimodal LLM on PU-VALOR, we developed AVicuna, a model capable of aligning audio-visual events with temporal intervals and corresponding text tokens. AVicuna excels in temporal localization and time-aware dialogue capabilities. Our experiments demonstrate that AVicuna effectively handles temporal understanding in audio-visual videos and achieves state-of-the-art performance on open-ended video QA, audio-visual QA, and audio-visual event dense localization tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akshay Paruchuri, Samuel Ehrenstein, Shuxian Wang, Inbar Fried, Stephen M. Pizer, Marc Niethammer, Roni Sengupta</p>
<p>Abstract: Monocular depth estimation in endoscopy videos can enable assistive and robotic surgery to obtain better coverage of the organ and detection of various health issues. Despite promising progress on mainstream, natural image depth estimation, techniques perform poorly on endoscopy images due to a lack of strong geometric features and challenging illumination effects. In this paper, we utilize the photometric cues, i.e., the light emitted from an endoscope and reflected by the surface, to improve monocular depth estimation. We first create two novel loss functions with supervised and self-supervised variants that utilize a per-pixel shading representation. We then propose a novel depth refinement network (PPSNet) that leverages the same per-pixel shading representation. Finally, we introduce teacher-student transfer learning to produce better depth maps from both synthetic data with supervision and clinical data with self-supervision. We achieve state-of-the-art results on the C3VD dataset while estimating high-quality depth maps from clinical data.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiwen Fan, Wenyan Cong, Kairun Wen, Kevin Wang, Jian Zhang, Xinghao Ding, Danfei Xu, Boris Ivanovic, Marco Pavone, Georgios Pavlakos, Zhangyang Wang, Yue Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: While novel view synthesis (NVS) from a sparse set of images has advanced significantly in 3D computer vision, it relies on precise initial estimation of camera parameters using Structure-from-Motion (SfM). For instance, the recently developed Gaussian Splatting depends heavily on the accuracy of SfM-derived points and poses. However, SfM processes are time-consuming and often prove unreliable in sparse-view scenarios, where matched features are scarce, leading to accumulated errors and limited generalization capability across datasets. In this study, we introduce a novel and efficient framework to enhance robust NVS from sparse-view images. Our framework, InstantSplat, integrates multi-view stereo(MVS) predictions with point-based representations to construct 3D Gaussians of large-scale scenes from sparse-view data within seconds, addressing the aforementioned performance and efficiency issues by SfM. Specifically, InstantSplat generates densely populated surface points across all training views and determines the initial camera parameters using pixel-alignment. Nonetheless, the MVS points are not globally accurate, and the pixel-wise prediction from all views results in an excessive Gaussian number, yielding a overparameterized scene representation that compromises both training speed and accuracy. To address this issue, we employ a grid-based, confidence-aware Farthest Point Sampling to strategically position point primitives at representative locations in parallel. Next, we enhance pose accuracy and tune scene parameters through a gradient-based joint optimization framework from self-supervision. By employing this simplified framework, InstantSplat achieves a substantial reduction in training time, from hours to mere seconds, and demonstrates robust performance across various numbers of views in diverse datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ryan Donghan Kwon, Gangjoo Robin Nam, Jisoo Tak, Junseob Shin, Hyerin Cha, Seung Won Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: In this study, we present an advanced convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for ship classification based on optical satellite imagery, which significantly enhances performance through the integration of a convolutional block attention module (CBAM) and additional architectural innovations. Building upon the foundational ResNet50 model, we first incorporated a standard CBAM to direct the model's focus toward more informative features, achieving an accuracy of 87% compared to 85% of the baseline ResNet50. Further augmentations involved multiscale feature integration, depthwise separable convolutions, and dilated convolutions, culminating in an enhanced ResNet model with improved CBAM. This model demonstrated a remarkable accuracy of 95%, with precision, recall, and F1 scores all witnessing substantial improvements across various ship classes. In particular, the bulk carrier and oil tanker classes exhibited nearly perfect precision and recall rates, underscoring the enhanced capability of the model to accurately identify and classify ships. Attention heatmap analyses further validated the efficacy of the improved model, revealing more focused attention on relevant ship features regardless of background complexities. These findings underscore the potential of integrating attention mechanisms and architectural innovations into CNNs for high-resolution satellite imagery classification. This study navigates through the class imbalance and computational costs and proposes future directions for scalability and adaptability in new or rare ship-type recognition. This study lays the groundwork for applying advanced deep learning techniques in remote sensing, offering insights into scalable and efficient satellite image classification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianqiang Xiao, Weiwen Guo, Junfeng Liu, Mengze Li</p>
<p>Abstract: In the field of computer vision, data augmentation is widely used to enrich the feature complexity of training datasets with deep learning techniques. However, regarding the generalization capabilities of models, the difference in artificial features generated by data augmentation and natural visual features has not been fully revealed. This study introduces the concept of "visual representation variables" to define the possible visual variations in a task as a joint distribution of these variables. We focus on the visual representation variable "illumination", by simulating its distribution degradation and examining how data augmentation techniques enhance model performance on a classification task. Our goal is to investigate the differences in generalization between models trained with augmented data and those trained under real-world illumination conditions. Results indicate that after applying various data augmentation methods, model performance has significantly improved. Yet, a noticeable generalization gap still exists after utilizing various data augmentation methods, emphasizing the critical role of feature diversity in the training set for enhancing model generalization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihan Cao, Xiao Wu, Liang-Jian Deng, Yu Zhong</p>
<p>Abstract: In image fusion tasks, images from different sources possess distinct characteristics. This has driven the development of numerous methods to explore better ways of fusing them while preserving their respective characteristics.Mamba, as a state space model, has emerged in the field of natural language processing. Recently, many studies have attempted to extend Mamba to vision tasks. However, due to the nature of images different from causal language sequences, the limited state capacity of Mamba weakens its ability to model image information. Additionally, the sequence modeling ability of Mamba is only capable of spatial information and cannot effectively capture the rich spectral information in images. Motivated by these challenges, we customize and improve the vision Mamba network designed for the image fusion task. Specifically, we propose the local-enhanced vision Mamba block, dubbed as LEVM. The LEVM block can improve local information perception of the network and simultaneously learn local and global spatial information. Furthermore, we propose the state sharing technique to enhance spatial details and integrate spatial and spectral information. Finally, the overall network is a multi-scale structure based on vision Mamba, called LE-Mamba. Extensive experiments show the proposed methods achieve state-of-the-art results on multispectral pansharpening and multispectral and hyperspectral image fusion datasets, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

<p>Abstract: This paper makes the first attempt towards unsupervised preference alignment in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We generate chosen and rejected responses with regard to the original and augmented image pairs, and conduct preference alignment with direct preference optimization. It is based on a core idea: properly designed augmentation to the image input will induce VLM to generate false but hard negative responses, which helps the model to learn from and produce more robust and powerful answers. The whole pipeline no longer hinges on supervision from GPT-4 or human involvement during alignment, and is highly efficient with few lines of code. With only 8k randomly sampled unsupervised data, it achieves 90\% relative score to GPT-4 on complex reasoning in LLaVA-Bench, and improves LLaVA-7B/13B by 6.7\%/5.6\% score on complex multi-modal benchmark MM-Vet. Visualizations shows its improved ability to align with user-intentions. A series of ablations are firmly conducted to reveal the latent mechanism of the approach, which also indicates its potential towards further scaling.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hang Hua, Yunlong Tang, Chenliang Xu, Jiebo Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Video summarization aims to create short, accurate, and cohesive summaries of longer videos. Despite the existence of various video summarization datasets, a notable limitation is their limited amount of source videos, which hampers the effective training of advanced large vision-language models (VLMs). Additionally, most existing datasets are created for video-to-video summarization, overlooking the contemporary need for multimodal video content summarization. Recent efforts have been made to expand from unimodal to multimodal video summarization, categorizing the task into three sub-tasks based on the summary's modality: video-to-video (V2V), video-to-text (V2T), and a combination of video and text summarization (V2VT). However, the textual summaries in previous multimodal datasets are inadequate. To address these issues, we introduce Instruct-V2Xum, a cross-modal video summarization dataset featuring 30,000 diverse videos sourced from YouTube, with lengths ranging from 40 to 940 seconds and an average summarization ratio of 16.39%. Each video summary in Instruct-V2Xum is paired with a textual summary that references specific frame indexes, facilitating the generation of aligned video and textual summaries. In addition, we propose a new video summarization framework named V2Xum-LLM. V2Xum-LLM, specifically V2Xum-LLaMA in this study, is the first framework that unifies different video summarization tasks into one large language model's (LLM) text decoder and achieves task-controllable video summarization with temporal prompts and task instructions. Experiments show that V2Xum-LLaMA outperforms strong baseline models on multiple video summarization tasks. Furthermore, we propose an enhanced evaluation metric for V2V and V2VT summarization tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenyu Zhang, Li Shen, Chuan-Sheng Foo</p>
<p>Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) aims to adapt a source model trained on a fully-labeled source domain to a related but unlabeled target domain. While the source model is a key avenue for acquiring target pseudolabels, the generated pseudolabels may exhibit source bias. In the conventional SFDA pipeline, a large data (e.g. ImageNet) pre-trained feature extractor is used to initialize the source model at the start of source training, and subsequently discarded. Despite having diverse features important for generalization, the pre-trained feature extractor can overfit to the source data distribution during source training and forget relevant target domain knowledge. Rather than discarding this valuable knowledge, we introduce an integrated framework to incorporate pre-trained networks into the target adaptation process. The proposed framework is flexible and allows us to plug modern pre-trained networks into the adaptation process to leverage their stronger representation learning capabilities. For adaptation, we propose the Co-learn algorithm to improve target pseudolabel quality collaboratively through the source model and a pre-trained feature extractor. Building on the recent success of the vision-language model CLIP in zero-shot image recognition, we present an extension Co-learn++ to further incorporate CLIP's zero-shot classification decisions. We evaluate on 4 benchmark datasets and include more challenging scenarios such as open-set, partial-set and open-partial SFDA. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed strategy improves adaptation performance and can be successfully integrated with existing SFDA methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Congjia Chen, Xiaoyu Jia, Yanhong Zheng, Yufu Qu</p>
<p>Abstract: Point cloud registration is a fundamental task for estimating rigid transformations between point clouds. Previous studies have used geometric information for extracting features, matching and estimating transformation. Recently, owing to the advancement of RGB-D sensors, researchers have attempted to combine visual and geometric information to improve registration performance. However, these studies focused on extracting distinctive features by deep feature fusion, which cannot effectively solve the negative effects of each feature's weakness, and cannot sufficiently leverage the valid information. In this paper, we propose a new feature combination framework, which applies a looser but more effective combination. An explicit filter based on transformation consistency is designed for the combination framework, which can overcome each feature's weakness. And an adaptive threshold determined by the error distribution is proposed to extract more valid information from the two types of features. Owing to the distinctive design, our proposed framework can estimate more accurate correspondences and is applicable to both hand-crafted and learning-based feature descriptors. Experiments on ScanNet and 3DMatch show that our method achieves a state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yitao Peng, Lianghua He, Die Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: With the widespread application of deep learning technology in medical image analysis, the effective explanation of model predictions and improvement of diagnostic accuracy have become urgent problems that need to be solved. Attribution methods have become key tools to help doctors better understand the diagnostic basis of models, and are used to explain and localize diseases in medical images. However, previous methods suffer from inaccurate and incomplete localization problems for fundus diseases with complex and diverse structures. To solve these problems, we propose a weakly supervised interpretable fundus disease localization method called hierarchical salient patch identification (HSPI) that can achieve interpretable disease localization using only image-level labels and a neural network classifier (NNC). First, we propose salient patch identification (SPI), which divides the image into several patches and optimizes consistency loss to identify which patch in the input image is most important for the network's prediction, in order to locate the disease. Second, we propose a hierarchical identification strategy to force SPI to analyze the importance of different areas to neural network classifier's prediction to comprehensively locate disease areas. Conditional peak focusing is then introduced to ensure that the mask vector can accurately locate the disease area. Finally, we propose patch selection based on multi-sized intersections to filter out incorrectly or additionally identified non-disease regions. We conduct disease localization experiments on fundus image datasets and achieve the best performance on multiple evaluation metrics compared to previous interpretable attribution methods. Additional ablation studies are conducted to verify the effectiveness of each method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Parth Padalkar, Natalia \'Slusarz, Ekaterina Komendantskaya, Gopal Gupta</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent efforts in interpreting Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) focus on translating the activation of CNN filters into a stratified Answer Set Program (ASP) rule-sets. The CNN filters are known to capture high-level image concepts, thus the predicates in the rule-set are mapped to the concept that their corresponding filter represents. Hence, the rule-set exemplifies the decision-making process of the CNN w.r.t the concepts that it learns for any image classification task. These rule-sets help understand the biases in CNNs, although correcting the biases remains a challenge. We introduce a neurosymbolic framework called NeSyBiCor for bias correction in a trained CNN. Given symbolic concepts, as ASP constraints, that the CNN is biased towards, we convert the concepts to their corresponding vector representations. Then, the CNN is retrained using our novel semantic similarity loss that pushes the filters away from (or towards) learning the desired/undesired concepts. The final ASP rule-set obtained after retraining, satisfies the constraints to a high degree, thus showing the revision in the knowledge of the CNN. We demonstrate that our NeSyBiCor framework successfully corrects the biases of CNNs trained with subsets of classes from the \textit{Places} dataset while sacrificing minimal accuracy and improving interpretability.</p>

<p>Abstract: Open-vocabulary detection aims to detect objects from novel categories beyond the base categories on which the detector is trained. However, existing open-vocabulary detectors trained on base category data tend to assign higher confidence to trained categories and confuse novel categories with the background. To resolve this, we propose OV-DQUO, an \textbf{O}pen-\textbf{V}ocabulary DETR with \textbf{D}enoising text \textbf{Q}uery training and open-world \textbf{U}nknown \textbf{O}bjects supervision. Specifically, we introduce a wildcard matching method. This method enables the detector to learn from pairs of unknown objects recognized by the open-world detector and text embeddings with general semantics, mitigating the confidence bias between base and novel categories. Additionally, we propose a denoising text query training strategy. It synthesizes foreground and background query-box pairs from open-world unknown objects to train the detector through contrastive learning, enhancing its ability to distinguish novel objects from the background.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuannan Liu, Zekun Li, Peipei Li, Shuhan Xia, Xing Cui, Linzhi Huang, Huaibo Huang, Weihong Deng, Zhaofeng He</p>
<p>Abstract: Current multimodal misinformation detection (MMD) methods often assume a single source and type of forgery for each sample, which is insufficient for real-world scenarios where multiple forgery sources coexist. The lack of a benchmark for mixed-source misinformation has hindered progress in this field. To address this, we introduce MMFakeBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for mixed-source MMD. MMFakeBench includes 3 critical sources: textual veracity distortion, visual veracity distortion, and cross-modal consistency distortion, along with 12 sub-categories of misinformation forgery types. We further conduct an extensive evaluation of 6 prevalent detection methods and 15 large vision-language models (LVLMs) on MMFakeBench under a zero-shot setting. The results indicate that current methods struggle under this challenging and realistic mixed-source MMD setting. Additionally, we propose an innovative unified framework, which integrates rationales, actions, and tool-use capabilities of LVLM agents, significantly enhancing accuracy and generalization. We believe this study will catalyze future research into more realistic mixed-source multimodal misinformation and provide a fair evaluation of misinformation detection methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weiqing Xiao, Wei Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Both uncertainty-assisted and iteration-based methods have achieved great success in stereo matching. However, existing uncertainty estimation methods take a single image and the corresponding disparity as input, which imposes higher demands on the estimation network. In this paper, we propose Cost volume-based disparity Uncertainty Estimation (UEC). Based on the rich similarity information in the cost volume coming from the image pairs, the proposed UEC can achieve competitive performance with low computational cost. Secondly, we propose two methods of uncertainty-assisted disparity estimation, Uncertainty-based Disparity Rectification (UDR) and Uncertainty-based Disparity update Conditioning (UDC). These two methods optimise the disparity update process of the iterative-based approach without adding extra parameters. In addition, we propose Disparity Rectification loss that significantly improves the accuracy of small amount of disparity updates. We present a high-performance stereo architecture, DR Stereo, which is a combination of the proposed methods. Experimental results from SceneFlow, KITTI, Middlebury 2014, and ETH3D show that DR-Stereo achieves very competitive disparity estimation performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Armando Zhu, Jiabei Liu, Keqin Li, Shuying Dai, Bo Hong, Peng Zhao, Changsong Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for deploying robust machine learning models, especially in areas where security is critical. However, traditional OOD detection methods often fail to capture complex data distributions from large scale date. In this paper, we present a novel approach for OOD detection that leverages the generative ability of diffusion models and the powerful feature extraction capabilities of CLIP. By using these features as conditional inputs to a diffusion model, we can reconstruct the images after encoding them with CLIP. The difference between the original and reconstructed images is used as a signal for OOD identification. The practicality and scalability of our method is increased by the fact that it does not require class-specific labeled ID data, as is the case with many other methods. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrates the robustness and effectiveness of our method, which have significantly improved the detection accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianzong Wu, Xiangtai Li, Yanhong Zeng, Jiangning Zhang, Qianyu Zhou, Yining Li, Yunhai Tong, Kai Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we present MotionBooth, an innovative framework designed for animating customized subjects with precise control over both object and camera movements. By leveraging a few images of a specific object, we efficiently fine-tune a text-to-video model to capture the object's shape and attributes accurately. Our approach presents subject region loss and video preservation loss to enhance the subject's learning performance, along with a subject token cross-attention loss to integrate the customized subject with motion control signals. Additionally, we propose training-free techniques for managing subject and camera motions during inference. In particular, we utilize cross-attention map manipulation to govern subject motion and introduce a novel latent shift module for camera movement control as well. MotionBooth excels in preserving the appearance of subjects while simultaneously controlling the motions in generated videos. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our method. Our project page is at https://jianzongwu.github.io/projects/motionbooth</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali Borji</p>
<p>Abstract: The primary aim of this manuscript is to underscore a significant limitation in current deep learning models, particularly vision models. Unlike human vision, which efficiently selects only the essential visual areas for further processing, leading to high speed and low energy consumption, deep vision models process the entire image. In this work, we examine this issue from a broader perspective and propose a solution that could pave the way for the next generation of more efficient vision models. Basically, convolution and pooling operations are selectively applied to altered regions, with a change map sent to subsequent layers. This map indicates which computations need to be repeated.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chaofan Luo, Donglin Di, Xun Yang, Yongjia Ma, Zhou Xue, Chen Wei, Yebin Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite significant strides in the field of 3D scene editing, current methods encounter substantial challenge, particularly in preserving 3D consistency in multi-view editing process. To tackle this challenge, we propose a progressive 3D editing strategy that ensures multi-view consistency via a Trajectory-Anchored Scheme (TAS) with a dual-branch editing mechanism. Specifically, TAS facilitates a tightly coupled iterative process between 2D view editing and 3D updating, preventing error accumulation yielded from text-to-image process. Additionally, we explore the relationship between optimization-based methods and reconstruction-based methods, offering a unified perspective for selecting superior design choice, supporting the rationale behind the designed TAS. We further present a tuning-free View-Consistent Attention Control (VCAC) module that leverages cross-view semantic and geometric reference from the source branch to yield aligned views from the target branch during the editing of 2D views. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we analyze 2D examples to demonstrate the improved consistency with the VCAC module. Further extensive quantitative and qualitative results in text-guided 3D scene editing indicate that our method achieves superior editing quality compared to state-of-the-art methods. We will make the complete codebase publicly available following the conclusion of the review process.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiedong Zhuang, Jiaqi Hu, Lianrui Mu, Rui Hu, Xiaoyu Liang, Jiangnan Ye, Haoji Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: CLIP has achieved impressive zero-shot performance after pre-training on a large-scale dataset consisting of paired image-text data. Previous works have utilized CLIP by incorporating manually designed visual prompts like colored circles and blur masks into the images to guide the model's attention, showing enhanced zero-shot performance in downstream tasks. Although these methods have achieved promising results, they inevitably alter the original information of the images, which can lead to failure in specific tasks. We propose a train-free method Foveal-Attention CLIP (FALIP), which adjusts the CLIP's attention by inserting foveal attention masks into the multi-head self-attention module. We demonstrate FALIP effectively boosts CLIP zero-shot performance in tasks such as referring expressions comprehension, image classification, and 3D point cloud recognition. Experimental results further show that FALIP outperforms existing methods on most metrics and can augment current methods to enhance their performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaojie Li, Yibo Yang, Jianlong Wu, Bernard Ghanem, Liqiang Nie, Min Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) confronts the challenge of integrating new classes into a model with minimal training samples while preserving the knowledge of previously learned classes. Traditional methods widely adopt static adaptation relying on a fixed parameter space to learn from data that arrive sequentially, prone to overfitting to the current session. Existing dynamic strategies require the expansion of the parameter space continually, leading to increased complexity. In this study, we explore the potential of Selective State Space Models (SSMs) for FSCIL, leveraging its dynamic weights and strong ability in sequence modeling to address these challenges. Concretely, we propose a dual selective SSM projector that dynamically adjusts the projection parameters based on the intermediate features for dynamic adaptation. The dual design enables the model to maintain the robust features of base classes, while adaptively learning distinctive feature shifts for novel classes. Additionally, we develop a class-sensitive selective scan mechanism to guide dynamic adaptation. It minimizes the disruption to base-class representations caused by training on novel data, and meanwhile, forces the selective scan to perform in distinct patterns between base and novel classes. Experiments on miniImageNet, CUB-200, and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that our framework outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hannah Lee, Changyeon Lee, Kevin Farhat, Lin Qiu, Steve Geluso, Aerin Kim, Oren Etzioni</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal generative models are rapidly evolving, leading to a surge in the generation of realistic video and audio that offers exciting possibilities but also serious risks. Deepfake videos, which can convincingly impersonate individuals, have particularly garnered attention due to their potential misuse in spreading misinformation and creating fraudulent content. This survey paper examines the dual landscape of deepfake video generation and detection, emphasizing the need for effective countermeasures against potential abuses. We provide a comprehensive overview of current deepfake generation techniques, including face swapping, reenactment, and audio-driven animation, which leverage cutting-edge technologies like GANs and diffusion models to produce highly realistic fake videos. Additionally, we analyze various detection approaches designed to differentiate authentic from altered videos, from detecting visual artifacts to deploying advanced algorithms that pinpoint inconsistencies across video and audio signals.
  The effectiveness of these detection methods heavily relies on the diversity and quality of datasets used for training and evaluation. We discuss the evolution of deepfake datasets, highlighting the importance of robust, diverse, and frequently updated collections to enhance the detection accuracy and generalizability. As deepfakes become increasingly indistinguishable from authentic content, developing advanced detection techniques that can keep pace with generation technologies is crucial. We advocate for a proactive approach in the "tug-of-war" between deepfake creators and detectors, emphasizing the need for continuous research collaboration, standardization of evaluation metrics, and the creation of comprehensive benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Visual storytelling involves generating a sequence of coherent frames from a textual storyline while maintaining consistency in characters and scenes. Existing autoregressive methods, which rely on previous frame-sentence pairs, struggle with high memory usage, slow generation speeds, and limited context integration. To address these issues, we propose ContextualStory, a novel framework designed to generate coherent story frames and extend frames for story continuation. ContextualStory utilizes Spatially-Enhanced Temporal Attention to capture spatial and temporal dependencies, handling significant character movements effectively. Additionally, we introduces a Storyline Contextualizer to enrich context in storyline embedding and a StoryFlow Adapter to measure scene changes between frames for guiding model. Extensive experiments on PororoSV and FlintstonesSV benchmarks demonstrate that ContextualStory significantly outperforms existing methods in both story visualization and story continuation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenbo Huang, Jinghui Zhang, Xuwei Qian, Zhen Wu, Meng Wang, Lei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: High frame-rate (HFR) videos of action recognition improve fine-grained expression while reducing the spatio-temporal relation and motion information density. Thus, large amounts of video samples are continuously required for traditional data-driven training. However, samples are not always sufficient in real-world scenarios, promoting few-shot action recognition (FSAR) research. We observe that most recent FSAR works build spatio-temporal relation of video samples via temporal alignment after spatial feature extraction, cutting apart spatial and temporal features within samples. They also capture motion information via narrow perspectives between adjacent frames without considering density, leading to insufficient motion information capturing. Therefore, we propose a novel plug-and-play architecture for FSAR called Spatio-tempOral frAme tuPle enhancer (SOAP) in this paper. The model we designed with such architecture refers to SOAP-Net. Temporal connections between different feature channels and spatio-temporal relation of features are considered instead of simple feature extraction. Comprehensive motion information is also captured, using frame tuples with multiple frames containing more motion information than adjacent frames. Combining frame tuples of diverse frame counts further provides a broader perspective. SOAP-Net achieves new state-of-the-art performance across well-known benchmarks such as SthSthV2, Kinetics, UCF101, and HMDB51. Extensive empirical evaluations underscore the competitiveness, pluggability, generalization, and robustness of SOAP. The code is released at https://github.com/wenbohuang1002/SOAP.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Syed Javed, Tariq M. Khan, Abdul Qayyum, Arcot Sowmya, Imran Razzak</p>
<p>Abstract: Retinal imaging has emerged as a promising method of addressing this challenge, taking advantage of the unique structure of the retina. The retina is an embryonic extension of the central nervous system, providing a direct in vivo window into neurological health. Recent studies have shown that specific structural changes in retinal vessels can not only serve as early indicators of various diseases but also help to understand disease progression. In this work, we present a lightweight retinal vessel segmentation network based on the encoder-decoder mechanism with region-guided attention. We introduce inverse addition attention blocks with region guided attention to focus on the foreground regions and improve the segmentation of regions of interest. To further boost the model's performance on retinal vessel segmentation, we employ a weighted dice loss. This choice is particularly effective in addressing the class imbalance issues frequently encountered in retinal vessel segmentation tasks. Dice loss penalises false positives and false negatives equally, encouraging the model to generate more accurate segmentation with improved object boundary delineation and reduced fragmentation. Extensive experiments on a benchmark dataset show better performance (0.8285, 0.8098, 0.9677, and 0.8166 recall, precision, accuracy and F1 score respectively) compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have attracted much attention for their multifunctionality. However, traditional Transformer architectures incur significant overhead due to their secondary computational complexity. To address this issue, we introduce ML-Mamba, a multimodal language model, which utilizes the latest and efficient Mamba-2 model for inference. Mamba-2 is known for its linear scalability and fast processing of long sequences. We replace the Transformer-based backbone with a pre-trained Mamba-2 model and explore methods for integrating 2D visual selective scanning mechanisms into multimodal learning while also trying various visual encoders and Mamba-2 model variants. Our extensive experiments in various multimodal benchmark tests demonstrate the competitive performance of ML-Mamba and highlight the potential of state space models in multimodal tasks. The experimental results show that: (1) we empirically explore how to effectively apply the 2D vision selective scan mechanism for multimodal learning. We propose a novel multimodal connector called the Mamba-2 Scan Connector (MSC), which enhances representational capabilities. (2) ML-Mamba achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods such as TinyLaVA and MobileVLM v2 through its linear sequential modeling while faster inference speed; (3) Compared to multimodal models utilizing Mamba-1, the Mamba-2-based ML-Mamba exhibits superior inference performance and effectiveness.</p>

<p>Abstract: Soil moisture estimation is an important task to enable precision agriculture in creating optimal plans for irrigation, fertilization, and harvest. It is common to utilize statistical and machine learning models to estimate soil moisture from traditional data sources such as weather forecasts, soil properties, and crop properties. However, there is a growing interest in utilizing aerial and geospatial imagery to estimate soil moisture. Although these images capture high-resolution crop details, they are expensive to curate and challenging to interpret. Imagine, an AI-enhanced software tool that predicts soil moisture using visual cues captured by smartphones and statistical data given by weather forecasts. This work is a first step towards that goal of developing a multi-modal approach for soil moisture estimation. In particular, we curate a dataset consisting of real-world images taken from ground stations and their corresponding weather data. We also propose MIS-ME - Meteorological & Image based Soil Moisture Estimator, a multi-modal framework for soil moisture estimation. Our extensive analysis shows that MIS-ME achieves a MAPE of 10.14%, outperforming traditional unimodal approaches with a reduction of 3.25% in MAPE for meteorological data and 2.15% in MAPE for image data, highlighting the effectiveness of tailored multi-modal approaches.

<p>Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models excel in integrating semantic information between images and text through contrastive learning techniques. It has achieved remarkable performance in various multimodal tasks. However, the deployment of large CLIP models is hindered in resource-limited environments, while smaller models frequently fail to meet the performance benchmarks required for practical applications. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, ComKD-CLIP: Comprehensive Knowledge Distillation for Contrastive Language-Image Pre-traning Model, which aims to comprehensively distill the knowledge from a large teacher CLIP model into a smaller student model, ensuring comparable performance with significantly reduced parameters. ComKD-CLIP is composed of two key mechanisms: Image Feature Alignment (IFAlign) and Educational Attention (EduAttention). IFAlign makes the image features extracted by the student model closely match those extracted by the teacher model, enabling the student to learn teacher's knowledge of extracting image features. EduAttention explores the cross-relationships between text features extracted by the teacher model and image features extracted by the student model, enabling the student model to learn how the teacher model integrates text-image features. In addition, ComKD-CLIP can refine the knowledge distilled from IFAlign and EduAttention by leveraging the text-image feature fusion results of the teacher model, ensuring the student model accurately absorbs the teacher's knowledge. Extensive experiments conducted on 11 datasets have demonstrated the superiority of the proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmad Arrabi, Xiaohan Zhang, Waqas Sultani, Chen Chen, Safwan Wshah</p>
<p>Abstract: Aerial imagery analysis is critical for many research fields. However, obtaining frequent high-quality aerial images is not always accessible due to its high effort and cost requirements. One solution is to use the Ground-to-Aerial (G2A) technique to synthesize aerial images from easily collectible ground images. However, G2A is rarely studied, because of its challenges, including but not limited to, the drastic view changes, occlusion, and range of visibility. In this paper, we present a novel Geometric Preserving Ground-to-Aerial (G2A) image synthesis (GPG2A) model that can generate realistic aerial images from ground images. GPG2A consists of two stages. The first stage predicts the Bird's Eye View (BEV) segmentation (referred to as the BEV layout map) from the ground image. The second stage synthesizes the aerial image from the predicted BEV layout map and text descriptions of the ground image. To train our model, we present a new multi-modal cross-view dataset, namely VIGORv2 which is built upon VIGOR with newly collected aerial images, maps, and text descriptions. Our extensive experiments illustrate that GPG2A synthesizes better geometry-preserved aerial images than existing models. We also present two applications, data augmentation for cross-view geo-localization and sketch-based region search, to further verify the effectiveness of our GPG2A. The code and data will be publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhongche Qu, Zhi Zhang, Cong Liu, Jianhua Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Conventional geometry-based SLAM systems lack dense 3D reconstruction capabilities since their data association usually relies on feature correspondences. Additionally, learning-based SLAM systems often fall short in terms of real-time performance and accuracy. Balancing real-time performance with dense 3D reconstruction capabilities is a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a real-time RGB-D SLAM system that incorporates a novel view synthesis technique, 3D Gaussian Splatting, for 3D scene representation and pose estimation. This technique leverages the real-time rendering performance of 3D Gaussian Splatting with rasterization and allows for differentiable optimization in real time through CUDA implementation. We also enable mesh reconstruction from 3D Gaussians for explicit dense 3D reconstruction. To estimate accurate camera poses, we utilize a rotation-translation decoupled strategy with inverse optimization. This involves iteratively updating both in several iterations through gradient-based optimization. This process includes differentiably rendering RGB, depth, and silhouette maps and updating the camera parameters to minimize a combined loss of photometric loss, depth geometry loss, and visibility loss, given the existing 3D Gaussian map. However, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) struggles to accurately represent surfaces due to the multi-view inconsistency of 3D Gaussians, which can lead to reduced accuracy in both camera pose estimation and scene reconstruction. To address this, we utilize depth priors as additional regularization to enforce geometric constraints, thereby improving the accuracy of both pose estimation and 3D reconstruction. We also provide extensive experimental results on public benchmark datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods in terms of pose accuracy, geometric accuracy, and rendering performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Rapidly acquiring three-dimensional (3D) building data, including geometric attributes like rooftop, height and orientations, as well as indicative attributes like function, quality, and age, is essential for accurate urban analysis, simulations, and policy updates. Current building datasets suffer from incomplete coverage of building multi-attributes. This paper introduces a geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) framework for large-scale building modeling, presenting the first national-scale Multi-Attribute Building dataset (CMAB), covering 3,667 spatial cities, 29 million buildings, and 21.3 billion square meters of rooftops with an F1-Score of 89.93% in OCRNet-based extraction, totaling 337.7 billion cubic meters of building stock. We trained bootstrap aggregated XGBoost models with city administrative classifications, incorporating features such as morphology, location, and function. Using multi-source data, including billions of high-resolution Google Earth images and 60 million street view images (SVIs), we generated rooftop, height, function, age, and quality attributes for each building. Accuracy was validated through model benchmarks, existing similar products, and manual SVI validation, mostly above 80%. Our dataset and results are crucial for global SDGs and urban planning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhichao Liao, Di Huang, Heming Fang, Yue Ma, Fengyuan Piao, Xinghui Li, Long Zeng, Pingfa Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: Drawing freehand sketches of mechanical components on multimedia devices for AI-based engineering modeling has become a new trend. However, its development is being impeded because existing works cannot produce suitable sketches for data-driven research. These works either generate sketches lacking a freehand style or utilize generative models not originally designed for this task resulting in poor effectiveness. To address this issue, we design a two-stage generative framework mimicking the human sketching behavior pattern, called MSFormer, which is the first time to produce humanoid freehand sketches tailored for mechanical components. The first stage employs Open CASCADE technology to obtain multi-view contour sketches from mechanical components, filtering perturbing signals for the ensuing generation process. Meanwhile, we design a view selector to simulate viewpoint selection tasks during human sketching for picking out information-rich sketches. The second stage translates contour sketches into freehand sketches by a transformer-based generator. To retain essential modeling features as much as possible and rationalize stroke distribution, we introduce a novel edge-constraint stroke initialization. Furthermore, we utilize a CLIP vision encoder and a new loss function incorporating the Hausdorff distance to enhance the generalizability and robustness of the model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance for generating freehand sketches in the mechanical domain. Project page: https://mcfreeskegen.github.io .</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bishwash Khanal, Sanjay Rijal, Manish Awale, Vaghawan Ojha</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for structure-preserving planar simplification of indoor scene point clouds for both simulated and real-world environments. Initially, the scene point cloud undergoes preprocessing steps, including noise reduction and Manhattan world alignment, to ensure robustness and coherence in subsequent analyses. We segment each captured scene into structured (walls-ceiling-floor) and non-structured (indoor objects) scenes. Leveraging a RANSAC algorithm, we extract primitive planes from the input point cloud, facilitating the segmentation and simplification of the structured scene. The best-fitting wall meshes are then generated from the primitives, followed by adjacent mesh merging with the vertex-translation algorithm which preserves the mesh layout. To accurately represent ceilings and floors, we employ the mesh clipping algorithm which clips the ceiling and floor meshes with respect to wall normals. In the case of indoor scenes, we apply a surface reconstruction technique to enhance the fidelity. This paper focuses on the intricate steps of the proposed scene simplification methodology, addressing complex scenarios such as multi-story and slanted walls and ceilings. We also conduct qualitative and quantitative performance comparisons against popular surface reconstruction, shape approximation, and floorplan generation approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuai Yuan, Hanlin Qin, Renke Kou, Xiang Yan, Zechuan Li, Chenxu Peng, Abd-Krim Seghouane</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we make the first attempt to construct a learning-based single-point annotation paradigm for infrared small target label generation (IRSTLG). Our intuition is that label generation requires just one more point prompt than target detection: IRSTLG can be regarded as an infrared small target detection (IRSTD) task with the target location hint. Based on this insight, we introduce an energy double guided single-point prompt (EDGSP) framework, which adeptly transforms the target detection network into a refined label generation method. Specifically, the proposed EDGSP includes: 1) target energy initialization (TEI) to create a foundational outline for sufficient shape evolution of pseudo label, 2) double prompt embedding (DPE) for rapid localization of interested regions and reinforcement of individual differences to avoid label adhesion, and 3) bounding box-based matching (BBM) to eliminate false alarms. Experimental results show that pseudo labels generated by three baselines equipped with EDGSP achieve 100% object-level probability of detection (Pd) and 0% false-alarm rate (Fa) on SIRST, NUDT-SIRST, and IRSTD-1k datasets, with a pixel-level intersection over union (IoU) improvement of 13.28% over state-of-the-art (SOTA) label generation methods. In the practical application of downstream IRSTD, EDGSP realizes, for the first time, a single-point generated pseudo mask beyond the full label. Even with coarse single-point annotations, it still achieves 99.5% performance of full labeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vinit Hegiste, Tatjana Legler, Martin Ruskowski</p>
<p>Abstract: In the realm of Federated Learning (FL), particularly within the manufacturing sector, the strategy for selecting client weights for server aggregation is pivotal for model performance. This study investigates the comparative effectiveness of two weight selection strategies: Final Epoch Weight Selection (FEWS) and Optimal Epoch Weight Selection (OEWS). Designed for manufacturing contexts where collaboration typically involves a limited number of partners (two to four clients), our research focuses on federated image classification tasks. We employ various neural network architectures, including EfficientNet, ResNet, and VGG, to assess the impact of these weight selection strategies on model convergence and robustness. Our research aims to determine whether FEWS or OEWS enhances the global FL model's performance across communication rounds (CRs). Through empirical analysis and rigorous experimentation, we seek to provide valuable insights for optimizing FL implementations in manufacturing, ensuring that collaborative efforts yield the most effective and reliable models with a limited number of participating clients. The findings from this study are expected to refine FL practices significantly in manufacturing, thereby enhancing the efficiency and performance of collaborative machine learning endeavors in this vital sector.</p>

<p>Abstract: Long-context capability is critical for multi-modal foundation models, especially for long video understanding. We introduce LongVILA, a full-stack solution for long-context visual-language models by co-designing the algorithm and system. For model training, we upgrade existing VLMs to support long video understanding by incorporating two additional stages, i.e., long context extension and long supervised fine-tuning. However, training on long video is computationally and memory intensive. We introduce the long-context Multi-Modal Sequence Parallelism (MM-SP) system that efficiently parallelizes long video training and inference, enabling 2M context length training on 256 GPUs without any gradient checkpointing. LongVILA efficiently extends the number of video frames of VILA from 8 to 1024, improving the long video captioning score from 2.00 to 3.26 (out of 5), achieving 99.5% accuracy in 1400-frame (274k context length) video needle-in-a-haystack. LongVILA-8B demonstrates consistent accuracy improvements on long videos in the VideoMME benchmark as the number of frames increases. Besides, MM-SP is 2.1x - 5.7x faster than ring sequence parallelism and 1.1x - 1.4x faster than Megatron with context parallelism + tensor parallelism. Moreover, it seamlessly integrates with Hugging Face Transformers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rishit Dagli, Atsuhiro Hibi, Rahul G. Krishnan, Pascal N. Tyrrell</p>
<p>Abstract: Current methods for performing 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis (NVS) in ultrasound imaging data often face severe artifacts when training NeRF-based approaches. The artifacts produced by current approaches differ from NeRF floaters in general scenes because of the unique nature of ultrasound capture. Furthermore, existing models fail to produce reasonable 3D reconstructions when ultrasound data is captured or obtained casually in uncontrolled environments, which is common in clinical settings. Consequently, existing reconstruction and NVS methods struggle to handle ultrasound motion, fail to capture intricate details, and cannot model transparent and reflective surfaces. In this work, we introduced NeRF-US, which incorporates 3D-geometry guidance for border probability and scattering density into NeRF training, while also utilizing ultrasound-specific rendering over traditional volume rendering. These 3D priors are learned through a diffusion model. Through experiments conducted on our new "Ultrasound in the Wild" dataset, we observed accurate, clinically plausible, artifact-free reconstructions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seunghwan Kim, Byunghwee Lee, Wonjae Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: The advent of computational and numerical methods in recent times has provided new avenues for analyzing art historiographical narratives and tracing the evolution of art styles therein. Here, we investigate an evolutionary process underpinning the emergence and stylization of contemporary user-generated visual art styles using the complexity-entropy (C-H) plane, which quantifies local structures in paintings. Informatizing 149,780 images curated in DeviantArt and Behance platforms from 2010 to 2020, we analyze the relationship between local information of the C-H space and multi-level image features generated by a deep neural network and a feature extraction algorithm. The results reveal significant statistical relationships between the C-H information of visual artistic styles and the dissimilarities of the multi-level image features over time within groups of artworks. By disclosing a particular C-H region where the diversity of image representations is noticeably manifested, our analyses reveal an empirical condition of emerging styles that are both novel in the C-H plane and characterized by greater stylistic diversity. Our research shows that visual art analyses combined with physics-inspired methodologies and machine learning, can provide macroscopic insights into quantitatively mapping relevant characteristics of an evolutionary process underpinning the creative stylization of uncharted visual arts of given groups and time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuexing Han, Liheng Ruan, Bing Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The goal of image style transfer is to render an image guided by a style reference while maintaining the original content. Existing image-guided methods rely on specific style reference images, restricting their wider application and potentially compromising result quality. As a flexible alternative, text-guided methods allow users to describe the desired style using text prompts. Despite their versatility, these methods often struggle with maintaining style consistency, reflecting the described style accurately, and preserving the content of the target image. To address these challenges, we introduce FAGStyle, a zero-shot text-guided diffusion image style transfer method. Our approach enhances inter-patch information interaction by incorporating the Sliding Window Crop technique and Feature Augmentation on Geodesic Surface into our style control loss. Furthermore, we integrate a Pre-Shape self-correlation consistency loss to ensure content consistency. FAGStyle demonstrates superior performance over existing methods, consistently achieving stylization that retains the semantic content of the source image. Experimental results confirms the efficacy of FAGStyle across a diverse range of source contents and styles, both imagined and common.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Diandian Guo, Weixin Si, Zhixi Li, Jialun Pei, Pheng-Ann Heng</p>
<p>Abstract: Pringle maneuver (PM) in laparoscopic liver resection aims to reduce blood loss and provide a clear surgical view by intermittently blocking blood inflow of the liver, whereas prolonged PM may cause ischemic injury. To comprehensively monitor this surgical procedure and provide timely warnings of ineffective and prolonged blocking, we suggest two complementary AI-assisted surgical monitoring tasks: workflow recognition and blocking effectiveness detection in liver resections. The former presents challenges in real-time capturing of short-term PM, while the latter involves the intraoperative discrimination of long-term liver ischemia states. To address these challenges, we meticulously collect a novel dataset, called PmLR50, consisting of 25,037 video frames covering various surgical phases from 50 laparoscopic liver resection procedures. Additionally, we develop an online baseline for PmLR50, termed PmNet. This model embraces Masked Temporal Encoding (MTE) and Compressed Sequence Modeling (CSM) for efficient short-term and long-term temporal information modeling, and embeds Contrastive Prototype Separation (CPS) to enhance action discrimination between similar intraoperative operations. Experimental results demonstrate that PmNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art surgical workflow recognition methods on the PmLR50 benchmark. Our research offers potential clinical applications for the laparoscopic liver surgery community. Source code and data will be publicly available.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite recent advancements in text-to-image generation, most existing methods struggle to create images with multiple objects and complex spatial relationships in 3D world. To tackle this limitation, we introduce a generic AI system, namely MUSES, for 3D-controllable image generation from user queries. Specifically, our MUSES addresses this challenging task by developing a progressive workflow with three key components, including (1) Layout Manager for 2D-to-3D layout lifting, (2) Model Engineer for 3D object acquisition and calibration, (3) Image Artist for 3D-to-2D image rendering. By mimicking the collaboration of human professionals, this multi-modal agent pipeline facilitates the effective and automatic creation of images with 3D-controllable objects, through an explainable integration of top-down planning and bottom-up generation. Additionally, we find that existing benchmarks lack detailed descriptions of complex 3D spatial relationships of multiple objects. To fill this gap, we further construct a new benchmark of T2I-3DisBench (3D image scene), which describes diverse 3D image scenes with 50 detailed prompts. Extensive experiments show the state-of-the-art performance of MUSES on both T2I-CompBench and T2I-3DisBench, outperforming recent strong competitors such as DALL-E 3 and Stable Diffusion 3. These results demonstrate a significant step of MUSES forward in bridging natural language, 2D image generation, and 3D world.</p>

<p>Abstract: Machine vision enhances automation, quality control, and operational efficiency in industrial applications by enabling machines to interpret and act on visual data. While traditional computer vision algorithms and approaches remain widely utilized, machine learning has become pivotal in current research activities. In particular, generative AI demonstrates promising potential by improving pattern recognition capabilities, through data augmentation, increasing image resolution, and identifying anomalies for quality control. However, the application of generative AI in machine vision is still in its early stages due to challenges in data diversity, computational requirements, and the necessity for robust validation methods. A comprehensive literature review is essential to understand the current state of generative AI in industrial machine vision, focusing on recent advancements, applications, and research trends. Thus, a literature review based on the PRISMA guidelines was conducted, analyzing over 1,200 papers on generative AI in industrial machine vision. Our findings reveal various patterns in current research, with the primary use of generative AI being data augmentation, for machine vision tasks such as classification and object detection. Furthermore, we gather a collection of application challenges together with data requirements to enable a successful application of generative AI in industrial machine vision. This overview aims to provide researchers with insights into the different areas and applications within current research, highlighting significant advancements and identifying opportunities for future work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zijian Zhao, Tingwei Chen, Zhijie Cai, Xiaoyang Li, Hang Li, Qimei Chen, Guangxu Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, Wi-Fi sensing has garnered significant attention due to its numerous benefits, such as privacy protection, low cost, and penetration ability. Extensive research has been conducted in this field, focusing on areas such as gesture recognition, people identification, and fall detection. However, many data-driven methods encounter challenges related to domain shift, where the model fails to perform well in environments different from the training data. One major factor contributing to this issue is the limited availability of Wi-Fi sensing datasets, which makes models learn excessive irrelevant information and over-fit to the training set. Unfortunately, collecting large-scale Wi-Fi sensing datasets across diverse scenarios is a challenging task. To address this problem, we propose CrossFi, a siamese network-based approach that excels in both in-domain scenario and cross-domain scenario, including few-shot, zero-shot scenarios, and even works in few-shot new-class scenario where testing set contains new categories. The core component of CrossFi is a sample-similarity calculation network called CSi-Net, which improves the structure of the siamese network by using an attention mechanism to capture similarity information, instead of simply calculating the distance or cosine similarity. Based on it, we develop an extra Weight-Net that can generate a template for each class, so that our CrossFi can work in different scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our CrossFi achieves state-of-the-art performance across various scenarios. In gesture recognition task, our CrossFi achieves an accuracy of 98.17% in in-domain scenario, 91.72% in one-shot cross-domain scenario, 64.81% in zero-shot cross-domain scenario, and 84.75% in one-shot new-class scenario. To facilitate future research, we will release the code for our model upon publication.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingcai Chen, Yuntao Du, Yi Zhang, Shuwei Qian, Chongjun Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Co-training, extended from self-training, is one of the frameworks for semi-supervised learning. Without natural split of features, single-view co-training works at the cost of training extra classifiers, where the algorithm should be delicately designed to prevent individual classifiers from collapsing into each other. To remove these obstacles which deter the adoption of single-view co-training, we present a simple and efficient algorithm Multi-Head Co-Training. By integrating base learners into a multi-head structure, the model is in a minimal amount of extra parameters. Every classification head in the unified model interacts with its peers through a "Weak and Strong Augmentation" strategy, in which the diversity is naturally brought by the strong data augmentation. Therefore, the proposed method facilitates single-view co-training by 1). promoting diversity implicitly and 2). only requiring a small extra computational overhead. The effectiveness of Multi-Head Co-Training is demonstrated in an empirical study on standard semi-supervised learning benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuhan Li, Dong Zhang, Xiaomeng Li, Chubin Ou, Lin An, Yanwu Xu, Kwang-Ting Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) is a crucial tool in the clinical screening of retinal diseases, allowing for accurate 3D imaging of blood vessels through non-invasive scanning. However, the hardware-based approach for acquiring OCTA images presents challenges due to the need for specialized sensors and expensive devices. In this paper, we introduce a novel method called TransPro, which can translate the readily available 3D Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images into 3D OCTA images without requiring any additional hardware modifications. Our TransPro method is primarily driven by two novel ideas that have been overlooked by prior work. The first idea is derived from a critical observation that the OCTA projection map is generated by averaging pixel values from its corresponding B-scans along the Z-axis. Hence, we introduce a hybrid architecture incorporating a 3D adversarial generative network and a novel Heuristic Contextual Guidance (HCG) module, which effectively maintains the consistency of the generated OCTA images between 3D volumes and projection maps. The second idea is to improve the vessel quality in the translated OCTA projection maps. As a result, we propose a novel Vessel Promoted Guidance (VPG) module to enhance the attention of network on retinal vessels. Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that our TransPro outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, with relative improvements around 11.4% in MAE, 2.7% in PSNR, 2% in SSIM, 40% in VDE, and 9.1% in VDC compared to the baseline method.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vladyslav Andriiashen, Robert van Liere, Tristan van Leeuwen, K. Joost Batenburg</p>
<p>Abstract: Background: X-ray imaging is widely used for the non-destructive detection of defects in industrial products on a conveyor belt. In-line detection requires highly accurate, robust, and fast algorithms. Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) satisfy these requirements when a large amount of labeled data is available. To overcome the challenge of collecting these data, different methods of X-ray image generation are considered.
  Objective: Depending on the desired degree of similarity to real data, different physical effects should either be simulated or can be ignored. X-ray scattering is known to be computationally expensive to simulate, and this effect can greatly affect the accuracy of a generated X-ray image. We aim to quantitatively evaluate the effect of scattering on defect detection.
  Methods: Monte-Carlo simulation is used to generate X-ray scattering distribution. DCNNs are trained on the data with and without scattering and applied to the same test datasets. Probability of Detection (POD) curves are computed to compare their performance, characterized by the size of the smallest detectable defect.
  Results: We apply the methodology to a model problem of defect detection in cylinders. When trained on data without scattering, DCNNs reliably detect defects larger than 1.3 mm, and using data with scattering improves performance by less than 5%. If the analysis is performed on the cases with large scattering-to-primary ratio ($1 < SPR < 5$), the difference in performance could reach 15% (approx. 0.4 mm).
  Conclusion: Excluding the scattering signal from the training data has the largest effect on the smallest detectable defects, and the difference decreases for larger defects. The scattering-to-primary ratio has a significant effect on detection performance and the required accuracy of data generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tengchao Lv, Yupan Huang, Jingye Chen, Yuzhong Zhao, Yilin Jia, Lei Cui, Shuming Ma, Yaoyao Chang, Shaohan Huang, Wenhui Wang, Li Dong, Weiyao Luo, Shaoxiang Wu, Guoxin Wang, Cha Zhang, Furu Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: The automatic reading of text-intensive images represents a significant advancement toward achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). In this paper we present KOSMOS-2.5, a multimodal literate model for machine reading of text-intensive images. Pre-trained on a large-scale corpus of text-intensive images, KOSMOS-2.5 excels in two distinct yet complementary transcription tasks: (1) generating spatially-aware text blocks, where each block of text is assigned spatial coordinates within the image, and (2) producing structured text output that captures both style and structure in markdown format. This unified multimodal literate capability is achieved through a shared decoder-only autoregressive Transformer architecture and task-specific prompts. Building on this foundation, we fine-tune KOSMOS-2.5 for document understanding tasks, resulting in a document understanding generalist named KOSMOS-2.5-CHAT. Additionally, a large corpus of 357.4 million document pages spanning diverse domains was curated for pre-training. We evaluate KOSMOS-2.5 on two newly proposed benchmarks, OCREval and MarkdownEval, for document-level text recognition and image-to-markdown generation, demonstrating impressive literate capabilities comparable to GPT-4o. KOSMOS-2.5-CHAT achieves performance comparable to other state-of-the-art generalists that are five times larger (1.3B vs. 7B) across nine text-rich visual question answering benchmarks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoxiang Gao, Zhongruo Wang, Yaqian Li, Kaiwen Long, Ming Yang, Yiqing Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: The advent of foundation models has revolutionized the fields of natural language processing and computer vision, paving the way for their application in autonomous driving (AD). This survey presents a comprehensive review of more than 40 research papers, demonstrating the role of foundation models in enhancing AD. Large language models contribute to planning and simulation in AD, particularly through their proficiency in reasoning, code generation and translation. In parallel, vision foundation models are increasingly adapted for critical tasks such as 3D object detection and tracking, as well as creating realistic driving scenarios for simulation and testing. Multi-modal foundation models, integrating diverse inputs, exhibit exceptional visual understanding and spatial reasoning, crucial for end-to-end AD. This survey not only provides a structured taxonomy, categorizing foundation models based on their modalities and functionalities within the AD domain but also delves into the methods employed in current research. It identifies the gaps between existing foundation models and cutting-edge AD approaches, thereby charting future research directions and proposing a roadmap for bridging these gaps.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohamed Kissi, Mathieu Pont, Joshua A. Levine, Julien Tierny</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a practical approach for the optimization of topological simplification, a central pre-processing step for the analysis and visualization of scalar data. Given an input scalar field f and a set of "signal" persistence pairs to maintain, our approach produces an output field g that is close to f and which optimizes (i) the cancellation of "non-signal" pairs, while (ii) preserving the "signal" pairs. In contrast to pre-existing simplification algorithms, our approach is not restricted to persistence pairs involving extrema and can thus address a larger class of topological features, in particular saddle pairs in three-dimensional scalar data. Our approach leverages recent generic persistence optimization frameworks and extends them with tailored accelerations specific to the problem of topological simplification. Extensive experiments report substantial accelerations over these frameworks, thereby making topological simplification optimization practical for real-life datasets. Our approach enables a direct visualization and analysis of the topologically simplified data, e.g., via isosurfaces of simplified topology (fewer components and handles). We apply our approach to the extraction of prominent filament structures in three-dimensional data. Specifically, we show that our pre-simplification of the data leads to practical improvements over standard topological techniques for removing filament loops. We also show how our approach can be used to repair genus defects in surface processing. Finally, we provide a C++ implementation for reproducibility purposes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jielong Tang, Zhenxing Wang, Ziyang Gong, Jianxing Yu, Xiangwei Zhu, Jian Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Grounded Multimodal Named Entity Recognition (GMNER) is an emerging information extraction (IE) task, aiming to simultaneously extract entity spans, types, and corresponding visual regions of entities from given sentence-image pairs data. Recent unified methods employing machine reading comprehension or sequence generation-based frameworks show limitations in this difficult task. The former, utilizing human-designed queries, struggles to differentiate ambiguous entities, such as Jordan (Person) and off-White x Jordan (Shoes). The latter, following the one-by-one decoding order, suffers from exposure bias issues. We maintain that these works misunderstand the relationships of multimodal entities. To tackle these, we propose a novel unified framework named Multi-grained Query-guided Set Prediction Network (MQSPN) to learn appropriate relationships at intra-entity and inter-entity levels. Specifically, MQSPN consists of a Multi-grained Query Set (MQS) and a Multimodal Set Prediction Network (MSP). MQS explicitly aligns entity regions with entity spans by employing a set of learnable queries to strengthen intra-entity connections. Based on distinct intra-entity modeling, MSP reformulates GMNER as a set prediction, guiding models to establish appropriate inter-entity relationships from a global matching perspective. Additionally, we incorporate a query-guided Fusion Net (QFNet) to work as a glue network between MQS and MSP. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performances in widely used benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Enneng Yang, Li Shen, Guibing Guo, Xingwei Wang, Xiaochun Cao, Jie Zhang, Dacheng Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: Model merging is an efficient empowerment technique in the machine learning community that does not require the collection of raw training data and does not require expensive computation. As model merging becomes increasingly prevalent across various fields, it is crucial to understand the available model merging techniques comprehensively. However, there is a significant gap in the literature regarding a systematic and thorough review of these techniques. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of model merging methods and theories, their applications in various domains and settings, and future research directions. Specifically, we first propose a new taxonomic approach that exhaustively discusses existing model merging methods. Secondly, we discuss the application of model merging techniques in large language models, multimodal large language models, and 10+ machine learning subfields, including continual learning, multi-task learning, few-shot learning, etc. Finally, we highlight the remaining challenges of model merging and discuss future research directions.

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07832">LADDER: Language Driven Slice Discovery and Error Rectification</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shantanu Ghosh, Chenyu Wang, Kayhan Batmanghelich</p>
<p>Abstract: Error slice discovery associates structured patterns with model errors. Existing methods discover error slices by clustering the error-prone samples with similar patterns or assigning discrete attributes to each sample for post-hoc analysis. While these methods aim for interpretability and easier mitigation through reweighting or rebalancing, they may not capture the full complexity of error patterns due to incomplete or missing attributes. Contrary to the existing approach, this paper utilizes the reasoning capabilities of the Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze complex error patterns and generate testable hypotheses. This paper proposes LADDER: Language Driven slice Discovery and Error Rectification. It first projects the model's representation into a language-aligned feature space (\eg CLIP) to preserve semantics in the original model feature space. This ensures the accurate retrieval of sentences that highlight the model's errors. Next, the LLM utilizes the sentences and generates hypotheses to discover error slices. Finally, we mitigate the error by fine-tuning the classification head by creating a group-balanced dataset using the hypotheses. Our entire method does not require any attribute annotation, either explicitly or through external tagging models. We validate our method with \textbf{five} image classification datasets.

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08459">JPEG-LM: LLMs as Image Generators with Canonical Codec Representations</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaochuang Han, Marjan Ghazvininejad, Pang Wei Koh, Yulia Tsvetkov</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent work in image and video generation has been adopting the autoregressive LLM architecture due to its generality and potentially easy integration into multi-modal systems. The crux of applying autoregressive training in language generation to visual generation is discretization -- representing continuous data like images and videos as discrete tokens. Common methods of discretizing images and videos include modeling raw pixel values, which are prohibitively lengthy, or vector quantization, which requires convoluted pre-hoc training. In this work, we propose to directly model images and videos as compressed files saved on computers via canonical codecs (e.g., JPEG, AVC/H.264). Using the default Llama architecture without any vision-specific modifications, we pretrain JPEG-LM from scratch to generate images (and AVC-LM to generate videos as a proof of concept), by directly outputting compressed file bytes in JPEG and AVC formats. Evaluation of image generation shows that this simple and straightforward approach is more effective than pixel-based modeling and sophisticated vector quantization baselines (on which our method yields a 31% reduction in FID). Our analysis shows that JPEG-LM has an especial advantage over vector quantization models in generating long-tail visual elements. Overall, we show that using canonical codec representations can help lower the barriers between language generation and visual generation, facilitating future research on multi-modal language/image/video LLMs.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09731">Reconstruct Spine CT from Biplanar X-Rays via Diffusion Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhi Qiao, Xuhui Liu, Xiaopeng Wang, Runkun Liu, Xiantong Zhen, Pei Dong, Zhen Qian</p>
<p>Abstract: Intraoperative CT imaging serves as a crucial resource for surgical guidance; however, it may not always be readily accessible or practical to implement. In scenarios where CT imaging is not an option, reconstructing CT scans from X-rays can offer a viable alternative. In this paper, we introduce an innovative method for 3D CT reconstruction utilizing biplanar X-rays. Distinct from previous research that relies on conventional image generation techniques, our approach leverages a conditional diffusion process to tackle the task of reconstruction. More precisely, we employ a diffusion-based probabilistic model trained to produce 3D CT images based on orthogonal biplanar X-rays. To improve the structural integrity of the reconstructed images, we incorporate a novel projection loss function. Experimental results validate that our proposed method surpasses existing state-of-the-art benchmarks in both visual image quality and multiple evaluative metrics. Specifically, our technique achieves a higher Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of 0.83, a relative increase of 10\%, and a lower Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) of 83.43, which represents a relative decrease of 25\%.</p>
