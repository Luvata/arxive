<p><b>Authors:</b> Lihui Liu, Zihao Wang, Hanghang Tong</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge graph reasoning is pivotal in various domains such as data mining, artificial intelligence, the Web, and social sciences. These knowledge graphs function as comprehensive repositories of human knowledge, facilitating the inference of new information. Traditional symbolic reasoning, despite its strengths, struggles with the challenges posed by incomplete and noisy data within these graphs. In contrast, the rise of Neural Symbolic AI marks a significant advancement, merging the robustness of deep learning with the precision of symbolic reasoning. This integration aims to develop AI systems that are not only highly interpretable and explainable but also versatile, effectively bridging the gap between symbolic and neural methodologies. Additionally, the advent of large language models (LLMs) has opened new frontiers in knowledge graph reasoning, enabling the extraction and synthesis of knowledge in unprecedented ways. This survey offers a thorough review of knowledge graph reasoning, focusing on various query types and the classification of neural symbolic reasoning. Furthermore, it explores the innovative integration of knowledge graph reasoning with large language models, highlighting the potential for groundbreaking advancements. This comprehensive overview is designed to support researchers and practitioners across multiple fields, including data mining, AI, the Web, and social sciences, by providing a detailed understanding of the current landscape and future directions in knowledge graph reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Filippo Ziliotto, Tommaso Campari, Luciano Serafini, Lamberto Ballan</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated excellent capabilities in composing various modules together to create programs that can perform complex reasoning tasks on images. In this paper, we propose TANGO, an approach that extends the program composition via LLMs already observed for images, aiming to integrate those capabilities into embodied agents capable of observing and acting in the world. Specifically, by employing a simple PointGoal Navigation model combined with a memory-based exploration policy as a foundational primitive for guiding an agent through the world, we show how a single model can address diverse tasks without additional training. We task an LLM with composing the provided primitives to solve a specific task, using only a few in-context examples in the prompt. We evaluate our approach on three key Embodied AI tasks: Open-Set ObjectGoal Navigation, Multi-Modal Lifelong Navigation, and Open Embodied Question Answering, achieving state-of-the-art results without any specific fine-tuning in challenging zero-shot scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaofei Cai, Bowei Zhang, Zihao Wang, Haowei Lin, Xiaojian Ma, Anji Liu, Yitao Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Developing agents that can follow multimodal instructions remains a fundamental challenge in robotics and AI. Although large-scale pre-training on unlabeled datasets (no language instruction) has enabled agents to learn diverse behaviors, these agents often struggle with following instructions. While augmenting the dataset with instruction labels can mitigate this issue, acquiring such high-quality annotations at scale is impractical. To address this issue, we frame the problem as a semi-supervised learning task and introduce GROOT-2, a multimodal instructable agent trained using a novel approach that combines weak supervision with latent variable models. Our method consists of two key components: constrained self-imitating, which utilizes large amounts of unlabeled demonstrations to enable the policy to learn diverse behaviors, and human intention alignment, which uses a smaller set of labeled demonstrations to ensure the latent space reflects human intentions. GROOT-2's effectiveness is validated across four diverse environments, ranging from video games to robotic manipulation, demonstrating its robust multimodal instruction-following capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ching-Chun Chang, Isao Echizen</p>
<p>Abstract: The problem of subliminal communication has been addressed in various forms of steganography, primarily relying on visual, auditory and linguistic media. However, the field faces a fundamental paradox: as the art of concealment advances, so too does the science of revelation, leading to an ongoing evolutionary interplay. This study seeks to extend the boundaries of what is considered a viable steganographic medium. We explore a steganographic paradigm, where hidden information is communicated through the episodes of multiple agents interacting with an environment. Each agent, acting as an encoder, learns a policy to disguise the very existence of hidden messages within actions seemingly directed toward innocent objectives. Meanwhile, an observer, serving as a decoder, learns to associate behavioural patterns with their respective agents despite their dynamic nature, thereby unveiling the hidden messages. The interactions of agents are governed by the framework of multi-agent reinforcement learning and shaped by feedback from the observer. This framework encapsulates a game-theoretic dilemma, wherein agents face decisions between cooperating to create distinguishable behavioural patterns or defecting to pursue individually optimal yet potentially overlapping episodic actions. As a proof of concept, we exemplify action steganography through the game of labyrinth, a navigation task where subliminal communication is concealed within the act of steering toward a destination. The stego-system has been systematically validated through experimental evaluations, assessing its distortion and capacity alongside its secrecy and robustness when subjected to simulated passive and active adversaries.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maria Victoria Carro, Francisca Gauna Selasco, Denise Alejandra Mester, Margarita Gonzales, Mario A. Leiva, Maria Vanina Martinez, Gerardo I. Simari</p>
<p>Abstract: Causal learning is the cognitive process of developing the capability of making causal inferences based on available information, often guided by normative principles. This process is prone to errors and biases, such as the illusion of causality, in which people perceive a causal relationship between two variables despite lacking supporting evidence. This cognitive bias has been proposed to underlie many societal problems, including social prejudice, stereotype formation, misinformation, and superstitious thinking. In this research, we investigate whether large language models (LLMs) develop causal illusions, both in real-world and controlled laboratory contexts of causal learning and inference. To this end, we built a dataset of over 2K samples including purely correlational cases, situations with null contingency, and cases where temporal information excludes the possibility of causality by placing the potential effect before the cause. We then prompted the models to make statements or answer causal questions to evaluate their tendencies to infer causation erroneously in these structured settings. Our findings show a strong presence of causal illusion bias in LLMs. Specifically, in open-ended generation tasks involving spurious correlations, the models displayed bias at levels comparable to, or even lower than, those observed in similar studies on human subjects. However, when faced with null-contingency scenarios or temporal cues that negate causal relationships, where it was required to respond on a 0-100 scale, the models exhibited significantly higher bias. These findings suggest that the models have not uniformly, consistently, or reliably internalized the normative principles essential for accurate causal learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ana Ozaki, Roberto Confalonieri, Ricardo Guimar\~aes, Anders Imenes</p>
<p>Abstract: Decision trees are a popular machine learning method, known for their inherent explainability. In Explainable AI, decision trees can be used as surrogate models for complex black box AI models or as approximations of parts of such models. A key challenge of this approach is determining how accurately the extracted decision tree represents the original model and to what extent it can be trusted as an approximation of their behavior. In this work, we investigate the use of the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) framework to provide a theoretical guarantee of fidelity for decision trees extracted from AI models. Based on theoretical results from the PAC framework, we adapt a decision tree algorithm to ensure a PAC guarantee under certain conditions. We focus on binary classification and conduct experiments where we extract decision trees from BERT-based language models with PAC guarantees. Our results indicate occupational gender bias in these models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chi Zhang, Jiajun Song, Siyu Li, Yitao Liang, Yuxi Ma, Wei Wang, Yixin Zhu, Song-Chun Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Mathematics olympiads are prestigious competitions, with problem proposing and solving highly honored. Building artificial intelligence that proposes and solves olympiads presents an unresolved challenge in automated theorem discovery and proving, especially in geometry for its combination of numerical and spatial elements. We introduce TongGeometry, a Euclidean geometry system supporting tree-search-based guided problem proposing and solving. The efficient geometry system establishes the most extensive repository of geometry theorems to date: within the same computational budget as the existing state-of-the-art, TongGeometry discovers 6.7 billion geometry theorems requiring auxiliary constructions, including 4.1 billion exhibiting geometric symmetry. Among them, 10 theorems were proposed to regional mathematical olympiads with 3 of TongGeometry's proposals selected in real competitions, earning spots in a national team qualifying exam or a top civil olympiad in China and the US. Guided by fine-tuned large language models, TongGeometry solved all International Mathematical Olympiad geometry in IMO-AG-30, outperforming gold medalists for the first time. It also surpasses the existing state-of-the-art across a broader spectrum of olympiad-level problems. The full capabilities of the system can be utilized on a consumer-grade machine, making the model more accessible and fostering widespread democratization of its use. By analogy, unlike existing systems that merely solve problems like students, TongGeometry acts like a geometry coach, discovering, presenting, and proving theorems.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10798">AuctionNet: A Novel Benchmark for Decision-Making in Large-Scale Games</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Kefan Su, Yusen Huo, Zhilin Zhang, Shuai Dou, Chuan Yu, Jian Xu, Zongqing Lu, Bo Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Decision-making in large-scale games is an essential research area in artificial intelligence (AI) with significant real-world impact. However, the limited access to realistic large-scale game environments has hindered research progress in this area. In this paper, we present \textbf{AuctionNet}, a benchmark for bid decision-making in large-scale ad auctions derived from a real-world online advertising platform. AuctionNet is composed of three parts: an ad auction environment, a pre-generated dataset based on the environment, and performance evaluations of several baseline bid decision-making algorithms. More specifically, the environment effectively replicates the integrity and complexity of real-world ad auctions through the interaction of several modules: the ad opportunity generation module employs deep generative models to bridge the gap between simulated and real-world data while mitigating the risk of sensitive data exposure; the bidding module implements diverse auto-bidding agents trained with different decision-making algorithms; and the auction module is anchored in the classic Generalized Second Price (GSP) auction but also allows for customization of auction mechanisms as needed. To facilitate research and provide insights into the game environment, we have also pre-generated a substantial dataset based on the environment. The dataset contains trajectories involving 48 diverse agents competing with each other, totaling over 500 million records and occupying 80GB of storage. Performance evaluations of baseline algorithms such as linear programming, reinforcement learning, and generative models for bid decision-making are also presented as part of AuctionNet. We note that AuctionNet is applicable not only to research on bid decision-making algorithms in ad auctions but also to the general area of decision-making in large-scale games.</p>

<p>Abstract: Performance of large language models (LLMs) on medical tasks has traditionally been evaluated using multiple choice question benchmarks. However, such benchmarks are highly constrained, saturated with repeated impressive performance by LLMs, and have an unclear relationship to performance in real clinical scenarios. Clinical reasoning, the process by which physicians employ critical thinking to gather and synthesize clinical data to diagnose and manage medical problems, remains an attractive benchmark for model performance. Prior LLMs have shown promise in outperforming clinicians in routine and complex diagnostic scenarios. We sought to evaluate OpenAI's o1-preview model, a model developed to increase run-time via chain of thought processes prior to generating a response. We characterize the performance of o1-preview with five experiments including differential diagnosis generation, display of diagnostic reasoning, triage differential diagnosis, probabilistic reasoning, and management reasoning, adjudicated by physician experts with validated psychometrics. Our primary outcome was comparison of the o1-preview output to identical prior experiments that have historical human controls and benchmarks of previous LLMs. Significant improvements were observed with differential diagnosis generation and quality of diagnostic and management reasoning. No improvements were observed with probabilistic reasoning or triage differential diagnosis. This study highlights o1-preview's ability to perform strongly on tasks that require complex critical thinking such as diagnosis and management while its performance on probabilistic reasoning tasks was similar to past models. New robust benchmarks and scalable evaluation of LLM capabilities compared to human physicians are needed along with trials evaluating AI in real clinical settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently emerged as powerful tools, finding many medical applications. LLMs' ability to coalesce vast amounts of information from many sources to generate a response-a process similar to that of a human expert-has led many to see potential in deploying LLMs for clinical use. However, medicine is a setting where accurate reasoning is paramount. Many researchers are questioning the effectiveness of multiple choice question answering (MCQA) benchmarks, frequently used to test LLMs. Researchers and clinicians alike must have complete confidence in LLMs' abilities for them to be deployed in a medical setting. To address this need for understanding, we introduce a knowledge graph (KG)-based method to evaluate the biomedical reasoning abilities of LLMs. Essentially, we map how LLMs link medical concepts in order to better understand how they reason. We test GPT-4, Llama3-70b, and PalmyraMed-70b, a specialized medical model. We enlist a panel of medical students to review a total of 60 LLM-generated graphs and compare these graphs to BIOS, a large biomedical KG. We observe GPT-4 to perform best in our human review but worst in our ground truth comparison; vice-versa with PalmyraMed, the medical model. Our work provides a means of visualizing the medical reasoning pathways of LLMs so they can be implemented in clinical settings safely and effectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shenxiong Li, Huaxia Rui</p>
<p>Abstract: We conducted three experiments to investigate how large language models (LLMs) evaluate posterior probabilities. Our results reveal the coexistence of two modes in posterior judgment among state-of-the-art models: a normative mode, which adheres to Bayes' rule, and a representative-based mode, which relies on similarity -- paralleling human System 1 and System 2 thinking. Additionally, we observed that LLMs struggle to recall base rate information from their memory, and developing prompt engineering strategies to mitigate representative-based judgment may be challenging. We further conjecture that the dual modes of judgment may be a result of the contrastive loss function employed in reinforcement learning from human feedback. Our findings underscore the potential direction for reducing cognitive biases in LLMs and the necessity for cautious deployment of LLMs in critical areas.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> William Watson, Nicole Cho, Nishan Srishankar, Zhen Zeng, Lucas Cecchi, Daniel Scott, Suchetha Siddagangappa, Rachneet Kaur, Tucker Balch, Manuela Veloso</p>
<p>Abstract: Legal contracts in the custody and fund services domain govern critical aspects such as key provider responsibilities, fee schedules, and indemnification rights. However, it is challenging for an off-the-shelf Large Language Model (LLM) to ingest these contracts due to the lengthy unstructured streams of text, limited LLM context windows, and complex legal jargon. To address these challenges, we introduce LAW (Legal Agentic Workflows for Custody and Fund Services Contracts). LAW features a modular design that responds to user queries by orchestrating a suite of domain-specific tools and text agents. Our experiments demonstrate that LAW, by integrating multiple specialized agents and tools, significantly outperforms the baseline. LAW excels particularly in complex tasks such as calculating a contract's termination date, surpassing the baseline by 92.9% points. Furthermore, LAW offers a cost-effective alternative to traditional fine-tuned legal LLMs by leveraging reusable, domain-specific tools.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sebastian Gutierrez, Irene Hou, Jihye Lee, Kenneth Angelikas, Owen Man, Sophia Mettille, James Prather, Paul Denny, Stephen MacNeil</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in generative AI systems have raised concerns about academic integrity among educators. Beyond excelling at solving programming problems and text-based multiple-choice questions, recent research has also found that large multimodal models (LMMs) can solve Parsons problems based only on an image. However, such problems are still inherently text-based and rely on the capabilities of the models to convert the images of code blocks to their corresponding text. In this paper, we further investigate the capabilities of LMMs to solve graph and tree data structure problems based only on images. To achieve this, we computationally construct and evaluate a novel benchmark dataset comprising 9,072 samples of diverse graph and tree data structure tasks to assess the performance of the GPT-4o, GPT-4v, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Gemini 1.5 Flash, Gemini 1.0 Pro Vision, and Claude 3 model families. GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Flash performed best on trees and graphs respectively. GPT-4o achieved 87.6% accuracy on tree samples, while Gemini 1.5 Flash, achieved 56.2% accuracy on graph samples. Our findings highlight the influence of structural and visual variations on model performance. This research not only introduces an LMM benchmark to facilitate replication and further exploration but also underscores the potential of LMMs in solving complex computing problems, with important implications for pedagogy and assessment practices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Byungjun Kim, Minju Kim, Dayeon Seo, Bugeun Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: We highlight two significant issues leading to the passivity of current merchant non-player characters (NPCs): pricing and communication. While immersive interactions have been a focus, negotiations between merchant NPCs and players on item prices have not received sufficient attention. First, we define passive pricing as the limited ability of merchants to modify predefined item prices. Second, passive communication means that merchants can only interact with players in a scripted manner. To tackle these issues and create an active merchant NPC, we propose a merchant framework based on large language models (LLMs), called MART, which consists of an appraiser module and a negotiator module. We conducted two experiments to guide game developers in selecting appropriate implementations by comparing different training methods and LLM sizes. Our findings indicate that finetuning methods, such as supervised finetuning (SFT) and knowledge distillation (KD), are effective in using smaller LLMs to implement active merchant NPCs. Additionally, we found three irregular cases arising from the responses of LLMs. We expect our findings to guide developers in using LLMs for developing active merchant NPCs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matthew Stephenson, Matthew Sidji, Beno\^it Ronval</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose the use of the popular word-based board game Codenames as a suitable benchmark for evaluating the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Codenames presents a highly interesting challenge for achieving successful AI performance, requiring both a sophisticated understanding of language, theory of mind, and epistemic reasoning capabilities. Prior attempts to develop agents for Codenames have largely relied on word embedding techniques, which have a limited vocabulary range and perform poorly when paired with differing approaches. LLMs have demonstrated enhanced reasoning and comprehension capabilities for language-based tasks, but can still suffer in lateral thinking challenges. We evaluate the capabilities of several state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Llama 3.1, across a variety of board setups. Our results indicate that while certain LLMs perform better than others overall, different models exhibit varying emergent behaviours during gameplay and excel at specific roles. We also evaluate the performance of different combinations of LLMs when playing cooperatively together, demonstrating that LLM agents are more generalisable to a wider range of teammates than prior techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junjie Lin, Jian Zhao, Yue Deng, Youpeng Zhao, Wengang Zhou, Houqiang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditionally, AI development for two-player zero-sum games has relied on two primary techniques: decision trees and reinforcement learning (RL). A common approach involves using a fixed decision tree as one player's strategy while training an RL agent as the opponent to identify vulnerabilities in the decision tree, thereby improving its strategic strength iteratively. However, this process often requires significant human intervention to refine the decision tree after identifying its weaknesses, resulting in inefficiencies and hindering full automation of the strategy enhancement process. Fortunately, the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers a transformative opportunity to automate the process. We propose RL-LLM-DT, an automatic decision tree generation method based on RL Evaluation and LLM Enhancement. Given an initial decision tree, the method involves two important iterative steps. Response Policy Search: RL is used to discover counter-strategies targeting the decision tree. Policy Improvement: LLMs analyze failure scenarios and generate improved decision tree code. In our method, RL focuses on finding the decision tree's flaws while LLM is prompted to generate an improved version of the decision tree. The iterative refinement process terminates when RL can't find any flaw of the tree or LLM fails to improve the tree. To evaluate the effectiveness of this integrated approach, we conducted experiments in a curling game. After iterative refinements, our curling AI based on the decision tree ranks first on the Jidi platform among 34 curling AIs in total, which demonstrates that LLMs can significantly enhance the robustness and adaptability of decision trees, representing a substantial advancement in the field of Game AI.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Duc-Cuong Dang, Aneta Neumann, Frank Neumann, Andre Opris, Dirk Sudholt</p>
<p>Abstract: Quality diversity (QD) algorithms have shown to provide sets of high quality solutions for challenging problems in robotics, games, and combinatorial optimisation. So far, theoretical foundational explaining their good behaviour in practice lack far behind their practical success. We contribute to the theoretical understanding of these algorithms and study the behaviour of QD algorithms for a classical planning problem seeking several solutions. We study the all-pairs-shortest-paths (APSP) problem which gives a natural formulation of the behavioural space based on all pairs of nodes of the given input graph that can be used by Map-Elites QD algorithms. Our results show that Map-Elites QD algorithms are able to compute a shortest path for each pair of nodes efficiently in parallel. Furthermore, we examine parent selection techniques for crossover that exhibit significant speed ups compared to the standard QD approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wonje Choi, Woo Kyung Kim, SeungHyun Kim, Honguk Woo</p>
<p>Abstract: For embodied reinforcement learning (RL) agents interacting with the environment, it is desirable to have rapid policy adaptation to unseen visual observations, but achieving zero-shot adaptation capability is considered as a challenging problem in the RL context. To address the problem, we present a novel contrastive prompt ensemble (ConPE) framework which utilizes a pretrained vision-language model and a set of visual prompts, thus enabling efficient policy learning and adaptation upon a wide range of environmental and physical changes encountered by embodied agents. Specifically, we devise a guided-attention-based ensemble approach with multiple visual prompts on the vision-language model to construct robust state representations. Each prompt is contrastively learned in terms of an individual domain factor that significantly affects the agent's egocentric perception and observation. For a given task, the attention-based ensemble and policy are jointly learned so that the resulting state representations not only generalize to various domains but are also optimized for learning the task. Through experiments, we show that ConPE outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms for several embodied agent tasks including navigation in AI2THOR, manipulation in egocentric-Metaworld, and autonomous driving in CARLA, while also improving the sample efficiency of policy learning and adaptation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wonje Choi, Woo Kyung Kim, Minjong Yoo, Honguk Woo</p>
<p>Abstract: We address the challenge of utilizing large language models (LLMs) for complex embodied tasks, in the environment where decision-making systems operate timely on capacity-limited, off-the-shelf devices. We present DeDer, a framework for decomposing and distilling the embodied reasoning capabilities from LLMs to efficient, small language model (sLM)-based policies. In DeDer, the decision-making process of LLM-based strategies is restructured into a hierarchy with a reasoning-policy and planning-policy. The reasoning-policy is distilled from the data that is generated through the embodied in-context learning and self-verification of an LLM, so it can produce effective rationales. The planning-policy, guided by the rationales, can render optimized plans efficiently. In turn, DeDer allows for adopting sLMs for both policies, deployed on off-the-shelf devices. Furthermore, to enhance the quality of intermediate rationales, specific to embodied tasks, we devise the embodied knowledge graph, and to generate multiple rationales timely through a single inference, we also use the contrastively prompted attention model. Our experiments with the ALFRED benchmark demonstrate that DeDer surpasses leading language planning and distillation approaches, indicating the applicability and efficiency of sLM-based embodied policies derived through DeDer.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marco Aiello, Ilche Georgievski</p>
<p>Abstract: These are notes for lectures presented at the University of Stuttgart that provide an introduction to key concepts and techniques in AI Planning. Artificial Intelligence Planning, also known as Automated Planning, emerged somewhere in 1966 from the need to give autonomy to a wheeled robot. Since then, it has evolved into a flourishing research and development discipline, often associated with scheduling. Over the decades, various approaches to planning have been developed with characteristics that make them appropriate for specific tasks and applications. Most approaches represent the world as a state within a state transition system; then the planning problem becomes that of searching a path in the state space from the current state to one which satisfies the goals of the user. The notes begin by introducing the state model and move on to exploring classical planning, the foundational form of planning, and present fundamental algorithms for solving such problems. Subsequently, we examine planning as a constraint satisfaction problem, outlining the mapping process and describing an approach to solve such problems. The most extensive section is dedicated to Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planning, one of the most widely used and powerful planning techniques in the field. The lecture notes end with a bonus chapter on the Planning Domain Definition (PDDL) Language, the de facto standard syntax for representing non-hierarchical planning problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lillian Wassim, Kamal Mohamed, Ali Hamdi</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose LLM-DaaS, a novel Drone-as-a-Service (DaaS) framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform free-text user requests into structured, actionable DaaS operation tasks. Our approach addresses the key challenge of interpreting and structuring natural language input to automate drone service operations under uncertain conditions. The system is composed of three main components: free-text request processing, structured request generation, and dynamic DaaS selection and composition. First, we fine-tune different LLM models such as Phi-3.5, LLaMA-3.2 7b and Gemma 2b on a dataset of text user requests mapped to structured DaaS requests. Users interact with our model in a free conversational style, discussing package delivery requests, while the fine-tuned LLM extracts DaaS metadata such as delivery time, source and destination locations, and package weight. The DaaS service selection model is designed to select the best available drone capable of delivering the requested package from the delivery point to the nearest optimal destination. Additionally, the DaaS composition model composes a service from a set of the best available drones to deliver the package from the source to the final destination. Second, the system integrates real-time weather data to optimize drone route planning and scheduling, ensuring safe and efficient operations. Simulations demonstrate the system's ability to significantly improve task accuracy, operational efficiency, and establish LLM-DaaS as a robust solution for DaaS operations in uncertain environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: From the Specific-MLLM, which excels in single-modal tasks, to the Omni-MLLM, which extends the range of general modalities, this evolution aims to achieve understanding and generation of multimodal information. Omni-MLLM treats the features of different modalities as different "foreign languages," enabling cross-modal interaction and understanding within a unified space. To promote the advancement of related research, we have compiled 47 relevant papers to provide the community with a comprehensive introduction to Omni-MLLM. We first explain the four core components of Omni-MLLM for unified modeling and interaction of multiple modalities. Next, we introduce the effective integration achieved through "alignment pretraining" and "instruction fine-tuning," and discuss open-source datasets and testing of interaction capabilities. Finally, we summarize the main challenges facing current Omni-MLLM and outline future directions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Timoth\'ee Anne, Noah Syrkis, Meriem Elhosni, Florian Turati, Franck Legendre, Alain Jaquier, Sebastian Risi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various tasks. A promising but largely under-explored area is their potential to facilitate human coordination with many agents. Such capabilities would be useful in domains including disaster response, urban planning, and real-time strategy scenarios. In this work, we introduce (1) a real-time strategy game benchmark designed to evaluate these abilities and (2) a novel framework we term HIVE. HIVE empowers a single human to coordinate swarms of up to 2,000 agents using natural language dialog with an LLM. We present promising results on this multi-agent benchmark, with our hybrid approach solving tasks such as coordinating agent movements, exploiting unit weaknesses, leveraging human annotations, and understanding terrain and strategic points. However, our findings also highlight critical limitations of current models, including difficulties in processing spatial visual information and challenges in formulating long-term strategic plans. This work sheds light on the potential and limitations of LLMs in human-swarm coordination, paving the way for future research in this area. The HIVE project page, which includes videos of the system in action, can be found here: hive.syrkis.com.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Heng Zhang, Donghui Quan</p>
<p>Abstract: There has been a longstanding dispute over which formalism is the best for representing knowledge in AI. The well-known "declarative vs. procedural controversy" is concerned with the choice of utilizing declarations or procedures as the primary mode of knowledge representation. The ongoing debate between symbolic AI and connectionist AI also revolves around the question of whether knowledge should be represented implicitly (e.g., as parametric knowledge in deep learning and large language models) or explicitly (e.g., as logical theories in traditional knowledge representation and reasoning). To address these issues, we propose a general framework to capture various knowledge representation formalisms in which we are interested. Within the framework, we find a family of universal knowledge representation formalisms, and prove that all universal formalisms are recursively isomorphic. Moreover, we show that all pairwise intertranslatable formalisms that admit the padding property are also recursively isomorphic. These imply that, up to an offline compilation, all universal (or natural and equally expressive) representation formalisms are in fact the same, which thus provides a partial answer to the aforementioned dispute.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yakoub Salhi</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a syntactic framework for analyzing and handling inconsistencies in propositional bases. Our approach focuses on examining the relationships between variable occurrences within conflicts. We propose two dual concepts: Minimal Inconsistency Relation (MIR) and Maximal Consistency Relation (MCR). Each MIR is a minimal equivalence relation on variable occurrences that results in inconsistency, while each MCR is a maximal equivalence relation designed to prevent inconsistency. Notably, MIRs capture conflicts overlooked by minimal inconsistent subsets. Using MCRs, we develop a series of non-explosive inference relations. The main strategy involves restoring consistency by modifying the propositional base according to each MCR, followed by employing the classical inference relation to derive conclusions. Additionally, we propose an unusual semantics that assigns truth values to variable occurrences instead of the variables themselves. The associated inference relations are established through Boolean interpretations compatible with the occurrence-based models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shane Storks, Itamar Bar-Yossef, Yayuan Li, Zheyuan Zhang, Jason J. Corso, Joyce Chai</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated task guidance has recently attracted attention from the AI research community. Procedural mistake detection (PMD) is a challenging sub-problem of classifying whether a human user (observed through egocentric video) has successfully executed the task at hand (specified by a procedural text). Despite significant efforts in building resources and models for PMD, machine performance remains nonviable, and the reasoning processes underlying this performance are opaque. As such, we recast PMD to an explanatory self-dialog of questions and answers, which serve as evidence for a decision. As this reformulation enables an unprecedented transparency, we leverage a fine-tuned natural language inference (NLI) model to formulate two automated coherence metrics for generated explanations. Our results show that while open-source VLMs struggle with this task off-the-shelf, their accuracy, coherence, and dialog efficiency can be vastly improved by incorporating these coherence metrics into common inference and fine-tuning methods. Furthermore, our multi-faceted metrics can visualize common outcomes at a glance, highlighting areas for improvement.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingyu Peng, Maolin Wang, Xiangyu Zhao, Kai Zhang, Wanyu Wang, Pengyue Jia, Qidong Liu, Ruocheng Guo, Qi Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable strides in complex reasoning tasks, but their safety and robustness in reasoning processes remain underexplored. Existing attacks on LLM reasoning are constrained by specific settings or lack of imperceptibility, limiting their feasibility and generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose the Stepwise rEasoning Error Disruption (SEED) attack, which subtly injects errors into prior reasoning steps to mislead the model into producing incorrect subsequent reasoning and final answers. Unlike previous methods, SEED is compatible with zero-shot and few-shot settings, maintains the natural reasoning flow, and ensures covert execution without modifying the instruction. Extensive experiments on four datasets across four different models demonstrate SEED's effectiveness, revealing the vulnerabilities of LLMs to disruptions in reasoning processes. These findings underscore the need for greater attention to the robustness of LLM reasoning to ensure safety in practical applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianxiang Yu, Jiaqi Tan, Zichen Ding, Jiapeng Zhu, Jiahao Li, Yao Cheng, Qier Cui, Yunshi Lan, Xiang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Peer review, as a cornerstone of scientific research, ensures the integrity and quality of scholarly work by providing authors with objective feedback for refinement. However, in the traditional peer review process, authors often receive vague or insufficiently detailed feedback, which provides limited assistance and leads to a more time-consuming review cycle. If authors can identify some specific weaknesses in their paper, they can not only address the reviewer's concerns but also improve their work. This raises the critical question of how to enhance authors' comprehension of review comments. In this paper, we present SEAGraph, a novel framework developed to clarify review comments by uncovering the underlying intentions behind them. We construct two types of graphs for each paper: the semantic mind graph, which captures the author's thought process, and the hierarchical background graph, which delineates the research domains related to the paper. A retrieval method is then designed to extract relevant content from both graphs, facilitating coherent explanations for the review comments. Extensive experiments show that SEAGraph excels in review comment understanding tasks, offering significant benefits to authors.</p>

At its core is Llama-OpenReviewer-8B, an 8B parameter language model specifically fine-tuned on 79,000 expert reviews from top ML conferences. Given a PDF paper submission and review template as input, OpenReviewer extracts the full text, including technical content like equations and tables, and generates a structured review following conference-specific guidelines. Our evaluation on 400 test papers shows that OpenReviewer produces significantly more critical and realistic reviews compared to general-purpose LLMs like GPT-4 and Claude-3.5. While other LLMs tend toward overly positive assessments, OpenReviewer's recommendations closely match the distribution of human reviewer ratings. The system provides authors with rapid, constructive feedback to improve their manuscripts before submission, though it is not intended to replace human peer review.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Filip Cano, Thomas A. Henzinger, Bettina K\"onighofer, Konstantin Kueffner, Kaushik Mallik</p>
<p>Abstract: As AI-based decision-makers increasingly influence human lives, it is a growing concern that their decisions are often unfair or biased with respect to people's sensitive attributes, such as gender and race. Most existing bias prevention measures provide probabilistic fairness guarantees in the long run, and it is possible that the decisions are biased on specific instances of short decision sequences. We introduce fairness shielding, where a symbolic decision-maker -- the fairness shield -- continuously monitors the sequence of decisions of another deployed black-box decision-maker, and makes interventions so that a given fairness criterion is met while the total intervention costs are minimized. We present four different algorithms for computing fairness shields, among which one guarantees fairness over fixed horizons, and three guarantee fairness periodically after fixed intervals. Given a distribution over future decisions and their intervention costs, our algorithms solve different instances of bounded-horizon optimal control problems with different levels of computational costs and optimality guarantees. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of these shields in ensuring fairness while maintaining cost efficiency across various scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Senkang Hu, Yihang Tao, Guowen Xu, Yiqin Deng, Xianhao Chen, Yuguang Fang, Sam Kwong</p>
<p>Abstract: Collaborative Perception (CP) has shown a promising technique for autonomous driving, where multiple connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) share their perception information to enhance the overall perception performance and expand the perception range. However, in CP, ego CAV needs to receive messages from its collaborators, which makes it easy to be attacked by malicious agents. For example, a malicious agent can send harmful information to the ego CAV to mislead it. To address this critical issue, we propose a novel method, \textbf{CP-Guard}, a tailored defense mechanism for CP that can be deployed by each agent to accurately detect and eliminate malicious agents in its collaboration network. Our key idea is to enable CP to reach a consensus rather than a conflict against the ego CAV's perception results. Based on this idea, we first develop a probability-agnostic sample consensus (PASAC) method to effectively sample a subset of the collaborators and verify the consensus without prior probabilities of malicious agents. Furthermore, we define a collaborative consistency loss (CCLoss) to capture the discrepancy between the ego CAV and its collaborators, which is used as a verification criterion for consensus. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments in collaborative bird's eye view (BEV) tasks and our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our CP-Guard.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rajat Khanda</p>
<p>Abstract: Technical troubleshooting in enterprise environments often involves navigating diverse, heterogeneous data sources to resolve complex issues effectively. This paper presents a novel agentic AI solution built on a Weighted Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Framework tailored for enterprise technical troubleshooting. By dynamically weighting retrieval sources such as product manuals, internal knowledge bases, FAQs, and troubleshooting guides based on query context, the framework prioritizes the most relevant data. For instance, it gives precedence to product manuals for SKU-specific queries while incorporating general FAQs for broader issues. The system employs FAISS for efficient dense vector search, coupled with a dynamic aggregation mechanism to seamlessly integrate results from multiple sources. A Llama-based self-evaluator ensures the contextual accuracy and confidence of the generated responses before delivering them. This iterative cycle of retrieval and validation enhances precision, diversity, and reliability in response generation. Preliminary evaluations on large enterprise datasets demonstrate the framework's efficacy in improving troubleshooting accuracy, reducing resolution times, and adapting to varied technical challenges. Future research aims to enhance the framework by integrating advanced conversational AI capabilities, enabling more interactive and intuitive troubleshooting experiences. Efforts will also focus on refining the dynamic weighting mechanism through reinforcement learning to further optimize the relevance and precision of retrieved information. By incorporating these advancements, the proposed framework is poised to evolve into a comprehensive, autonomous AI solution, redefining technical service workflows across enterprise settings.</p>

This article endeavors to review the topics where AI and traffic management intersect. It comprises areas like AI-powered traffic signal control systems, automatic distance and velocity recognition (for instance, in autonomous vehicles, hereafter AVs), smart parking systems, and Intelligent Traffic Management Systems (ITMS), which use data captured in real-time to keep track of traffic conditions, and traffic-related law enforcement and surveillance using AI. AI applications in traffic management cover a wide range of spheres. The spheres comprise, inter alia, streamlining traffic signal timings, predicting traffic bottlenecks in specific areas, detecting potential accidents and road hazards, managing incidents accurately, advancing public transportation systems, development of innovative driver assistance systems, and minimizing environmental impact through simplified routes and reduced emissions. The benefits of AI in traffic management are also diverse. They comprise improved management of traffic data, sounder route decision automation, easier and speedier identification and resolution of vehicular issues through monitoring the condition of individual vehicles, decreased traffic snarls and mishaps, superior resource utilization, alleviated stress of traffic management manpower, greater on-road safety, and better emergency response time.</p>

<p>Abstract: Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) form a prominent model for uncertainty in sequential decision making. We are interested in constructing algorithms with theoretical guarantees to determine whether the agent has a strategy ensuring a given specification with probability 1. This well-studied problem is known to be undecidable already for very simple omega-regular objectives, because of the difficulty of reasoning on uncertain events. We introduce a revelation mechanism which restricts information loss by requiring that almost surely the agent has eventually full information of the current state. Our main technical results are to construct exact algorithms for two classes of POMDPs called weakly and strongly revealing. Importantly, the decidable cases reduce to the analysis of a finite belief-support Markov decision process. This yields a conceptually simple and exact algorithm for a large class of POMDPs.</p>

Building on prior research and informed by a communication grounding perspective, we contribute to the study of \emph{human-agent communication} by identifying and analyzing twelve key communication challenges that these systems pose. These include challenges in conveying information from the agent to the user, challenges in enabling the user to convey information to the agent, and overarching challenges that need to be considered across all human-agent communication. We illustrate each challenge through concrete examples and identify open directions of research. Our findings provide insights into critical gaps in human-agent communication research and serve as an urgent call for new design patterns, principles, and guidelines to support transparency and control in these systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingxin Liu, Xiang Gao, Yisha Li, Xin Li, Haiyang Lu, Ben Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been widely applied in recommendation systems to capture users' long-term engagement, thereby improving dwelling time and enhancing user retention. In the context of a short video & live-stream mixed recommendation scenario, the live-stream recommendation system (RS) decides whether to inject at most one live-stream into the video feed for each user request. To maximize long-term user engagement, it is crucial to determine an optimal live-stream injection policy for accurate live-stream allocation. However, traditional RL algorithms often face divergence and instability problems, and these issues are even more pronounced in our scenario. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Supervised Learning-enhanced Multi-Group Actor Critic algorithm (SL-MGAC). Specifically, we introduce a supervised learning-enhanced actor-critic framework that incorporates variance reduction techniques, where multi-task reward learning helps restrict bootstrapping error accumulation during critic learning. Additionally, we design a multi-group state decomposition module for both actor and critic networks to reduce prediction variance and improve model stability. Empirically, we evaluate the SL-MGAC algorithm using offline policy evaluation (OPE) and online A/B testing. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only outperforms baseline methods but also exhibits enhanced stability in online recommendation scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zoe Ruo-Yu Li, Caswell Barry, Mutlu Cukurova</p>
<p>Abstract: The widespread use of generative AI has led to multiple applications of AI-generated text and media to potentially enhance learning outcomes. However, there are a limited number of well-designed experimental studies investigating the impact of learning gains and affective feedback from AI-generated media compared to traditional media (e.g., text from documents and human recordings of video). The current study recruited 500 participants to investigate adult learners recall and recognition performances as well as their affective feedback on the AI-generated synthetic video, using a mixed-methods approach with a pre-and post-test design. Specifically, four learning conditions, AI-generated framing of human instructor-generated text, AI-generated synthetic videos with human instructor-generated text, human instructor-generated videos, and human instructor-generated text frame (baseline), were considered. The results indicated no statistically significant difference amongst conditions on recall and recognition performance. In addition, the participants affective feedback was not statistically significantly different between the two video conditions. However, adult learners preferred to learn from the video formats rather than text materials.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper surveys research in the rapidly growing field of enhancing large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning (RL), a technique that enables LLMs to improve their performance by receiving feedback in the form of rewards based on the quality of their outputs, allowing them to generate more accurate, coherent, and contextually appropriate responses. In this work, we make a systematic review of the most up-to-date state of knowledge on RL-enhanced LLMs, attempting to consolidate and analyze the rapidly growing research in this field, helping researchers understand the current challenges and advancements. Specifically, we (1) detail the basics of RL; (2) introduce popular RL-enhanced LLMs; (3) review researches on two widely-used reward model-based RL techniques: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF); and (4) explore Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), a set of methods that bypass the reward model to directly use human preference data for aligning LLM outputs with human expectations. We will also point out current challenges and deficiencies of existing methods and suggest some avenues for further improvements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shashank Pathak, Guohui Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Motivation: Codon optimization of Open Reading Frame (ORF) sequences is essential for enhancing mRNA stability and expression in applications like mRNA vaccines, where codon choice can significantly impact protein yield which directly impacts immune strength. In this work, we investigate the use of a pre-trained protein language model (PPLM) for getting a rich representation of amino acids which could be utilized for codon optimization. This leaves us with a simpler fine-tuning task over PPLM in optimizing ORF sequences.
  Results: The ORFs generated by our proposed models outperformed their natural counterparts encoding the same proteins on computational metrics for stability and expression. They also demonstrated enhanced performance against the benchmark ORFs used in mRNA vaccines for the SARS-CoV-2 viral spike protein and the varicella-zoster virus (VZV). These results highlight the potential of adapting PPLM for designing ORFs tailored to encode target antigens in mRNA vaccines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Imran, Abdul Wahab Ziaullah, Kai Chen, Ferda Ofli</p>
<p>Abstract: The widespread use of microblogging platforms like X (formerly Twitter) during disasters provides real-time information to governments and response authorities. However, the data from these platforms is often noisy, requiring automated methods to filter relevant information. Traditionally, supervised machine learning models have been used, but they lack generalizability. In contrast, Large Language Models (LLMs) show better capabilities in understanding and processing natural language out of the box. This paper provides a detailed analysis of the performance of six well-known LLMs in processing disaster-related social media data from a large-set of real-world events. Our findings indicate that while LLMs, particularly GPT-4o and GPT-4, offer better generalizability across different disasters and information types, most LLMs face challenges in processing flood-related data, show minimal improvement despite the provision of examples (i.e., shots), and struggle to identify critical information categories like urgent requests and needs. Additionally, we examine how various linguistic features affect model performance and highlight LLMs' vulnerabilities against certain features like typos. Lastly, we provide benchmarking results for all events across both zero- and few-shot settings and observe that proprietary models outperform open-source ones in all tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicolas Bougie, Narimasa Watanabe</p>
<p>Abstract: The peer review process is fundamental to scientific progress, determining which papers meet the quality standards for publication. Yet, the rapid growth of scholarly production and increasing specialization in knowledge areas strain traditional scientific feedback mechanisms. In light of this, we introduce Generative Agent Reviewers (GAR), leveraging LLM-empowered agents to simulate faithful peer reviewers. To enable generative reviewers, we design an architecture that extends a large language model with memory capabilities and equips agents with reviewer personas derived from historical data. Central to this approach is a graph-based representation of manuscripts, condensing content and logically organizing information - linking ideas with evidence and technical details. GAR's review process leverages external knowledge to evaluate paper novelty, followed by detailed assessment using the graph representation and multi-round assessment. Finally, a meta-reviewer aggregates individual reviews to predict the acceptance decision. Our experiments demonstrate that GAR performs comparably to human reviewers in providing detailed feedback and predicting paper outcomes. Beyond mere performance comparison, we conduct insightful experiments, such as evaluating the impact of reviewer expertise and examining fairness in reviews. By offering early expert-level feedback, typically restricted to a limited group of researchers, GAR democratizes access to transparent and in-depth evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyu Yang, Zheng Zhang, Saket Sathe</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models, such as ChatGPT, Claude, or LLaMA, are gigantic, monolithic, and possess the superpower to simultaneously support thousands of tasks. However, high-throughput applications often prefer smaller task-specific models because of their lower latency and cost. One challenge of using task-specific models is the incremental need for solving newer tasks after the model is already deployed for existing tasks. A straightforward solution requires fine-tuning the model again for both existing and new tasks, which is computationally expensive and time-consuming. To address this issue, we propose a model merging based approach called SUPERMERGE. SUPERMERGE is a gradient-based method to systematically merge several fine-tuned models trained on existing and new tasks. SUPERMERGE is designed to be lightweight and fast, and the merged model achieves similar performance to fully fine-tuned models on all tasks. Furthermore, we proposed a hierarchical model merging strategy to reduce the peak space requirement without sacrificing the performance of the merged model. We experimentally demonstrate that SUPERMERGE outperforms existing model merging methods on common natural language processing and computer vision tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdelrahman A. Ali, Aya E. Fouda, Radwa J. Hanafy, Mohammed E. Fouda</p>
<p>Abstract: Mental health disorders are increasingly prevalent worldwide, creating an urgent need for innovative tools to support early diagnosis and intervention. This study explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in multimodal mental health diagnostics, specifically for detecting depression and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder through text and audio modalities. Using the E-DAIC dataset, we compare text and audio modalities to investigate whether LLMs can perform equally well or better with audio inputs. We further examine the integration of both modalities to determine if this can enhance diagnostic accuracy, which generally results in improved performance metrics. Our analysis specifically utilizes custom-formulated metrics; Modal Superiority Score and Disagreement Resolvement Score to evaluate how combined modalities influence model performance. The Gemini 1.5 Pro model achieves the highest scores in binary depression classification when using the combined modality, with an F1 score of 0.67 and a Balanced Accuracy (BA) of 77.4%, assessed across the full dataset. These results represent an increase of 3.1% over its performance with the text modality and 2.7% over the audio modality, highlighting the effectiveness of integrating modalities to enhance diagnostic accuracy. Notably, all results are obtained in zero-shot inferring, highlighting the robustness of the models without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. To explore the impact of different configurations on model performance, we conduct binary, severity, and multiclass tasks using both zero-shot and few-shot prompts, examining the effects of prompt variations on performance. The results reveal that models such as Gemini 1.5 Pro in text and audio modalities, and GPT-4o mini in the text modality, often surpass other models in balanced accuracy and F1 scores across multiple tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nishanth Nakshatri, Shamik Roy, Rajarshi Das, Suthee Chaidaroon, Leonid Boytsov, Rashmi Gangadharaiah</p>
<p>Abstract: Constrained decoding with lookahead heuristics (CDLH) is a highly effective method for aligning LLM generations to human preferences. However, the extensive lookahead roll-out operations for each generated token makes CDLH prohibitively expensive, resulting in low adoption in practice. In contrast, common decoding strategies such as greedy decoding are extremely efficient, but achieve very low constraint satisfaction. We propose constrained decoding with speculative lookaheads (CDSL), a technique that significantly improves upon the inference efficiency of CDLH without experiencing the drastic performance reduction seen with greedy decoding. CDSL is motivated by the recently proposed idea of speculative decoding that uses a much smaller draft LLM for generation and a larger target LLM for verification. In CDSL, the draft model is used to generate lookaheads which is verified by a combination of target LLM and task-specific reward functions. This process accelerates decoding by reducing the computational burden while maintaining strong performance. We evaluate CDSL in two constraint decoding tasks with three LLM families and achieve 2.2x to 12.15x speedup over CDLH without significant performance reduction.</p>

<p>Abstract: We address the problem of personalized, interactive text-to-image (T2I) generation, designing a reinforcement learning (RL) agent which iteratively improves a set of generated images for a user through a sequence of prompt expansions. Using human raters, we create a novel dataset of sequential preferences, which we leverage, together with large-scale open-source (non-sequential) datasets. We construct user-preference and user-choice models using an EM strategy and identify varying user preference types. We then leverage a large multimodal language model (LMM) and a value-based RL approach to suggest a personalized and diverse slate of prompt expansions to the user. Our Personalized And Sequential Text-to-image Agent (PASTA) extends T2I models with personalized multi-turn capabilities, fostering collaborative co-creation and addressing uncertainty or underspecification in a user's intent. We evaluate PASTA using human raters, showing significant improvement compared to baseline methods. We also release our sequential rater dataset and simulated user-rater interactions to support future research in personalized, multi-turn T2I generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Meihao Fan, Ju Fan, Nan Tang, Lei Cao, Xiaoyong Du</p>
<p>Abstract: Answering natural language (NL) questions about tables, which is referred to as Tabular Question Answering (TQA), is important because it enables users to extract meaningful insights quickly and efficiently from structured data, bridging the gap between human language and machine-readable formats. Many of these tables originate from web sources or real-world scenarios, necessitating careful data preparation (or data prep for short) to ensure accurate answers. However, unlike traditional data prep, question-aware data prep introduces new requirements, which include tasks such as column augmentation and filtering for given questions, and question-aware value normalization or conversion. Because each of the above tasks is unique, a single model (or agent) may not perform effectively across all scenarios. In this paper, we propose AUTOPREP, a large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent framework that leverages the strengths of multiple agents, each specialized in a certain type of data prep, ensuring more accurate and contextually relevant responses. Given an NL question over a table, AUTOPREP performs data prep through three key components. Planner: Determines a logical plan, outlining a sequence of high-level operations. Programmer: Translates this logical plan into a physical plan by generating the corresponding low-level code. Executor: Iteratively executes and debugs the generated code to ensure correct outcomes. To support this multi-agent framework, we design a novel chain-of-thought reasoning mechanism for high-level operation suggestion, and a tool-augmented method for low-level code generation. Extensive experiments on real-world TQA datasets demonstrate that AUTOPREP can significantly improve the SOTA TQA solutions through question-aware data prep.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaoqing Zhang, Zhuosheng Zhang, Kehai Chen, Rongxiang Weng, Muyun Yang, Tiejun Zhao, Min Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite being empowered with alignment mechanisms, large language models (LLMs) are increasingly vulnerable to emerging jailbreak attacks that can compromise their alignment mechanisms. This vulnerability poses significant risks to the real-world applications. Existing work faces challenges in both training efficiency and generalization capabilities (i.e., Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback and Red-Teaming). Developing effective strategies to enable LLMs to resist continuously evolving jailbreak attempts represents a significant challenge. To address this challenge, we propose a novel defensive paradigm called GuidelineLLM, which assists LLMs in recognizing queries that may have harmful content. Before LLMs respond to a query, GuidelineLLM first identifies potential risks associated with the query, summarizes these risks into guideline suggestions, and then feeds these guidelines to the responding LLMs. Importantly, our approach eliminates the necessity for additional safety fine-tuning of the LLMs themselves; only the GuidelineLLM requires fine-tuning. This characteristic enhances the general applicability of GuidelineLLM across various LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that GuidelineLLM can significantly reduce the attack success rate (ASR) against the LLMs (an average reduction of 34.17\% ASR) while maintaining the helpfulness of the LLMs in handling benign queries.

<p>Abstract: We introduce a novel evaluation paradigm for large language models (LLMs), LLM-as-an-Interviewer. This approach consists of a two stage process designed to assess the true capabilities of LLMs: first, modifying benchmark datasets to generate initial queries, and second, interacting with the LLM through feedback and follow up questions. Compared to existing evaluation methods such as LLM as a Judge, our framework addresses several limitations, including data contamination, verbosity bias, and self enhancement bias. Additionally, we show that our multi turn evaluation process provides valuable insights into the LLM's performance in real-world scenarios, including its adaptability to feedback and its ability to handle follow up questions, including clarification or requests for additional knowledge. Finally, we propose the Interview Report, which offers a comprehensive reflection of an LLM's strengths and weaknesses, illustrated with specific examples from the interview process. This report delivers a snapshot of the LLM's capabilities, providing a detailed picture of its practical performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rithvik Prakki</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to creating adaptive language agents by integrating active inference with large language models (LLMs). While LLMs demonstrate remarkable capabilities, their reliance on static prompts limits adaptation to new information and changing environments. We address this by implementing an active inference framework that acts as a cognitive layer above an LLM-based agent, dynamically adjusting prompts and search strategies through principled information-seeking behavior. Our framework models the environment using three state factors (prompt, search, and information states) with seven observation modalities capturing quality metrics. By framing the agent's learning through the free energy principle, we enable systematic exploration of prompt combinations and search strategies. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, with the agent developing accurate models of environment dynamics evidenced by emergent structure in observation matrices. Action selection patterns reveal sophisticated exploration-exploitation behavior, transitioning from initial information-gathering to targeted prompt testing. The integration of thermodynamic principles with language model capabilities provides a principled framework for creating robust, adaptable agents, extending active inference beyond traditional low-dimensional control problems to high-dimensional, language-driven environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuyang Cheng, Xingwei Qu, Tomas Goldsack, Chenghua Lin, Chung-Chi Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Thomas C. Schelling, awarded the 2005 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, pointed out that ``individuals decisions (micromotives), while often personal and localized, can lead to societal outcomes (macrobehavior) that are far more complex and different from what the individuals intended.'' The current research related to large language models' (LLMs') micromotives, such as preferences or biases, assumes that users will make more appropriate decisions once LLMs are devoid of preferences or biases. Consequently, a series of studies has focused on removing bias from LLMs. In the NLP community, while there are many discussions on LLMs' micromotives, previous studies have seldom conducted a systematic examination of how LLMs may influence society's macrobehavior. In this paper, we follow the design of Schelling's model of segregation to observe the relationship between the micromotives and macrobehavior of LLMs. Our results indicate that, regardless of the level of bias in LLMs, a highly segregated society will emerge as more people follow LLMs' suggestions. We hope our discussion will spark further consideration of the fundamental assumption regarding the mitigation of LLMs' micromotives and encourage a reevaluation of how LLMs may influence users and society.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the burgeoning field of AI-driven image generation, the quest for precision and relevance in response to textual prompts remains paramount. This paper introduces GPTDrawer, an innovative pipeline that leverages the generative prowess of GPT-based models to enhance the visual synthesis process. Our methodology employs a novel algorithm that iteratively refines input prompts using keyword extraction, semantic analysis, and image-text congruence evaluation. By integrating ChatGPT for natural language processing and Stable Diffusion for image generation, GPTDrawer produces a batch of images that undergo successive refinement cycles, guided by cosine similarity metrics until a threshold of semantic alignment is attained. The results demonstrate a marked improvement in the fidelity of images generated in accordance with user-defined prompts, showcasing the system's ability to interpret and visualize complex semantic constructs. The implications of this work extend to various applications, from creative arts to design automation, setting a new benchmark for AI-assisted creative processes.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized text generation, making detecting machine-generated text increasingly challenging. Although past methods have achieved good performance on detecting pure machine-generated text, those detectors have poor performance on distinguishing machine-revised text (rewriting, expansion, and polishing), which can have only minor changes from its original human prompt. As the content of text may originate from human prompts, detecting machine-revised text often involves identifying distinctive machine styles, e.g., worded favored by LLMs. However, existing methods struggle to detect machine-style phrasing hidden within the content contributed by humans. We propose the "Imitate Before Detect" (ImBD) approach, which first imitates the machine-style token distribution, and then compares the distribution of the text to be tested with the machine-style distribution to determine whether the text has been machine-revised. To this end, we introduce style preference optimization (SPO), which aligns a scoring LLM model to the preference of text styles generated by machines. The aligned scoring model is then used to calculate the style-conditional probability curvature (Style-CPC), quantifying the log probability difference between the original and conditionally sampled texts for effective detection. We conduct extensive comparisons across various scenarios, encompassing text revisions by six LLMs, four distinct text domains, and three machine revision types. Compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, our method yields a 13% increase in AUC for detecting text revised by open-source LLMs, and improves performance by 5% and 19% for detecting GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o revised text, respectively. Notably, our method surpasses the commercially trained GPT-Zero with just $1,000$ samples and five minutes of SPO, demonstrating its efficiency and effectiveness.</p>

<p>Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized many fields, not only traditional natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Recently, research on applying LLMs to the database field has been booming, and as a typical non-relational database, the use of LLMs in graph database research has naturally gained significant attention. Recent efforts have increasingly focused on leveraging LLMs to translate natural language into graph query language (NL2GQL). Although some progress has been made, these methods have clear limitations, such as their reliance on streamlined processes that often overlook the potential of LLMs to autonomously plan and collaborate with other LLMs in tackling complex NL2GQL challenges. To address this gap, we propose NAT-NL2GQL, a novel multi-agent framework for translating natural language to graph query language. Specifically, our framework consists of three synergistic agents: the Preprocessor agent, the Generator agent, and the Refiner agent. The Preprocessor agent manages data processing as context, including tasks such as name entity recognition, query rewriting, path linking, and the extraction of query-related schemas. The Generator agent is a fine-tuned LLM trained on NL-GQL data, responsible for generating corresponding GQL statements based on queries and their related schemas. The Refiner agent is tasked with refining the GQL or context using error information obtained from the GQL execution results. Given the scarcity of high-quality open-source NL2GQL datasets based on nGQL syntax, we developed StockGQL, a dataset constructed from a financial market graph database. It is available at: https://github.com/leonyuancode/StockGQL. Experimental results on the StockGQL and SpCQL datasets reveal that our method significantly outperforms baseline approaches, highlighting its potential for advancing NL2GQL research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Dong, Sen Jia, Hongyu Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, with the emergence of recent Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) technology, it has become possible to exploit its video understanding capability on different classification tasks. In practice, we face the difficulty of huge requirements for GPU resource if we need to deploy MLLMs online. In this paper, we propose COEF-VQ, a novel cascaded MLLM framework for better video quality understanding on TikTok. To this end, we first propose a MLLM fusing all visual, textual and audio signals, and then develop a cascade framework with a lightweight model as pre-filtering stage and MLLM as fine-consideration stage, significantly reducing the need for GPU resource, while retaining the performance demonstrated solely by MLLM. To demonstrate the effectiveness of COEF-VQ, we deployed this new framework onto the video management platform (VMP) at TikTok, and performed a series of detailed experiments on two in-house tasks related to video quality understanding. We show that COEF-VQ leads to substantial performance gains with limit resource consumption in these two tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maxime Noizet (UTC, Heudiasyc), Philippe Xu (ENSTA Paris), Philippe Bonnifait (UTC, Heudiasyc)</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting road features is a key enabler for autonomous driving and localization. For instance, a reliable detection of poles which are widespread in road environments can improve localization. Modern deep learning-based perception systems need a significant amount of annotated data. Automatic annotation avoids time-consuming and costly manual annotation. Because automatic methods are prone to errors, managing annotation uncertainty is crucial to ensure a proper learning process. Fusing multiple annotation sources on the same dataset can be an efficient way to reduce the errors. This not only improves the quality of annotations, but also improves the learning of perception models. In this paper, we consider the fusion of three automatic annotation methods in images: feature projection from a high accuracy vector map combined with a lidar, image segmentation and lidar segmentation. Our experimental results demonstrate the significant benefits of multi-modal automatic annotation for pole detection through a comparative evaluation on manually annotated images. Finally, the resulting multi-modal fusion is used to fine-tune an object detection model for pole base detection using unlabeled data, showing overall improvements achieved by enhancing network specialization. The dataset is publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiwei Hu, V\'ictor Guti\'errez-Basulto, Ru Li, Jeff Z. Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal entity linking (MEL) aims to link ambiguous mentions within multimodal contexts to corresponding entities in a multimodal knowledge base. Most existing approaches to MEL are based on representation learning or vision-and-language pre-training mechanisms for exploring the complementary effect among multiple modalities. However, these methods suffer from two limitations. On the one hand, they overlook the possibility of considering negative samples from the same modality. On the other hand, they lack mechanisms to capture bidirectional cross-modal interaction. To address these issues, we propose a Multi-level Matching network for Multimodal Entity Linking (M3EL). Specifically, M3EL is composed of three different modules: (i) a Multimodal Feature Extraction module, which extracts modality-specific representations with a multimodal encoder and introduces an intra-modal contrastive learning sub-module to obtain better discriminative embeddings based on uni-modal differences; (ii) an Intra-modal Matching Network module, which contains two levels of matching granularity: Coarse-grained Global-to-Global and Fine-grained Global-to-Local, to achieve local and global level intra-modal interaction; (iii) a Cross-modal Matching Network module, which applies bidirectional strategies, Textual-to-Visual and Visual-to-Textual matching, to implement bidirectional cross-modal interaction. Extensive experiments conducted on WikiMEL, RichpediaMEL, and WikiDiverse datasets demonstrate the outstanding performance of M3EL when compared to the state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Quoc-Bao Nguyen-Le, Tuan-Hy Le, Anh-Triet Do</p>
<p>Abstract: In the burgeoning field of medical imaging, precise computation of 3D volume holds a significant importance for subsequent qualitative analysis of 3D reconstructed objects. Combining multivariate calculus, marching cube algorithm, and binary indexed tree data structure, we developed an algorithm for efficient computation of intrinsic volume of any volumetric data recovered from computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR). We proposed the 30 configurations of volume values based on the polygonal mesh generation method. Our algorithm processes the data in scan-line order simultaneously with reconstruction algorithm to create a Fenwick tree, ensuring query time much faster and assisting users' edition of slicing or transforming model. We tested the algorithm's accuracy on simple 3D objects (e.g., sphere, cylinder) to complicated structures (e.g., lungs, cardiac chambers). The result deviated within $\pm 0.004 \text{cm}^3$ and there is still room for further improvement.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhentao Tan, Ben Xue, Jian Jia, Junhao Wang, Wencai Ye, Shaoyun Shi, Mingjie Sun, Wenjin Wu, Quan Chen, Peng Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents the \textbf{S}emantic-a\textbf{W}ar\textbf{E} spatial-t\textbf{E}mporal \textbf{T}okenizer (SweetTokenizer), a compact yet effective discretization approach for vision data. Our goal is to boost tokenizers' compression ratio while maintaining reconstruction fidelity in the VQ-VAE paradigm. Firstly, to obtain compact latent representations, we decouple images or videos into spatial-temporal dimensions, translating visual information into learnable querying spatial and temporal tokens through a \textbf{C}ross-attention \textbf{Q}uery \textbf{A}uto\textbf{E}ncoder (CQAE). Secondly, to complement visual information during compression, we quantize these tokens via a specialized codebook derived from off-the-shelf LLM embeddings to leverage the rich semantics from language modality. Finally, to enhance training stability and convergence, we also introduce a curriculum learning strategy, which proves critical for effective discrete visual representation learning. SweetTokenizer achieves comparable video reconstruction fidelity with only \textbf{25\%} of the tokens used in previous state-of-the-art video tokenizers, and boost video generation results by \textbf{32.9\%} w.r.t gFVD. When using the same token number, we significantly improves video and image reconstruction results by \textbf{57.1\%} w.r.t rFVD on UCF-101 and \textbf{37.2\%} w.r.t rFID on ImageNet-1K. Additionally, the compressed tokens are imbued with semantic information, enabling few-shot recognition capabilities powered by LLMs in downstream applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bruno Bianchi, Aakash Agrawal, Stanislas Dehaene, Emmanuel Chemla, Yair Lakretz</p>
<p>Abstract: Human readers can accurately count how many letters are in a word (e.g., 7 in ``buffalo''), remove a letter from a given position (e.g., ``bufflo'') or add a new one. The human brain of readers must have therefore learned to disentangle information related to the position of a letter and its identity. Such disentanglement is necessary for the compositional, unbounded, ability of humans to create and parse new strings, with any combination of letters appearing in any positions. Do modern deep neural models also possess this crucial compositional ability? Here, we tested whether neural models that achieve state-of-the-art on disentanglement of features in visual input can also disentangle letter position and letter identity when trained on images of written words. Specifically, we trained beta variational autoencoder ($\beta$-VAE) to reconstruct images of letter strings and evaluated their disentanglement performance using CompOrth - a new benchmark that we created for studying compositional learning and zero-shot generalization in visual models for orthography. The benchmark suggests a set of tests, of increasing complexity, to evaluate the degree of disentanglement between orthographic features of written words in deep neural models. Using CompOrth, we conducted a set of experiments to analyze the generalization ability of these models, in particular, to unseen word length and to unseen combinations of letter identities and letter positions. We found that while models effectively disentangle surface features, such as horizontal and vertical `retinal' locations of words within an image, they dramatically fail to disentangle letter position and letter identity and lack any notion of word length. Together, this study demonstrates the shortcomings of state-of-the-art $\beta$-VAE models compared to humans and proposes a new challenge and a corresponding benchmark to evaluate neural models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Exploiting the promise of recent advances in imitation learning for mobile manipulation will require the collection of large numbers of human-guided demonstrations. This paper proposes an open-source design for an inexpensive, robust, and flexible mobile manipulator that can support arbitrary arms, enabling a wide range of real-world household mobile manipulation tasks. Crucially, our design uses powered casters to enable the mobile base to be fully holonomic, able to control all planar degrees of freedom independently and simultaneously. This feature makes the base more maneuverable and simplifies many mobile manipulation tasks, eliminating the kinematic constraints that create complex and time-consuming motions in nonholonomic bases. We equip our robot with an intuitive mobile phone teleoperation interface to enable easy data acquisition for imitation learning. In our experiments, we use this interface to collect data and show that the resulting learned policies can successfully perform a variety of common household mobile manipulation tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sai Qian Zhang, Ziyun Li, Chuan Guo, Saeed Mahloujifar, Deeksha Dangwal, Edward Suh, Barbara De Salvo, Chiao Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Inverting visual representations within deep neural networks (DNNs) presents a challenging and important problem in the field of security and privacy for deep learning. The main goal is to invert the features of an unidentified target image generated by a pre-trained DNN, aiming to reconstruct the original image. Feature inversion holds particular significance in understanding the privacy leakage inherent in contemporary split DNN execution techniques, as well as in various applications based on the extracted DNN features.
  In this paper, we explore the use of diffusion models, a promising technique for image synthesis, to enhance feature inversion quality. We also investigate the potential of incorporating alternative forms of prior knowledge, such as textual prompts and cross-frame temporal correlations, to further improve the quality of inverted features. Our findings reveal that diffusion models can effectively leverage hidden information from the DNN features, resulting in superior reconstruction performance compared to previous methods. This research offers valuable insights into how diffusion models can enhance privacy and security within applications that are reliant on DNN features.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate and timely regional weather prediction is vital for sectors dependent on weather-related decisions. Traditional prediction methods, based on atmospheric equations, often struggle with coarse temporal resolutions and inaccuracies. This paper presents a novel machine learning (ML) model, called MiMa (short for Micro-Macro), that integrates both near-surface observational data from Kentucky Mesonet stations (collected every five minutes, known as Micro data) and hourly atmospheric numerical outputs (termed as Macro data) for fine-resolution weather forecasting. The MiMa model employs an encoder-decoder transformer structure, with two encoders for processing multivariate data from both datasets and a decoder for forecasting weather variables over short time horizons. Each instance of the MiMa model, called a modelet, predicts the values of a specific weather parameter at an individual Mesonet station. The approach is extended with Re-MiMa modelets, which are designed to predict weather variables at ungauged locations by training on multivariate data from a few representative stations in a region, tagged with their elevations. Re-MiMa (short for Regional-MiMa) can provide highly accurate predictions across an entire region, even in areas without observational stations. Experimental results show that MiMa significantly outperforms current models, with Re-MiMa offering precise short-term forecasts for ungauged locations, marking a significant advancement in weather forecasting accuracy and applicability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mayuri Mathur, Anav Chaudhary, Saurabh Kumar Gupta, Ojaswa Sharma</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical image colorization can greatly enhance the interpretability of the underlying imaging modality and provide insights into human anatomy. The objective of medical image colorization is to transfer a diverse spectrum of colors distributed across human anatomy from Cryosection data to source MRI data while retaining the structures of the MRI. To achieve this, we propose a novel architecture for structurally consistent color transfer to the source MRI data. Our architecture fuses segmentation semantics of Cryosection images for stable contextual colorization of various organs in MRI images. For colorization, we neither require precise registration between MRI and Cryosection images, nor segmentation of MRI images. Additionally, our architecture incorporates a feature compression-and-activation mechanism to capture organ-level global information and suppress noise, enabling the distinction of organ-specific data in MRI scans for more accurate and realistic organ-specific colorization. Our experiments demonstrate that our architecture surpasses the existing methods and yields better quantitative and qualitative results.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reliable prediction of pediatric obesity can offer a valuable resource to providers, helping them engage in timely preventive interventions before the disease is established. Many efforts have been made to develop ML-based predictive models of obesity, and some studies have reported high predictive performances. However, no commonly used clinical decision support tool based on existing ML models currently exists. This study presents a novel end-to-end pipeline specifically designed for pediatric obesity prediction, which supports the entire process of data extraction, inference, and communication via an API or a user interface. While focusing only on routinely recorded data in pediatric electronic health records (EHRs), our pipeline uses a diverse expert-curated list of medical concepts to predict the 1-3 years risk of developing obesity. Furthermore, by using the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard in our design procedure, we specifically target facilitating low-effort integration of our pipeline with different EHR systems. In our experiments, we report the effectiveness of the predictive model as well as its alignment with the feedback from various stakeholders, including ML scientists, providers, health IT personnel, health administration representatives, and patient group representatives.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shihao Xu, Yiyang Luo, Wei Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Geometry mathematics problems pose significant challenges for large language models (LLMs) because they involve visual elements and spatial reasoning. Current methods primarily rely on symbolic character awareness to address these problems. Considering geometry problem solving is a relatively nascent field with limited suitable datasets and currently almost no work on solid geometry problem solving, we collect a geometry question-answer dataset by sourcing geometric data from Chinese high school education websites, referred to as GeoMath. It contains solid geometry questions and answers with accurate reasoning steps as compensation for existing plane geometry datasets. Additionally, we propose a Large Multi-modal Model (LMM) framework named Geo-LLaVA, which incorporates retrieval augmentation with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) in the training stage, called meta-training, and employs in-context learning (ICL) during inference to improve performance. Our fine-tuned model with ICL attains the state-of-the-art performance of 65.25% and 42.36% on selected questions of the GeoQA dataset and GeoMath dataset respectively with proper inference steps. Notably, our model initially endows the ability to solve solid geometry problems and supports the generation of reasonable solid geometry picture descriptions and problem-solving steps. Our research sets the stage for further exploration of LLMs in multi-modal math problem-solving, particularly in geometry math problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenxuan Liu, Monde Duinkharjav, Qi Sun, Sai Qian Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Leveraging real-time eye-tracking, foveated rendering optimizes hardware efficiency and enhances visual quality virtual reality (VR). This approach leverages eye-tracking techniques to determine where the user is looking, allowing the system to render high-resolution graphics only in the foveal region-the small area of the retina where visual acuity is highest, while the peripheral view is rendered at lower resolution. However, modern deep learning-based gaze-tracking solutions often exhibit a long-tail distribution of tracking errors, which can degrade user experience and reduce the benefits of foveated rendering by causing misalignment and decreased visual quality.
  This paper introduces \textit{FovealNet}, an advanced AI-driven gaze tracking framework designed to optimize system performance by strategically enhancing gaze tracking accuracy. To further reduce the implementation cost of the gaze tracking algorithm, FovealNet employs an event-based cropping method that eliminates over $64.8\%$ of irrelevant pixels from the input image. Additionally, it incorporates a simple yet effective token-pruning strategy that dynamically removes tokens on the fly without compromising tracking accuracy. Finally, to support different runtime rendering configurations, we propose a system performance-aware multi-resolution training strategy, allowing the gaze tracking DNN to adapt and optimize overall system performance more effectively. Evaluation results demonstrate that FovealNet achieves at least $1.42\times$ speed up compared to previous methods and 13\% increase in perceptual quality for foveated output.</p>

<p>Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have demonstrated remarkable prowess in the field of computer vision. However, their opaque decision-making processes pose significant challenges for practical applications. In this study, we provide quantitative metrics for assessing CNN filters by clustering the feature maps corresponding to individual filters in the model via Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). By analyzing the clustering results, we screen out some anomaly filters associated with outlier samples. We further analyze the relationship between the anomaly filters and model overfitting, proposing three hypotheses. This method is universally applicable across diverse CNN architectures without modifications, as evidenced by its successful application to models like AlexNet and LeNet-5. We present three meticulously designed experiments demonstrating our hypotheses from the perspectives of model behavior, dataset characteristics, and filter impacts. Through this work, we offer a novel perspective for evaluating the CNN performance and gain new insights into the operational behavior of model overfitting.</p>

<p>Abstract: Numerous studies have focused on learning and understanding the dynamics of physical systems from video data, such as spatial intelligence. Artificial intelligence requires quantitative assessments of the uncertainty of the model to ensure reliability. However, there is still a relative lack of systematic assessment of the uncertainties, particularly the uncertainties of the physical data. Our motivation is to introduce conformal prediction into the uncertainty assessment of dynamical systems, providing a method supported by theoretical guarantees. This paper uses the conformal prediction method to assess uncertainties with benchmark operator learning methods. We have also compared the Monte Carlo Dropout and Ensemble methods in the partial differential equations dataset, effectively evaluating uncertainty through straight roll-outs, making it ideal for time-series tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sheng Wu, Xiaobao Wang, Longbiao Wang, Dongxiao He, Jianwu Dang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) stands as a critical research frontier, seeking to comprehensively unravel human emotions by amalgamating text, audio, and visual data. Yet, discerning subtle emotional nuances within audio and video expressions poses a formidable challenge, particularly when emotional polarities across various segments appear similar. In this paper, our objective is to spotlight emotion-relevant attributes of audio and visual modalities to facilitate multimodal fusion in the context of nuanced emotional shifts in visual-audio scenarios. To this end, we introduce DEVA, a progressive fusion framework founded on textual sentiment descriptions aimed at accentuating emotional features of visual-audio content. DEVA employs an Emotional Description Generator (EDG) to transmute raw audio and visual data into textualized sentiment descriptions, thereby amplifying their emotional characteristics. These descriptions are then integrated with the source data to yield richer, enhanced features. Furthermore, DEVA incorporates the Text-guided Progressive Fusion Module (TPF), leveraging varying levels of text as a core modality guide. This module progressively fuses visual-audio minor modalities to alleviate disparities between text and visual-audio modalities. Experimental results on widely used sentiment analysis benchmark datasets, including MOSI, MOSEI, and CH-SIMS, underscore significant enhancements compared to state-of-the-art models. Moreover, fine-grained emotion experiments corroborate the robust sensitivity of DEVA to subtle emotional variations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenbin Pei, Ruohao Dai, Bing Xue, Mengjie Zhang, Qiang Zhang, Yiu-Ming Cheung, Shuyin Xia</p>
<p>Abstract: Class imbalance would lead to biased classifiers that favor the majority class and disadvantage the minority class. Unfortunately, from a practical perspective, the minority class is of importance in many real-life applications. Hybrid sampling methods address this by oversampling the minority class to increase the number of its instances, followed by undersampling to remove low-quality instances. However, most existing sampling methods face difficulties in generating diverse high-quality instances and often fail to remove noise or low-quality instances on a larger scale effectively. This paper therefore proposes an evolutionary multi-granularity hybrid sampling method, called EvoSampling. During the oversampling process, genetic programming (GP) is used with multi-task learning to effectively and efficiently generate diverse high-quality instances. During the undersampling process, we develop a granular ball-based undersampling method that removes noise in a multi-granular fashion, thereby enhancing data quality. Experiments on 20 imbalanced datasets demonstrate that EvoSampling effectively enhances the performance of various classification algorithms by providing better datasets than existing sampling methods. Besides, ablation studies further indicate that allowing knowledge transfer accelerates the GP's evolutionary learning process.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the current era of rapidly growing digital data, evaluating the political bias and factuality of news outlets has become more important for seeking reliable information online. In this work, we study the classification problem of profiling news media from the lens of political bias and factuality. Traditional profiling methods, such as Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promising results, but they face notable challenges. PLMs focus solely on textual features, causing them to overlook the complex relationships between entities, while GNNs often struggle with media graphs containing disconnected components and insufficient labels. To address these limitations, we propose MediaGraphMind (MGM), an effective solution within a variational Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework. Instead of relying on limited neighboring nodes, MGM leverages features, structural patterns, and label information from globally similar nodes. Such a framework not only enables GNNs to capture long-range dependencies for learning expressive node representations but also enhances PLMs by integrating structural information and therefore improving the performance of both models. The extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and achieve new state-of-the-art results. Further, we share our repository1 which contains the dataset, code, and documentation</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyuan Yang, Delin Chen, Xueyang Yu, Maohao Shen, Chuang Gan</p>
<p>Abstract: Long video understanding poses unique challenges due to their temporal complexity and low information density. Recent works address this task by sampling numerous frames or incorporating auxiliary tools using LLMs, both of which result in high computational costs. In this work, we introduce a curiosity-driven video agent with self-exploration capability, dubbed as VCA. Built upon VLMs, VCA autonomously navigates video segments and efficiently builds a comprehensive understanding of complex video sequences. Instead of directly sampling frames, VCA employs a tree-search structure to explore video segments and collect frames. Rather than relying on external feedback or reward, VCA leverages VLM's self-generated intrinsic reward to guide its exploration, enabling it to capture the most crucial information for reasoning. Experimental results on multiple long video benchmarks demonstrate our approach's superior effectiveness and efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amanda Rios, Ibrahima Ndiour, Parual Datta, Omesh Tickoo, Nilesh Ahuja</p>
<p>Abstract: In the field of continual learning, relying on so-called oracles for novelty detection is commonplace albeit unrealistic. This paper introduces CONCLAD ("COntinuous Novel CLAss Detector"), a comprehensive solution to the under-explored problem of continual novel class detection in post-deployment data. At each new task, our approach employs an iterative uncertainty estimation algorithm to differentiate between known and novel class(es) samples, and to further discriminate between the different novel classes themselves. Samples predicted to be from a novel class with high-confidence are automatically pseudo-labeled and used to update our model. Simultaneously, a tiny supervision budget is used to iteratively query ambiguous novel class predictions, which are also used during update. Evaluation across multiple datasets, ablations and experimental settings demonstrate our method's effectiveness at separating novel and old class samples continuously. We will release our code upon acceptance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Angel Yanguas-Gil, Matthew T. Dearing, Jeffrey W. Elam, Jessica C. Jones, Sungjoon Kim, Adnan Mohammad, Chi Thang Nguyen, Bratin Sengupta</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work we introduce an open-ended question benchmark, ALDbench, to evaluate the performance of large language models (LLMs) in materials synthesis, and in particular in the field of atomic layer deposition, a thin film growth technique used in energy applications and microelectronics. Our benchmark comprises questions with a level of difficulty ranging from graduate level to domain expert current with the state of the art in the field. Human experts reviewed the questions along the criteria of difficulty and specificity, and the model responses along four different criteria: overall quality, specificity, relevance, and accuracy. We ran this benchmark on an instance of OpenAI's GPT-4o. The responses from the model received a composite quality score of 3.7 on a 1 to 5 scale, consistent with a passing grade. However, 36% of the questions received at least one below average score. An in-depth analysis of the responses identified at least five instances of suspected hallucination. Finally, we observed statistically significant correlations between the difficulty of the question and the quality of the response, the difficulty of the question and the relevance of the response, and the specificity of the question and the accuracy of the response as graded by the human experts. This emphasizes the need to evaluate LLMs across multiple criteria beyond difficulty or accuracy.</p>

This study presents a first step towards quantitatively and systematically describing the musical properties of tipping points. Timing information and computationally-derived tonal tension values which correspond to dissonance, distance from key, and harmonic motion are compared to tipping points in Ashkenazy's recordings of six Chopin Mazurkas, as identified by 35 listeners. The analysis shows that all popular tipping points but one could be explained by statistically significant timing deviations or changepoints in at least one of the three tension parameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenfeng Zhuang, Min Cen, Yanfeng Li, Fangyu Zhou, Lequan Yu, Baptiste Magnier, Liansheng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Significant disparities between the features of natural images and those inherent to histopathological images make it challenging to directly apply and transfer pre-trained models from natural images to histopathology tasks. Moreover, the frequent lack of annotations in histopathology patch images has driven researchers to explore self-supervised learning methods like mask reconstruction for learning representations from large amounts of unlabeled data. Crucially, previous mask-based efforts in self-supervised learning have often overlooked the spatial interactions among entities, which are essential for constructing accurate representations of pathological entities. To address these challenges, constructing graphs of entities is a promising approach. In addition, the diffusion reconstruction strategy has recently shown superior performance through its random intensity noise addition technique to enhance the robust learned representation. Therefore, we introduce H-MGDM, a novel self-supervised Histopathology image representation learning method through the Dynamic Entity-Masked Graph Diffusion Model. Specifically, we propose to use complementary subgraphs as latent diffusion conditions and self-supervised targets respectively during pre-training. We note that the graph can embed entities' topological relationships and enhance representation. Dynamic conditions and targets can improve pathological fine reconstruction. Our model has conducted pretraining experiments on three large histopathological datasets. The advanced predictive performance and interpretability of H-MGDM are clearly evaluated on comprehensive downstream tasks such as classification and survival analysis on six datasets. Our code will be publicly available at https://github.com/centurion-crawler/H-MGDM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruibang Liu, Guoqiang Li, Minyu Chen, Ling-I Wu, Jingyu Ke</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated program verification has always been an important component of building trustworthy software. While the analysis of real-world programs remains a theoretical challenge, the automation of loop invariant analysis has effectively resolved the problem. However, real-world programs that often mix complex data structures and control flows pose challenges to traditional loop invariant generation tools. To enhance the applicability of invariant generation techniques, we proposed ACInv, an Automated Complex program loop Invariant generation tool, which combines static analysis with Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate the proper loop invariants. We utilize static analysis to extract the necessary information for each loop and embed it into prompts for the LLM to generate invariants for each loop. Subsequently, we employ an LLM-based evaluator to assess the generated invariants, refining them by either strengthening, weakening, or rejecting them based on their correctness, ultimately obtaining enhanced invariants. We conducted experiments on ACInv, which showed that ACInv outperformed previous tools on data sets with data structures, and maintained similar performance to the state-of-the-art tool AutoSpec on numerical programs without data structures. For the total data set, ACInv can solve 21% more examples than AutoSpec and can generate reference data structure templates.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zehao Chen, Rong Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) are essential XML-based formats for versatile graphics, offering resolution independence and scalability. Unlike raster images, SVGs use geometric shapes and support interactivity, animation, and manipulation via CSS and JavaScript. Current SVG generation methods face challenges related to high computational costs and complexity. In contrast, human designers use component-based tools for efficient SVG creation. Inspired by this, SVGBuilder introduces a component-based, autoregressive model for generating high-quality colored SVGs from textual input. It significantly reduces computational overhead and improves efficiency compared to traditional methods. Our model generates SVGs up to 604 times faster than optimization-based approaches. To address the limitations of existing SVG datasets and support our research, we introduce ColorSVG-100K, the first large-scale dataset of colored SVGs, comprising 100,000 graphics. This dataset fills the gap in color information for SVG generation models and enhances diversity in model training. Evaluation against state-of-the-art models demonstrates SVGBuilder's superior performance in practical applications, highlighting its efficiency and quality in generating complex SVG graphics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaifan Zhang, Lihuo He, Xin Jiang, Wen Lu, Di Wang, Xinbo Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals have attracted significant attention from researchers due to their non-invasive nature and high temporal sensitivity in decoding visual stimuli. However, most recent studies have focused solely on the relationship between EEG and image data pairs, neglecting the valuable ``beyond-image-modality" information embedded in EEG signals. This results in the loss of critical multimodal information in EEG. To address this limitation, we propose CognitionCapturer, a unified framework that fully leverages multimodal data to represent EEG signals. Specifically, CognitionCapturer trains Modality Expert Encoders for each modality to extract cross-modal information from the EEG modality. Then, it introduces a diffusion prior to map the EEG embedding space to the CLIP embedding space, followed by using a pretrained generative model, the proposed framework can reconstruct visual stimuli with high semantic and structural fidelity. Notably, the framework does not require any fine-tuning of the generative models and can be extended to incorporate more modalities. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that CognitionCapturer outperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Runtao Liu, Chen I Chieh, Jindong Gu, Jipeng Zhang, Renjie Pi, Qifeng Chen, Philip Torr, Ashkan Khakzar, Fabio Pizzati</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have become widespread, but their limited safety guardrails expose end users to harmful content and potentially allow for model misuse. Current safety measures are typically limited to text-based filtering or concept removal strategies, able to remove just a few concepts from the model's generative capabilities. In this work, we introduce SafetyDPO, a method for safety alignment of T2I models through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). We enable the application of DPO for safety purposes in T2I models by synthetically generating a dataset of harmful and safe image-text pairs, which we call CoProV2. Using a custom DPO strategy and this dataset, we train safety experts, in the form of low-rank adaptation (LoRA) matrices, able to guide the generation process away from specific safety-related concepts. Then, we merge the experts into a single LoRA using a novel merging strategy for optimal scaling performance. This expert-based approach enables scalability, allowing us to remove 7 times more harmful concepts from T2I models compared to baselines. SafetyDPO consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art on many benchmarks and establishes new practices for safety alignment in T2I networks.

<p>Abstract: We have witnessed the unprecedented success of diffusion-based video generation over the past year. Recently proposed models from the community have wielded the power to generate cinematic and high-resolution videos with smooth motions from arbitrary input prompts. However, as a supertask of image generation, video generation models require more computation and are thus hosted mostly on cloud servers, limiting broader adoption among content creators. In this work, we propose a comprehensive acceleration framework to bring the power of the large-scale video diffusion model to the hands of edge users. From the network architecture scope, we initialize from a compact image backbone and search out the design and arrangement of temporal layers to maximize hardware efficiency. In addition, we propose a dedicated adversarial fine-tuning algorithm for our efficient model and reduce the denoising steps to 4. Our model, with only 0.6B parameters, can generate a 5-second video on an iPhone 16 PM within 5 seconds. Compared to server-side models that take minutes on powerful GPUs to generate a single video, we accelerate the generation by magnitudes while delivering on-par quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> April Yang, Jordan Tab, Parth Shah, Paul Kotchavong</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing reliance on large language models (LLMs) for diverse applications necessitates a thorough understanding of their robustness to adversarial perturbations and out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. In this study, we investigate the correlation between adversarial robustness and OOD robustness in LLMs, addressing a critical gap in robustness evaluation. By applying methods originally designed to improve one robustness type across both contexts, we analyze their performance on adversarial and out-of-distribution benchmark datasets. The input of the model consists of text samples, with the output prediction evaluated in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores in various natural language inference tasks.
  Our findings highlight nuanced interactions between adversarial robustness and OOD robustness, with results indicating limited transferability between the two robustness types. Through targeted ablations, we evaluate how these correlations evolve with different model sizes and architectures, uncovering model-specific trends: smaller models like LLaMA2-7b exhibit neutral correlations, larger models like LLaMA2-13b show negative correlations, and Mixtral demonstrates positive correlations, potentially due to domain-specific alignment. These results underscore the importance of hybrid robustness frameworks that integrate adversarial and OOD strategies tailored to specific models and domains. Further research is needed to evaluate these interactions across larger models and varied architectures, offering a pathway to more reliable and generalizable LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmed Mohamed Hussain, Nada Abughanam, Panos Papadimitratos</p>
<p>Abstract: The deployment of the Internet of Things (IoT) in smart cities and critical infrastructure has enhanced connectivity and real-time data exchange but introduced significant security challenges. While effective, cryptography can often be resource-intensive for small-footprint resource-constrained (i.e., IoT) devices. Radio Frequency Fingerprinting (RFF) offers a promising authentication alternative by using unique RF signal characteristics for device identification at the Physical (PHY)-layer, without resorting to cryptographic solutions. The challenge is two-fold: how to deploy such RFF in a large scale and for resource-constrained environments. Edge computing, processing data closer to its source, i.e., the wireless device, enables faster decision-making, reducing reliance on centralized cloud servers. Considering a modest edge device, we introduce two truly lightweight Edge AI-based RFF schemes tailored for resource-constrained devices. We implement two Deep Learning models, namely a Convolution Neural Network and a Transformer-Encoder, to extract complex features from the IQ samples, forming device-specific RF fingerprints. We convert the models to TensorFlow Lite and evaluate them on a Raspberry Pi, demonstrating the practicality of Edge deployment. Evaluations demonstrate the Transformer-Encoder outperforms the CNN in identifying unique transmitter features, achieving high accuracy (> 0.95) and ROC-AUC scores (> 0.90) while maintaining a compact model size of 73KB, appropriate for resource-constrained devices.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models must balance their weight-encoded knowledge with in-context information from prompts to generate accurate responses. This paper investigates this interplay by analyzing how models of varying capacities within the same family handle intentionally misleading in-context information. Our experiments demonstrate that larger models exhibit higher resilience to deceptive prompts, showcasing an advanced ability to interpret and integrate prompt information with their internal knowledge. Furthermore, we find that larger models outperform smaller ones in following legitimate instructions, indicating that their resilience is not due to disregarding in-context information. We also show that this phenomenon is likely not a result of memorization but stems from the models' ability to better leverage implicit task-relevant information from the prompt alongside their internally stored knowledge.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dong Hoon Lee, Seunghoon Hong</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent token reduction methods for Vision Transformers (ViTs) incorporate token merging, which measures the similarities between token embeddings and combines the most similar pairs. However, their merging policies are directly dependent on intermediate features in ViTs, which prevents exploiting features tailored for merging and requires end-to-end training to improve token merging. In this paper, we propose Decoupled Token Embedding for Merging (DTEM) that enhances token merging through a decoupled embedding learned via a continuously relaxed token merging process. Our method introduces a lightweight embedding module decoupled from the ViT forward pass to extract dedicated features for token merging, thereby addressing the restriction from using intermediate features. The continuously relaxed token merging, applied during training, enables us to learn the decoupled embeddings in a differentiable manner. Thanks to the decoupled structure, our method can be seamlessly integrated into existing ViT backbones and trained either modularly by learning only the decoupled embeddings or end-to-end by fine-tuning. We demonstrate the applicability of DTEM on various tasks, including classification, captioning, and segmentation, with consistent improvement in token merging. Especially in the ImageNet-1k classification, DTEM achieves a 37.2% reduction in FLOPs while maintaining a top-1 accuracy of 79.85% with DeiT-small.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Karina Halevy, Karly Hou, Charumathi Badrinath</p>
<p>Abstract: Data augmentation methods, especially SoTA interpolation-based methods such as Fair Mixup, have been widely shown to increase model fairness. However, this fairness is evaluated on metrics that do not capture model uncertainty and on datasets with only one, relatively large, minority group. As a remedy, multicalibration has been introduced to measure fairness while accommodating uncertainty and accounting for multiple minority groups. However, existing methods of improving multicalibration involve reducing initial training data to create a holdout set for post-processing, which is not ideal when minority training data is already sparse. This paper uses multicalibration to more rigorously examine data augmentation for classification fairness. We stress-test four versions of Fair Mixup on two structured data classification problems with up to 81 marginalized groups, evaluating multicalibration violations and balanced accuracy. We find that on nearly every experiment, Fair Mixup \textit{worsens} baseline performance and fairness, but the simple vanilla Mixup \textit{outperforms} both Fair Mixup and the baseline, especially when calibrating on small groups. \textit{Combining} vanilla Mixup with multicalibration post-processing, which enforces multicalibration through post-processing on a holdout set, further increases fairness.</p>

In this paper, we cover the use of Transformers in Robotics. We go through recent advances and trends in Transformer architectures and examine their integration into robotic perception, planning, and control for autonomous systems. Furthermore, we review past work and recent research on use of Transformers in Robotics as pre-trained foundation models and integration of Transformers with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for autonomous systems. We discuss how different Transformer variants are being adapted in robotics for reliable planning and perception, increasing human-robot interaction, long-horizon decision-making, and generalization.

However, the trust placed in clients makes federated learning vulnerable to backdoor attacks launched by malicious participants. While many defenses have been proposed, they often fail short when facing heterogeneous data distributions among participating clients. In this paper, we propose a novel defense mechanism for federated learning systems designed to mitigate backdoor attacks on the clients-side. Our approach leverages adversarial learning techniques and model patching to neutralize the impact of backdoor attacks. Through extensive experiments on the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets, we demonstrate that our defense effectively reduces backdoor accuracy, outperforming existing state-of-the-art defenses, such as LFighter, FLAME, and RoseAgg, in i.i.d. and non-i.i.d. scenarios, while maintaining competitive or superior accuracy on clean data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arash Hajisafi, Maria Despoina Siampou, Bita Azarijoo, Cyrus Shahabi</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurately modeling and analyzing time series data is crucial for downstream applications across various fields, including healthcare, finance, astronomy, and epidemiology. However, real-world time series often exhibit irregularities such as misaligned timestamps, missing entries, and variable sampling rates, complicating their analysis. Existing approaches often rely on imputation, which can introduce biases. A few approaches that directly model irregularity tend to focus exclusively on either capturing intra-series patterns or inter-series relationships, missing the benefits of integrating both. To this end, we present WaveGNN, a novel framework designed to directly (i.e., no imputation) embed irregularly sampled multivariate time series data for accurate predictions. WaveGNN utilizes a Transformer-based encoder to capture intra-series patterns by directly encoding the temporal dynamics of each time series. To capture inter-series relationships, WaveGNN uses a dynamic graph neural network model, where each node represents a sensor, and the edges capture the long- and short-term relationships between them. Our experimental results on real-world healthcare datasets demonstrate that WaveGNN consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, with an average relative improvement of 14.7% in F1-score when compared to the second-best baseline in cases with extreme sparsity. Our ablation studies reveal that both intra-series and inter-series modeling significantly contribute to this notable improvement.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10622">A recent evaluation on the performance of LLMs on radiation oncology physics using questions of randomly shuffled options</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Peilong Wang, Jason Holmes, Zhengliang Liu, Dequan Chen, Tianming Liu, Jiajian Shen, Wei Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Purpose: We present an updated study evaluating the performance of large language models (LLMs) in answering radiation oncology physics questions, focusing on the latest released models.
  Methods: A set of 100 multiple-choice radiation oncology physics questions, previously created by us, was used for this study. The answer options of the questions were randomly shuffled to create "new" exam sets. Five LLMs -- OpenAI o1-preview, GPT-4o, LLaMA 3.1 (405B), Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet -- with the versions released before September 30, 2024, were queried using these new exams. To evaluate their deductive reasoning abilities, the correct answer options in the questions were replaced with "None of the above." Then, the explain-first and step-by-step instruction prompt was used to test if it improved their reasoning abilities. The performance of the LLMs was compared to medical physicists in majority-vote scenarios.
  Results: All models demonstrated expert-level performance on these questions, with o1-preview even surpassing medical physicists in majority-vote scenarios. When substituting the correct answer options with "None of the above," all models exhibited a considerable decline in performance, suggesting room for improvement. The explain-first and step-by-step instruction prompt helped enhance the reasoning abilities of LLaMA 3.1 (405B), Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet models.
  Conclusion: These latest LLMs demonstrated expert-level performance in answering radiation oncology physics questions, exhibiting great potential for assisting in radiation oncology physics education.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Di Xu, Xin Miao, Hengjie Liu, Jessica E. Scholey, Wensha Yang, Mary Feng, Michael Ohliger, Hui Lin, Yi Lao, Yang Yang, Ke Sheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Abstract Purpose: High-quality 4D MRI requires an impractically long scanning time for dense k-space signal acquisition covering all respiratory phases. Accelerated sparse sampling followed by reconstruction enhancement is desired but often results in degraded image quality and long reconstruction time. We hereby propose the chained iterative reconstruction network (CIRNet) for efficient sparse-sampling reconstruction while maintaining clinically deployable quality. Methods: CIRNet adopts the denoising diffusion probabilistic framework to condition the image reconstruction through a stochastic iterative denoising process. During training, a forward Markovian diffusion process is designed to gradually add Gaussian noise to the densely sampled ground truth (GT), while CIRNet is optimized to iteratively reverse the Markovian process from the forward outputs. At the inference stage, CIRNet performs the reverse process solely to recover signals from noise, conditioned upon the undersampled input. CIRNet processed the 4D data (3D+t) as temporal slices (2D+t). The proposed framework is evaluated on a data cohort consisting of 48 patients (12332 temporal slices) who underwent free-breathing liver 4D MRI. 3-, 6-, 10-, 20- and 30-times acceleration were examined with a retrospective random undersampling scheme. Compressed sensing (CS) reconstruction with a spatiotemporal constraint and a recently proposed deep network, Re-Con-GAN, are selected as baselines. Results: CIRNet consistently achieved superior performance compared to CS and Re-Con-GAN. The inference time of CIRNet, CS, and Re-Con-GAN are 11s, 120s, and 0.15s. Conclusion: A novel framework, CIRNet, is presented. CIRNet maintains useable image quality for acceleration up to 30 times, significantly reducing the burden of 4DMRI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shengheng Liu, Zihuan Mao, Xingkang Li, Mengguan Pan, Peng Liu, Yongming Huang, Xiaohu You</p>
<p>Abstract: Pervasive and high-accuracy positioning has become increasingly important as a fundamental enabler for intelligent connected devices in mobile networks. Nevertheless, current wireless networks heavily rely on pure model-driven techniques to achieve positioning functionality, often succumbing to performance deterioration due to hardware impairments in practical scenarios. Here we reformulate the direction finding or angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation problem as an image recovery task of the spatial spectrum and propose a new model-driven deep neural network (MoD-DNN) framework. The proposed MoD-DNN scheme comprises three modules: a multi-task autoencoder-based beamformer, a coarray spectrum generation module, and a model-driven deep learning-based spatial spectrum reconstruction module. Our technique enables automatic calibration of angular-dependent phase error thereby enhancing the resilience of direction-finding precision against realistic system non-idealities. We validate the proposed scheme both using numerical simulations and field tests. The results show that the proposed MoD-DNN framework enables effective spectrum calibration and accurate AoA estimation. To the best of our knowledge, this study marks the first successful demonstration of hybrid data-and-model-driven direction finding utilizing readily available commodity 5G gNodeB.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christopher J. Tralie, Matt Amery, Benjamin Douglas, Ian Utz</p>
<p>Abstract: As generative techniques pervade the audio domain, there has been increasing interest in tracing back through these complicated models to understand how they draw on their training data to synthesize new examples, both to ensure that they use properly licensed data and also to elucidate their black box behavior. In this paper, we show that if imperceptible echoes are hidden in the training data, a wide variety of audio to audio architectures (differentiable digital signal processing (DDSP), Realtime Audio Variational autoEncoder (RAVE), and ``Dance Diffusion'') will reproduce these echoes in their outputs. Hiding a single echo is particularly robust across all architectures, but we also show promising results hiding longer time spread echo patterns for an increased information capacity. We conclude by showing that echoes make their way into fine tuned models, that they survive mixing/demixing, and that they survive pitch shift augmentation during training. Hence, this simple, classical idea in watermarking shows significant promise for tagging generative audio models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Changjin Kim, Tae Hyun Kim, Sungyong Baik</p>
<p>Abstract: Removing noise from images, a.k.a image denoising, can be a very challenging task since the type and amount of noise can greatly vary for each image due to many factors including a camera model and capturing environments. While there have been striking improvements in image denoising with the emergence of advanced deep learning architectures and real-world datasets, recent denoising networks struggle to maintain performance on images with noise that has not been seen during training. One typical approach to address the challenge would be to adapt a denoising network to new noise distribution. Instead, in this work, we shift our focus to adapting the input noise itself, rather than adapting a network. Thus, we keep a pretrained network frozen, and adapt an input noise to capture the fine-grained deviations. As such, we propose a new denoising algorithm, dubbed Learning-to-Adapt-Noise (LAN), where a learnable noise offset is directly added to a given noisy image to bring a given input noise closer towards the noise distribution a denoising network is trained to handle. Consequently, the proposed framework exhibits performance improvement on images with unseen noise, displaying the potential of the proposed research direction.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinzong Dong, Zhaohui Jiang, Dong Pan, Haoyang Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Confidence calibration of classification models is a technique to estimate the true posterior probability of the predicted class, which is critical for ensuring reliable decision-making in practical applications. Existing confidence calibration methods mostly use statistical techniques to estimate the calibration curve from data or fit a user-defined calibration function, but often overlook fully mining and utilizing the prior distribution behind the calibration curve. However, a well-informed prior distribution can provide valuable insights beyond the empirical data under the limited data or low-density regions of confidence scores. To fill this gap, this paper proposes a new method that integrates the prior distribution behind the calibration curve with empirical data to estimate a continuous calibration curve, which is realized by modeling the sampling process of calibration data as a binomial process and maximizing the likelihood function of the binomial process. We prove that the calibration curve estimating method is Lipschitz continuous with respect to data distribution and requires a sample size of $3/B$ of that required for histogram binning, where $B$ represents the number of bins. Also, a new calibration metric ($TCE_{bpm}$), which leverages the estimated calibration curve to estimate the true calibration error (TCE), is designed. $TCE_{bpm}$ is proven to be a consistent calibration measure. Furthermore, realistic calibration datasets can be generated by the binomial process modeling from a preset true calibration curve and confidence score distribution, which can serve as a benchmark to measure and compare the discrepancy between existing calibration metrics and the true calibration error. The effectiveness of our calibration method and metric are verified in real-world and simulated data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenghui Yu, Peiyi Li, Haoze Wu, Bingfeng Deng, Hongyu Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: Negative feedback signals are crucial to guardrail content recommendations and improve user experience. When these signals are effectively integrated into recommendation systems, they play a vital role in preventing the promotion of harmful or undesirable content, thereby contributing to a healthier online environment. However, the challenges associated with negative signals are noteworthy. Due to the limited visibility of options for users to express negative feedback, these signals are often sparse compared to positive signals. This imbalance can lead to a skewed understanding of user preferences, resulting in recommendations that prioritize short-term engagement over long-term satisfaction. Moreover, an over-reliance on positive signals can create a filter bubble, where users are continuously exposed to content that aligns with their immediate preferences but may not be beneficial in the long run. This scenario can ultimately lead to user attrition as audiences become disillusioned with the quality of the content provided. Additionally, existing user signals frequently fail to meet specific customized requirements, such as understanding the underlying reasons for a user's likes or dislikes regarding a video. This lack of granularity hinders our ability to tailor content recommendations effectively, as we cannot identify the particular attributes of content that resonate with individual users.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sukai Huang, Trevor Cohn, Nir Lipovetzky</p>
<p>Abstract: The capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to plan remains a topic of debate. Some critics argue that strategies to boost LLMs' reasoning skills are ineffective in planning tasks, while others report strong outcomes merely from training models on a planning corpus. This study reassesses recent strategies by developing an end-to-end LLM planner and employing diverse metrics for a thorough evaluation. We find that merely fine-tuning LLMs on a corpus of planning instances does not lead to robust planning skills, as indicated by poor performance on out-of-distribution test sets. At the same time, we find that various strategies, including Chain-of-Thought, do enhance the probability of a plan being executable. This indicates progress towards better plan quality, despite not directly enhancing the final validity rate. Among the strategies we evaluated, reinforcement learning with our novel `Longest Contiguous Common Subsequence' reward emerged as the most effective, contributing to both plan validity and executability. Overall, our research addresses key misconceptions in the LLM-planning literature; we validate incremental progress in plan executability, although plan validity remains a challenge. Hence, future strategies should focus on both these aspects, drawing insights from our findings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Training automatic summary fact verifiers often faces the challenge of a lack of human-labeled data. In this paper, we explore alternative way of leveraging Large Language Model (LLM) generated feedback to address the inherent limitation of using human-labeled data. We introduce FineSumFact, a large-scale dataset containing fine-grained factual feedback on summaries. We employ 10 distinct LLMs for diverse summary generation and Llama-3-70B-Instruct for feedback. We utilize this dataset to fine-tune the lightweight open-source model Llama-3-8B-Instruct, optimizing resource efficiency while maintaining high performance. Our experimental results reveal that the model trained on extensive LLM-generated datasets surpasses that trained on smaller human-annotated datasets when evaluated using human-generated test sets. Fine-tuning fact verification models with LLM feedback can be more effective and cost-efficient than using human feedback. The dataset is available at https://github.com/DISL-Lab/FineSumFact.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study explores fine-tuning multilingual ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) models, specifically OpenAI's Whisper-Tiny, to improve performance in Japanese. While multilingual models like Whisper offer versatility, they often lack precision in specific languages. Conversely, monolingual models like ReazonSpeech excel in language-specific tasks but are less adaptable. Using Japanese-specific datasets and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) along with end-to-end (E2E) training, we fine-tuned Whisper-Tiny to bridge this gap. Our results show that fine-tuning reduced Whisper-Tiny's Character Error Rate (CER) from 32.7 to 20.8 with LoRA and to 14.7 with end-to-end fine-tuning, surpassing Whisper-Base's CER of 20.2. However, challenges with domain-specific terms remain, highlighting the need for specialized datasets. These findings demonstrate that fine-tuning multilingual models can achieve strong language-specific performance while retaining their flexibility. This approach provides a scalable solution for improving ASR in resource-constrained environments and languages with complex writing systems like Japanese.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fengshuo Bai, Runze Liu, Yali Du, Ying Wen, Yaodong Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Evaluating deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents against targeted behavior attacks is critical for assessing their robustness. These attacks aim to manipulate the victim into specific behaviors that align with the attacker's objectives, often bypassing traditional reward-based defenses. Prior methods have primarily focused on reducing cumulative rewards; however, rewards are typically too generic to capture complex safety requirements effectively. As a result, focusing solely on reward reduction can lead to suboptimal attack strategies, particularly in safety-critical scenarios where more precise behavior manipulation is needed. To address these challenges, we propose RAT, a method designed for universal, targeted behavior attacks. RAT trains an intention policy that is explicitly aligned with human preferences, serving as a precise behavioral target for the adversary. Concurrently, an adversary manipulates the victim's policy to follow this target behavior. To enhance the effectiveness of these attacks, RAT dynamically adjusts the state occupancy measure within the replay buffer, allowing for more controlled and effective behavior manipulation. Our empirical results on robotic simulation tasks demonstrate that RAT outperforms existing adversarial attack algorithms in inducing specific behaviors. Additionally, RAT shows promise in improving agent robustness, leading to more resilient policies. We further validate RAT by guiding Decision Transformer agents to adopt behaviors aligned with human preferences in various MuJoCo tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse tasks.</p>

In this work, overfitting control (or generalization property) in machine learning is explained using analogies from physics and biology. For stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics, we show that the Eyring formula of kinetic theory allows to control overfitting in the algorithmic stability approach - when wide minima of the risk function with low free energy correspond to low overfitting. For the generative adversarial network (GAN) model, we establish an analogy between GAN and the predator-prey model in biology. An application of this analogy allows us to explain the selection of wide likelihood maxima and overfitting reduction for GANs.</p>

<p>Abstract: To break through the limitations of pre-training models on fixed categories, Open-Set Object Detection (OSOD) and Open-Set Segmentation (OSS) have attracted a surge of interest from researchers. Inspired by large language models, mainstream OSOD and OSS methods generally utilize text as a prompt, achieving remarkable performance. Following SAM paradigm, some researchers use visual prompts, such as points, boxes, and masks that cover detection or segmentation targets. Despite these two prompt paradigms exhibit excellent performance, they also reveal inherent limitations. On the one hand, it is difficult to accurately describe characteristics of specialized category using textual description. On the other hand, existing visual prompt paradigms heavily rely on multi-round human interaction, which hinders them being applied to fully automated pipeline. To address the above issues, we propose a novel prompt paradigm in OSOD and OSS, that is, \textbf{Image Prompt Paradigm}. This brand new prompt paradigm enables to detect or segment specialized categories without multi-round human intervention. To achieve this goal, the proposed image prompt paradigm uses just a few image instances as prompts, and we propose a novel framework named \textbf{MI Grounding} for this new paradigm. In this framework, high-quality image prompts are automatically encoded, selected and fused, achieving the single-stage and non-interactive inference. We conduct extensive experiments on public datasets, showing that MI Grounding achieves competitive performance on OSOD and OSS benchmarks compared to text prompt paradigm methods and visual prompt paradigm methods. Moreover, MI Grounding can greatly outperform existing method on our constructed specialized ADR50K dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has significantly advanced the development of Embodied Question Answering (EQA), enhancing agents' abilities in language understanding and reasoning within complex and realistic scenarios. However, EQA in real-world scenarios remains challenging, as human-posed questions often contain noise that can interfere with an agent's exploration and response, bringing challenges especially for language beginners and non-expert users. To address this, we introduce a NoisyEQA benchmark designed to evaluate an agent's ability to recognize and correct noisy questions. This benchmark introduces four common types of noise found in real-world applications: Latent Hallucination Noise, Memory Noise, Perception Noise, and Semantic Noise generated through an automated dataset creation framework. Additionally, we also propose a 'Self-Correction' prompting mechanism and a new evaluation metric to enhance and measure both noise detection capability and answer quality. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that current EQA agents often struggle to detect noise in questions, leading to responses that frequently contain erroneous information. Through our Self-Correct Prompting mechanism, we can effectively improve the accuracy of agent answers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Yang, Wenjuan Xi, Luping Zhou, Jinhui Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language retrieval aims to search for similar instances in one modality based on queries from another modality. The primary objective is to learn cross-modal matching representations in a latent common space. Actually, the assumption underlying cross-modal matching is modal balance, where each modality contains sufficient information to represent the others. However, noise interference and modality insufficiency often lead to modal imbalance, making it a common phenomenon in practice. The impact of imbalance on retrieval performance remains an open question. In this paper, we first demonstrate that ultimate cross-modal matching is generally sub-optimal for cross-modal retrieval when imbalanced modalities exist. The structure of instances in the common space is inherently influenced when facing imbalanced modalities, posing a challenge to cross-modal similarity measurement. To address this issue, we emphasize the importance of meaningful structure-preserved matching. Accordingly, we propose a simple yet effective method to rebalance cross-modal matching by learning structure-preserved matching representations. Specifically, we design a novel multi-granularity cross-modal matching that incorporates structure-aware distillation alongside the cross-modal matching loss. While the cross-modal matching loss constraints instance-level matching, the structure-aware distillation further regularizes the geometric consistency between learned matching representations and intra-modal representations through the developed relational matching. Extensive experiments on different datasets affirm the superior cross-modal retrieval performance of our approach, simultaneously enhancing single-modal retrieval capabilities compared to the baseline models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yucong Meng, Zhiwei Yang, Yonghong Shi, Zhijian Song</p>
<p>Abstract: The accelerated MRI reconstruction process presents a challenging ill-posed inverse problem due to the extensive under-sampling in k-space. Recently, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have become the mainstream for this task, demonstrating substantial performance improvements. However, there are still three significant issues remain unaddressed: (1) ViTs struggle to capture high-frequency components of images, limiting their ability to detect local textures and edge information, thereby impeding MRI restoration; (2) Previous methods calculate multi-head self-attention (MSA) among both related and unrelated tokens in content, introducing noise and significantly increasing computational burden; (3) The naive feed-forward network in ViTs cannot model the multi-scale information that is important for image restoration. In this paper, we propose FPS-Former, a powerful ViT-based framework, to address these issues from the perspectives of frequency modulation, spatial purification, and scale diversification. Specifically, for issue (1), we introduce a frequency modulation attention module to enhance the self-attention map by adaptively re-calibrating the frequency information in a Laplacian pyramid. For issue (2), we customize a spatial purification attention module to capture interactions among closely related tokens, thereby reducing redundant or irrelevant feature representations. For issue (3), we propose an efficient feed-forward network based on a hybrid-scale fusion strategy. Comprehensive experiments conducted on three public datasets show that our FPS-Former outperforms state-of-the-art methods while requiring lower computational costs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Liu, Yaran Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Current advanced policy learning methodologies have demonstrated the ability to develop expert-level strategies when provided enough information. However, their requirements, including task-specific rewards, expert-labeled trajectories, and huge environmental interactions, can be expensive or even unavailable in many scenarios. In contrast, humans can efficiently acquire skills within a few trials and errors by imitating easily accessible internet video, in the absence of any other supervision. In this paper, we try to let machines replicate this efficient watching-and-learning process through Unsupervised Policy from Ensemble Self-supervised labeled Videos (UPESV), a novel framework to efficiently learn policies from videos without any other expert supervision. UPESV trains a video labeling model to infer the expert actions in expert videos, through several organically combined self-supervised tasks. Each task performs its own duties, and they together enable the model to make full use of both expert videos and reward-free interactions for advanced dynamics understanding and robust prediction. Simultaneously, UPESV clones a policy from the labeled expert videos, in turn collecting environmental interactions for self-supervised tasks. After a sample-efficient and unsupervised (i.e., reward-free) training process, an advanced video-imitated policy is obtained. Extensive experiments in sixteen challenging procedurally-generated environments demonstrate that the proposed UPESV achieves state-of-the-art few-shot policy learning (outperforming five current advanced baselines on 12/16 tasks) without exposure to any other supervision except videos. Detailed analysis is also provided, verifying the necessity of each self-supervised task employed in UPESV.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nilo Schwencke, Cyril Furtlehner</p>
<p>Abstract: In the recent years, Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have received strong interest as a method to solve PDE driven systems, in particular for data assimilation purpose. This method is still in its infancy, with many shortcomings and failures that remain not properly understood. In this paper we propose a natural gradient approach to PINNs which contributes to speed-up and improve the accuracy of the training. Based on an in depth analysis of the differential geometric structures of the problem, we come up with two distinct contributions: (i) a new natural gradient algorithm that scales as $\min(P^2S, S^2P)$, where $P$ is the number of parameters, and $S$ the batch size; (ii) a mathematically principled reformulation of the PINNs problem that allows the extension of natural gradient to it, with proved connections to Green's function theory.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jen-Yuan Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have demonstrated exceptional capability of generating high-quality and diverse images, but their practical application is hindered by the intensive computational cost during inference. The DPM generation process requires solving a Probability-Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (PF-ODE), which involves discretizing the integration domain into intervals for numerical approximation. This corresponds to the sampling schedule of a diffusion ODE solver, and we notice the solution from a first-order solver can be expressed as a convex combination of model outputs at all scheduled time-steps. We derive an upper bound for the discretization error of the sampling schedule, which can be efficiently optimized with Monte-Carlo estimation. Building on these theoretical results, we purpose a two-phase alternating optimization algorithm. In Phase-1, the sampling schedule is optimized for the pre-trained DPM; in Phase-2, the DPM further tuned on the selected time-steps. Experiments on a pre-trained DPM for ImageNet64 dataset demonstrate the purposed method consistently improves the baseline across various number of sampling steps.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuan Tian, Shuo Wang, Guangtao Zhai</p>
<p>Abstract: Face de-identification (DeID) has been widely studied for common scenes, but remains under-researched for medical scenes, mostly due to the lack of large-scale patient face datasets. In this paper, we release MeMa, consisting of over 40,000 photo-realistic patient faces. MeMa is re-generated from massive real patient photos. By carefully modulating the generation and data-filtering procedures, MeMa avoids breaching real patient privacy, while ensuring rich and plausible medical manifestations. We recruit expert clinicians to annotate MeMa with both coarse- and fine-grained labels, building the first medical-scene DeID benchmark. Additionally, we propose a baseline approach for this new medical-aware DeID task, by integrating data-driven medical semantic priors into the DeID procedure. Despite its conciseness and simplicity, our approach substantially outperforms previous ones. Dataset is available at https://github.com/tianyuan168326/MeMa-Pytorch.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sida Huang, Hongyuan Zhang, Xuelong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: With the advancement of pre-trained vision-language (VL) models, enhancing the alignment between visual and linguistic modalities in downstream tasks has emerged as a critical challenge. Different from existing fine-tuning methods that add extra modules to these two modalities, we investigate whether the frozen model can be fine-tuned by customized noise. Our approach is motivated by the scientific study of beneficial noise, namely Positive-incentive Noise (Pi-noise or $\pi$-noise) , which quantitatively analyzes the impact of noise. It therefore implies a new scheme to learn beneficial noise distribution that can be employed to fine-tune VL models. Focusing on few-shot classification tasks based on CLIP, we reformulate the inference process of CLIP and apply variational inference, demonstrating how to generate $\pi$-noise towards visual and linguistic modalities. Then, we propose Positive-incentive Noise Injector (PiNI), which can fine-tune CLIP via injecting noise into both visual and text encoders. Since the proposed method can learn the distribution of beneficial noise, we can obtain more diverse embeddings of vision and language to better align these two modalities for specific downstream tasks within limited computational resources. We evaluate different noise incorporation approaches and network architectures of PiNI. The evaluation across 11 datasets demonstrates its effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sharmin Akter</p>
<p>Abstract: Chest radiography is climacteric in identifying different pulmonary diseases, yet radiologist workload and inefficiency can lead to misdiagnoses. Automatic, accurate, and efficient segmentation of lung from X-ray images of chest is paramount for early disease detection. This study develops a deep learning framework using a Pix2pix Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to segment pulmonary abnormalities from CXR images. This framework's image preprocessing and augmentation techniques were properly incorporated with a U-Net-inspired generator-discriminator architecture. Initially, it loaded the CXR images and manual masks from the Montgomery and Shenzhen datasets, after which preprocessing and resizing were performed. A U-Net generator is applied to the processed CXR images that yield segmented masks; then, a Discriminator Network differentiates between the generated and real masks. Montgomery dataset served as the model's training set in the study, and the Shenzhen dataset was used to test its robustness, which was used here for the first time. An adversarial loss and an L1 distance were used to optimize the model in training. All metrics, which assess precision, recall, F1 score, and Dice coefficient, prove the effectiveness of this framework in pulmonary abnormality segmentation. It, therefore, sets the basis for future studies to be performed shortly using diverse datasets that could further confirm its clinical applicability in medical imaging.</p>

<p>Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has emerged as an effective approach for activating latent capabilities in large language models (LLMs). We observe that CoT shares significant similarities with self-training in terms of their learning processes. Motivated by these parallels, this paper explores the underlying relationship between CoT and self-training, demonstrating how insights from self-training can enhance CoT performance. Specifically, our study first reveals that CoT, like self-training, follows the principle of semantic entropy minimization. Leveraging this insight, we propose a novel CoT framework that incorporates two key components: (i) a task-specific prompt module designed to guide LLMs in generating high-quality initial reasoning processes, and (ii) an adaptive reasoning iteration module for progressively refining the reasoning process.</p>

<p>Abstract: Colloidal synthesis of nanocrystals usually includes complex chemical reactions and multi-step crystallization processes. Despite the great success in the past 30 years, it remains challenging to clarify the correlations between synthetic parameters of chemical reaction and physical properties of nanocrystals. Here, we developed a deep learning-based nanocrystal synthesis model that correlates synthetic parameters with the final size and shape of target nanocrystals, using a dataset of 3500 recipes covering 348 distinct nanocrystal compositions. The size and shape labels were obtained from transmission electron microscope images using a segmentation model trained with a semi-supervised algorithm on a dataset comprising 1.2 million nanocrystals. By applying the reaction intermediate-based data augmentation method and elaborated descriptors, the synthesis model was able to predict nanocrystal's size with a mean absolute error of 1.39 nm, while reaching an 89% average accuracy for shape classification. The synthesis model shows knowledge transfer capabilities across different nanocrystals with inputs of new recipes. With that, the influence of chemicals on the final size of nanocrystals was further evaluated, revealing the importance order of nanocrystal composition, precursor or ligand, and solvent. Overall, the deep learning-based nanocrystal synthesis model offers a powerful tool to expedite the development of high-quality nanocrystals.</p>

<p>Abstract: Foresight 2 (FS2) is a large language model fine-tuned on hospital data for modelling patient timelines (GitHub 'removed for anon'). It can understand patients' clinical notes and predict SNOMED codes for a wide range of biomedical use cases, including diagnosis suggestions, risk forecasting, and procedure and medication recommendations. FS2 is trained on the free text portion of the MIMIC-III dataset, firstly through extracting biomedical concepts and then creating contextualised patient timelines, upon which the model is then fine-tuned. The results show significant improvement over the previous state-of-the-art for the next new biomedical concept prediction (P/R - 0.73/0.66 vs 0.52/0.32) and a similar improvement specifically for the next new disorder prediction (P/R - 0.69/0.62 vs 0.46/0.25). Finally, on the task of risk forecast, we compare our model to GPT-4-turbo (and a range of open-source biomedical LLMs) and show that FS2 performs significantly better on such tasks (P@5 - 0.90 vs 0.65). This highlights the need to incorporate hospital data into LLMs and shows that small models outperform much larger ones when fine-tuned on high-quality, specialised data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingyu Xu, Longguang Wang, Weidong Sheng, Yingqian Wang, Chao Xiao, Chao Ma, Wei An</p>
<p>Abstract: Tracking multiple tiny objects is highly challenging due to their weak appearance and limited features. Existing multi-object tracking algorithms generally focus on single-modality scenes, and overlook the complementary characteristics of tiny objects captured by multiple remote sensors. To enhance tracking performance by integrating complementary information from multiple sources, we propose a novel framework called {HGT-Track (Heterogeneous Graph Transformer based Multi-Tiny-Object Tracking)}. Specifically, we first employ a Transformer-based encoder to embed images from different modalities. Subsequently, we utilize Heterogeneous Graph Transformer to aggregate spatial and temporal information from multiple modalities to generate detection and tracking features. Additionally, we introduce a target re-detection module (ReDet) to ensure tracklet continuity by maintaining consistency across different modalities. Furthermore, this paper introduces the first benchmark VT-Tiny-MOT (Visible-Thermal Tiny Multi-Object Tracking) for RGB-T fused multiple tiny object tracking. Extensive experiments are conducted on VT-Tiny-MOT, and the results have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method. Compared to other state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves better performance in terms of MOTA (Multiple-Object Tracking Accuracy) and ID-F1 score.

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10869">TinySubNets: An efficient and low capacity continual learning strategy</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Marcin Pietro\'n, Kamil Faber, Dominik \.Zurek, Roberto Corizzo</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) is a highly relevant setting gaining traction in recent machine learning research. Among CL works, architectural and hybrid strategies are particularly effective due to their potential to adapt the model architecture as new tasks are presented. However, many existing solutions do not efficiently exploit model sparsity, and are prone to capacity saturation due to their inefficient use of available weights, which limits the number of learnable tasks. In this paper, we propose TinySubNets (TSN), a novel architectural CL strategy that addresses the issues through the unique combination of pruning with different sparsity levels, adaptive quantization, and weight sharing. Pruning identifies a subset of weights that preserve model performance, making less relevant weights available for future tasks. Adaptive quantization allows a single weight to be separated into multiple parts which can be assigned to different tasks. Weight sharing between tasks boosts the exploitation of capacity and task similarity, allowing for the identification of a better trade-off between model accuracy and capacity. These features allow TSN to efficiently leverage the available capacity, enhance knowledge transfer, and reduce computational resource consumption. Experimental results involving common benchmark CL datasets and scenarios show that our proposed strategy achieves better results in terms of accuracy than existing state-of-the-art CL strategies. Moreover, our strategy is shown to provide a significantly improved model capacity exploitation. Code released at: https://github.com/lifelonglab/tinysubnets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhi Zhou, Kun-Yang Yu, Lan-Zhe Guo, Yu-Feng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Tabular data plays a vital role in various real-world scenarios and finds extensive applications. Although recent deep tabular models have shown remarkable success, they still struggle to handle data distribution shifts, leading to performance degradation when testing distributions change. To remedy this, a robust tabular model must adapt to generalize to unknown distributions during testing. In this paper, we investigate the problem of fully test-time adaptation (FTTA) for tabular data, where the model is adapted using only the testing data. We identify three key challenges: the existence of label and covariate distribution shifts, the lack of effective data augmentation, and the sensitivity of adaptation, which render existing FTTA methods ineffective for tabular data. To this end, we propose the Fully Test-time Adaptation for Tabular data, namely FTAT, which enables FTTA methods to robustly optimize the label distribution of predictions, adapt to shifted covariate distributions, and suit a variety of tasks and models effectively. We conduct comprehensive experiments on six benchmark datasets, which are evaluated using three metrics. The experimental results demonstrate that FTAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a margin.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haocheng Duan, Hao Wu, Sean Qian</p>
<p>Abstract: Conventional automatic incident detection (AID) has relied heavily on all incident reports exclusively for training and evaluation. However, these reports suffer from a number of issues, such as delayed reports, inaccurate descriptions, false alarms, missing reports, and incidents that do not necessarily influence traffic. Relying on these reports to train or calibrate AID models hinders their ability to detect traffic anomalies effectively and timely, even leading to convergence issues in the model training process. Moreover, conventional AID models are not inherently designed to capture the early indicators of any generic incidents. It remains unclear how far ahead an AID model can report incidents. The AID applications in the literature are also spatially limited because the data used by most models is often limited to specific test road segments. To solve these problems, we propose a deep learning framework utilizing prior domain knowledge and model-designing strategies. This allows the model to detect a broader range of anomalies, not only incidents that significantly influence traffic flow but also early characteristics of incidents along with historically unreported anomalies. We specially design the model to target the early-stage detection/prediction of an incident. Additionally, unlike most conventional AID studies, we use widely available data, enhancing our method's scalability. The experimental results across numerous road segments on different maps demonstrate that our model leads to more effective and early anomaly detection. Our framework does not focus on stacking or tweaking various deep learning models; instead, it focuses on model design and training strategies to improve early detection performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Literature reviews are a critical component of formulating and justifying new research, but are a manual and often time-consuming process. This research introduces a novel, generalizable approach to literature analysis called CEKER which uses a three-step process to streamline the collection of literature, the extraction of key insights, and the summarized analysis of key trends and gaps. Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), this methodology represents a significant shift from traditional manual literature reviews, offering a scalable, flexible, and repeatable approach that can be applied across diverse research domains.
  A case study on unikernel security illustrates CEKER's ability to generate novel insights validated against previous manual methods. CEKER's analysis highlighted reduced attack surface as the most prominent theme. Key security gaps included the absence of Address Space Layout Randomization, missing debugging tools, and limited entropy generation, all of which represent important challenges to unikernel security. The study also revealed a reliance on hypervisors as a potential attack vector and emphasized the need for dynamic security adjustments to address real-time threats.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenyu Lei, Yushun Dong, Jundong Li, Chen Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Spatial-temporal graphs are widely used in a variety of real-world applications. Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool to extract meaningful insights from this data. However, in real-world applications, most nodes may not possess any available temporal data during training. For example, the pandemic dynamics of most cities on a geographical graph may not be available due to the asynchronous nature of outbreaks. Such a phenomenon disagrees with the training requirements of most existing spatial-temporal forecasting methods, which jeopardizes their effectiveness and thus blocks broader deployment. In this paper, we propose to formulate a novel problem of inductive forecasting with limited training data. In particular, given a spatial-temporal graph, we aim to learn a spatial-temporal forecasting model that can be easily generalized onto those nodes without any available temporal training data. To handle this problem, we propose a principled framework named ST-FiT. ST-FiT consists of two key learning components: temporal data augmentation and spatial graph topology learning. With such a design, ST-FiT can be used on top of any existing STGNNs to achieve superior performance on the nodes without training data. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of ST-FiT in multiple key perspectives.</p>

<p>Abstract: There is a surge of interest in using formal languages such as Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) and finite automata to precisely and succinctly specify complex tasks and derive reward functions for reinforcement learning (RL) in robotic applications. However, existing methods often assign sparse rewards (e.g., giving a reward of 1 only if a task is completed and 0 otherwise), necessitating extensive exploration to converge to a high-quality policy. To address this limitation, we propose a suite of reward functions that incentivize an RL agent to make measurable progress on tasks specified by LTL formulas and develop an adaptive reward shaping approach that dynamically updates these reward functions during the learning process. Experimental results on a range of RL-based robotic tasks demonstrate that the proposed approach is compatible with various RL algorithms and consistently outperforms baselines, achieving earlier convergence to better policies with higher task success rates and returns.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rise of chronic diseases and pandemics like COVID-19 has emphasized the need for effective patient data processing while ensuring privacy through anonymization and de-identification of protected health information (PHI). Anonymized data facilitates research without compromising patient confidentiality. This paper introduces expert small AI models developed using the LLM-in-the-loop methodology to meet the demand for domain-specific de-identification NER models. These models overcome the privacy risks associated with large language models (LLMs) used via APIs by eliminating the need to transmit or store sensitive data. More importantly, they consistently outperform LLMs in de-identification tasks, offering superior performance and reliability. Our de-identification NER models, developed in eight languages (English, German, Italian, French, Romanian, Turkish, Spanish, and Arabic) achieved f1-micro score averages of 0.966, 0.975, 0.976, 0.970, 0.964, 0.974, 0.978, and 0.953 respectively. These results establish them as the most accurate healthcare anonymization solutions, surpassing existing small models and even general-purpose LLMs such as GPT-4o. While Part-1 of this series introduced the LLM-in-the-loop methodology for bio-medical document translation, this second paper showcases its success in developing cost-effective expert small NER models in de-identification tasks. Our findings lay the groundwork for future healthcare AI innovations, including biomedical entity and relation extraction, demonstrating the value of specialized models for domain-specific challenges.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhiram Raju, Praneeth Vepakomma</p>
<p>Abstract: Hemodialysis patients who are on donor lists for kidney transplant may get misidentified, delaying their wait time. Thus, predicting their survival time is crucial for optimizing waiting lists and personalizing treatment plans. Predicting survival times for patients often requires large quantities of high quality but sensitive data. This data is siloed and since individual datasets are smaller and less diverse, locally trained survival models do not perform as well as centralized ones. Hence, we propose the use of Federated Learning in the context of predicting survival for hemodialysis patients. Federated Learning or FL can have comparatively better performances than local models while not sharing data between centers. However, despite the increased use of such technologies, the application of FL in survival and even more, dialysis patients remains sparse. This paper studies the performance of FL for data of hemodialysis patients from NephroPlus, the largest private network of dialysis centers in India.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Julia Witte Zimmerman, Denis Hudon, Kathryn Cramer, Alejandro J. Ruiz, Calla Beauregard, Ashley Fehr, Mikaela Irene Fudolig, Bradford Demarest, Yoshi Meke Bird, Milo Z. Trujillo, Christopher M. Danforth, Peter Sheridan Dodds</p>
<p>Abstract: Tokenization is a necessary component within the current architecture of many language models, including the transformer-based large language models (LLMs) of Generative AI, yet its impact on the model's cognition is often overlooked. We argue that LLMs demonstrate that the Distributional Hypothesis (DM) is sufficient for reasonably human-like language performance, and that the emergence of human-meaningful linguistic units among tokens motivates linguistically-informed interventions in existing, linguistically-agnostic tokenization techniques, particularly with respect to their roles as (1) semantic primitives and as (2) vehicles for conveying salient distributional patterns from human language to the model. We explore tokenizations from a BPE tokenizer; extant model vocabularies obtained from Hugging Face and tiktoken; and the information in exemplar token vectors as they move through the layers of a RoBERTa (large) model. Besides creating sub-optimal semantic building blocks and obscuring the model's access to the necessary distributional patterns, we describe how tokenization pretraining can be a backdoor for bias and other unwanted content, which current alignment practices may not remediate. Additionally, we relay evidence that the tokenization algorithm's objective function impacts the LLM's cognition, despite being meaningfully insulated from the main system intelligence.</p>

<p>Abstract: Video representation learning is an increasingly important topic in machine learning research. We present Video JEPA with Variance-Covariance Regularization (VJ-VCR): a joint-embedding predictive architecture for self-supervised video representation learning that employs variance and covariance regularization to avoid representation collapse. We show that hidden representations from our VJ-VCR contain abstract, high-level information about the input data. Specifically, they outperform representations obtained from a generative baseline on downstream tasks that require understanding of the underlying dynamics of moving objects in the videos. Additionally, we explore different ways to incorporate latent variables into the VJ-VCR framework that capture information about uncertainty in the future in non-deterministic settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Piyapath T Spencer</p>
<p>Abstract: Human-Centric NLP often claims to prioritise human needs and values, yet many implementations reveal an underlying AI-centric focus. Through an analysis of case studies in language modelling, behavioural testing, and multi-modal alignment, this study identifies a significant gap between the ideas of human-centricity and actual practices. Key issues include misalignment with human-centred design principles, the reduction of human factors to mere benchmarks, and insufficient consideration of real-world impacts. The discussion explores whether Human-Centric NLP embodies true human-centred design, emphasising the need for interdisciplinary collaboration and ethical considerations. The paper advocates for a redefinition of Human-Centric NLP, urging a broader focus on real-world utility and societal implications to ensure that language technologies genuinely serve and empower users.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hong-Wei Wu, Wei-Yao Wang, Kuang-Da Wang, Wen-Chih Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: Tabular data are fundamental in common machine learning applications, ranging from finance to genomics and healthcare. This paper focuses on tabular regression tasks, a field where deep learning (DL) methods are not consistently superior to machine learning (ML) models due to the challenges posed by irregular target functions inherent in tabular data, causing sensitive label changes with minor variations from features. To address these issues, we propose a novel Arithmetic-Aware Pre-training and Adaptive-Regularized Fine-tuning framework (APAR), which enables the model to fit irregular target function in tabular data while reducing the negative impact of overfitting. In the pre-training phase, APAR introduces an arithmetic-aware pretext objective to capture intricate sample-wise relationships from the perspective of continuous labels. In the fine-tuning phase, a consistency-based adaptive regularization technique is proposed to self-learn appropriate data augmentation. Extensive experiments across 10 datasets demonstrated that APAR outperforms existing GBDT-, supervised NN-, and pretrain-finetune NN-based methods in RMSE (+9.43% $\sim$ 20.37%), and empirically validated the effects of pre-training tasks, including the study of arithmetic operations.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simon Torka, Sahin Albayrak</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, the rise of AI-assisted code-generation tools has significantly transformed software development. While code generators have mainly been used to support conventional software development, their use will be extended to powerful and secure AI systems. Systems capable of generating code, such as ChatGPT, OpenAI Codex, GitHub Copilot, and AlphaCode, take advantage of advances in machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) enabled by large language models (LLMs). However, it must be borne in mind that these models work probabilistically, which means that although they can generate complex code from natural language input, there is no guarantee for the functionality and security of the generated code.
  However, to fully exploit the considerable potential of this technology, the security, reliability, functionality, and quality of the generated code must be guaranteed. This paper examines the implementation of these goals to date and explores strategies to optimize them. In addition, we explore how these systems can be optimized to create safe, high-performance, and executable artificial intelligence (AI) models, and consider how to improve their accessibility to make AI development more inclusive and equitable.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Chen, Ze Wang, Xiang Li, Ximeng Sun, Fangyi Chen, Jiang Liu, Jindong Wang, Bhiksha Raj, Zicheng Liu, Emad Barsoum</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficient image tokenization with high compression ratios remains a critical challenge for training generative models. We present SoftVQ-VAE, a continuous image tokenizer that leverages soft categorical posteriors to aggregate multiple codewords into each latent token, substantially increasing the representation capacity of the latent space. When applied to Transformer-based architectures, our approach compresses 256x256 and 512x512 images using as few as 32 or 64 1-dimensional tokens. Not only does SoftVQ-VAE show consistent and high-quality reconstruction, more importantly, it also achieves state-of-the-art and significantly faster image generation results across different denoising-based generative models. Remarkably, SoftVQ-VAE improves inference throughput by up to 18x for generating 256x256 images and 55x for 512x512 images while achieving competitive FID scores of 1.78 and 2.21 for SiT-XL. It also improves the training efficiency of the generative models by reducing the number of training iterations by 2.3x while maintaining comparable performance. With its fully-differentiable design and semantic-rich latent space, our experiment demonstrates that SoftVQ-VQE achieves efficient tokenization without compromising generation quality, paving the way for more efficient generative models. Code and model are released.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10961">PSMGD: Periodic Stochastic Multi-Gradient Descent for Fast Multi-Objective Optimization</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingjing Xu, Peizhong Ju, Jia Liu, Haibo Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-objective optimization (MOO) lies at the core of many machine learning (ML) applications that involve multiple, potentially conflicting objectives (e.g., multi-task learning, multi-objective reinforcement learning, among many others). Despite the long history of MOO, recent years have witnessed a surge in interest within the ML community in the development of gradient manipulation algorithms for MOO, thanks to the availability of gradient information in many ML problems. However, existing gradient manipulation methods for MOO often suffer from long training times, primarily due to the need for computing dynamic weights by solving an additional optimization problem to determine a common descent direction that can decrease all objectives simultaneously. To address this challenge, we propose a new and efficient algorithm called Periodic Stochastic Multi-Gradient Descent (PSMGD) to accelerate MOO. PSMGD is motivated by the key observation that dynamic weights across objectives exhibit small changes under minor updates over short intervals during the optimization process. Consequently, our PSMGD algorithm is designed to periodically compute these dynamic weights and utilizes them repeatedly, thereby effectively reducing the computational overload. Theoretically, we prove that PSMGD can achieve state-of-the-art convergence rates for strongly-convex, general convex, and non-convex functions. Additionally, we introduce a new computational complexity measure, termed backpropagation complexity, and demonstrate that PSMGD could achieve an objective-independent backpropagation complexity. Through extensive experiments, we verify that PSMGD can provide comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art MOO algorithms while significantly reducing training time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alex Morehead, Jianlin Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Powerful generative models of protein-ligand structure have recently been proposed, but few of these methods support both flexible protein-ligand docking and affinity estimation. Of those that do, none can directly model multiple binding ligands concurrently or have been rigorously benchmarked on pharmacologically relevant drug targets, hindering their widespread adoption in drug discovery efforts. In this work, we propose FlowDock, a deep geometric generative model based on conditional flow matching that learns to directly map unbound (apo) structures to their bound (holo) counterparts for an arbitrary number of binding ligands. Furthermore, FlowDock provides predicted structural confidence scores and binding affinity values with each of its generated protein-ligand complex structures, enabling fast virtual screening of new (multi-ligand) drug targets. For the commonly-used PoseBusters Benchmark dataset, FlowDock achieves a 51% blind docking success rate using unbound (apo) protein input structures and without any information derived from multiple sequence alignments, and for the challenging new DockGen-E dataset, FlowDock matches the performance of single-sequence Chai-1 for binding pocket generalization. Additionally, in the ligand category of the 16th community-wide Critical Assessment of Techniques for Structure Prediction (CASP16), FlowDock ranked among the top-5 methods for pharmacological binding affinity estimation across 140 protein-ligand complexes, demonstrating the efficacy of its learned representations in virtual screening.

<p>Abstract: Sound decision-making relies on accurate prediction for tangible outcomes ranging from military conflict to disease outbreaks. To improve crowdsourced forecasting accuracy, we developed SAGE, a hybrid forecasting system that combines human and machine generated forecasts. The system provides a platform where users can interact with machine models and thus anchor their judgments on an objective benchmark. The system also aggregates human and machine forecasts weighting both for propinquity and based on assessed skill while adjusting for overconfidence. We present results from the Hybrid Forecasting Competition (HFC) - larger than comparable forecasting tournaments - including 1085 users forecasting 398 real-world forecasting problems over eight months. Our main result is that the hybrid system generated more accurate forecasts compared to a human-only baseline which had no machine generated predictions. We found that skilled forecasters who had access to machine-generated forecasts outperformed those who only viewed historical data. We also demonstrated the inclusion of machine-generated forecasts in our aggregation algorithms improved performance, both in terms of accuracy and scalability. This suggests that hybrid forecasting systems, which potentially require fewer human resources, can be a viable approach for maintaining a competitive level of accuracy over a larger number of forecasting questions.</p>

We highlight the scarcity of publicly available, diverse datasets and analyze the consequences of dialectal bias within existing resources. By emphasizing the need for culturally and contextually informed natural language processing (NLP) tools, we advocate for a more nuanced and inclusive approach to hate speech detection in the Arab world.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mustafa Munir, Md Mostafijur Rahman, Radu Marculescu</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision transformers (ViTs) have dominated computer vision in recent years. However, ViTs are computationally expensive and not well suited for mobile devices; this led to the prevalence of convolutional neural network (CNN) and ViT-based hybrid models for mobile vision applications. Recently, Vision GNN (ViG) and CNN hybrid models have also been proposed for mobile vision tasks. However, all of these methods remain slower compared to pure CNN-based models. In this work, we propose Multi-Level Dilated Convolutions to devise a purely CNN-based mobile backbone. Using Multi-Level Dilated Convolutions allows for a larger theoretical receptive field than standard convolutions. Different levels of dilation also allow for interactions between the short-range and long-range features in an image. Experiments show that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) mobile CNN, ViT, ViG, and hybrid architectures in terms of accuracy and/or speed on image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation. Our fastest model, RapidNet-Ti, achieves 76.3\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with 0.9 ms inference latency on an iPhone 13 mini NPU, which is faster and more accurate than MobileNetV2x1.4 (74.7\% top-1 with 1.0 ms latency). Our work shows that pure CNN architectures can beat SOTA hybrid and ViT models in terms of accuracy and speed when designed properly.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present Cocoa, a system that implements a novel interaction design pattern -- interactive plans -- for users to collaborate with an AI agent on complex, multi-step tasks in a document editor. Cocoa harmonizes human and AI efforts and enables flexible delegation of agency through two actions: Co-planning (where users collaboratively compose a plan of action with the agent) and Co-execution (where users collaboratively execute plan steps with the agent). Using scientific research as a sample domain, we motivate the design of Cocoa through a formative study with 9 researchers while also drawing inspiration from the design of computational notebooks. We evaluate Cocoa through a user study with 16 researchers and find that when compared to a strong chat baseline, Cocoa improved agent steerability without sacrificing ease of use. A deeper investigation of the general utility of both systems uncovered insights into usage contexts where interactive plans may be more appropriate than chat, and vice versa. Our work surfaces numerous practical implications and paves new paths for interactive interfaces that foster more effective collaboration between humans and agentic AI systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in agentic LLMs have demonstrated remarkable automated Verilog code generation capabilities.

We show for the first time that multi-agent architectures can effectively mitigate the degeneration risk while improving code error correction capabilities, resulting in higher-quality Verilog code generation. Experimental results show that the proposed method could achieve 96.4% and 96.5% pass@10 scores on VerilogEval Machine and Human benchmarks, respectively while attaining 100% Syntax and 99.9% Functionality pass@5 metrics on the RTLLM benchmark.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hang Zhang, Zhuoling Li, Jun Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Dynamic scenes contain intricate spatio-temporal information, crucial for mobile robots, UAVs, and autonomous driving systems to make informed decisions. Parsing these scenes into semantic triplets <Subject-Predicate-Object> for accurate Scene Graph Generation (SGG) is highly challenging due to the fluctuating spatio-temporal complexity. Inspired by the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose SceneLLM, a novel framework that leverages LLMs as powerful scene analyzers for dynamic SGG. Our framework introduces a Video-to-Language (V2L) mapping module that transforms video frames into linguistic signals (scene tokens), making the input more comprehensible for LLMs. To better encode spatial information, we devise a Spatial Information Aggregation (SIA) scheme, inspired by the structure of Chinese characters, which encodes spatial data into tokens. Using Optimal Transport (OT), we generate an implicit language signal from the frame-level token sequence that captures the video's spatio-temporal information. To further improve the LLM's ability to process this implicit linguistic input, we apply Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the model. Finally, we use a transformer-based SGG predictor to decode the LLM's reasoning and predict semantic triplets. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on the Action Genome (AG) benchmark, and extensive experiments show the effectiveness of SceneLLM in understanding and generating accurate dynamic scene graphs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yujin Wang, Quanfeng Liu, Jiaqi Fan, Jinlong Hong, Hongqing Chu, Mengjian Tian, Bingzhao Gao, Hong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding and addressing corner cases is essential for ensuring the safety and reliability of autonomous driving systems. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) play a crucial role in enhancing scenario comprehension, yet they face significant challenges, such as hallucination and insufficient real-world grounding, which compromise their performance in critical driving scenarios. In this work, we propose RAC3, a novel framework designed to improve VLMs' ability to handle corner cases effectively. The framework integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to mitigate hallucination by dynamically incorporating context-specific external knowledge. A cornerstone of RAC3 is its cross-modal alignment fine-tuning, which utilizes contrastive learning to embed image-text pairs into a unified semantic space, enabling robust retrieval of similar scenarios. We evaluate RAC3 through extensive experiments using a curated dataset of corner case scenarios, demonstrating its ability to enhance semantic alignment, improve hallucination mitigation, and achieve superior performance metrics, such as Cosine Similarity and ROUGE-L scores. For example, for the LLaVA-v1.6-34B VLM, the cosine similarity between the generated text and the reference text has increased by 5.22\%. The F1-score in ROUGE-L has increased by 39.91\%, the Precision has increased by 55.80\%, and the Recall has increased by 13.74\%. This work underscores the potential of retrieval-augmented VLMs to advance the robustness and safety of autonomous driving in complex environments.</p>

In 2023, Intel released the Intel Core Ultra processor with codename Meteor Lake, featuring a CPU, GPU, and NPU system-on-chip. However, official software support for the NPU through Intel's OpenVINO framework is limited to static model inference. The dynamic nature of autoregressive token generation in LLMs is therefore not supported out of the box. To address this shortcoming, we present NITRO (NPU Inference for Transformers Optimization), a Python-based framework built on top of OpenVINO to support text and chat generation on NPUs. In this paper, we discuss in detail the key modifications made to the transformer architecture to enable inference, some performance benchmarks, and future steps towards improving the package. The code repository for NITRO can be found here: https://github.com/abdelfattah-lab/nitro.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Wang (Jeff), Feiling wang (Jeff), Xuegang Ban (Jeff)</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a sensitivity analysis framework based on set valued mapping for deep neural networks (DNN) to understand and compute how the solutions (model weights) of DNN respond to perturbations in the training data. As a DNN may not exhibit a unique solution (minima) and the algorithm of solving a DNN may lead to different solutions with minor perturbations to input data, we focus on the sensitivity of the solution set of DNN, instead of studying a single solution. In particular, we are interested in the expansion and contraction of the set in response to data perturbations. If the change of solution set can be bounded by the extent of the data perturbation, the model is said to exhibit the Lipschitz like property. This "set-to-set" analysis approach provides a deeper understanding of the robustness and reliability of DNNs during training. Our framework incorporates both isolated and non-isolated minima, and critically, does not require the assumption that the Hessian of loss function is non-singular. By developing set-level metrics such as distance between sets, convergence of sets, derivatives of set-valued mapping, and stability across the solution set, we prove that the solution set of the Fully Connected Neural Network holds Lipschitz-like properties. For general neural networks (e.g., Resnet), we introduce a graphical-derivative-based method to estimate the new solution set following data perturbation without retraining.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuo Wu, Qinglin Jia, Chuhan Wu, Zhaocheng Du, Shuai Wang, Zan Wang, Zhenhua Dong</p>
<p>Abstract: Evaluating the quality of recommender systems is critical for algorithm design and optimization. Most evaluation methods are computed based on offline metrics for quick algorithm evolution, since online experiments are usually risky and time-consuming. However, offline evaluation usually cannot fully reflect users' preference for the outcome of different recommendation algorithms, and the results may not be consistent with online A/B test. Moreover, many offline metrics such as AUC do not offer sufficient information for comparing the subtle differences between two competitive recommender systems in different aspects, which may lead to substantial performance differences in long-term online serving. Fortunately, due to the strong commonsense knowledge and role-play capability of large language models (LLMs), it is possible to obtain simulated user feedback on offline recommendation results. Motivated by the idea of LLM Chatbot Arena, in this paper we present the idea of RecSys Arena, where the recommendation results given by two different recommender systems in each session are evaluated by an LLM judger to obtain fine-grained evaluation feedback. More specifically, for each sample we use LLM to generate a user profile description based on user behavior history or off-the-shelf profile features, which is used to guide LLM to play the role of this user and evaluate the relative preference for two recommendation results generated by different models. Through extensive experiments on two recommendation datasets in different scenarios, we demonstrate that many different LLMs not only provide general evaluation results that are highly consistent with canonical offline metrics, but also provide rich insight in many subjective aspects. Moreover, it can better distinguish different algorithms with comparable performance in terms of AUC and nDCG.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihao Guo, Qingyun Sun, Haonan Yuan, Xingcheng Fu, Min Zhou, Yisen Gao, Jianxin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-world graphs have inherently complex and diverse topological patterns, known as topological heterogeneity. Most existing works learn graph representation in a single constant curvature space that is insufficient to match the complex geometric shapes, resulting in low-quality embeddings with high distortion. This also constitutes a critical challenge for graph foundation models, which are expected to uniformly handle a wide variety of diverse graph data. Recent studies have indicated that product manifold gains the possibility to address topological heterogeneity. However, the product manifold is still homogeneous, which is inadequate and inflexible for representing the mixed heterogeneous topology. In this paper, we propose a novel Graph Mixture of Riemannian Experts (GraphMoRE) framework to effectively tackle topological heterogeneity by personalized fine-grained topology geometry pattern preservation. Specifically, to minimize the embedding distortion, we propose a topology-aware gating mechanism to select the optimal embedding space for each node. By fusing the outputs of diverse Riemannian experts with learned gating weights, we construct personalized mixed curvature spaces for nodes, effectively embedding the graph into a heterogeneous manifold with varying curvatures at different points. Furthermore, to fairly measure pairwise distances between different embedding spaces, we present a concise and effective alignment strategy. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance with lower distortion, highlighting its potential for modeling complex graphs with topological heterogeneity, and providing a novel architectural perspective for graph foundation models.</p>

<p>Abstract: In causal inference, randomized experiment is a de facto method to overcome various theoretical issues in observational study. However, the experimental design requires expensive costs, so an efficient experimental design is necessary. We propose ABC3, a Bayesian active learning policy for causal inference. We show a policy minimizing an estimation error on conditional average treatment effect is equivalent to minimizing an integrated posterior variance, similar to Cohn criteria \citep{cohn1994active}. We theoretically prove ABC3 also minimizes an imbalance between the treatment and control groups and the type 1 error probability. Imbalance-minimizing characteristic is especially notable as several works have emphasized the importance of achieving balance. Through extensive experiments on real-world data sets, ABC3 achieves the highest efficiency, while empirically showing the theoretical results hold.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gazi Nazia Nur, Mohammad Ahnaf Sadat</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the impact of adversarial attacks on the explainability of deep learning models, which are commonly criticized for their black-box nature despite their capacity for autonomous feature extraction. This black-box nature can affect the perceived trustworthiness of these models. To address this, explainability techniques such as GradCAM, SmoothGrad, and LIME have been developed to clarify model decision-making processes. Our research focuses on the robustness of these explanations when models are subjected to adversarial attacks, specifically those involving subtle image perturbations that are imperceptible to humans but can significantly mislead models. For this, we utilize attack methods like the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and the Basic Iterative Method (BIM) and observe their effects on model accuracy and explanations. The results reveal a substantial decline in model accuracy, with accuracies dropping from 89.94% to 58.73% and 45.50% under FGSM and BIM attacks, respectively. Despite these declines in accuracy, the explanation of the models measured by metrics such as Intersection over Union (IoU) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) shows negligible changes, suggesting that these metrics may not be sensitive enough to detect the presence of adversarial perturbations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yun Qu, Yuhang Jiang, Boyuan Wang, Yixiu Mao, Cheems Wang, Chang Liu, Xiangyang Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) often encounters delayed and sparse feedback in real-world applications, even with only episodic rewards. Previous approaches have made some progress in reward redistribution for credit assignment but still face challenges, including training difficulties due to redundancy and ambiguous attributions stemming from overlooking the multifaceted nature of mission performance evaluation. Hopefully, Large Language Model (LLM) encompasses fruitful decision-making knowledge and provides a plausible tool for reward redistribution. Even so, deploying LLM in this case is non-trivial due to the misalignment between linguistic knowledge and the symbolic form requirement, together with inherent randomness and hallucinations in inference. To tackle these issues, we introduce LaRe, a novel LLM-empowered symbolic-based decision-making framework, to improve credit assignment. Key to LaRe is the concept of the Latent Reward, which works as a multi-dimensional performance evaluation, enabling more interpretable goal attainment from various perspectives and facilitating more effective reward redistribution. We examine that semantically generated code from LLM can bridge linguistic knowledge and symbolic latent rewards, as it is executable for symbolic objects. Meanwhile, we design latent reward self-verification to increase the stability and reliability of LLM inference. Theoretically, reward-irrelevant redundancy elimination in the latent reward benefits RL performance from more accurate reward estimation. Extensive experimental results witness that LaRe (i) achieves superior temporal credit assignment to SOTA methods, (ii) excels in allocating contributions among multiple agents, and (iii) outperforms policies trained with ground truth rewards for certain tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bingchen Wang, Zhaoxuan Wu, Fusheng Liu, Bryan Kian Hsiang Low</p>
<p>Abstract: Collaborative machine learning (CML) provides a promising paradigm for democratizing advanced technologies by enabling cost-sharing among participants. However, the potential for rent-seeking behaviors among parties can undermine such collaborations. Contract theory presents a viable solution by rewarding participants with models of varying accuracy based on their contributions. However, unlike monetary compensation, using models as rewards introduces unique challenges, particularly due to the stochastic nature of these rewards when contribution costs are privately held information. This paper formalizes the optimal contracting problem within CML and proposes a transformation that simplifies the non-convex optimization problem into one that can be solved through convex optimization algorithms. We conduct a detailed analysis of the properties that an optimal contract must satisfy when models serve as the rewards, and we explore the potential benefits and welfare implications of these contract-driven CML schemes through numerical experiments.</p>

<p>Abstract: The drug development process is a critical challenge in the pharmaceutical industry due to its time-consuming nature and the need to discover new drug potentials to address various ailments. The initial step in drug development, drug target identification, often consumes considerable time. While valid, traditional methods such as in vivo and in vitro approaches are limited in their ability to analyze vast amounts of data efficiently, leading to wasteful outcomes. To expedite and streamline drug development, an increasing reliance on computer-aided drug design (CADD) approaches has merged. These sophisticated in silico methods offer a promising avenue for efficiently identifying viable drug candidates, thus providing pharmaceutical firms with significant opportunities to uncover new prospective drug targets. The main goal of this work is to review in silico methods used in the drug development process with a focus on identifying therapeutic targets linked to specific diseases at the genetic or protein level. This article thoroughly discusses A-to-Z in silico techniques, which are essential for identifying the targets of bioactive compounds and their potential therapeutic effects. This review intends to improve drug discovery processes by illuminating the state of these cutting-edge approaches, thereby maximizing the effectiveness and duration of clinical trials for novel drug target investigation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juntao Dai, Yaodong Yang, Qian Zheng, Gang Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: A key aspect of Safe Reinforcement Learning (Safe RL) involves estimating the constraint condition for the next policy, which is crucial for guiding the optimization of safe policy updates. However, the existing Advantage-based Estimation (ABE) method relies on the infinite-horizon discounted advantage function. This dependence leads to catastrophic errors in finite-horizon scenarios with non-discounted constraints, resulting in safety-violation updates. In response, we propose the first estimation method for finite-horizon non-discounted constraints in deep Safe RL, termed Gradient-based Estimation (GBE), which relies on the analytic gradient derived along trajectories. Our theoretical and empirical analyses demonstrate that GBE can effectively estimate constraint changes over a finite horizon. Constructing a surrogate optimization problem with GBE, we developed a novel Safe RL algorithm called Constrained Gradient-based Policy Optimization (CGPO). CGPO identifies feasible optimal policies by iteratively resolving sub-problems within trust regions. Our empirical results reveal that CGPO, unlike baseline algorithms, successfully estimates the constraint functions of subsequent policies, thereby ensuring the efficiency and feasibility of each update.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Da Li, Junping Yin, Jin Xu, Xinxin Li, Juan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Symbolic regression automatically searches for mathematical equations to reveal underlying mechanisms within datasets, offering enhanced interpretability compared to black box models. Traditionally, symbolic regression has been considered to be purely numeric-driven, with insufficient attention given to the potential contributions of visual information in augmenting this process. When dealing with high-dimensional and complex datasets, existing symbolic regression models are often inefficient and tend to generate overly complex equations, making subsequent mechanism analysis complicated. In this paper, we propose the vision-guided multimodal symbolic regression model, called ViSymRe, that systematically explores how visual information can improve various metrics of symbolic regression. Compared to traditional models, our proposed model has the following innovations: (1) It integrates three modalities: vision, symbol and numeric to enhance symbolic regression, enabling the model to benefit from the strengths of each modality; (2) It establishes a meta-learning framework that can learn from historical experiences to efficiently solve new symbolic regression problems; (3) It emphasizes the simplicity and structural rationality of the equations rather than merely numerical fitting. Extensive experiments show that our proposed model exhibits strong generalization capability and noise resistance. The equations it generates outperform state-of-the-art numeric-only baselines in terms of fitting effect, simplicity and structural accuracy, thus being able to facilitate accurate mechanism analysis and the development of theoretical models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) is an important machine learning task with many real-world uses, including fraud detection, medical diagnosis, and industrial monitoring. Within natural language processing (NLP), AD helps detect issues like spam, misinformation, and unusual user activity. Although large language models (LLMs) have had a strong impact on tasks such as text generation and summarization, their potential in AD has not been studied enough. This paper introduces AD-LLM, the first benchmark that evaluates how LLMs can help with NLP anomaly detection. We examine three key tasks: (i) zero-shot detection, using LLMs' pre-trained knowledge to perform AD without tasks-specific training; (ii) data augmentation, generating synthetic data and category descriptions to improve AD models; and (iii) model selection, using LLMs to suggest unsupervised AD models. Through experiments with different datasets, we find that LLMs can work well in zero-shot AD, that carefully designed augmentation methods are useful, and that explaining model selection for specific datasets remains challenging. Based on these results, we outline six future research directions on LLMs for AD.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joar Skalse, Alessandro Abate</p>
<p>Abstract: The aim of inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) is to infer an agent's preferences from observing their behaviour. Usually, preferences are modelled as a reward function, $R$, and behaviour is modelled as a policy, $\pi$. One of the central difficulties in IRL is that multiple preferences may lead to the same observed behaviour. That is, $R$ is typically underdetermined by $\pi$, which means that $R$ is only partially identifiable. Recent work has characterised the extent of this partial identifiability for different types of agents, including optimal and Boltzmann-rational agents. However, work so far has only considered agents that discount future reward exponentially: this is a serious limitation, especially given that extensive work in the behavioural sciences suggests that humans are better modelled as discounting hyperbolically. In this work, we newly characterise partial identifiability in IRL for agents with non-exponential discounting: our results are in particular relevant for hyperbolical discounting, but they also more generally apply to agents that use other types of (non-exponential) discounting. We significantly show that generally IRL is unable to infer enough information about $R$ to identify the correct optimal policy, which entails that IRL alone can be insufficient to adequately characterise the preferences of such agents.</p>

<p>Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a critical component of clinical practice, and the state-of-the-art MedSAM model has significantly advanced this field. Nevertheless, critiques highlight that MedSAM demands substantial computational resources during inference. To address this issue, the CVPR 2024 MedSAM on Laptop Challenge was established to find an optimal balance between accuracy and processing speed. In this paper, we introduce a quantization-aware training pipeline designed to efficiently quantize the Segment Anything Model for medical images and deploy it using the OpenVINO inference engine. This pipeline optimizes both training time and disk storage. Our experimental results confirm that this approach considerably enhances processing speed over the baseline, while still achieving an acceptable accuracy level.

We analyze their influence by both observing and modifying the attention scores corresponding to the plausible relations that could impact a pronoun prediction. Our findings reveal that while some heads do attend the relations of interest, not all of them influence the models' ability to disambiguate pronouns. We show that certain heads are underutilized by the models, suggesting that model performance could be improved if only the heads would attend one of the relations more strongly. Furthermore, we fine-tune the most promising heads and observe the increase in pronoun disambiguation accuracy of up to 5 percentage points which demonstrates that the improvements in performance can be solidified into the models' parameters.</p>

<p>Abstract: Stock market forecasting has been a topic of extensive research, aiming to provide investors with optimal stock recommendations for higher returns. In recent years, this field has gained even more attention due to the widespread adoption of deep learning models. While these models have achieved impressive accuracy in predicting stock behavior, tailoring them to specific scenarios has become increasingly important. Election Day represents one such critical scenario, characterized by intensified market volatility, as the winning candidate's policies significantly impact various economic sectors and companies. To address this challenge, we propose the Election Day Stock Market Forecasting (EDSMF) Model. Our approach leverages the contextual capabilities of large language models alongside specialized agents designed to analyze the political and economic consequences of elections. By building on a state-of-the-art architecture, we demonstrate that EDSMF improves the predictive performance of the S&P 500 during this uniquely volatile day.</p>

<p>Abstract: The frequent discovery of security vulnerabilities in both open-source and proprietary software underscores the urgent need for earlier detection during the development lifecycle. Initiatives such as DARPA's Artificial Intelligence Cyber Challenge (AIxCC) aim to accelerate Automated Vulnerability Detection (AVD), seeking to address this challenge by autonomously analyzing source code to identify vulnerabilities.
  This paper addresses two primary research questions: (RQ1) How is current AVD research distributed across its core components? (RQ2) What key areas should future research target to bridge the gap in the practical applicability of AVD throughout software development? To answer these questions, we conduct a systematization over 79 AVD articles and 17 empirical studies, analyzing them across five core components: task formulation and granularity, input programming languages and representations, detection approaches and key solutions, evaluation metrics and datasets, and reported performance.
  Our systematization reveals that the narrow focus of AVD research-mainly on specific tasks and programming languages-limits its practical impact and overlooks broader areas crucial for effective, real-world vulnerability detection. We identify significant challenges, including the need for diversified problem formulations, varied detection granularities, broader language support, better dataset quality, enhanced reproducibility, and increased practical impact. Based on these findings we identify research directions that will enhance the effectiveness and applicability of AVD solutions in software security.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, we are seeing considerable interest in conversational agents with the rise of large language models (LLMs). Although they offer considerable advantages, LLMs also present significant risks, such as hallucination, which hinder their widespread deployment in industry. Moreover, low-resource languages such as African ones are still underrepresented in these systems limiting their performance in these languages. In this paper, we illustrate a more classical approach based on modular architectures of Task-oriented Dialog Systems (ToDS) offering better control over outputs. We propose a chatbot generation engine based on the Rasa framework and a robust methodology for projecting annotations onto the Wolof language using an in-house machine translation system. After evaluating a generated chatbot trained on the Amazon Massive dataset, our Wolof Intent Classifier performs similarly to the one obtained for French, which is a resource-rich language. We also show that this approach is extensible to other low-resource languages, thanks to the intent classifier's language-agnostic pipeline, simplifying the design of chatbots in these languages.</p>

<p>Abstract: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) trains models in a collaborative and privacy-preserving manner while removing model centralization risks and improving communication bottlenecks. However, DFL faces challenges in efficient communication management and model aggregation within decentralized environments, especially with heterogeneous data distributions. Thus, this paper introduces ProFe, a novel communication optimization algorithm for DFL that combines knowledge distillation, prototype learning, and quantization techniques. ProFe utilizes knowledge from large local models to train smaller ones for aggregation, incorporates prototypes to better learn unseen classes, and applies quantization to reduce data transmitted during communication rounds. The performance of ProFe has been validated and compared to the literature by using benchmark datasets like MNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100. Results showed that the proposed algorithm reduces communication costs by up to ~40-50% while maintaining or improving model performance. In addition, it adds ~20% training time due to increased complexity, generating a trade-off.</p>

<p>Abstract: We develop compositional learning algorithms for coupled dynamical systems. While deep learning has proven effective at modeling complex relationships from data, compositional couplings between system components typically introduce algebraic constraints on state variables, posing challenges to many existing data-driven approaches to modeling dynamical systems. Towards developing deep learning models for constrained dynamical systems, we introduce neural port-Hamiltonian differential algebraic equations (N-PHDAEs), which use neural networks to parametrize unknown terms in both the differential and algebraic components of a port-Hamiltonian DAE. To train these models, we propose an algorithm that uses automatic differentiation to perform index reduction, automatically transforming the neural DAE into an equivalent system of neural ordinary differential equations (N-ODEs), for which established model inference and backpropagation methods exist. The proposed compositional modeling framework and learning algorithms may be applied broadly to learn control-oriented models of dynamical systems in a variety of application areas, however, in this work, we focus on their application to the modeling of electrical networks. Experiments simulating the dynamics of nonlinear circuits exemplify the benefits of our approach: the proposed N-PHDAE model achieves an order of magnitude improvement in prediction accuracy and constraint satisfaction when compared to a baseline N-ODE over long prediction time horizons. We also validate the compositional capabilities of our approach through experiments on a simulated D.C. microgrid: we train individual N-PHDAE models for separate grid components, before coupling them to accurately predict the behavior of larger-scale networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jin-Yu Liu, Xian-Ling Mao, Tian-Yi Che, Rong-Cheng Tu</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-modal hashing methods have gained popularity due to their fast speed and low storage requirements. Among them, the supervised methods demonstrate better performance by utilizing labels as supervisory signals compared with unsupervised methods. Currently, for almost all supervised multi-modal hashing methods, there is a hidden assumption that training sets have no noisy labels. However, labels are often annotated incorrectly due to manual labeling in real-world scenarios, which will greatly harm the retrieval performance. To address this issue, we first discover a significant distribution consistency pattern through experiments, i.e., the 1-0 distribution of the presence or absence of each category in the label is consistent with the high-low distribution of similarity scores of the hash codes relative to category centers. Then, inspired by this pattern, we propose a novel Distribution-Consistency-Guided Multi-modal Hashing (DCGMH), which aims to filter and reconstruct noisy labels to enhance retrieval performance. Specifically, the proposed method first randomly initializes several category centers, which are used to compute the high-low distribution of similarity scores; Noisy and clean labels are then separately filtered out via the discovered distribution consistency pattern to mitigate the impact of noisy labels; Subsequently, a correction strategy, which is indirectly designed via the distribution consistency pattern, is applied to the filtered noisy labels, correcting high-confidence ones while treating low-confidence ones as unlabeled for unsupervised learning, thereby further enhancing the model's performance. Extensive experiments on three widely used datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art baselines in multi-modal retrieval tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yulin Wang, Haoji Zhang, Yang Yue, Shiji Song, Chao Deng, Junlan Feng, Gao Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive exploration of the phenomenon of data redundancy in video understanding, with the aim to improve computational efficiency. Our investigation commences with an examination of spatial redundancy, which refers to the observation that the most informative region in each video frame usually corresponds to a small image patch, whose shape, size and location shift smoothly across frames. Motivated by this phenomenon, we formulate the patch localization problem as a dynamic decision task, and introduce a spatially adaptive video recognition approach, termed AdaFocus. In specific, a lightweight encoder is first employed to quickly process the full video sequence, whose features are then utilized by a policy network to identify the most task-relevant regions. Subsequently, the selected patches are inferred by a high-capacity deep network for the final prediction. The full model can be trained in end-to-end conveniently. Furthermore, AdaFocus can be extended by further considering temporal and sample-wise redundancies, i.e., allocating the majority of computation to the most task-relevant frames, and minimizing the computation spent on relatively "easier" videos. Our resulting approach, Uni-AdaFocus, establishes a comprehensive framework that seamlessly integrates spatial, temporal, and sample-wise dynamic computation, while it preserves the merits of AdaFocus in terms of efficient end-to-end training and hardware friendliness. In addition, Uni-AdaFocus is general and flexible as it is compatible with off-the-shelf efficient backbones (e.g., TSM and X3D), which can be readily deployed as our feature extractor, yielding a significantly improved computational efficiency. Empirically, extensive experiments based on seven benchmark datasets and three application scenarios substantiate that Uni-AdaFocus is considerably more efficient than the competitive baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> G\"ozde \"Ozcan, Chengzhi Shi, Stratis Ioannidis</p>
<p>Abstract: Ou et al. (2022) introduce the problem of learning set functions from data generated by a so-called optimal subset oracle. Their approach approximates the underlying utility function with an energy-based model, whose parameters are estimated via mean-field variational inference. Ou et al. (2022) show this reduces to fixed point iterations; however, as the number of iterations increases, automatic differentiation quickly becomes computationally prohibitive due to the size of the Jacobians that are stacked during backpropagation. We address this challenge with implicit differentiation and examine the convergence conditions for the fixed-point iterations. We empirically demonstrate the efficiency of our method on synthetic and real-world subset selection applications including product recommendation, set anomaly detection and compound selection tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lanxiang Hu, Tajana Rosing, Hao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Specializing large language models (LLMs) for local deployment in domain-specific use cases is necessary for strong performance while meeting latency and privacy constraints. However, conventional task-specific adaptation approaches do not show simultaneous memory saving and inference speedup at deployment time. Practical compression techniques like quantization and pruning require dedicated hardware or kernel support to achieve measured inference speedup. We develop TrimLLM based on the layer-wise specialization phenomenon we empirically observed and verified on contemporary LLMs. TrimLLM reduces the depth of LLMs via progressive layer dropping. We show it retains LLMs' capacity in specific domains and achieves inference speedup irrespective of hardware and deep learning frameworks. We evaluated TrimLLM on LLMs of various sizes for inference; models adapted on medical, legal, and financial datasets all demonstrate $2.1-5.7\times$ inference speedup on consumer GPUs and up to $3.1\times$ speedup on A100 when compared to state-of-the-art model compression algorithms, with no loss in accuracy at 50$\sim$60\% model compression ratio.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marzieh Mirzaeibonehkhater, Mohammad Ali Labbaf-Khaniki, Mohammad Manthouri</p>
<p>Abstract: Bearing fault detection is a critical task in predictive maintenance, where accurate and timely fault identification can prevent costly downtime and equipment damage. Traditional attention mechanisms in Transformer neural networks often struggle to capture the complex temporal patterns in bearing vibration data, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this limitation, we propose a novel attention mechanism, Temporal Decomposition Attention (TDA), which combines temporal bias encoding with seasonal-trend decomposition to capture both long-term dependencies and periodic fluctuations in time series data. Additionally, we incorporate the Hull Exponential Moving Average (HEMA) for feature extraction, enabling the model to effectively capture meaningful characteristics from the data while reducing noise. Our approach integrates TDA into the Transformer architecture, allowing the model to focus separately on the trend and seasonal components of the data. Experimental results on the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) bearing fault detection dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional attention mechanisms and achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and interpretability. The HEMA-Transformer-TDA model achieves an accuracy of 98.1%, with exceptional precision, recall, and F1-scores, demonstrating its effectiveness in bearing fault detection and its potential for application in other time series tasks with seasonal patterns or trends.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sayantan Pal, Souvik Das, Rohini K. Srihari</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly improved personalized conversational capabilities. However, existing datasets like Persona Chat, Synthetic Persona Chat, and Blended Skill Talk rely on static, predefined personas. This approach often results in dialogues that fail to capture human personalities' fluid and evolving nature. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel dataset with around 400,000 dialogues and a framework for generating personalized conversations using long-form journal entries from Reddit. Our approach clusters journal entries for each author and filters them by selecting the most representative cluster, ensuring that the retained entries best reflect the author's personality. We further refine the data by capturing the Big Five personality traits --openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism --ensuring that dialogues authentically reflect an individual's personality. Using Llama 3 70B, we generate high-quality, personality-rich dialogues grounded in these journal entries. Fine-tuning models on this dataset leads to an 11% improvement in capturing personality traits on average, outperforming existing approaches in generating more coherent and personality-driven dialogues.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guan Wang, Haoyi Niu, Jianxiong Li, Li Jiang, Jianming Hu, Xianyuan Zhan</p>
<p>Abstract: Among various branches of offline reinforcement learning (RL) methods, goal-conditioned supervised learning (GCSL) has gained increasing popularity as it formulates the offline RL problem as a sequential modeling task, therefore bypassing the notoriously difficult credit assignment challenge of value learning in conventional RL paradigm. Sequential modeling, however, requires capturing accurate dynamics across long horizons in trajectory data to ensure reasonable policy performance. To meet this requirement, leveraging large, expressive models has become a popular choice in recent literature, which, however, comes at the cost of significantly increased computation and inference latency. Contradictory yet promising, we reveal that lightweight models as simple as shallow 2-layer MLPs, can also enjoy accurate dynamics consistency and significantly reduced sequential modeling errors against large expressive models by adopting a simple recursive planning scheme: recursively planning coarse-grained future sub-goals based on current and target information, and then executes the action with a goal-conditioned policy learned from data rela-beled with these sub-goal ground truths. We term our method Recursive Skip-Step Planning (RSP). Simple yet effective, RSP enjoys great efficiency improvements thanks to its lightweight structure, and substantially outperforms existing methods, reaching new SOTA performances on the D4RL benchmark, especially in multi-stage long-horizon tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Danielle R. Thomas, Conrad Borchers, Sanjit Kakarla, Jionghao Lin, Shambhavi Bhushan, Boyuan Guo, Erin Gatz, Kenneth R. Koedinger</p>
<p>Abstract: Equity is a core concern of learning analytics. However, applications that teach and assess equity skills, particularly at scale are lacking, often due to barriers in evaluating language. Advances in generative AI via large language models (LLMs) are being used in a wide range of applications, with this present work assessing its use in the equity domain. We evaluate tutor performance within an online lesson on enhancing tutors' skills when responding to students in potentially inequitable situations. We apply a mixed-method approach to analyze the performance of 81 undergraduate remote tutors. We find marginally significant learning gains with increases in tutors' self-reported confidence in their knowledge in responding to middle school students experiencing possible inequities from pretest to posttest. Both GPT-4o and GPT-4-turbo demonstrate proficiency in assessing tutors ability to predict and explain the best approach. Balancing performance, efficiency, and cost, we determine that few-shot learning using GPT-4o is the preferred model. This work makes available a dataset of lesson log data, tutor responses, rubrics for human annotation, and generative AI prompts. Future work involves leveling the difficulty among scenarios and enhancing LLM prompts for large-scale grading and assessment.</p>

<p>Abstract: Estimating physical properties for visual data is a crucial task in computer vision, graphics, and robotics, underpinning applications such as augmented reality, physical simulation, and robotic grasping. However, this area remains under-explored due to the inherent ambiguities in physical property estimation. To address these challenges, we introduce GaussianProperty, a training-free framework that assigns physical properties of materials to 3D Gaussians. Specifically, we integrate the segmentation capability of SAM with the recognition capability of GPT-4V(ision) to formulate a global-local physical property reasoning module for 2D images. Then we project the physical properties from multi-view 2D images to 3D Gaussians using a voting strategy. We demonstrate that 3D Gaussians with physical property annotations enable applications in physics-based dynamic simulation and robotic grasping. For physics-based dynamic simulation, we leverage the Material Point Method (MPM) for realistic dynamic simulation. For robot grasping, we develop a grasping force prediction strategy that estimates a safe force range required for object grasping based on the estimated physical properties. Extensive experiments on material segmentation, physics-based dynamic simulation, and robotic grasping validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, highlighting its crucial role in understanding physical properties from visual data.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kurando IIDA, Kenjiro MIMURA</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces the Comprehensive AI-assisted Translation Edit Ratio (CATER), a novel and fully prompt-driven framework for evaluating machine translation (MT) quality. Leveraging large language models (LLMs) via a carefully designed prompt-based protocol, CATER expands beyond traditional reference-bound metrics, offering a multidimensional, reference-independent evaluation that addresses linguistic accuracy, semantic fidelity, contextual coherence, stylistic appropriateness, and information completeness. CATER's unique advantage lies in its immediate implementability: by providing the source and target texts along with a standardized prompt, an LLM can rapidly identify errors, quantify edit effort, and produce category-level and overall scores. This approach eliminates the need for pre-computed references or domain-specific resources, enabling instant adaptation to diverse languages, genres, and user priorities through adjustable weights and prompt modifications. CATER's LLM-enabled strategy supports more nuanced assessments, capturing phenomena such as subtle omissions, hallucinations, and discourse-level shifts that increasingly challenge contemporary MT systems. By uniting the conceptual rigor of frameworks like MQM and DQF with the scalability and flexibility of LLM-based evaluation, CATER emerges as a valuable tool for researchers, developers, and professional translators worldwide. The framework and example prompts are openly available, encouraging community-driven refinement and further empirical validation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Salar Abbaspourazad, Anshuman Mishra, Joseph Futoma, Andrew C. Miller, Ian Shapiro</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern wearable devices can conveniently and continuously record various biosignals in the many different environments of daily living, ultimately enabling a rich view of individual health. However, not all biosignals are the same: high-fidelity measurements, such as photoplethysmography (PPG), contain more physiological information, but require optical sensors with a high power footprint. In a resource-constrained setting, such biosignals may be unavailable. Alternatively, a lower-fidelity biosignal, such as accelerometry that captures minute cardiovascular information during low-motion periods, has a significantly smaller power footprint and is available in almost any wearable device. Here, we demonstrate that we can distill representational knowledge across biosignals, i.e., from PPG to accelerometry, using 20 million minutes of unlabeled data, collected from ~172K participants in the Apple Heart and Movement Study under informed consent. We first pre-train PPG encoders via self-supervised learning, and then distill their representational knowledge to accelerometry encoders. We demonstrate strong cross-modal alignment on unseen data, e.g., 99.2% top-1 accuracy for retrieving PPG embeddings from accelerometry embeddings. We show that distilled accelerometry encoders have significantly more informative representations compared to self-supervised or supervised encoders trained directly on accelerometry data, observed by at least 23%-49% improved performance for predicting heart rate and heart rate variability. We also show that distilled accelerometry encoders are readily predictive of a wide array of downstream health targets, i.e., they are generalist foundation models. We believe accelerometry foundation models for health may unlock new opportunities for developing digital biomarkers from any wearable device, and help individuals track their health more frequently and conveniently.</p>

<p>Abstract: Spanning multiple scales-from macroscopic anatomy down to intricate microscopic architecture-the human brain exemplifies a complex system that demands integrated approaches to fully understand its complexity. Yet, mapping nonlinear relationships between these scales remains challenging due to technical limitations and the high cost of multimodal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) acquisition. Here, we introduce Macro2Micro, a deep learning framework that predicts brain microstructure from macrostructure using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). Grounded in the scale-free, self-similar nature of brain organization-where microscale information can be inferred from macroscale patterns-Macro2Micro explicitly encodes multiscale brain representations into distinct processing branches. To further enhance image fidelity and suppress artifacts, we propose a simple yet effective auxiliary discriminator and learning objective. Our results show that Macro2Micro faithfully translates T1-weighted MRIs into corresponding Fractional Anisotropy (FA) images, achieving a 6.8% improvement in the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) compared to previous methods, while preserving the individual neurobiological characteristics.</p>

<p>Abstract: Video face swapping is becoming increasingly popular across various applications, yet existing methods primarily focus on static images and struggle with video face swapping because of temporal consistency and complex scenarios. In this paper, we present the first diffusion-based framework specifically designed for video face swapping. Our approach introduces a novel image-video hybrid training framework that leverages both abundant static image data and temporal video sequences, addressing the inherent limitations of video-only training. The framework incorporates a specially designed diffusion model coupled with a VidFaceVAE that effectively processes both types of data to better maintain temporal coherence of the generated videos. To further disentangle identity and pose features, we construct the Attribute-Identity Disentanglement Triplet (AIDT) Dataset, where each triplet has three face images, with two images sharing the same pose and two sharing the same identity. Enhanced with a comprehensive occlusion augmentation, this dataset also improves robustness against occlusions. Additionally, we integrate 3D reconstruction techniques as input conditioning to our network for handling large pose variations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves superior performance in identity preservation, temporal consistency, and visual quality compared to existing methods, while requiring fewer inference steps. Our approach effectively mitigates key challenges in video face swapping, including temporal flickering, identity preservation, and robustness to occlusions and pose variations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Wearable sensors offer a non-invasive way to collect physical activity (PA) data, with walking as a key component. Existing models often struggle to detect gait bouts in individuals with neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) involving involuntary movements. We developed J-Net, a deep learning model inspired by U-Net, which uses a pre-trained self-supervised foundation model fine-tuned with Huntington`s disease (HD) in-lab data and paired with a segmentation head for gait detection. J-Net processes wrist-worn accelerometer data to detect gait during daily living. We evaluated J-Net on in-lab and daily-living data from HD, Parkinson`s disease (PD), and controls. J-Net achieved a 10-percentage point improvement in ROC-AUC for HD over existing methods, reaching 0.97 for in-lab data. In daily-living environments, J-Net estimates showed no significant differences in median daily walking time between HD and controls (p = 0.23), in contrast to other models, which indicated counterintuitive results (p < 0.005). Walking time measured by J-Net correlated with the UHDRS-TMS clinical severity score (r=-0.52; p=0.02), confirming its clinical relevance. Fine-tuning J-Net on PD data also improved gait detection over current methods. J-Net`s architecture effectively addresses the challenges of gait detection in severe chorea and offers robust performance in daily living. The dataset and J-Net model are publicly available, providing a resource for further research into NDD-related gait impairments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ashish Parmanand Pandey, Alan John Varghese, Sarang Patil, Mengjia Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Dynamic graph embedding has emerged as an important technique for modeling complex time-evolving networks across diverse domains. While transformer-based models have shown promise in capturing long-range dependencies in temporal graph data, they face scalability challenges due to quadratic computational complexity. This study presents a comparative analysis of dynamic graph embedding approaches using transformers and the recently proposed Mamba architecture, a state-space model with linear complexity. We introduce three novel models: TransformerG2G augment with graph convolutional networks, DG-Mamba, and GDG-Mamba with graph isomorphism network edge convolutions. Our experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that Mamba-based models achieve comparable or superior performance to transformer-based approaches in link prediction tasks while offering significant computational efficiency gains on longer sequences. Notably, DG-Mamba variants consistently outperform transformer-based models on datasets with high temporal variability, such as UCI, Bitcoin, and Reality Mining, while maintaining competitive performance on more stable graphs like SBM. We provide insights into the learned temporal dependencies through analysis of attention weights and state matrices, revealing the models' ability to capture complex temporal patterns. By effectively combining state-space models with graph neural networks, our work addresses key limitations of previous approaches and contributes to the growing body of research on efficient temporal graph representation learning. These findings offer promising directions for scaling dynamic graph embedding to larger, more complex real-world networks, potentially enabling new applications in areas such as social network analysis, financial modeling, and biological system dynamics.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the increased popularity of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), increases also the need for tools to assist developers in the DNN implementation, testing and debugging process. Several approaches have been proposed that automatically analyse and localise potential faults in DNNs under test. In this work, we evaluate and compare existing state-of-the-art fault localisation techniques, which operate based on both dynamic and static analysis of the DNN. The evaluation is performed on a benchmark consisting of both real faults obtained from bug reporting platforms and faulty models produced by a mutation tool. Our findings indicate that the usage of a single, specific ground truth (e.g., the human defined one) for the evaluation of DNN fault localisation tools results in pretty low performance (maximum average recall of 0.31 and precision of 0.23). However, such figures increase when considering alternative, equivalent patches that exist for a given faulty DNN. Results indicate that \dfd is the most effective tool, achieving an average recall of 0.61 and precision of 0.41 on our benchmark.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generic sentences express generalisations about the world without explicit quantification. Although generics are central to everyday communication, building a precise semantic framework has proven difficult, in part because speakers use generics to generalise properties with widely different statistical prevalence. In this work, we study the implicit quantification and context-sensitivity of generics by leveraging language models as models of language. We create ConGen, a dataset of 2873 naturally occurring generic and quantified sentences in context, and define p-acceptability, a metric based on surprisal that is sensitive to quantification. Our experiments show generics are more context-sensitive than determiner quantifiers and about 20% of naturally occurring generics we analyze express weak generalisations. We also explore how human biases in stereotypes can be observed in language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaochen Zhu, Georgi Karadzhov, Chenxi Whitehouse, Andreas Vlachos</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have shown promise in text generation but often struggle with generating long, coherent, and contextually accurate text. Token-level diffusion overlooks word-order dependencies and enforces short output windows, while passage-level diffusion struggles with learning robust representation for long-form text. To address these challenges, we propose Segment-Level Diffusion (SLD), a framework that enhances diffusion-based text generation through text segmentation, robust representation training with adversarial and contrastive learning, and improved latent-space guidance. By segmenting long-form outputs into separate latent representations and decoding them with an autoregressive decoder, SLD simplifies diffusion predictions and improves scalability. Experiments on XSum, ROCStories, DialogSum, and DeliData demonstrate that SLD achieves competitive or superior performance in fluency, coherence, and contextual compatibility across automatic and human evaluation metrics comparing with other diffusion and autoregressive baselines. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our segmentation and representation learning strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Naoki Wake, Atsushi Kanehira, Daichi Saito, Jun Takamatsu, Kazuhiro Sasabuchi, Hideki Koike, Katsushi Ikeuchi</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-step dexterous manipulation is a fundamental skill in household scenarios, yet remains an underexplored area in robotics. This paper proposes a modular approach, where each step of the manipulation process is addressed with dedicated policies based on effective modality input, rather than relying on a single end-to-end model. To demonstrate this, a dexterous robotic hand performs a manipulation task involving picking up and rotating a box. Guided by insights from neuroscience, the task is decomposed into three sub-skills, 1)reaching, 2)grasping and lifting, and 3)in-hand rotation, based on the dominant sensory modalities employed in the human brain. Each sub-skill is addressed using distinct methods from a practical perspective: a classical controller, a Vision-Language-Action model, and a reinforcement learning policy with force feedback, respectively. We tested the pipeline on a real robot to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach. The key contribution of this study lies in presenting a neuroscience-inspired, modality-driven methodology for multi-step dexterous manipulation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Melanie McGrath, Harrison Bailey, Necva B\"ol\"uc\"u, Xiang Dai, Sarvnaz Karimi, Cecile Paris</p>
<p>Abstract: Information extraction from the scientific literature is one of the main techniques to transform unstructured knowledge hidden in the text into structured data which can then be used for decision-making in down-stream tasks. One such area is Trust in AI, where factors contributing to human trust in artificial intelligence applications are studied. The relationships of these factors with human trust in such applications are complex. We hence explore this space from the lens of information extraction where, with the input of domain experts, we carefully design annotation guidelines, create the first annotated English dataset in this domain, investigate an LLM-guided annotation, and benchmark it with state-of-the-art methods using large language models in named entity and relation extraction. Our results indicate that this problem requires supervised learning which may not be currently feasible with prompt-based LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuqing Li, Jinglei Cheng, Xulong Tang, Youtao Zhang, Frederic T. Chong, Junyu Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantum machine learning is considered one of the flagship applications of quantum computers, where variational quantum circuits could be the leading paradigm both in the near-term quantum devices and the early fault-tolerant quantum computers. However, it is not clear how to identify the regime of quantum advantages from these circuits, and there is no explicit theory to guide the practical design of variational ansatze to achieve better performance. We address these challenges with the stabilizer bootstrap, a method that uses stabilizer-based techniques to optimize quantum neural networks before their quantum execution, together with theoretical proofs and high-performance computing with 10000 qubits or random datasets up to 1000 data. We find that, in a general setup of variational ansatze, the possibility of improvements from the stabilizer bootstrap depends on the structure of the observables and the size of the datasets. The results reveal that configurations exhibit two distinct behaviors: some maintain a constant probability of circuit improvement, while others show an exponential decay in improvement probability as qubit numbers increase. These patterns are termed strong stabilizer enhancement and weak stabilizer enhancement, respectively, with most situations falling in between. Our work seamlessly bridges techniques from fault-tolerant quantum computing with applications of variational quantum algorithms. Not only does it offer practical insights for designing variational circuits tailored to large-scale machine learning challenges, but it also maps out a clear trajectory for defining the boundaries of feasible and practical quantum advantages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ehsan Asali, Prashant Doshi</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a novel method for collaborative robots (cobots) to learn manipulation tasks and perform them in a human-like manner. Our method falls under the learn-from-observation (LfO) paradigm, where robots learn to perform tasks by observing human actions, which facilitates quicker integration into industrial settings compared to programming from scratch. We introduce Visual IRL that uses the RGB-D keypoints in each frame of the observed human task performance directly as state features, which are input to inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). The inversely learned reward function, which maps keypoints to reward values, is transferred from the human to the cobot using a novel neuro-symbolic dynamics model, which maps human kinematics to the cobot arm. This model allows similar end-effector positioning while minimizing joint adjustments, aiming to preserve the natural dynamics of human motion in robotic manipulation. In contrast with previous techniques that focus on end-effector placement only, our method maps multiple joint angles of the human arm to the corresponding cobot joints. Moreover, it uses an inverse kinematics model to then minimally adjust the joint angles, for accurate end-effector positioning. We evaluate the performance of this approach on two different realistic manipulation tasks. The first task is produce processing, which involves picking, inspecting, and placing onions based on whether they are blemished. The second task is liquid pouring, where the robot picks up bottles, pours the contents into designated containers, and disposes of the empty bottles. Our results demonstrate advances in human-like robotic manipulation, leading to more human-robot compatibility in manufacturing applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiannan Huang, Yixin Chen, Quan Yuan, Chao Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Predicting future bus trip chains for an existing user is of great significance for operators of public transit systems. Existing methods always treat this task as a time-series prediction problem, but the 1-dimensional time series structure cannot express the complex relationship between trips. To better capture the inherent patterns in bus travel behavior, this paper proposes a novel approach that synthesizes future bus trip chains based on those from similar days. Key similarity patterns are defined and tested using real-world data, and a similarity function is then developed to capture these patterns. Afterwards, a graph is constructed where each day is represented as a node and edge weight reflects the similarity between days. Besides, the trips on a given day can be regarded as labels for each node, transferring the bus trip chain prediction problem to a semi-supervised classification problem on a graph. To address this, we propose several methods and validate them on a real-world dataset of 10000 bus users, achieving state-of-the-art prediction results. Analyzing the parameters of similarity function reveals some interesting bus usage patterns, allowing us can to cluster bus users into three types: repeat-dominated, evolve-dominate and repeat-evolve balanced. In summary, our work demonstrates the effectiveness of similarity-based prediction for bus trip chains and provides a new perspective for analyzing individual bus travel patterns. The code for our prediction model is publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shijia Zhou, Euijoon Ahn, Hao Wang, Ann Quinton, Narelle Kennedy, Pradeeba Sridar, Ralph Nanan, Jinman Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: The measurement of fetal thalamus diameter (FTD) and fetal head circumference (FHC) are crucial in identifying abnormal fetal thalamus development as it may lead to certain neuropsychiatric disorders in later life. However, manual measurements from 2D-US images are laborious, prone to high inter-observer variability, and complicated by the high signal-to-noise ratio nature of the images. Deep learning-based landmark detection approaches have shown promise in measuring biometrics from US images, but the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithm, BiometryNet, is inadequate for FTD and FHC measurement due to its inability to account for the fuzzy edges of these structures and the complex shape of the FTD structure. To address these inadequacies, we propose a novel Swoosh Activation Function (SAF) designed to enhance the regularization of heatmaps produced by landmark detection algorithms. Our SAF serves as a regularization term to enforce an optimum mean squared error (MSE) level between predicted heatmaps, reducing the dispersiveness of hotspots in predicted heatmaps. Our experimental results demonstrate that SAF significantly improves the measurement performances of FTD and FHC with higher intraclass correlation coefficient scores in FTD and lower mean difference scores in FHC measurement than those of the current SOTA algorithm BiometryNet. Moreover, our proposed SAF is highly generalizable and architecture-agnostic. The SAF's coefficients can be configured for different tasks, making it highly customizable. Our study demonstrates that the SAF activation function is a novel method that can improve measurement accuracy in fetal biometry landmark detection. This improvement has the potential to contribute to better fetal monitoring and improved neonatal outcomes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anika Tabassum, Amirkoushyar Ziabari</p>
<p>Abstract: Industrial X-ray computed tomography (XCT) is a powerful tool for non-destructive characterization of materials and manufactured components. XCT commonly accompanied by advanced image analysis and computer vision algorithms to extract relevant information from the images. Traditional computer vision models often struggle due to noise, resolution variability, and complex internal structures, particularly in scientific imaging applications. State-of-the-art foundational models, like the Segment Anything Model (SAM)-designed for general-purpose image segmentation-have revolutionized image segmentation across various domains, yet their application in specialized fields like materials science remains under-explored. In this work, we explore the application and limitations of SAM for industrial X-ray CT inspection of additive manufacturing components. We demonstrate that while SAM shows promise, it struggles with out-of-distribution data, multiclass segmentation, and computational efficiency during fine-tuning. To address these issues, we propose a fine-tuning strategy utilizing parameter-efficient techniques, specifically Conv-LoRa, to adapt SAM for material-specific datasets. Additionally, we leverage generative adversarial network (GAN)-generated data to enhance the training process and improve the model's segmentation performance on complex X-ray CT data. Our experimental results highlight the importance of tailored segmentation models for accurate inspection, showing that fine-tuning SAM on domain-specific scientific imaging data significantly improves performance. However, despite improvements, the model's ability to generalize across diverse datasets remains limited, highlighting the need for further research into robust, scalable solutions for domain-specific segmentation tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tom S. Juzek, Zina B. Ward</p>
<p>Abstract: Scientific English is currently undergoing rapid change, with words like "delve," "intricate," and "underscore" appearing far more frequently than just a few years ago. It is widely assumed that scientists' use of large language models (LLMs) is responsible for such trends. We develop a formal, transferable method to characterize these linguistic changes. Application of our method yields 21 focal words whose increased occurrence in scientific abstracts is likely the result of LLM usage. We then pose "the puzzle of lexical overrepresentation": WHY are such words overused by LLMs? We fail to find evidence that lexical overrepresentation is caused by model architecture, algorithm choices, or training data. To assess whether reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) contributes to the overuse of focal words, we undertake comparative model testing and conduct an exploratory online study. While the model testing is consistent with RLHF playing a role, our experimental results suggest that participants may be reacting differently to "delve" than to other focal words. With LLMs quickly becoming a driver of global language change, investigating these potential sources of lexical overrepresentation is important. We note that while insights into the workings of LLMs are within reach, a lack of transparency surrounding model development remains an obstacle to such research.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming the robotics domain by enabling robots to comprehend and execute natural language instructions. The cornerstone benefits of LLM include processing textual data from technical manuals, instructions, academic papers, and user queries based on the knowledge provided. However, deploying LLM-generated code in robotic systems without safety verification poses significant risks. This paper outlines a safety layer that verifies the code generated by ChatGPT before executing it to control a drone in a simulated environment. The safety layer consists of a fine-tuned GPT-4o model using Few-Shot learning, supported by knowledge graph prompting (KGP). Our approach improves the safety and compliance of robotic actions, ensuring that they adhere to the regulations of drone operations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiang Ding, Lvzhou Luo, Yixuan Cao, Ping Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: To assist humans in efficiently validating RAG-generated content, developing a fine-grained attribution mechanism that provides supporting evidence from retrieved documents for every answer span is essential. Existing fine-grained attribution methods rely on model-internal similarity metrics between responses and documents, such as saliency scores and hidden state similarity. However, these approaches suffer from either high computational complexity or coarse-grained representations. Additionally, a common problem shared by the previous works is their reliance on decoder-only Transformers, limiting their ability to incorporate contextual information after the target span. To address the above problems, we propose two techniques applicable to all model-internals-based methods. First, we aggregate token-wise evidence through set union operations, preserving the granularity of representations. Second, we enhance the attributor by integrating dependency parsing to enrich the semantic completeness of target spans. For practical implementation, our approach employs attention weights as the similarity metric. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms all prior works.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Federated Domain Generalization with Label Smoothing and Balanced Decentralized Training (FedSB), to address the challenges of data heterogeneity within a federated learning framework. FedSB utilizes label smoothing at the client level to prevent overfitting to domain-specific features, thereby enhancing generalization capabilities across diverse domains when aggregating local models into a global model. Additionally, FedSB incorporates a decentralized budgeting mechanism which balances training among clients, which is shown to improve the performance of the aggregated global model. Extensive experiments on four commonly used multi-domain datasets, PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, and TerraInc, demonstrate that FedSB outperforms competing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results on three out of four datasets, indicating the effectiveness of FedSB in addressing data heterogeneity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Liu, Shuwei He, Yifan Hu, Haizhou Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual Text-to-Speech (VTTS) aims to take the environmental image as the prompt to synthesize the reverberant speech for the spoken content. The challenge of this task lies in understanding the spatial environment from the image. Many attempts have been made to extract global spatial visual information from the RGB space of an spatial image. However, local and depth image information are crucial for understanding the spatial environment, which previous works have ignored. To address the issues, we propose a novel multi-modal and multi-scale spatial environment understanding scheme to achieve immersive VTTS, termed M2SE-VTTS. The multi-modal aims to take both the RGB and Depth spaces of the spatial image to learn more comprehensive spatial information, and the multi-scale seeks to model the local and global spatial knowledge simultaneously. Specifically, we first split the RGB and Depth images into patches and adopt the Gemini-generated environment captions to guide the local spatial understanding. After that, the multi-modal and multi-scale features are integrated by the local-aware global spatial understanding. In this way, M2SE-VTTS effectively models the interactions between local and global spatial contexts in the multi-modal spatial environment. Objective and subjective evaluations suggest that our model outperforms the advanced baselines in environmental speech generation.

This paper examines the current state of AI for scientific discovery, highlighting recent progress in large language models and other AI techniques applied to scientific tasks. We then outline key challenges and promising research directions toward developing more comprehensive AI systems for scientific discovery, including the need for science-focused AI agents, improved benchmarks and evaluation metrics, multimodal scientific representations, and unified frameworks combining reasoning, theorem proving, and data-driven modeling. Addressing these challenges could lead to transformative AI tools to accelerate progress across disciplines towards scientific discovery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alberto Chiappa, Briti Gangopadhyay, Zhao Wang, Shingo Takamatsu</p>
<p>Abstract: Online advertising has become one of the most successful business models of the internet era. Impression opportunities are typically allocated through real-time auctions, where advertisers bid to secure advertisement slots. Deciding the best bid for an impression opportunity is challenging, due to the stochastic nature of user behavior and the variability of advertisement traffic over time. In this work, we propose a framework for training auto-bidding agents in multi-slot second-price auctions to maximize acquisitions (e.g., clicks, conversions) while adhering to budget and cost-per-acquisition (CPA) constraints. We exploit the insight that, after an advertisement campaign concludes, determining the optimal bids for each impression opportunity can be framed as a multiple-choice knapsack problem (MCKP) with a nonlinear objective. We propose an "oracle" algorithm that identifies a near-optimal combination of impression opportunities and advertisement slots, considering both past and future advertisement traffic data. This oracle solution serves as a training target for a student network which bids having access only to real-time information, a method we term Oracle Imitation Learning (OIL). Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate that OIL achieves superior performance compared to both online and offline reinforcement learning algorithms, offering improved sample efficiency. Notably, OIL shifts the complexity of training auto-bidding agents from crafting sophisticated learning algorithms to solving a nonlinear constrained optimization problem efficiently.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuanfan Zheng, Jinlin Wu, Wuyang Li, Zhen Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain Adaptive Object Detection (DAOD) transfers knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unannotated target domain under closed-set assumption. Universal DAOD (UniDAOD) extends DAOD to handle open-set, partial-set, and closed-set domain adaptation. In this paper, we first unveil two issues: domain-private category alignment is crucial for global-level features, and the domain probability heterogeneity of features across different levels. To address these issues, we propose a novel Dual Probabilistic Alignment (DPA) framework to model domain probability as Gaussian distribution, enabling the heterogeneity domain distribution sampling and measurement. The DPA consists of three tailored modules: the Global-level Domain Private Alignment (GDPA), the Instance-level Domain Shared Alignment (IDSA), and the Private Class Constraint (PCC). GDPA utilizes the global-level sampling to mine domain-private category samples and calculate alignment weight through a cumulative distribution function to address the global-level private category alignment. IDSA utilizes instance-level sampling to mine domain-shared category samples and calculates alignment weight through Gaussian distribution to conduct the domain-shared category domain alignment to address the feature heterogeneity. The PCC aggregates domain-private category centroids between feature and probability spaces to mitigate negative transfer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our DPA outperforms state-of-the-art UniDAOD and DAOD methods across various datasets and scenarios, including open, partial, and closed sets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gangqiang Hu, Jianfeng Lu, Jianmin Han, Shuqin Cao, Jing Liu, Hao Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to the sensitivity of data, federated learning (FL) is employed to enable distributed machine learning while safeguarding data privacy and accommodating the requirements of various devices. However, in the context of semi-decentralized federated learning (SD-FL), clients' communication and training states are dynamic. This variability arises from local training fluctuations, heterogeneous data distributions, and intermittent client participation. Most existing studies primarily focus on stable client states, neglecting the dynamic challenges present in real-world scenarios. To tackle this issue, we propose a trust-aware client scheduling mechanism (TRAIL) that assesses client states and contributions, enhancing model training efficiency through selective client participation. Our focus is on a semi-decentralized federated learning framework where edge servers and clients train a shared global model using unreliable intra-cluster model aggregation and inter-cluster model consensus. First, we develop an adaptive hidden semi-Markov model (AHSMM) to estimate clients' communication states and contributions. Next, we address a client-server association optimization problem to minimize global training loss. Using convergence analysis, we propose a greedy client scheduling algorithm. Finally, our experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate that TRAIL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an improvement of 8.7\% in test accuracy and a reduction of 15.3\% in training loss.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose WHISPER-GPT: A generative large language model (LLM) for speech and music that allows us to work with continuous audio representations and discrete tokens simultaneously as part of a single architecture. There has been a huge surge in generative audio, speech, and music models that utilize discrete audio tokens derived from neural compression algorithms, e.g. ENCODEC. However, one of the major drawbacks of this approach is handling the context length. It blows up for high-fidelity generative architecture if one has to account for all the audio contents at various frequencies for the next token prediction. By combining continuous audio representation like the spectrogram and discrete acoustic tokens, we retain the best of both worlds: Have all the information needed from the audio at a specific time instance in a single token, yet allow LLM to predict the future token to allow for sampling and other benefits discrete space provides. We show how our architecture improves the perplexity and negative log-likelihood scores for the next token prediction compared to a token-based LLM for speech and music.</p>

<p>Abstract: As multimodal large language models (MLLMs) gain prominence in the medical field, the need for precise evaluation methods to assess their effectiveness has become critical. While benchmarks provide a reliable means to evaluate the capabilities of MLLMs, traditional metrics like ROUGE and BLEU employed for open domain evaluation only focus on token overlap and may not align with human judgment. Although human evaluation is more reliable, it is labor-intensive, costly, and not scalable. LLM-based evaluation methods have proven promising, but to date, there is still an urgent need for open-source multimodal LLM-based evaluators in the medical field. To address this issue, we introduce ACE-$M^3$, an open-sourced \textbf{A}utomatic \textbf{C}apability \textbf{E}valuator for \textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{M}edical \textbf{M}odels specifically designed to assess the question answering abilities of medical MLLMs. It first utilizes a branch-merge architecture to provide both detailed analysis and a concise final score based on standard medical evaluation criteria. Subsequently, a reward token-based direct preference optimization (RTDPO) strategy is incorporated to save training time without compromising performance of our model. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of our ACE-$M^3$ model\footnote{\url{https://huggingface.co/collections/AIUSRTMP/ace-m3-67593297ff391b93e3e5d068}} in evaluating the capabilities of medical MLLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zaifu Zhan, Rui Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: To efficiently select optimal dataset combinations for enhancing multi-task learning (MTL) performance in large language models, we proposed a novel framework that leverages a neural network to predict the best dataset combinations. The framework iteratively refines the selection, greatly improving efficiency, while being model-, dataset-, and domain-independent. Through experiments on 12 biomedical datasets across four tasks - named entity recognition, relation extraction, event extraction, and text classification-we demonstrate that our approach effectively identifies better combinations, even for tasks that may seem unpromising from a human perspective. This verifies that our framework provides a promising solution for maximizing MTL potential.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Dai, Kai Hwang, Jicong Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) plays an important role in modern data analytics and it is crucial to provide simple yet effective and guaranteed UAD algorithms for real applications. In this paper, we present a novel UAD method for tabular data by evaluating how much noise is in the data. Specifically, we propose to learn a deep neural network from the clean (normal) training dataset and a noisy dataset, where the latter is generated by adding highly diverse noises to the clean data. The neural network can learn a reliable decision boundary between normal data and anomalous data when the diversity of the generated noisy data is sufficiently high so that the hard abnormal samples lie in the noisy region. Importantly, we provide theoretical guarantees, proving that the proposed method can detect anomalous data successfully, although the method does not utilize any real anomalous data in the training stage. Extensive experiments through more than 60 benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison to 12 baselines of UAD. Our method obtains a 92.27\% AUC score and a 1.68 ranking score on average. Moreover, compared to the state-of-the-art UAD methods, our method is easier to implement.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minjun Kim, Minjee Kim, Jinhoon Jeong</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative models trained on multi-institutional datasets can provide an enriched understanding through diverse data distributions. However, training the models on medical images is often challenging due to hospitals' reluctance to share data for privacy reasons. Federated learning(FL) has emerged as a privacy-preserving solution for training distributed datasets across data centers by aggregating model weights from multiple clients instead of sharing raw data. Previous research has explored the adaptation of FL to generative models, yet effective aggregation algorithms specifically tailored for generative models remain unexplored. We hereby propose a novel algorithm aimed at improving the performance of generative models within FL. Our approach adaptively re-weights the contribution of each client, resulting in well-trained shared parameters. In each round, the server side measures the distribution distance between fake images generated by clients instead of directly comparing the Fr\'echet Inception Distance per client, thereby enhancing efficiency of the learning. Experimental results on three public chest X-ray datasets show superior performance in medical image generation, outperforming both centralized learning and conventional FL algorithms.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siyuan Liang, Jiajun Gong, Tianmeng Fang, Aishan Liu, Tao Wang, Xianglong Liu, Xiaochun Cao, Dacheng Tao, Chang Ee-Chien</p>
<p>Abstract: Website fingerprint (WF) attacks, which covertly monitor user communications to identify the web pages they visit, pose a serious threat to user privacy. Existing WF defenses attempt to reduce the attacker's accuracy by disrupting unique traffic patterns; however, they often suffer from the trade-off between overhead and effectiveness, resulting in less usefulness in practice. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Controllable Website Fingerprint Defense (CWFD), a novel defense perspective based on backdoor learning. CWFD exploits backdoor vulnerabilities in neural networks to directly control the attacker's model by designing trigger patterns based on network traffic. Specifically, CWFD injects only incoming packets on the server side into the target web page's traffic, keeping overhead low while effectively poisoning the attacker's model during training. During inference, the defender can influence the attacker's model through a 'red pill, blue pill' choice: traces with the trigger (red pill) lead to misclassification as the target web page, while normal traces (blue pill) are classified correctly, achieving directed control over the defense outcome. We use the Fast Levenshtein-like distance as the optimization objective to compute trigger patterns that can be effectively associated with our target page. Experiments show that CWFD significantly reduces RF's accuracy from 99% to 6% with 74% data overhead. In comparison, FRONT reduces accuracy to only 97% at similar overhead, while Palette achieves 32% accuracy with 48% more overhead. We further validate the practicality of our method in a real Tor network environment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Purity Mugambi, Alexandra Meliou, Madalina Fiterau</p>
<p>Abstract: A crucial step in cohort studies is to extract the required cohort from one or more study datasets. This step is time-consuming, especially when a researcher is presented with a dataset that they have not previously worked with. When the cohort has to be extracted from multiple datasets, cohort extraction can be extremely laborious. In this study, we present an approach for partially automating cohort extraction from multiple electronic health record (EHR) databases. We formulate the guided multi-dataset cohort extraction problem in which selection criteria are first converted into queries, translating them from natural language text to language that maps to database entities. Then, using FLMs, columns of interest identified from the queries are automatically matched between the study databases. Finally, the generated queries are run across all databases to extract the study cohort. We propose and evaluate an algorithm for automating column matching on two large, popular and publicly-accessible EHR databases -- MIMIC-III and eICU. Our approach achieves a high top-three accuracy of $92\%$, correctly matching $12$ out of the $13$ columns of interest, when using a small, pre-trained general purpose language model. Furthermore, this accuracy is maintained even as the search space (i.e., size of the database) increases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zijian Gu, Jianwei Ma, Yan Huang, Honghao Wei, Zhanye Chen, Hui Zhang, Wei Hong</p>
<p>Abstract: Millimeter-wave radar plays a vital role in 3D object detection for autonomous driving due to its all-weather and all-lighting-condition capabilities for perception. However, radar point clouds suffer from pronounced sparsity and unavoidable angle estimation errors. To address these limitations, incorporating a camera may partially help mitigate the shortcomings. Nevertheless, the direct fusion of radar and camera data can lead to negative or even opposite effects due to the lack of depth information in images and low-quality image features under adverse lighting conditions. Hence, in this paper, we present the radar-camera fusion network with Hybrid Generation and Synchronization (HGSFusion), designed to better fuse radar potentials and image features for 3D object detection. Specifically, we propose the Radar Hybrid Generation Module (RHGM), which fully considers the Direction-Of-Arrival (DOA) estimation errors in radar signal processing. This module generates denser radar points through different Probability Density Functions (PDFs) with the assistance of semantic information. Meanwhile, we introduce the Dual Sync Module (DSM), comprising spatial sync and modality sync, to enhance image features with radar positional information and facilitate the fusion of distinct characteristics in different modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods in the VoD and TJ4DRadSet datasets by $6.53\%$ and $2.03\%$ in RoI AP and BEV AP, respectively.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guangsheng Bao, Yanbin Zhao, Juncai He, Yue Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Advanced large language models (LLMs) can generate text almost indistinguishable from human-written text, highlighting the importance of LLM-generated text detection. However, current zero-shot techniques face challenges as white-box methods are restricted to use weaker open-source LLMs, and black-box methods are limited by partial observation from stronger proprietary LLMs. It seems impossible to enable white-box methods to use proprietary models because API-level access to the models neither provides full predictive distributions nor inner embeddings. To traverse the divide, we propose Glimpse, a probability distribution estimation approach, predicting the full distributions from partial observations. Despite the simplicity of Glimpse, we successfully extend white-box methods like Entropy, Rank, Log-Rank, and Fast-DetectGPT to latest proprietary models. Experiments show that Glimpse with Fast-DetectGPT and GPT-3.5 achieves an average AUROC of about 0.95 in five latest source models, improving the score by 51% relative to the remaining space of the open source baseline (Table 1). It demonstrates that the latest LLMs can effectively detect their own outputs, suggesting that advanced LLMs may be the best shield against themselves.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyeonchu Park, Byungjun Kim, Bugeun Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) generate more human-like texts, concerns about the side effects of AI-generated texts (AIGT) have grown. So, researchers have developed methods for detecting AIGT. However, two challenges remain. First, the performance on detecting black-box LLMs is low, because existing models have focused on syntactic features. Second, most AIGT detectors have been tested on a single-candidate setting, which assumes that we know the origin of an AIGT and may deviate from the real-world scenario. To resolve these challenges, we propose DART, which consists of four steps: rephrasing, semantic parsing, scoring, and multiclass classification. We conducted several experiments to test the performance of DART by following previous work. The experimental result shows that DART can discriminate multiple black-box LLMs without using syntactic features and knowing the origin of AIGT.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dong In Lee, Hyeongcheol Park, Jiyoung Seo, Eunbyung Park, Hyunje Park, Ha Dam Baek, Shin Sangheon, Sangmin kim, Sangpil Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D editing have highlighted the potential of text-driven methods in real-time, user-friendly AR/VR applications. However, current methods rely on 2D diffusion models without adequately considering multi-view information, resulting in multi-view inconsistency. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) significantly improves rendering quality and speed, its 3D editing process encounters difficulties with inefficient optimization, as pre-trained Gaussians retain excessive source information, hindering optimization. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{EditSplat}, a novel 3D editing framework that integrates Multi-view Fusion Guidance (MFG) and Attention-Guided Trimming (AGT). Our MFG ensures multi-view consistency by incorporating essential multi-view information into the diffusion process, leveraging classifier-free guidance from the text-to-image diffusion model and the geometric properties of 3DGS. Additionally, our AGT leverages the explicit representation of 3DGS to selectively prune and optimize 3D Gaussians, enhancing optimization efficiency and enabling precise, semantically rich local edits. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations, EditSplat achieves superior multi-view consistency and editing quality over existing methods, significantly enhancing overall efficiency.</p>

The model currently supports mainly English, including the variety spoken in Singapore. We are actively expanding our datasets to gradually cover other languages in subsequent releases. The MERaLiON Speech Encoder was pre-trained from scratch on 200K hours of unlabelled speech data using a self-supervised learning approach based on masked language modelling. We describe our training procedure and hyperparameter tuning experiments in detail below. Our evaluation demonstrates improvements to spontaneous and Singapore speech benchmarks for speech recognition, while remaining competitive to other state-of-the-art speech encoders across ten other speech tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaxu Wan, Hong Zhang, Ziqi He, Qishu Wang, Ding Yuan, Yifan Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: In 3D understanding, point transformers have yielded significant advances in broadening the receptive field. However, further enhancement of the receptive field is hindered by the constraints of grouping attention. The proxy-based model, as a hot topic in image and language feature extraction, uses global or local proxies to expand the model's receptive field. But global proxy-based methods fail to precisely determine proxy positions and are not suited for tasks like segmentation and detection in the point cloud, and exist local proxy-based methods for image face difficulties in global-local balance, proxy sampling in various point clouds, and parallel cross-attention computation for sparse association. In this paper, we present SP$^2$T, a local proxy-based dual stream point transformer, which promotes global receptive field while maintaining a balance between local and global information. To tackle robust 3D proxy sampling, we propose a spatial-wise proxy sampling with vertex-based point proxy associations, ensuring robust point-cloud sampling in many scales of point cloud. To resolve economical association computation, we introduce sparse proxy attention combined with table-based relative bias, which enables low-cost and precise interactions between proxy and point features. Comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets reveal that our model achieves SOTA performance in downstream tasks.

Additionally, our experiments show that the proposed ensemble-selection method significantly enhances the performance and robustness of our ensemble, surpassing previously proposed strategies, which have not accounted for error diversity.</p>

<p>Abstract: Rapid advancements in speech synthesis and voice conversion bring convenience but also new security risks, creating an urgent need for effective audio deepfake detection. Although current models perform well, their effectiveness diminishes when confronted with the diverse and evolving nature of real-world deepfakes. To address this issue, we propose a continual learning method named Region-Based Optimization (RegO) for audio deepfake detection. Specifically, we use the Fisher information matrix to measure important neuron regions for real and fake audio detection, dividing them into four regions. First, we directly fine-tune the less important regions to quickly adapt to new tasks. Next, we apply gradient optimization in parallel for regions important only to real audio detection, and in orthogonal directions for regions important only to fake audio detection. For regions that are important to both, we use sample proportion-based adaptive gradient optimization. This region-adaptive optimization ensures an appropriate trade-off between memory stability and learning plasticity. Additionally, to address the increase of redundant neurons from old tasks, we further introduce the Ebbinghaus forgetting mechanism to release them, thereby promoting the capability of the model to learn more generalized discriminative features. Experimental results show our method achieves a 21.3% improvement in EER over the state-of-the-art continual learning approach RWM for audio deepfake detection. Moreover, the effectiveness of RegO extends beyond the audio deepfake detection domain, showing potential significance in other tasks, such as image recognition.

<p>Abstract: Wildfire monitoring and prediction are essential for understanding wildfire behaviour. With extensive Earth observation data, these tasks can be integrated and enhanced through multi-task deep learning models. We present a comprehensive multi-temporal remote sensing dataset for active fire detection, daily wildfire monitoring, and next-day wildfire prediction. Covering wildfire events in the contiguous U.S. from January 2017 to October 2021, the dataset includes 3552 surface reflectance images and auxiliary data such as weather, topography, land cover, and fuel information, totalling 71 GB. The lifecycle of each wildfire is documented, with labels for active fires (AF) and burned areas (BA), supported by manual quality assurance of AF and BA test labels. The dataset supports three tasks: a) active fire detection, b) daily burned area mapping, and c) wildfire progression prediction. Detection tasks use pixel-wise classification of multi-spectral, multi-temporal images, while prediction tasks integrate satellite and auxiliary data to model fire dynamics. This dataset and its benchmarks provide a foundation for advancing wildfire research using deep learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuchen Fu, Zifeng Cheng, Zhiwei Jiang, Zhonghui Wang, Yafeng Yin, Zhengliang Li, Qing Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: Extracting sentence embeddings from large language models (LLMs) is a promising direction, as LLMs have demonstrated stronger semantic understanding capabilities. Previous studies typically focus on prompt engineering to elicit sentence embeddings from LLMs by prompting the model to encode sentence information into the embedding of the last token. However, LLMs are mostly decoder-only models with causal attention and the earlier tokens in the sentence cannot attend to the latter tokens, resulting in biased encoding of sentence information and cascading effects on the final decoded token. To this end, we propose a novel Token Prepending (TP) technique that prepends each layer's decoded sentence embedding to the beginning of the sentence in the next layer's input, allowing earlier tokens to attend to the complete sentence information under the causal attention mechanism. The proposed TP technique is a plug-and-play and training-free technique, which means it can be seamlessly integrated with various prompt-based sentence embedding methods and autoregressive LLMs. Extensive experiments on various Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) tasks and downstream classification tasks demonstrate that our proposed TP technique can significantly improve the performance of existing prompt-based sentence embedding methods across different LLMs, while incurring negligible additional inference cost.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiale Cheng, Xiao Liu, Cunxiang Wang, Xiaotao Gu, Yida Lu, Dan Zhang, Yuxiao Dong, Jie Tang, Hongning Wang, Minlie Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Instruction-following is a fundamental capability of language models, requiring the model to recognize even the most subtle requirements in the instructions and accurately reflect them in its output. Such an ability is well-suited for and often optimized by preference learning. However, existing methods often directly sample multiple independent responses from the model when creating preference pairs. Such practice can introduce content variations irrelevant to whether the instruction is precisely followed (e.g., different expressions about the same semantic), interfering with the goal of teaching models to recognize the key differences that lead to improved instruction following. In light of this, we introduce SPaR, a self-play framework integrating tree-search self-refinement to yield valid and comparable preference pairs free from distractions. By playing against itself, an LLM employs a tree-search strategy to refine its previous responses with respect to the instruction while minimizing unnecessary variations. Our experiments show that a LLaMA3-8B model, trained over three iterations guided by SPaR, surpasses GPT-4-Turbo on the IFEval benchmark without losing general capabilities. Furthermore, SPaR demonstrates promising scalability and transferability, greatly enhancing models like GLM-4-9B and LLaMA3-70B. We also identify how inference scaling in tree search would impact model performance. Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/thu-coai/SPaR.</p>

<p>Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) for understanding proteins primarily treats amino acid sequences as a text modality. Meanwhile, Protein Language Models (PLMs), such as ESM-2, have learned massive sequential evolutionary knowledge from the universe of natural protein sequences. Furthermore, structure-based encoders like ProteinMPNN learn the structural information of proteins through Graph Neural Networks. However, whether the incorporation of protein encoders can enhance the protein understanding of LLMs has not been explored. To bridge this gap, we propose EvoLlama, a multimodal framework that connects a structure-based encoder, a sequence-based protein encoder and an LLM for protein understanding. EvoLlama consists of a ProteinMPNN structure encoder, an ESM-2 protein sequence encoder, a multimodal projector to align protein and text representations and a Llama-3 text decoder. To train EvoLlama, we fine-tune it on protein-oriented instructions and protein property prediction datasets verbalized via natural language instruction templates. Our experiments show that EvoLlama's protein understanding capabilities have been significantly enhanced, outperforming other fine-tuned protein-oriented LLMs in zero-shot settings by an average of 1%-8% and surpassing the state-of-the-art baseline with supervised fine-tuning by an average of 6%. On protein property prediction datasets, our approach achieves promising results that are competitive with state-of-the-art task-specific baselines. We will release our code in a future version.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenxiao Fan, Kan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Noisy labels can negatively impact the performance of deep neural networks. One common solution is label refurbishment, which involves reconstructing noisy labels through predictions and distributions. However, these methods may introduce problematic semantic associations, a phenomenon that we identify as Semantic Contamination. Through an analysis of Robust LR, a representative label refurbishment method, we found that utilizing the logits of views for refurbishment does not adequately balance the semantic information of individual classes. Conversely, using the logits of models fails to maintain consistent semantic relationships across models, which explains why label refurbishment methods frequently encounter issues related to Semantic Contamination. To address this issue, we propose a novel method called Collaborative Cross Learning, which utilizes semi-supervised learning on refurbished labels to extract appropriate semantic associations from embeddings across views and models. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing approaches on both synthetic and real-world noisy datasets, effectively mitigating the impact of label noise and Semantic Contamination.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juncheng Zou</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate human motion prediction is crucial for safe human-robot collaboration but remains challenging due to the complexity of modeling intricate and variable human movements. This paper presents Parallel Multi-scale Incremental Prediction (PMS), a novel framework that explicitly models incremental motion across multiple spatio-temporal scales to capture subtle joint evolutions and global trajectory shifts. PMS encodes these multi-scale increments using parallel sequence branches, enabling iterative refinement of predictions. A multi-stage training procedure with a full-timeline loss integrates temporal context. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate substantial improvements in continuity, biomechanical consistency, and long-term forecast stability by modeling inter-frame increments. PMS achieves state-of-the-art performance, increasing prediction accuracy by 16.3%-64.2% over previous methods. The proposed multi-scale incremental approach provides a powerful technique for advancing human motion prediction capabilities critical for seamless human-robot interaction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tao Meng, Wei Ai, Jianbin Li, Ze Wang, Yuntao Shou, Keqin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Text representation learning is significant as the cornerstone of natural language processing. In recent years, graph contrastive learning (GCL) has been widely used in text representation learning due to its ability to represent and capture complex text information in a self-supervised setting. However, current mainstream graph contrastive learning methods often require the incorporation of domain knowledge or cumbersome computations to guide the data augmentation process, which significantly limits the application efficiency and scope of GCL. Additionally, many methods learn text representations only by constructing word-document relationships, which overlooks the rich contextual semantic information in the text. To address these issues and exploit representative textual semantics, we present an event-based, simple, and effective graph contrastive learning (SE-GCL) for text representation. Precisely, we extract event blocks from text and construct internal relation graphs to represent inter-semantic interconnections, which can ensure that the most critical semantic information is preserved. Then, we devise a streamlined, unsupervised graph contrastive learning framework to leverage the complementary nature of the event semantic and structural information for intricate feature data capture. In particular, we introduce the concept of an event skeleton for core representation semantics and simplify the typically complex data augmentation techniques found in existing graph contrastive learning to boost algorithmic efficiency. We employ multiple loss functions to prompt diverse embeddings to converge or diverge within a confined distance in the vector space, ultimately achieving a harmonious equilibrium. We conducted experiments on the proposed SE-GCL on four standard data sets (AG News, 20NG, SougouNews, and THUCNews) to verify its effectiveness in text representation learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Chen, Guo Ye, Yakun Wang, Zhao Zhang, Libang Zhang, Daxin Wang, Zhiqiang Zhang, Fuzhen Zhuang</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised Graph Domain Adaptation (UGDA) seeks to bridge distribution shifts between domains by transferring knowledge from labeled source graphs to given unlabeled target graphs. Existing UGDA methods primarily focus on aligning features in the latent space learned by graph neural networks (GNNs) across domains, often overlooking structural shifts, resulting in limited effectiveness when addressing structurally complex transfer scenarios. Given the sensitivity of GNNs to local structural features, even slight discrepancies between source and target graphs could lead to significant shifts in node embeddings, thereby reducing the effectiveness of knowledge transfer. To address this issue, we introduce a novel approach for UGDA called Target-Domain Structural Smoothing (TDSS). TDSS is a simple and effective method designed to perform structural smoothing directly on the target graph, thereby mitigating structural distribution shifts and ensuring the consistency of node representations. Specifically, by integrating smoothing techniques with neighborhood sampling, TDSS maintains the structural coherence of the target graph while mitigating the risk of over-smoothing. Our theoretical analysis shows that TDSS effectively reduces target risk by improving model smoothness. Empirical results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that TDSS outperforms recent state-of-the-art baselines, achieving significant improvements across six transfer scenarios.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jangyeong Jeon, Sangyeon Cho, Dongjoon Lee, Changhee Lee, Junyeong Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Pediatric Emergency Department (PED) overcrowding presents a significant global challenge, prompting the need for efficient solutions. This paper introduces the BioBridge framework, a novel approach that applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) to Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) in written free-text form to enhance decision-making in PED. In non-English speaking countries, such as South Korea, EMR data is often written in a Code-Switching (CS) format that mixes the native language with English, with most code-switched English words having clinical significance. The BioBridge framework consists of two core modules: "bridging modality in context" and "unified bio-embedding." The "bridging modality in context" module improves the contextual understanding of bilingual and code-switched EMRs. In the "unified bio-embedding" module, the knowledge of the model trained in the medical domain is injected into the encoder-based model to bridge the gap between the medical and general domains. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed BioBridge significantly performance traditional machine learning and pre-trained encoder-based models on several metrics, including F1 score, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC), and Brier score. Specifically, BioBridge-XLM achieved enhancements of 0.85% in F1 score, 0.75% in AUROC, and 0.76% in AUPRC, along with a notable 3.04% decrease in the Brier score, demonstrating marked improvements in accuracy, reliability, and prediction calibration over the baseline XLM model. The source code will be made publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hangyu Zhu, Yuxiang Fan, Zhenping Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a privacy preserving machine learning paradigm designed to collaboratively learn a global model without data leakage. Specifically, in a typical FL system, the central server solely functions as an coordinator to iteratively aggregate the collected local models trained by each client, potentially introducing single-point transmission bottleneck and security threats. To mitigate this issue, decentralized federated learning (DFL) has been proposed, where all participating clients engage in peer-to-peer communication without a central server. Nonetheless, DFL still suffers from training degradation as FL does due to the non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) nature of client data. And incorporating personalization layers into DFL may be the most effective solutions to alleviate the side effects caused by non-IID data. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel unit representation aided personalized decentralized federated learning framework, named UA-PDFL, to deal with the non-IID challenge in DFL. By adaptively adjusting the level of personalization layers through the guidance of the unit representation, UA-PDFL is able to address the varying degrees of data skew. Based on this scheme, client-wise dropout and layer-wise personalization are proposed to further enhance the learning performance of DFL. Extensive experiments empirically prove the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuai Zhou, Shizhe Zhao, Zhongqiang Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) seeks collision-free paths for multiple agents from their respective starting locations to their respective goal locations while minimizing path costs. Although many MAPF algorithms were developed and can handle up to thousands of agents, they usually rely on the assumption that each action of the agent takes a time unit, and the actions of all agents are synchronized in a sense that the actions of agents start at the same discrete time step, which may limit their use in practice. Only a few algorithms were developed to address asynchronous actions, and they all lie on one end of the spectrum, focusing on finding optimal solutions with limited scalability. This paper develops new planners that lie on the other end of the spectrum, trading off solution quality for scalability, by finding an unbounded sub-optimal solution for many agents. Our method leverages both search methods (LSS) in handling asynchronous actions and rule-based planning methods (PIBT) for MAPF. We analyze the properties of our method and test it against several baselines with up to 1000 agents in various maps. Given a runtime limit, our method can handle an order of magnitude more agents than the baselines with about 25% longer makespan.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daiki Shirafuji, Makoto Takenaka, Shinya Taguchi</p>
<p>Abstract: The use of language models (LMs) has increased considerably in recent years, and the biases and stereotypes in training data that are reflected in the LM outputs are causing social problems. In this paper, inspired by the task arithmetic, we propose the ``Bias Vector'' method for the mitigation of these LM biases. The Bias Vector method does not require manually created debiasing data. The three main steps of our approach involve: (1) continual training the pre-trained LMs on biased data using masked language modeling; (2) constructing the Bias Vector as the difference between the weights of the biased LMs and those of pre-trained LMs; and (3) subtracting the Bias Vector from the weights of the pre-trained LMs for debiasing. We evaluated the Bias Vector method on the SEAT across three LMs and confirmed an average improvement of 0.177 points. We demonstrated that the Bias Vector method does not degrade the LM performance on downstream tasks in the GLUE benchmark. In addition, we examined the impact of scaling factors, which control the magnitudes of Bias Vectors, with effect sizes on the SEAT and conducted a comprehensive evaluation of our debiased LMs across both the SEAT and GLUE benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdelbaki Souid, Mohamed Hamroun, Soufiene Ben Othman, Hedi Sakli, Naceur Abdelkarim</p>
<p>Abstract: Pulmonary pathologies are a significant global health concern, often leading to fatal outcomes if not diagnosed and treated promptly. Chest radiography serves as a primary diagnostic tool, but the availability of experienced radiologists remains limited. Advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning, particularly in computer vision, offer promising solutions to address this challenge.
  This research evaluates a deep learning model designed to detect lung cancer, specifically pulmonary nodules, along with eight other lung pathologies, using chest radiographs. The study leverages diverse datasets comprising over 135,120 frontal chest radiographs to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). A two-stage classification system, utilizing ensemble methods and transfer learning, is employed to first triage images into Normal or Abnormal categories and then identify specific pathologies, including lung nodules.
  The deep learning model achieves notable results in nodule classification, with a top-performing accuracy of 77%, a sensitivity of 0.713, a specificity of 0.776 during external validation, and an AUC score of 0.888. Despite these successes, some misclassifications were observed, primarily false negatives.
  In conclusion, the model demonstrates robust potential for generalization across diverse patient populations, attributed to the geographic diversity of the training dataset. Future work could focus on integrating ETL data distribution strategies and expanding the dataset with additional nodule-type samples to further enhance diagnostic accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate trajectory prediction is essential for the safety and efficiency of autonomous driving. Traditional models often struggle with real-time processing, capturing non-linearity and uncertainty in traffic environments, efficiency in dense traffic, and modeling temporal dynamics of interactions. We introduce NEST (Neuromodulated Small-world Hypergraph Trajectory Prediction), a novel framework that integrates Small-world Networks and hypergraphs for superior interaction modeling and prediction accuracy. This integration enables the capture of both local and extended vehicle interactions, while the Neuromodulator component adapts dynamically to changing traffic conditions. We validate the NEST model on several real-world datasets, including nuScenes, MoCAD, and HighD. The results consistently demonstrate that NEST outperforms existing methods in various traffic scenarios, showcasing its exceptional generalization capability, efficiency, and temporal foresight. Our comprehensive evaluation illustrates that NEST significantly improves the reliability and operational efficiency of autonomous driving systems, making it a robust solution for trajectory prediction in complex traffic environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Even with various regulations in place across countries and social media platforms (Government of India, 2021; European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2022, digital abusive speech remains a significant issue. One potential approach to address this challenge is automatic text detoxification, a text style transfer (TST) approach that transforms toxic language into a more neutral or non-toxic form. To date, the availability of parallel corpora for the text detoxification task (Logachevavet al., 2022; Atwell et al., 2022; Dementievavet al., 2024a) has proven to be crucial for state-of-the-art approaches. With this work, we extend parallel text detoxification corpus to new languages -- German, Chinese, Arabic, Hindi, and Amharic -- testing in the extensive multilingual setup TST baselines. Next, we conduct the first of its kind an automated, explainable analysis of the descriptive features of both toxic and non-toxic sentences, diving deeply into the nuances, similarities, and differences of toxicity and detoxification across 9 languages. Finally, based on the obtained insights, we experiment with a novel text detoxification method inspired by the Chain-of-Thoughts reasoning approach, enhancing the prompting process through clustering on relevant descriptive attributes.</p>

<p>Abstract: Context. The security of critical infrastructure has been a fundamental concern since the advent of computers, and this concern has only intensified in today's cyber warfare landscape. Protecting mission-critical systems (MCSs), including essential assets like healthcare, telecommunications, and military coordination, is vital for national security. These systems require prompt and comprehensive governance to ensure their resilience, yet recent events have shown that meeting these demands is increasingly challenging. Aim. Building on prior research that demonstrated the potential of GAI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), in improving risk analysis tasks, we aim to explore practitioners' perspectives, specifically developers and security personnel, on using generative AI (GAI) in the governance of IT MCSs seeking to provide insights and recommendations for various stakeholders, including researchers, practitioners, and policymakers. Method. We designed a survey to collect practical experiences, concerns, and expectations of practitioners who develop and implement security solutions in the context of MCSs. Analyzing this data will help identify key trends, challenges, and opportunities for introducing GAIs in this niche domain. Conclusions and Future Works. Our findings highlight that the safe use of LLMs in MCS governance requires interdisciplinary collaboration. Researchers should focus on designing regulation-oriented models and focus on accountability; practitioners emphasize data protection and transparency, while policymakers must establish a unified AI framework with global benchmarks to ensure ethical and secure LLMs-based MCS governance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Atsuki Yamaguchi, Terufumi Morishita, Aline Villavicencio, Nikolaos Aletras</p>
<p>Abstract: Chat models (i.e. language models trained to follow instructions through conversation with humans) outperform base models (i.e. trained solely on unlabeled data) in both conversation and general task-solving abilities. These models are generally English-centric and require further adaptation for languages that are underrepresented in or absent from their training data. A common technique for adapting base models is to extend the model's vocabulary with target language tokens, i.e. vocabulary expansion (VE), and then continually pre-train it on language-specific data. Using chat data is ideal for chat model adaptation, but often, either this does not exist or is costly to construct. Alternatively, adapting chat models with unlabeled data is a possible solution, but it could result in catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we investigate the impact of using unlabeled target language data for VE on chat models for the first time. We first show that off-the-shelf VE generally performs well across target language tasks and models in 71% of cases, though it underperforms in scenarios where source chat models are already strong. To further improve adapted models, we propose post-hoc techniques that inject information from the source model without requiring any further training. Experiments reveal the effectiveness of our methods, helping the adapted models to achieve performance improvements in 87% of cases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuanzhi Wang, Yong Li, Mengyi Liu, Xiaoya Zhang, Xin Liu, Zhen Cui, Antoni B. Chan</p>
<p>Abstract: Editing videos with textual guidance has garnered popularity due to its streamlined process which mandates users to solely edit the text prompt corresponding to the source video. Recent studies have explored and exploited large-scale text-to-image diffusion models for text-guided video editing, resulting in remarkable video editing capabilities. However, they may still suffer from some limitations such as mislocated objects, incorrect number of objects. Therefore, the controllability of video editing remains a formidable challenge. In this paper, we aim to challenge the above limitations by proposing a Re-Attentional Controllable Video Diffusion Editing (ReAtCo) method. Specially, to align the spatial placement of the target objects with the edited text prompt in a training-free manner, we propose a Re-Attentional Diffusion (RAD) to refocus the cross-attention activation responses between the edited text prompt and the target video during the denoising stage, resulting in a spatially location-aligned and semantically high-fidelity manipulated video. In particular, to faithfully preserve the invariant region content with less border artifacts, we propose an Invariant Region-guided Joint Sampling (IRJS) strategy to mitigate the intrinsic sampling errors w.r.t the invariant regions at each denoising timestep and constrain the generated content to be harmonized with the invariant region content. Experimental results verify that ReAtCo consistently improves the controllability of video diffusion editing and achieves superior video editing performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Training medical personnel using standardized patients (SPs) remains a complex challenge, requiring extensive domain expertise and role-specific practice. Most research on Large Language Model (LLM)-based simulated patients focuses on improving data retrieval accuracy or adjusting prompts through human feedback. However, this focus has overlooked the critical need for patient agents to learn a standardized presentation pattern that transforms data into human-like patient responses through unsupervised simulations. To address this gap, we propose EvoPatient, a novel simulated patient framework in which a patient agent and doctor agents simulate the diagnostic process through multi-turn dialogues, simultaneously gathering experience to improve the quality of both questions and answers, ultimately enabling human doctor training. Extensive experiments on various cases demonstrate that, by providing only overall SP requirements, our framework improves over existing reasoning methods by more than 10% in requirement alignment and better human preference, while achieving an optimal balance of resource consumption after evolving over 200 cases for 10 hours, with excellent generalizability.

<p>Abstract: Traditional adversarial attacks typically produce adversarial examples under norm-constrained conditions, whereas unrestricted adversarial examples are free-form with semantically meaningful perturbations. Current unrestricted adversarial impersonation attacks exhibit limited control over adversarial face attributes and often suffer from low transferability. In this paper, we propose a novel Text Controlled Attribute Attack (TCA$^2$) to generate photorealistic adversarial impersonation faces guided by natural language. Specifically, the category-level personal softmax vector is employed to precisely guide the impersonation attacks. Additionally, we propose both data and model augmentation strategies to achieve transferable attacks on unknown target models. Finally, a generative model, \textit{i.e}, Style-GAN, is utilized to synthesize impersonated faces with desired attributes. Extensive experiments on two high-resolution face recognition datasets validate that our TCA$^2$ method can generate natural text-guided adversarial impersonation faces with high transferability. We also evaluate our method on real-world face recognition systems, \textit{i.e}, Face++ and Aliyun, further demonstrating the practical potential of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyin Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a wearable driving status recognition device and our open-source dataset, along with a new real-time method robust to changes in lighting conditions for identifying driving status from eye observations of drivers. The core of our method is generating event frames from conventional intensity frames, and the other is a newly designed Attention Driving State Network (ADSN). Compared to event cameras, conventional cameras offer complete information and lower hardware costs, enabling captured frames to encode rich spatial information. However, these textures lack temporal information, posing challenges in effectively identifying driving status. DriveGazen addresses this issue from three perspectives. First, we utilize video frames to generate realistic synthetic dynamic vision sensor (DVS) events. Second, we adopt a spiking neural network to decode pertinent temporal information. Lastly, ADSN extracts crucial spatial cues from corresponding intensity frames and conveys spatial attention to convolutional spiking layers during both training and inference through a novel guide attention module to guide the feature learning and feature enhancement of the event frame. We specifically collected the Driving Status (DriveGaze) dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Additionally, we validate the superiority of the DriveGazen on the Single-eye Event-based Emotion (SEE) dataset. To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first to utilize guide attention spiking neural networks and eye-based event frames generated from conventional cameras for driving status recognition.

<p>Abstract: In this work, we question the necessity of adaptive gradient methods for training deep neural networks. SGD-SaI is a simple yet effective enhancement to stochastic gradient descent with momentum (SGDM). SGD-SaI performs learning rate Scaling at Initialization (SaI) to distinct parameter groups, guided by their respective gradient signal-to-noise ratios (g-SNR). By adjusting learning rates without relying on adaptive second-order momentum, SGD-SaI helps prevent training imbalances from the very first iteration and cuts the optimizer's memory usage by half compared to AdamW. Despite its simplicity and efficiency, SGD-SaI consistently matches or outperforms AdamW in training a variety of Transformer-based tasks, effectively overcoming a long-standing challenge of using SGD for training Transformers. SGD-SaI excels in ImageNet-1K classification with Vision Transformers(ViT) and GPT-2 pretraining for large language models (LLMs, transformer decoder-only), demonstrating robustness to hyperparameter variations and practicality for diverse applications. We further tested its robustness on tasks like LoRA fine-tuning for LLMs and diffusion models, where it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers. From a memory efficiency perspective, SGD-SaI achieves substantial memory savings for optimizer states, reducing memory usage by 5.93 GB for GPT-2 (1.5B parameters) and 25.15 GB for Llama2-7B compared to AdamW in full-precision training settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pratik Sutar, Jason Naradowsky, Yusuke Miyao</p>
<p>Abstract: Natural language is commonly used to describe instrument timbre, such as a "warm" or "heavy" sound. As these descriptors are based on human perception, there can be disagreement over which acoustic features correspond to a given adjective. In this work, we pursue a data-driven approach to further our understanding of such adjectives in the context of guitar tone. Our main contribution is a dataset of timbre adjectives, constructed by processing single clips of instrument audio to produce varied timbres through adjustments in EQ and effects such as distortion. Adjective annotations are obtained for each clip by crowdsourcing experts to complete a pairwise comparison and a labeling task. We examine the dataset and reveal correlations between adjective ratings and highlight instances where the data contradicts prevailing theories on spectral features and timbral adjectives, suggesting a need for a more nuanced, data-driven understanding of timbre.</p>

<p>Abstract: As social systems become increasingly complex, legal articles are also growing more intricate, making it progressively harder for humans to identify any potential competitions among them, particularly when drafting new laws or applying existing laws. Despite this challenge, no method for detecting such competitions has been proposed so far. In this paper, we propose a new legal AI task called Legal Article Competition Detection (LACD), which aims to identify competing articles within a given law. Our novel retrieval method, CAM-Re2, outperforms existing relevant methods, reducing false positives by 20.8% and false negatives by 8.3%, while achieving a 98.2% improvement in precision@5, for the LACD task.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Luo, Haiming Yao, Wenyong Yu, Zhengyong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised visual anomaly detection is crucial for enhancing industrial production quality and efficiency. Among unsupervised methods, reconstruction approaches are popular due to their simplicity and effectiveness. The key aspect of reconstruction methods lies in the restoration of anomalous regions, which current methods have not satisfactorily achieved. To tackle this issue, we introduce a novel \uline{A}daptive \uline{M}ask \uline{I}npainting \uline{Net}work (AMI-Net) from the perspective of adaptive mask-inpainting. In contrast to traditional reconstruction methods that treat non-semantic image pixels as targets, our method uses a pre-trained network to extract multi-scale semantic features as reconstruction targets. Given the multiscale nature of industrial defects, we incorporate a training strategy involving random positional and quantitative masking. Moreover, we propose an innovative adaptive mask generator capable of generating adaptive masks that effectively mask anomalous regions while preserving normal regions. In this manner, the model can leverage the visible normal global contextual information to restore the masked anomalous regions, thereby effectively suppressing the reconstruction of defects. Extensive experimental results on the MVTec AD and BTAD industrial datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Additionally, AMI-Net exhibits exceptional real-time performance, striking a favorable balance between detection accuracy and speed, rendering it highly suitable for industrial applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoran Xu, Jiangang Yang, Wenhui Shi, Siyuan Ding, Luqing Luo, Jian Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Single-Domain Generalized Object Detection~(S-DGOD) aims to train on a single source domain for robust performance across a variety of unseen target domains by taking advantage of an object detector. Existing S-DGOD approaches often rely on data augmentation strategies, including a composition of visual transformations, to enhance the detector's generalization ability. However, the absence of real-world prior knowledge hinders data augmentation from contributing to the diversity of training data distributions. To address this issue, we propose PhysAug, a novel physical model-based non-ideal imaging condition data augmentation method, to enhance the adaptability of the S-DGOD tasks. Drawing upon the principles of atmospheric optics, we develop a universal perturbation model that serves as the foundation for our proposed PhysAug. Given that visual perturbations typically arise from the interaction of light with atmospheric particles, the image frequency spectrum is harnessed to simulate real-world variations during training. This approach fosters the detector to learn domain-invariant representations, thereby enhancing its ability to generalize across various settings. Without altering the network architecture or loss function, our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art across various S-DGOD datasets. In particular, it achieves a substantial improvement of $7.3\%$ and $7.2\%$ over the baseline on DWD and Cityscape-C, highlighting its enhanced generalizability in real-world settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingze Shi, Bingheng Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: In order to make the foundation model more efficient and effective, our idea is combining sequence transformation and state transformation. First, we prove the availability of rotary position embedding in the state space duality algorithm, which reduces the perplexity of the hybrid quadratic causal self-attention and state space duality by more than 4%, to ensure that the combining sequence transformation unifies position encoding. Second, we propose dynamic mask attention, which maintains 100% accuracy in the more challenging multi-query associative recall task, improving by more than 150% compared to quadratic causal self-attention and state space duality, to ensure that the combining sequence transformation selectively filters relevant information. Third, we design cross domain mixture of experts, which makes the computational speed of expert retrieval with more than 1024 experts 8 to 10 times faster than the mixture of experts, to ensure that the combining state transformation quickly retrieval mixture. Finally, we summarize these matrix algorithms that can form the foundation model: Wonderful Matrices, which can be a competitor to popular model architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Effrosyni Sokli, Pranav Kasela, Georgios Peikos, Gabriella Pasi</p>
<p>Abstract: While Dense Retrieval Models (DRMs) have advanced Information Retrieval (IR), one limitation of these neural models is their narrow generalizability and robustness. To cope with this issue, one can leverage the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. While previous IR studies have incorporated MoE architectures within the Transformer layers of DRMs, our work investigates an architecture that integrates a single MoE block (SB-MoE) after the output of the final Transformer layer. Our empirical evaluation investigates how SB-MoE compares, in terms of retrieval effectiveness, to standard fine-tuning. In detail, we fine-tune three DRMs (TinyBERT, BERT, and Contriever) across four benchmark collections with and without adding the MoE block. Moreover, since MoE showcases performance variations with respect to its parameters (i.e., the number of experts), we conduct additional experiments to investigate this aspect further. The findings show the effectiveness of SB-MoE especially for DRMs with a low number of parameters (i.e., TinyBERT), as it consistently outperforms the fine-tuned underlying model on all four benchmarks. For DRMs with a higher number of parameters (i.e., BERT and Contriever), SB-MoE requires larger numbers of training samples to yield better retrieval performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alex F. Spies, William Edwards, Michael I. Ivanitskiy, Adrians Skapars, Tilman R\"auker, Katsumi Inoue, Alessandra Russo, Murray Shanahan</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies in interpretability have explored the inner workings of transformer models trained on tasks across various domains, often discovering that these networks naturally develop surprisingly structured representations. When such representations comprehensively reflect the task domain's structure, they are commonly referred to as ``World Models'' (WMs). In this work, we discover such WMs in transformers trained on maze tasks. In particular, by employing Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) and analysing attention patterns, we examine the construction of WMs and demonstrate consistency between the circuit analysis and the SAE feature-based analysis. We intervene upon the isolated features to confirm their causal role and, in doing so, find asymmetries between certain types of interventions. Surprisingly, we find that models are able to reason with respect to a greater number of active features than they see during training, even if attempting to specify these in the input token sequence would lead the model to fail. Futhermore, we observe that varying positional encodings can alter how WMs are encoded in a model's residual stream. By analyzing the causal role of these WMs in a toy domain we hope to make progress toward an understanding of emergent structure in the representations acquired by Transformers, leading to the development of more interpretable and controllable AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Evgeny Zamyatin</p>
<p>Abstract: A major problem of making friend suggestions in social networks is the large size of social graphs, which can have hundreds of millions of people and tens of billions of connections. Classic methods based on heuristics or factorizations are often used to address the difficulties of scaling more complex models. However, the unsupervised nature of these methods can lead to suboptimal results. In this work, we introduce the Generalized Ego-network Friendship Score framework, which makes it possible to use complex supervised models without sacrificing scalability. The main principle of the framework is to reduce the problem of link prediction on a full graph to a series of low-scale tasks on ego-nets with subsequent aggregation of their results. Here, the underlying model takes an ego-net as input and produces a pairwise relevance matrix for its nodes. In addition, we develop the WalkGNN model which is capable of working effectively in the social network domain, where these graph-level link prediction tasks are heterogeneous, dynamic and featureless. To measure the accuracy of this model, we introduce the Ego-VK dataset that serves as an exact representation of the real-world problem that we are addressing. Offline experiments on the dataset show that our model outperforms all baseline methods, and a live A/B test demonstrates the growth of business metrics as a result of utilizing our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kun Ouyang, Yuanxin Liu, Shicheng Li, Yi Liu, Hao Zhou, Fandong Meng, Jie Zhou, Xu Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal punchlines, which involve humor or sarcasm conveyed in image-caption pairs, are a popular way of communication on online multimedia platforms. With the rapid development of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), it is essential to assess their ability to effectively comprehend these punchlines. However, existing benchmarks on punchline comprehension suffer from three major limitations: 1) language shortcuts that allow models to solely rely on text, 2) lack of question diversity, and 3) narrow focus on a specific domain of multimodal content (e.g., cartoon). To address these limitations, we introduce a multimodal \textbf{Punch}line comprehension \textbf{Bench}mark, named \textbf{PunchBench}, which is tailored for accurate and comprehensive evaluation of punchline comprehension. To enhance the evaluation accuracy, we generate synonymous and antonymous captions by modifying original captions, which mitigates the impact of shortcuts in the captions. To provide a comprehensive evaluation, PunchBench incorporates diverse question formats and image-captions from various domains. On this basis, we conduct extensive evaluations and reveal a significant gap between state-of-the-art MLLMs and humans in punchline comprehension. To improve punchline comprehension, we propose Simple-to-Complex Chain-of-Question (SC-CoQ) strategy, enabling the models to incrementally address complicated questions by first mastering simple ones. SC-CoQ effectively enhances the performance of various MLLMs on PunchBench, surpassing in-context learning and chain-of-thought.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoxi Li, Jiajie Jin, Yujia Zhou, Yongkang Wu, Zhonghua Li, Qi Ye, Zhicheng Dou</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable generative capabilities but often suffer from hallucinations. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offers an effective solution by incorporating external knowledge, but existing methods still face several limitations: additional deployment costs of separate retrievers, redundant input tokens from retrieved text chunks, and the lack of joint optimization of retrieval and generation. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{RetroLLM}, a unified framework that integrates retrieval and generation into a single, cohesive process, enabling LLMs to directly generate fine-grained evidence from the corpus with constrained decoding. Moreover, to mitigate false pruning in the process of constrained evidence generation, we introduce (1) hierarchical FM-Index constraints, which generate corpus-constrained clues to identify a subset of relevant documents before evidence generation, reducing irrelevant decoding space; and (2) a forward-looking constrained decoding strategy, which considers the relevance of future sequences to improve evidence accuracy. Extensive experiments on five open-domain QA datasets demonstrate RetroLLM's superior performance across both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sepideh Mamooler, Syrielle Montariol, Alexander Mathis, Antoine Bosselut</p>
<p>Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform tasks using few demonstrations, facilitating task adaptation when labeled examples are hard to obtain. However, ICL is sensitive to the choice of demonstrations, and it remains unclear which demonstration attributes enable in-context generalization. In this work, we conduct a perturbation study of in-context demonstrations for low-resource Named Entity Detection (NED). Our surprising finding is that in-context demonstrations with partially correct annotated entity mentions can be as effective for task transfer as fully correct demonstrations. Based off our findings, we propose Pseudo-annotated In-Context Learning (PICLe), a framework for in-context learning with noisy, pseudo-annotated demonstrations. PICLe leverages LLMs to annotate many demonstrations in a zero-shot first pass. We then cluster these synthetic demonstrations, sample specific sets of in-context demonstrations from each cluster, and predict entity mentions using each set independently. Finally, we use self-verification to select the final set of entity mentions. We evaluate PICLe on five biomedical NED datasets and show that, with zero human annotation, PICLe outperforms ICL in low-resource settings where limited gold examples can be used as in-context demonstrations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minjae Cho, Chuangchuang Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Meta-Reinforcement Learning (Meta-RL) enables fast adaptation to new testing tasks. Despite recent advancements, it is still challenging to learn performant policies across multiple complex and high-dimensional tasks. To address this, we propose a novel architecture with three hierarchical levels for 1) learning task representations, 2) discovering task-agnostic macro-actions in an automated manner, and 3) learning primitive actions. The macro-action can guide the low-level primitive policy learning to more efficiently transition to goal states. This can address the issue that the policy may forget previously learned behavior while learning new, conflicting tasks. Moreover, the task-agnostic nature of the macro-actions is enabled by removing task-specific components from the state space. Hence, this makes them amenable to re-composition across different tasks and leads to promising fast adaptation to new tasks. Also, the prospective instability from the tri-level hierarchies is effectively mitigated by our innovative, independently tailored training schemes. Experiments in the MetaWorld framework demonstrate the improved sample efficiency and success rate of our approach compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmad Hassanpour, Amir Zarei, Khawla Mallat, Anderson Santana de Oliveira, Bian Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: This study investigates the trade-offs between fairness, privacy, and utility in image classification using machine learning (ML). Recent research suggests that generalization techniques can improve the balance between privacy and utility. One focus of this work is sharpness-aware training (SAT) and its integration with differential privacy (DP-SAT) to further improve this balance. Additionally, we examine fairness in both private and non-private learning models trained on datasets with synthetic and real-world biases. We also measure the privacy risks involved in these scenarios by performing membership inference attacks (MIAs) and explore the consequences of eliminating high-privacy risk samples, termed outliers. Moreover, we introduce a new metric, named \emph{harmonic score}, which combines accuracy, privacy, and fairness into a single measure.
  Through empirical analysis using generalization techniques, we achieve an accuracy of 81.11\% under $(8, 10^{-5})$-DP on CIFAR-10, surpassing the 79.5\% reported by De et al. (2022). Moreover, our experiments show that memorization of training samples can begin before the overfitting point, and generalization techniques do not guarantee the prevention of this memorization. Our analysis of synthetic biases shows that generalization techniques can amplify model bias in both private and non-private models. Additionally, our results indicate that increased bias in training data leads to reduced accuracy, greater vulnerability to privacy attacks, and higher model bias. We validate these findings with the CelebA dataset, demonstrating that similar trends persist with real-world attribute imbalances. Finally, our experiments show that removing outlier data decreases accuracy and further amplifies model bias.</p>

<p>Abstract: Image Aesthetic Assessment (IAA) is a vital and intricate task that entails analyzing and assessing an image's aesthetic values, and identifying its highlights and areas for improvement. Traditional methods of IAA often concentrate on a single aesthetic task and suffer from inadequate labeled datasets, thus impairing in-depth aesthetic comprehension. Despite efforts to overcome this challenge through the application of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), such models remain underdeveloped for IAA purposes. To address this, we propose a comprehensive aesthetic MLLM capable of nuanced aesthetic insight. Central to our approach is an innovative multi-scale text-guided self-supervised learning technique. This technique features a multi-scale feature alignment module and capitalizes on a wealth of unlabeled data in a self-supervised manner to structurally and functionally enhance aesthetic ability. The empirical evidence indicates that accompanied with extensive instruct-tuning, our model sets new state-of-the-art benchmarks across multiple tasks, including aesthetic scoring, aesthetic commenting, and personalized image aesthetic assessment. Remarkably, it also demonstrates zero-shot learning capabilities in the emerging task of aesthetic suggesting. Furthermore, for personalized image aesthetic assessment, we harness the potential of in-context learning and showcase its inherent advantages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Giordano Cicchetti, Eleonora Grassucci, Luigi Sigillo, Danilo Comminiello</p>
<p>Abstract: Human perception integrates multiple modalities, such as vision, hearing, and language, into a unified understanding of the surrounding reality. While recent multimodal models have achieved significant progress by aligning pairs of modalities via contrastive learning, their solutions are unsuitable when scaling to multiple modalities. These models typically align each modality to a designated anchor without ensuring the alignment of all modalities with each other, leading to suboptimal performance in tasks requiring a joint understanding of multiple modalities. In this paper, we structurally rethink the pairwise conventional approach to multimodal learning and we present the novel Gramian Representation Alignment Measure (GRAM), which overcomes the above-mentioned limitations. GRAM learns and then aligns $n$ modalities directly in the higher-dimensional space in which modality embeddings lie by minimizing the Gramian volume of the $k$-dimensional parallelotope spanned by the modality vectors, ensuring the geometric alignment of all modalities simultaneously. GRAM can replace cosine similarity in any downstream method, holding for 2 to $n$ modality and providing more meaningful alignment with respect to previous similarity measures. The novel GRAM-based contrastive loss function enhances the alignment of multimodal models in the higher-dimensional embedding space, leading to new state-of-the-art performance in downstream tasks such as video-audio-text retrieval and audio-video classification. The project page, the code, and the pretrained models are available at https://ispamm.github.io/GRAM/.</p>

<p>Abstract: Traditional reinforcement learning-based robotic control methods are often task-specific and fail to generalize across diverse environments or unseen objects and instructions. Visual Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong scene understanding and planning capabilities but lack the ability to generate actionable policies tailored to specific robotic embodiments. To address this, Visual-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged, yet they face challenges in long-horizon spatial reasoning and grounded task planning. In this work, we propose the Embodied Multimodal Action Model with Grounded Chain of Thought and Look-ahead Spatial Reasoning, Emma-X. Emma-X leverages our constructed hierarchical embodiment dataset based on BridgeV2, containing 60,000 robot manipulation trajectories auto-annotated with grounded task reasoning and spatial guidance. Additionally, we introduce a trajectory segmentation strategy based on gripper states and motion trajectories, which can help mitigate hallucination in grounding subtask reasoning generation. Experimental results demonstrate that Emma-X achieves superior performance over competitive baselines, particularly in real-world robotic tasks requiring spatial reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taiyan Zhang, Renchi Yang, Mingyu Yan, Xiaochun Ye, Dongrui Fan, Yurui Lai</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as go-to models for node classification in graph data due to their powerful abilities in fusing graph structures and attributes. However, such models strongly rely on adequate high-quality labeled data for training, which are expensive to acquire in practice. With the advent of large language models (LLMs), a promising way is to leverage their superb zero-shot capabilities and massive knowledge for node labeling. Despite promising results reported, this methodology either demands considerable queries to LLMs, or suffers from compromised performance caused by noisy labels produced by LLMs.
  To remedy these issues, this work presents Cella, an active self-training framework that integrates LLMs into GNNs in a cost-effective manner. The design recipe of Cella is to iteratively identify small sets of "critical" samples using GNNs and extract informative pseudo-labels for them with both LLMs and GNNs as additional supervision signals to enhance model training. Particularly, Cella includes three major components: (i) an effective active node selection strategy for initial annotations; (ii) a judicious sample selection scheme to sift out the "critical" nodes based on label disharmonicity and entropy; and (iii) a label refinement module combining LLMs and GNNs with rewired topology. Our extensive experiments over five benchmark text-attributed graph datasets demonstrate that Cella significantly outperforms the state of the arts under the same query budget to LLMs in terms of label-free node classification. In particular, on the DBLP dataset with 14.3k nodes, Cella is able to achieve an 8.08% conspicuous improvement in accuracy over the state-of-the-art at a cost of less than one cent.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Devika Venugopalan, Ziwen Yan, Conrad Borchers, Jionghao Lin, Vincent Aleven</p>
<p>Abstract: Caregivers (i.e., parents and members of a child's caring community) are underappreciated stakeholders in learning analytics. Although caregiver involvement can enhance student academic outcomes, many obstacles hinder involvement, most notably knowledge gaps with respect to modern school curricula. An emerging topic of interest in learning analytics is hybrid tutoring, which includes instructional and motivational support. Caregivers assert similar roles in homework, yet it is unknown how learning analytics can support them. Our past work with caregivers suggested that conversational support is a promising method of providing caregivers with the guidance needed to effectively support student learning. We developed a system that provides instructional support to caregivers through conversational recommendations generated by a Large Language Model (LLM). Addressing known instructional limitations of LLMs, we use instructional intelligence from tutoring systems while conducting prompt engineering experiments with the open-source Llama 3 LLM. This LLM generated message recommendations for caregivers supporting their child's math practice via chat. Few-shot prompting and combining real-time problem-solving context from tutoring systems with examples of tutoring practices yielded desirable message recommendations. These recommendations were evaluated with ten middle school caregivers, who valued recommendations facilitating content-level support and student metacognition through self-explanation. We contribute insights into how tutoring systems can best be merged with LLMs to support hybrid tutoring settings through conversational assistance, facilitating effective caregiver involvement in tutoring systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yueqian Lin, Yuzhe Fu, Jingyang Zhang, Yudong Liu, Jianyi Zhang, Jingwei Sun, Hai "Helen" Li, Yiran Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Speech Information Retrieval (SIR), a new long-context task for Speech Large Language Models (Speech LLMs), and present SPIRAL, a 1,012-sample benchmark testing models' ability to extract critical details from approximately 90-second spoken inputs. While current Speech LLMs excel at short-form tasks, they struggle with the computational and representational demands of longer audio sequences. To address this limitation, we propose SpeechPrune, a training-free token pruning strategy that uses speech-text similarity and approximated attention scores to efficiently discard irrelevant tokens. In SPIRAL, SpeechPrune achieves accuracy improvements of 29% and up to 47% over the original model and the random pruning model at a pruning rate of 20%, respectively. SpeechPrune can maintain network performance even at a pruning level of 80%. This approach highlights the potential of token-level pruning for efficient and scalable long-form speech understanding.</p>

<p>Abstract: Learning navigation capabilities in different environments has long been one of the major challenges in decision-making. In this work, we focus on zero-shot navigation ability using given abstract $2$-D top-down maps. Like human navigation by reading a paper map, the agent reads the map as an image when navigating in a novel layout, after learning to navigate on a set of training maps. We propose a model-based reinforcement learning approach for this multi-task learning problem, where it jointly learns a hypermodel that takes top-down maps as input and predicts the weights of the transition network. We use the DeepMind Lab environment and customize layouts using generated maps. Our method can adapt better to novel environments in zero-shot and is more robust to noise.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gaojian Wang, Feng Lin, Tong Wu, Zhenguang Liu, Zhongjie Ba, Kui Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: This work asks: with abundant, unlabeled real faces, how to learn a robust and transferable facial representation that boosts various face security tasks with respect to generalization performance? We make the first attempt and propose a self-supervised pretraining framework to learn fundamental representations of real face images, FSFM, that leverages the synergy between masked image modeling (MIM) and instance discrimination (ID). We explore various facial masking strategies for MIM and present a simple yet powerful CRFR-P masking, which explicitly forces the model to capture meaningful intra-region consistency and challenging inter-region coherency. Furthermore, we devise the ID network that naturally couples with MIM to establish underlying local-to-global correspondence via tailored self-distillation. These three learning objectives, namely 3C, empower encoding both local features and global semantics of real faces. After pretraining, a vanilla ViT serves as a universal vision foundation model for downstream face security tasks: cross-dataset deepfake detection, cross-domain face anti-spoofing, and unseen diffusion facial forgery detection. Extensive experiments on 10 public datasets demonstrate that our model transfers better than supervised pretraining, visual and facial self-supervised learning arts, and even outperforms task-specialized SOTA methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ira Ceka, Feitong Qiao, Anik Dey, Aastha Valechia, Gail Kaiser, Baishakhi Ray</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite their remarkable success, large language models (LLMs) have shown limited ability on applied tasks such as vulnerability detection. We investigate various prompting strategies for vulnerability detection and, as part of this exploration, propose a prompting strategy that integrates natural language descriptions of vulnerabilities with a contrastive chain-of-thought reasoning approach, augmented using contrastive samples from a synthetic dataset. Our study highlights the potential of LLMs to detect vulnerabilities by integrating natural language descriptions, contrastive reasoning, and synthetic examples into a comprehensive prompting framework. Our results show that this approach can enhance LLM understanding of vulnerabilities. On a high-quality vulnerability detection dataset such as SVEN, our prompting strategies can improve accuracies, F1-scores, and pairwise accuracies by 23%, 11%, and 14%, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juli\'an N. Acosta, Siddhant Dogra, Subathra Adithan, Kay Wu, Michael Moritz, Stephen Kwak, Pranav Rajpurkar</p>
<p>Abstract: Radiologists face increasing workload pressures amid growing imaging volumes, creating risks of burnout and delayed reporting times. While artificial intelligence (AI) based automated radiology report generation shows promise for reporting workflow optimization, evidence of its real-world impact on clinical accuracy and efficiency remains limited. This study evaluated the effect of draft reports on radiology reporting workflows by conducting a three reader multi-case study comparing standard versus AI-assisted reporting workflows. In both workflows, radiologists reviewed the cases and modified either a standard template (standard workflow) or an AI-generated draft report (AI-assisted workflow) to create the final report. For controlled evaluation, we used GPT-4 to generate simulated AI drafts and deliberately introduced 1-3 errors in half the cases to mimic real AI system performance. The AI-assisted workflow significantly reduced average reporting time from 573 to 435 seconds (p=0.003), without a statistically significant difference in clinically significant errors between workflows. These findings suggest that AI-generated drafts can meaningfully accelerate radiology reporting while maintaining diagnostic accuracy, offering a practical solution to address mounting workload challenges in clinical practice.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eliot Xing, Vernon Luk, Jean Oh</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in GPU-based parallel simulation have enabled practitioners to collect large amounts of data and train complex control policies using deep reinforcement learning (RL), on commodity GPUs. However, such successes for RL in robotics have been limited to tasks sufficiently simulated by fast rigid-body dynamics. Simulation techniques for soft bodies are comparatively several orders of magnitude slower, thereby limiting the use of RL due to sample complexity requirements. To address this challenge, this paper presents both a novel RL algorithm and a simulation platform to enable scaling RL on tasks involving rigid bodies and deformables. We introduce Soft Analytic Policy Optimization (SAPO), a maximum entropy first-order model-based actor-critic RL algorithm, which uses first-order analytic gradients from differentiable simulation to train a stochastic actor to maximize expected return and entropy. Alongside our approach, we develop Rewarped, a parallel differentiable multiphysics simulation platform that supports simulating various materials beyond rigid bodies. We re-implement challenging manipulation and locomotion tasks in Rewarped, and show that SAPO outperforms baselines over a range of tasks that involve interaction between rigid bodies, articulations, and deformables.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guoxuan Chen, Han Shi, Jiawei Li, Yihang Gao, Xiaozhe Ren, Yimeng Chen, Xin Jiang, Zhenguo Li, Weiyang Liu, Chao Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited exceptional performance across a spectrum of natural language processing tasks. However, their substantial sizes pose considerable challenges, particularly in computational demands and inference speed, due to their quadratic complexity. In this work, we have identified a key pattern: certain seemingly meaningless special tokens (i.e., separators) contribute disproportionately to attention scores compared to semantically meaningful tokens. This observation suggests that information of the segments between these separator tokens can be effectively condensed into the separator tokens themselves without significant information loss. Guided by this insight, we introduce SepLLM, a plug-and-play framework that accelerates inference by compressing these segments and eliminating redundant tokens. Additionally, we implement efficient kernels for training acceleration. Experimental results across training-free, training-from-scratch, and post-training settings demonstrate SepLLM's effectiveness. Notably, using the Llama-3-8B backbone, SepLLM achieves over 50% reduction in KV cache on the GSM8K-CoT benchmark while maintaining comparable performance. Furthermore, in streaming settings, SepLLM effectively processes sequences of up to 4 million tokens or more while maintaining consistent language modeling capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bhavya Sukhija, Stelian Coros, Andreas Krause, Pieter Abbeel, Carmelo Sferrazza</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms aim to balance exploiting the current best strategy with exploring new options that could lead to higher rewards. Most common RL algorithms use undirected exploration, i.e., select random sequences of actions. Exploration can also be directed using intrinsic rewards, such as curiosity or model epistemic uncertainty. However, effectively balancing task and intrinsic rewards is challenging and often task-dependent. In this work, we introduce a framework, MaxInfoRL, for balancing intrinsic and extrinsic exploration. MaxInfoRL steers exploration towards informative transitions, by maximizing intrinsic rewards such as the information gain about the underlying task. When combined with Boltzmann exploration, this approach naturally trades off maximization of the value function with that of the entropy over states, rewards, and actions. We show that our approach achieves sublinear regret in the simplified setting of multi-armed bandits. We then apply this general formulation to a variety of off-policy model-free RL methods for continuous state-action spaces, yielding novel algorithms that achieve superior performance across hard exploration problems and complex scenarios such as visual control tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chung-Chin Shih, Ti-Rong Wu, Ting Han Wei, I-Chen Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Goal-achieving problems are puzzles that set up a specific situation with a clear objective. An example that is well-studied is the category of life-and-death (L&D) problems for Go, which helps players hone their skill of identifying region safety. Many previous methods like lambda search try null moves first, then derive so-called relevance zones (RZs), outside of which the opponent does not need to search. This paper first proposes a novel RZ-based approach, called the RZ-Based Search (RZS), to solving L&D problems for Go. RZS tries moves before determining whether they are null moves post-hoc. This means we do not need to rely on null move heuristics, resulting in a more elegant algorithm, so that it can also be seamlessly incorporated into AlphaZero's super-human level play in our solver. To repurpose AlphaZero for solving, we also propose a new training method called Faster to Life (FTL), which modifies AlphaZero to entice it to win more quickly. We use RZS and FTL to solve L&D problems on Go, namely solving 68 among 106 problems from a professional L&D book while a previous program solves 11 only. Finally, we discuss that the approach is generic in the sense that RZS is applicable to solving many other goal-achieving problems for board games.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingchen Xu, Stephanie Lee, Yong Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent scholarly work has extensively examined the phenomenon of algorithmic collusion driven by AI-enabled pricing algorithms. However, online platforms commonly deploy recommender systems that influence how consumers discover and purchase products, thereby shaping the reward structures faced by pricing algorithms and ultimately affecting competition dynamics and equilibrium outcomes. To address this gap in the literature and elucidate the role of recommender systems, we propose a novel repeated game framework that integrates several key components. We first develop a structural search model to characterize consumers' decision-making processes in response to varying recommendation sets. This model incorporates both observable and unobservable heterogeneity in utility and search cost functions, and is estimated using real-world data. Building on the resulting consumer model, we formulate personalized recommendation algorithms designed to maximize either platform revenue or consumer utility. We further introduce pricing algorithms for sellers and integrate all these elements to facilitate comprehensive numerical experiments. Our experimental findings reveal that a revenue-maximizing recommender system intensifies algorithmic collusion, whereas a utility-maximizing recommender system encourages more competitive pricing behavior among sellers. Intriguingly, and contrary to conventional insights from the industrial organization and choice modeling literature, increasing the size of recommendation sets under a utility-maximizing regime does not consistently enhance consumer utility. Moreover, the degree of horizontal differentiation moderates this phenomenon in unexpected ways. The "more is less" effect does not arise at low levels of differentiation, but becomes increasingly pronounced as horizontal differentiation increases.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multi-modal knowledge graph completion (MMKGC) aims to discover unobserved knowledge from given knowledge graphs, collaboratively leveraging structural information from the triples and multi-modal information of the entities to overcome the inherent incompleteness. Existing MMKGC methods usually extract multi-modal features with pre-trained models, resulting in coarse handling of multi-modal entity information, overlooking the nuanced, fine-grained semantic details and their complex interactions. To tackle this shortfall, we introduce a novel framework MyGO to tokenize, fuse, and augment the fine-grained multi-modal representations of entities and enhance the MMKGC performance. Motivated by the tokenization technology, MyGO tokenizes multi-modal entity information as fine-grained discrete tokens and learns entity representations with a cross-modal entity encoder. To further augment the multi-modal representations, MyGO incorporates fine-grained contrastive learning to highlight the specificity of the entity representations. Experiments on standard MMKGC benchmarks reveal that our method surpasses 19 of the latest models, underlining its superior performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cong Zhang, Derrick Goh Xin Deik, Dexun Li, Hao Zhang, Yong Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of neural language models has sparked a new surge of intelligent agent research. Unlike traditional agents, large language model-based agents (LLM agents) have emerged as a promising paradigm for achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI) due to their superior reasoning and generalization capabilities. Effective planning is crucial for the success of LLM agents in real-world tasks, making it a highly pursued topic in the community. Current planning methods typically translate tasks into executable action sequences. However, determining a feasible or optimal sequence for complex tasks with multiple constraints at fine granularity, which often requires compositing long chains of heterogeneous actions, remains challenging. This paper introduces Planning with Multi-Constraints (PMC), a zero-shot methodology for collaborative LLM-based multi-agent systems that simplifies complex task planning with constraints by decomposing it into a hierarchy of subordinate tasks. Each subtask is then mapped into executable actions. PMC was assessed on two constraint-intensive benchmarks, TravelPlanner and API-Bank. Notably, PMC achieved an average 42.68% success rate on TravelPlanner, significantly higher than GPT-4 (2.92%), and outperforming GPT-4 with ReAct on API-Bank by 13.64%, showing the immense potential of integrating LLM with multi-agent systems. We also show that PMC works with small LLM as the planning core, e.g., LLaMA-3.1-8B.</p>

<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming scientific research, with explainable AI methods like concept-based models (CMs) showing promise for new discoveries. However, in molecular science, CMs are less common than black-box models like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), due to their need for predefined concepts and manual labeling. This paper introduces the Automated Molecular Concept (AutoMolCo) framework, which leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically generate and label predictive molecular concepts. Through iterative concept refinement, AutoMolCo enables simple linear models to outperform GNNs and LLM in-context learning on several benchmarks. The framework operates without human knowledge input, overcoming limitations of existing CMs while maintaining explainability and allowing easy intervention. Experiments on MoleculeNet and High-Throughput Experimentation (HTE) datasets demonstrate that AutoMolCo-induced explainable CMs are beneficial for molecular science research.</p>

<p>Abstract: Advanced analytics science methods have enabled combining the power of artificial and human intelligence, creating \textit{centaurs} that allow superior decision-making. Centaurs are hybrid human-algorithm models that combine both formal analytics and human intuition in a symbiotic manner within their learning and reasoning process. We argue that the future of AI development and use in many domains needs to focus more on centaurs as opposed to other AI approaches. This paradigm shift towards centaur-based AI methods raises some fundamental questions: How are centaurs different from other human-in-the-loop methods? What are the most effective methods for creating centaurs? When should centaurs be used, and when should the lead be given to pure AI models? Doesn't the incorporation of human intuition -- which at times can be misleading -- in centaurs' decision-making process degrade its performance compared to pure AI methods? This work aims to address these fundamental questions, focusing on recent advancements in generative AI, and especially in Large Language Models (LLMs), as a main case study to illustrate centaurs' critical essentiality to future AI endeavors.</p>

<p>Abstract: Video language continual learning involves continuously adapting to information from video and text inputs, enhancing a model's ability to handle new tasks while retaining prior knowledge. This field is a relatively under-explored area, and establishing appropriate datasets is crucial for facilitating communication and research in this field. In this study, we present the first dedicated benchmark, ViLCo-Bench, designed to evaluate continual learning models across a range of video-text tasks. The dataset comprises ten-minute-long videos and corresponding language queries collected from publicly available datasets. Additionally, we introduce a novel memory-efficient framework that incorporates self-supervised learning and mimics long-term and short-term memory effects. This framework addresses challenges including memory complexity from long video clips, natural language complexity from open queries, and text-video misalignment. We posit that ViLCo-Bench, with greater complexity compared to existing continual learning benchmarks, would serve as a critical tool for exploring the video-language domain, extending beyond conventional class-incremental tasks, and addressing complex and limited annotation issues.

<p>Abstract: On-device inference for Large Language Models (LLMs), driven by increasing privacy concerns and advancements of mobile-sized models, has gained significant interest. However, even mobile-sized LLMs (e.g., Gemma-2B) encounter unacceptably high inference latency, often bottlenecked by the prefill stage in tasks like screen UI understanding.
  We present llm.npu, the first LLM inference system utilizing on-device Neural Processing Unit (NPU) offloading to reduce prefill latency. llm.npu enhances NPU offloading efficiency by re-constructing the prompt and model in three levels: (1) At prompt level, it divides variable-length prompts into multiple fixed-sized chunks while maintaining data dependencies; (2) At tensor level, it identifies and extracts significant outliers to run on the CPU/GPU in parallel with minimal overhead; (3) At block level, it schedules Transformer blocks in an out-of-order manner to the CPU/GPU and NPU based on their hardware affinity and sensitivity to accuracy. Compared to competitive baselines, llm.npu achieves 22.4x faster prefill speed and 30.7$\times$ energy savings on average, and up to 32.8x speedup in an end-to-end real-world application. For the first time, llm.npu achieves more than 1,000 tokens/sec prefilling for a billion-sized model.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent years, multi-hop reasoning has been widely studied for knowledge graph (KG) reasoning due to its efficacy and interpretability. However, previous multi-hop reasoning approaches are subject to two primary shortcomings. First, agents struggle to learn effective and robust policies at the early phase due to sparse rewards. Second, these approaches often falter on specific datasets like sparse knowledge graphs, where agents are required to traverse lengthy reasoning paths. To address these problems, we propose a multi-hop reasoning model with dual agents based on hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL), which is named FULORA. FULORA tackles the above reasoning challenges by eFficient GUidance-ExpLORAtion between dual agents. The high-level agent walks on the simplified knowledge graph to provide stage-wise hints for the low-level agent walking on the original knowledge graph. In this framework, the low-level agent optimizes a value function that balances two objectives: (1) maximizing return, and (2) integrating efficient guidance from the high-level agent. Experiments conducted on three real-word knowledge graph datasets demonstrate that FULORA outperforms RL-based baselines, especially in the case of long-distance reasoning.</p>

This paper introduces the Chat Game Engine (ChatGE) powered by LLM, which allows everyone to develop a custom game using natural language through Human-LLM interaction. To enable an LLM to function as a ChatGE, we instruct it to perform the following processes in each turn: (1) $P_{script}$: configure the game script segment based on the user's input; (2) $P_{code}$: generate the corresponding code snippet based on the game script segment; (3) $P_{utter}$: interact with the user, including guidance and feedback. We propose a data synthesis pipeline based on LLM to generate game script-code pairs and interactions from a few manually crafted seed data. We propose a three-stage progressive training strategy to transfer the dialogue-based LLM to our ChatGE smoothly. We construct a ChatGE for poker games as a case study and comprehensively evaluate it from two perspectives: interaction quality and code correctness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruihui Hou, Shencheng Chen, Yongqi Fan, Guangya Yu, Lifeng Zhu, Jing Sun, Jingping Liu, Tong Ruan</p>
<p>Abstract: Clinical diagnosis is critical in medical practice, typically requiring a continuous and evolving process that includes primary diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and final diagnosis. However, most existing clinical diagnostic tasks are single-step processes, which does not align with the complex multi-step diagnostic procedures found in real-world clinical settings. In this paper, we propose a Chinese clinical diagnostic benchmark, called MSDiagnosis. This benchmark consists of 2,225 cases from 12 departments, covering tasks such as primary diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and final diagnosis. Additionally, we propose a novel and effective framework. This framework combines forward inference, backward inference, reflection, and refinement, enabling the large language model to self-evaluate and adjust its diagnostic results. To this end, we test open-source models, closed-source models, and our proposed framework.The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. We also provide a comprehensive experimental analysis and suggest future research directions for this task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haotian Peng, Jiawei Liu, Jinsong Du, Jie Gao, Wei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a bearing health management framework leveraging large language models (BearLLM), a novel multimodal model that unifies multiple bearing-related tasks by processing user prompts and vibration signals. Specifically, we introduce a prior knowledge-enhanced unified vibration signal representation to handle various working conditions across multiple datasets. This involves adaptively sampling the vibration signals based on the sampling rate of the sensor, incorporating the frequency domain to unify input dimensions, and using a fault-free reference signal as an auxiliary input. To extract features from vibration signals, we first train a fault classification network, then convert and align the extracted features into word embedding, and finally concatenate these with text embedding as input to an LLM. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we constructed the first large-scale multimodal bearing health management (MBHM) dataset, including paired vibration signals and textual descriptions. With our unified vibration signal representation, BearLLM using one set of pre-trained weights achieves state-of-the-art performance on nine publicly available fault diagnosis benchmarks, outperforming specific methods designed for individual datasets. We provide a dataset, our model, and code to inspire future research on building more capable industrial multimodal models https://github.com/SIA-IDE/BearLLM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xia Jiang, Yaoxin Wu, Yuan Wang, Yingqian Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: To advance capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in solving combinatorial optimization problems (COPs), this paper presents the Language-based Neural COP Solver (LNCS), a novel framework that is unified for the end-to-end resolution of diverse text-attributed COPs. LNCS leverages LLMs to encode problem instances into a unified semantic space, and integrates their embeddings with a Transformer-based solution generator to produce high-quality solutions. By training the solution generator with conflict-free multi-task reinforcement learning, LNCS effectively enhances LLM performance in tackling COPs of varying types and sizes, achieving state-of-the-art results across diverse problems. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and generalizability of the LNCS, highlighting its potential as a unified and practical framework for real-world COP applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Timothy Bennett, Sean Welsh, Anna Ciaunica</p>
<p>Abstract: We tackle the hard problem of consciousness taking the naturally selected, embodied organism as our starting point. We provide a formalism describing how biological systems self-organise to hierarchically interpret unlabelled sensory information according to valence. Such interpretations imply behavioural policies which are differentiated from each other only by the qualitative aspect of information processing. Natural selection favours systems that intervene in the world to achieve homeostatic and reproductive goals. Quality is a property arising in such systems to link cause to affect to motivate interventions. This produces interoceptive and exteroceptive classifiers and determines priorities. In formalising the seminal distinction between access and phenomenal consciousness, we claim that access consciousness at the human level requires the ability to hierarchically model i) the self, ii) the world/others and iii) the self as modelled by others, and that this requires phenomenal consciousness. Phenomenal without access consciousness is likely common, but the reverse is implausible. To put it provocatively: death grounds meaning, and Nature does not like zombies. We then describe the multilayered architecture of self-organisation from rocks to Einstein, illustrating how our argument applies. Our proposal lays the foundation of a formal science of consciousness, closer to human fact than zombie fiction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongzhe Huang, Jiang Liu, Zhewen Yu, Li Cai, Dian Jiao, Wenqiao Zhang, Siliang Tang, Juncheng Li, Hao Jiang, Haoyuan Li, Yueting Zhuang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), such as LLaVA-series models, are driven by massive machine-generated instruction-following data tuning. Such automatic instruction collection pipelines, however, inadvertently introduce significant variability in data quality. This paper introduces a novel instruction curation algorithm, derived from two unique perspectives, human and LLM preference alignment, to compress this vast corpus of machine-generated multimodal instructions to a compact and high-quality form: (i) For human preference alignment, we have collected a machine-generated multimodal instruction dataset and established a comprehensive set of both subjective and objective criteria to guide the data quality assessment critically from human experts. By doing so, a reward model was trained on the annotated dataset to internalize the nuanced human understanding of instruction alignment. (ii) For LLM preference alignment, given the instruction selected by the reward model, we propose leveraging the inner LLM used in MLLM to align the writing style of visual instructions with that of the inner LLM itself, resulting in LLM-aligned instruction improvement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that we can maintain or even improve model performance by compressing synthetic multimodal instructions by up to 90%. Impressively, by aggressively reducing the training instructions from 158k to 14k (9$\times$ smaller), our model consistently outperforms its full-size dataset counterpart across various MLLM benchmarks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dezhi Luo, Haiyun Lyu, Qingying Gao, Haoran Sun, Yijiang Li, Hokin Deng</p>
<p>Abstract: Conservation is a critical milestone of cognitive development considered to be supported by both the understanding of quantitative concepts and the reversibility of mental operations. To assess whether this critical component of human intelligence has emerged in Vision Language Models, we leverage the ConserveBench from CogDevelop2K, a data-intensive cognitive experiment benchmark for assaying the developmental trajectory of machine intelligence. The battery includes over 350 questions across four dimensions of physical quantities: volume, solid quantity, length, and number. The former two involve only transformational tasks, whereas the latter two also involve non-transformational tasks assessing the understanding of quantitative concepts alone. Surprisingly, we find that while VLMs are generally capable of conserving, they tend to fail at non-transformational tasks which success is typically considered to be entailed by the ability to conserve. This implies that the law of conservation, at least in concrete domains, may exist without corresponding conceptual understanding of quantity. $\href{https://growing-ai-like-a-child.github.io/pages/Conservation/}{Website}$</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanrong Zhang, Xinyue Wang, Jiabao Pan, Hongwei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge graph (KG) technology is extensively utilized in many areas, and many companies offer applications based on KG. Nonetheless, most KG platforms necessitate expertise and tremendous time and effort from users to construct KG records manually, which poses great difficulties for ordinary people. Additionally, audio data is abundant and holds valuable information, but it is challenging to transform it into a KG. What's more, the platforms usually do not leverage the full potential of the KGs constructed by users. In this paper, we propose an intelligent and user-friendly platform for Semi-automated KG Construction and Application (SAKA) to address the aforementioned problems. Primarily, users can semi-automatically construct KGs from structured data of numerous areas by interacting with the platform, based on which multi-versions of KG can be stored, viewed, managed, and updated. Moreover, we propose an Audio-based KG Information Extraction (AGIE) method to establish KGs from audio data. Lastly, the platform creates a semantic parsing-based knowledge base question answering (KBQA) system based on the user-created KGs. We prove the feasibility of the semi-automatic KG construction method on the SAKA platform.</p>

<p>Abstract: Since the earliest proposals for neural network models of the mind and brain, critics have pointed out key weaknesses in these models compared to human cognitive abilities. Here we review recent work that uses metalearning to overcome several classic challenges by addressing the Problem of Incentive and Practice -- that is, providing machines with both incentives to improve specific skills and opportunities to practice those skills. This explicit optimization contrasts with more conventional approaches that hope the desired behavior will emerge through optimizing related but different objectives. We review applications of this principle to addressing four classic challenges for neural networks: systematic generalization, catastrophic forgetting, few-shot learning and multi-step reasoning. We also discuss the prospects for understanding aspects of human development through this framework, and whether natural environments provide the right incentives and practice for learning how to make challenging generalizations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Antonis Antoniades, Albert \"Orwall, Kexun Zhang, Yuxi Xie, Anirudh Goyal, William Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Software engineers operating in complex and dynamic environments must continuously adapt to evolving requirements, learn iteratively from experience, and reconsider their approaches based on new insights. However, current large language model (LLM)-based software agents often rely on rigid processes and tend to repeat ineffective actions without the capacity to evaluate their performance or adapt their strategies over time. To address these challenges, we propose SWE-Search, a multi-agent framework that integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with a self-improvement mechanism to enhance software agents' performance on repository-level software tasks. SWE-Search extends traditional MCTS by incorporating a hybrid value function that leverages LLMs for both numerical value estimation and qualitative evaluation. This enables self-feedback loops where agents iteratively refine their strategies based on both quantitative numerical evaluations and qualitative natural language assessments of pursued trajectories. The framework includes a SWE-Agent for adaptive exploration, a Value Agent for iterative feedback, and a Discriminator Agent that facilitates multi-agent debate for collaborative decision-making. Applied to the SWE-bench benchmark, our approach demonstrates a 23% relative improvement in performance across five models compared to standard open-source agents without MCTS. Our analysis reveals how performance scales with increased search depth and identifies key factors that facilitate effective self-evaluation in software agents. This work highlights the potential of self-evaluation driven search techniques to enhance agent reasoning and planning in complex, dynamic software engineering environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Caleb J. S. Barr, Olivia Erdelyi, Paul D. Docherty, Randolph C. Grace</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent regulatory proposals for artificial intelligence emphasize fairness requirements for machine learning models. However, precisely defining the appropriate measure of fairness is challenging due to philosophical, cultural and political contexts. Biases can infiltrate machine learning models in complex ways depending on the model's context, rendering a single common metric of fairness insufficient. This ambiguity highlights the need for criteria to guide the selection of context-aware measures, an issue of increasing importance given the proliferation of ever tighter regulatory requirements. To address this, we developed a flowchart to guide the selection of contextually appropriate fairness measures. Twelve criteria were used to formulate the flowchart. This included consideration of model assessment criteria, model selection criteria, and data bias. We also review fairness literature in the context of machine learning and link it to core regulatory instruments to assist policymakers, AI developers, researchers, and other stakeholders in appropriately addressing fairness concerns and complying with relevant regulatory requirements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaodong Chen, Yuxuan Hu, Xiaokang Zhang, Yanling Wang, Cuiping Li, Hong Chen, Jing Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Pruning has become a widely adopted technique for reducing the hardware requirements of large language models (LLMs). To recover model performance after pruning, post-training is commonly employed to mitigate the resulting performance degradation. While post-training benefits from larger datasets, once the dataset size is already substantial, increasing the training data provides only limited performance gains. To balance post-training cost and model performance, it is necessary to explore the optimal amount of post-training data.Through extensive experiments on the Llama-3 and Qwen-2.5 series models, pruned using various common pruning methods, we uncover the scaling \textbf{Law} for \textbf{P}ost-training after model \textbf{P}runing, referred to as the P$^2$ Law.This law identifies four key factors for predicting the pruned model's post-training loss: the model size before pruning, the number of post-training tokens, the pruning rate, and the model's loss before pruning. Moreover, P$^2$ Law can generalize to larger dataset sizes, larger model sizes, and higher pruning rates, offering valuable insights for the post-training of pruned LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tingjia Shen, Hao Wang, Chuhan Wu, Jin Yao Chin, Wei Guo, Yong Liu, Huifeng Guo, Defu Lian, Ruiming Tang, Enhong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Sequential Recommendation (SR) plays a critical role in predicting users' sequential preferences. Despite its growing prominence in various industries, the increasing scale of SR models incurs substantial computational costs and unpredictability, challenging developers to manage resources efficiently. Under this predicament, Scaling Laws have achieved significant success by examining the loss as models scale up. However, there remains a disparity between loss and model performance, which is of greater concern in practical applications. Moreover, as data continues to expand, it incorporates repetitive and inefficient data. In response, we introduce the Performance Law for SR models, which aims to theoretically investigate and model the relationship between model performance and data quality. Specifically, we first fit the HR and NDCG metrics to transformer-based SR models. Subsequently, we propose Approximate Entropy (ApEn) to assess data quality, presenting a more nuanced approach compared to traditional data quantity metrics. Our method enables accurate predictions across various dataset scales and model sizes, demonstrating a strong correlation in large SR models and offering insights into achieving optimal performance for any given model configuration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maximilian P Niroomand, David J Wales</p>
<p>Abstract: The ability to explain decisions made by machine learning models remains one of the most significant hurdles towards widespread adoption of AI in highly sensitive areas such as medicine, cybersecurity or autonomous driving. Great interest exists in understanding which features of the input data prompt model decision making. In this contribution, we propose a novel approach to identify relevant features of the input data, inspired by methods from the energy landscapes field, developed in the physical sciences. By identifying conserved weights within groups of minima of the loss landscapes, we can identify the drivers of model decision making. Analogues to this idea exist in the molecular sciences, where coordinate invariants or order parameters are employed to identify critical features of a molecule. However, no such approach exists for machine learning loss landscapes. We will demonstrate the applicability of energy landscape methods to machine learning models and give examples, both synthetic and from the real world, for how these methods can help to make models more interpretable.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhinav Bhatia, Samer B. Nashed, Shlomo Zilberstein</p>
<p>Abstract: Meta reinforcement learning (meta-RL) methods such as RL$^2$ have emerged as promising approaches for learning data-efficient RL algorithms tailored to a given task distribution. However, they show poor asymptotic performance and struggle with out-of-distribution tasks because they rely on sequence models, such as recurrent neural networks or transformers, to process experiences rather than summarize them using general-purpose RL components such as value functions. In contrast, traditional RL algorithms are data-inefficient as they do not use domain knowledge, but do converge to an optimal policy in the limit. We propose RL$^3$, a principled hybrid approach that incorporates action-values, learned per task via traditional RL, in the inputs to meta-RL. We show that RL$^3$ earns greater cumulative reward in the long term compared to RL$^2$ while drastically reducing meta-training time and generalizes better to out-of-distribution tasks. Experiments are conducted on both custom and benchmark discrete domains from the meta-RL literature that exhibit a range of short-term, long-term, and complex dependencies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenyang Qiu, Guoshun Nan, Hongrui Xia, Zheng Weng, Xueting Wang, Meng Shen, Xiaofeng Tao, Jun Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Network-based intrusion detection system (NIDS) monitors network traffic for malicious activities, forming the frontline defense against increasing attacks over information infrastructures. Although promising, our quantitative analysis shows that existing methods perform inconsistently in declaring various attacks, and perform poorly in few-shot intrusion detections. We reveal that the underlying cause is entangled distributions of flow features. This motivates us to propose DIDS-MFL, a disentangled intrusion detection method to handle various intrusion detection scenarios. DIDS-MFL involves two key components, respectively: a double Disentanglementbased Intrusion Detection System (DIDS) and a plug-and-play Multi-scale Few-shot Learning-based (MFL) intrusion detection module. Specifically, the proposed DIDS first disentangles traffic features by a non-parameterized optimization, automatically differentiating tens and hundreds of complex features of various attacks. Such differentiated features will be further disentangled to highlight the attack-specific features. Our DIDS additionally uses a novel graph diffusion method that dynamically fuses the network topology in evolving data streams. Furthermore, the proposed MFL involves an alternating optimization framework to address the entangled representations in few-shot traffic threats with rigorous derivation. MFL first captures multiscale information in latent space to distinguish attack-specific information and then optimizes the disentanglement term to highlight the attack-specific information. Finally, MFL fuses and alternately solves them in an end-to-end way. Experiments show the superiority of our proposed DIDS-MFL. Our code is available at https://github.com/qcydm/DIDS-MFL</p>

Rendering datasets as text, however, could help aggregate diverse and multi-modal scientific data into a single training corpus, thereby potentially facilitating the development of foundation models for science. In this work, we introduce xVal, a strategy for continuously tokenizing numbers within language models that results in a more appropriate inductive bias for scientific applications. By training specially-modified language models from scratch on a variety of scientific datasets formatted as text, we find that xVal generally outperforms other common numerical tokenization strategies on metrics including out-of-distribution generalization and computational efficiency.</p>

Our study provides concrete evidence for this erasure phenomenon in a 4-layer transformer, identifying heads that consistently remove the output of earlier heads.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yao Yao, Peike Li, Boyu Chen, Alex Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: With rapid advances in generative artificial intelligence, the text-to-music synthesis task has emerged as a promising direction for music generation. Nevertheless, achieving precise control over multi-track generation remains an open challenge. While existing models excel in directly generating multi-track mix, their limitations become evident when it comes to composing individual tracks and integrating them in a controllable manner. This departure from the typical workflows of professional composers hinders the ability to refine details in specific tracks. To address this gap, we propose JEN-1 Composer, a unified framework designed to efficiently model marginal, conditional, and joint distributions over multi-track music using a single model. Building upon an audio latent diffusion model, JEN-1 Composer extends the versatility of multi-track music generation. We introduce a progressive curriculum training strategy, which gradually escalates the difficulty of training tasks while ensuring the model's generalization ability and facilitating smooth transitions between different scenarios. During inference, users can iteratively generate and select music tracks, thus incrementally composing entire musical pieces in accordance with the Human-AI co-composition workflow. Our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in controllable and high-fidelity multi-track music synthesis, marking a significant advancement in interactive AI-assisted music creation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Ferdous Alam, Parinaz Naghizadeh, David Hoelzle</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) enables sequential decision-making in complex and high-dimensional environments through interaction with the environment. In most real-world applications, however, a high number of interactions are infeasible. In these environments, transfer RL algorithms, which can be used for the transfer of knowledge from one or multiple source environments to a target environment, have been shown to increase learning speed and improve initial and asymptotic performance. However, most existing transfer RL algorithms are on-policy and sample inefficient, fail in adversarial target tasks, and often require heuristic choices in algorithm design. This paper proposes an off-policy Advantage-based Policy Transfer algorithm, APT-RL, for fixed domain environments. Its novelty is in using the popular notion of ``advantage'' as a regularizer, to weigh the knowledge that should be transferred from the source, relative to new knowledge learned in the target, removing the need for heuristic choices. Further, we propose a new transfer performance measure to evaluate the performance of our algorithm and unify existing transfer RL frameworks. Finally, we present a scalable, theoretically-backed task similarity measurement algorithm to illustrate the alignments between our proposed transferability measure and similarities between source and target environments. We compare APT-RL with several baselines, including existing transfer-RL algorithms, in three high-dimensional continuous control tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that APT-RL outperforms existing transfer RL algorithms and is at least as good as learning from scratch in adversarial tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Visual programming has the potential of providing novice programmers with a low-code experience to build customized processing pipelines. Existing systems typically require users to build pipelines from scratch, implying that novice users are expected to set up and link appropriate nodes from a blank workspace. In this paper, we introduce InstructPipe, an AI assistant for prototyping machine learning (ML) pipelines with text instructions. We contribute two large language model (LLM) modules and a code interpreter as part of our framework. The LLM modules generate pseudocode for a target pipeline, and the interpreter renders the pipeline in the node-graph editor for further human-AI collaboration. Both technical and user evaluation (N=16) shows that InstructPipe empowers users to streamline their ML pipeline workflow, reduce their learning curve, and leverage open-ended commands to spark innovative ideas.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sarthak Choudhary, Aashish Kolluri, Prateek Saxena</p>
<p>Abstract: Training modern neural networks or models typically requires averaging over a sample of high-dimensional vectors. Poisoning attacks can skew or bias the average vectors used to train the model, forcing the model to learn specific patterns or avoid learning anything useful. Byzantine robust aggregation is a principled algorithmic defense against such biasing. Robust aggregators can bound the maximum bias in computing centrality statistics, such as mean, even when some fraction of inputs are arbitrarily corrupted. Designing such aggregators is challenging when dealing with high dimensions. However, the first polynomial-time algorithms with strong theoretical bounds on the bias have recently been proposed. Their bounds are independent of the number of dimensions, promising a conceptual limit on the power of poisoning attacks in their ongoing arms race against defenses.
  In this paper, we show a new attack called HIDRA on practical realization of strong defenses which subverts their claim of dimension-independent bias. HIDRA highlights a novel computational bottleneck that has not been a concern of prior information-theoretic analysis. Our experimental evaluation shows that our attacks almost completely destroy the model performance, whereas existing attacks with the same goal fail to have much effect. Our findings leave the arms race between poisoning attacks and provable defenses wide open.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoxiong Liu, Yifan Zhang, Yifan Luo, Andrew Chi-Chih Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the advancements in large language models (LLMs) for mathematical reasoning, solving competition-level math problems remains a significant challenge, especially for open-source LLMs without external tools. We introduce the MMIQC dataset, comprising a mixture of processed web data and synthetic question-response pairs, aimed at enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of base language models. Models fine-tuned on MMIQC consistently surpass their counterparts in performance on the MATH benchmark across various model sizes. Notably, Qwen-72B-MMIQC achieves a 45.0% accuracy, exceeding the previous open-source state-of-the-art by 8.2% and outperforming the initial version GPT-4 released in 2023. Extensive evaluation results on Hungarian high school finals suggest that such improvement can generalize to unseen data. Our ablation study on MMIQC reveals that a large part of the improvement can be attributed to our novel augmentation method, Iterative Question Composing (IQC), which involves iteratively composing new questions from seed problems using an LLM and applying rejection sampling through another LLM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ian Gemp, Roma Patel, Yoram Bachrach, Marc Lanctot, Vibhavari Dasagi, Luke Marris, Georgios Piliouras, Siqi Liu, Karl Tuyls</p>
<p>Abstract: Mathematical models of interactions among rational agents have long been studied in game theory. However these interactions are often over a small set of discrete game actions which is very different from how humans communicate in natural language. To bridge this gap, we introduce a framework that allows equilibrium solvers to work over the space of natural language dialogue generated by large language models (LLMs). Specifically, by modelling the players, strategies and payoffs in a "game" of dialogue, we create a binding from natural language interactions to the conventional symbolic logic of game theory. Given this binding, we can ask existing game-theoretic algorithms to provide us with strategic solutions (e.g., what string an LLM should generate to maximize payoff in the face of strategic partners or opponents), giving us predictors of stable, rational conversational strategies. We focus on three domains that require different negotiation strategies: scheduling meetings, trading fruit and debate, and evaluate an LLM's generated language when guided by solvers. We see that LLMs that follow game-theory solvers result in dialogue generations that are less exploitable than the control (no guidance from solvers), and the language generated results in higher rewards, in all negotiation domains. We discuss future implications of this work, and how game-theoretic solvers that can leverage the expressivity of natural language can open up a new avenue of guiding language research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sairam Sri Vatsavai, Venkata Sai Praneeth Karempudi, Ishan Thakkar</p>
<p>Abstract: Several photonic microring resonators (MRRs) based analog accelerators have been proposed to accelerate the inference of integer-quantized CNNs with remarkably higher throughput and energy efficiency compared to their electronic counterparts. However, the existing analog photonic accelerators suffer from three shortcomings: (i) severe hampering of wavelength parallelism due to various crosstalk effects, (ii) inflexibility of supporting various dataflows other than the weight-stationary dataflow, and (iii) failure in fully leveraging the ability of photodetectors to perform in-situ accumulations. These shortcomings collectively hamper the performance and energy efficiency of prior accelerators. To tackle these shortcomings, we present a novel Hybrid timE Amplitude aNalog optical Accelerator, called HEANA. HEANA employs hybrid time-amplitude analog optical multipliers (TAOMs) that increase the flexibility of HEANA to support multiple dataflows. A spectrally hitless arrangement of TAOMs significantly reduces the crosstalk effects, thereby increasing the wavelength parallelism in HEANA. Moreover, HEANA employs our invented balanced photo-charge accumulators (BPCAs) that enable buffer-less, in-situ, temporal accumulations to eliminate the need to use reduction networks in HEANA, relieving it from related latency and energy overheads. Our evaluation for the inference of four modern CNNs indicates that HEANA provides improvements of atleast 66x and 84x in frames-per-second (FPS) and FPS/W (energy-efficiency), respectively, for equal-area comparisons, on gmean over two MRR-based analog CNN accelerators from prior work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junjie Chu, Yugeng Liu, Ziqing Yang, Xinyue Shen, Michael Backes, Yang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Jailbreak attacks aim to bypass the safeguards of LLMs. While researchers have studied different jailbreak attacks in depth, they have done so in isolation -- either with unaligned experiment settings or comparing a limited range of methods. To fill this gap, we present the first large-scale measurement of various jailbreak attack methods. We collect 17 cutting-edge jailbreak methods, summarize their features, and establish a novel jailbreak attack taxonomy. Based on eight popular censored LLMs and 160 questions from 16 violation categories, we conduct a unified and impartial assessment of attack effectiveness as well as a comprehensive ablation study. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that all the jailbreak attacks have a powerful effect on the LLMs. This indicates that all LLMs fail to cover all the violation categories, and they are susceptible to significant jailbreak risks, with even the well-aligned Llama3 facing a maximum attack success rate of 0.88. Additionally, we test jailbreak attacks under eight advanced external defenses and find none of the defenses could mitigate the jailbreak attacks entirely. Our study offers valuable insights for future research on jailbreak attacks and defenses and serves as a benchmark tool for researchers and practitioners to evaluate them effectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lingzhi Wang, Xingshan Zeng, Jinsong Guo, Kam-Fai Wong, Georg Gottlob</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper explores Machine Unlearning (MU), an emerging field that is gaining increased attention due to concerns about neural models unintentionally remembering personal or sensitive information. We present SeUL, a novel method that enables selective and fine-grained unlearning for language models. Unlike previous work that employs a fully reversed training objective in unlearning, SeUL minimizes the negative impact on the capability of language models, particularly in terms of generation. Furthermore, we introduce two innovative evaluation metrics, sensitive extraction likelihood (S-EL) and sensitive memorization accuracy (S-MA), specifically designed to assess the effectiveness of forgetting sensitive information. In support of the unlearning framework, we propose efficient automatic online and offline sensitive span annotation methods. The online selection method, based on language probability scores, ensures computational efficiency, while the offline annotation involves a two-stage LLM-based process for robust verification. In summary, this paper contributes a novel selective unlearning method (SeUL), introduces specialized evaluation metrics (S-EL and S-MA) for assessing sensitive information forgetting, and proposes automatic online and offline sensitive span annotation methods to support the overall unlearning framework and evaluation process.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fali Wang, Runxue Bao, Suhang Wang, Wenchao Yu, Yanchi Liu, Wei Cheng, Haifeng Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved exceptional capabilities in open generation across various domains, yet they encounter difficulties with tasks that require intensive knowledge. To address these challenges, methods for integrating knowledge have been developed, which augment LLMs with domain-specific knowledge graphs through external modules. These approaches, however, face data inefficiency issues as they necessitate the processing of both known and unknown knowledge for fine-tuning. Thus, our research focuses on a novel problem: efficiently integrating unknown knowledge into LLMs without unnecessary overlap of known knowledge. A risk of introducing new knowledge is the potential forgetting of existing knowledge. To mitigate this risk, we propose the innovative {\method} framework. This framework employs transformer internal states to determine when to enrich LLM outputs with additional information, effectively preventing knowledge forgetting. Performance evaluations using the UMLS-2.5k and MetaQA domain knowledge graphs reveal that {\method} not only successfully integrates new knowledge but also outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, reducing knowledge forgetting by 9\% and 6\%, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kazuki Hayashi, Kazuma Onishi, Toma Suzuki, Yusuke Ide, Seiji Gobara, Shigeki Saito, Yusuke Sakai, Hidetaka Kamigaito, Katsuhiko Hayashi, Taro Watanabe</p>
<p>Abstract: Large-scale Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) process both images and text, excelling in multimodal tasks such as image captioning and description generation. However, while these models excel at generating factual content, their ability to generate and evaluate texts reflecting perspectives on the same image, depending on the context, has not been sufficiently explored. To address this, we propose IRR: Image Review Rank, a novel evaluation framework designed to assess critic review texts from multiple perspectives. IRR evaluates LVLMs by measuring how closely their judgments align with human interpretations. We validate it using a dataset of images from 15 categories, each with five critic review texts and annotated rankings in both English and Japanese, totaling over 2,000 data instances. The datasets are available at https://hf.co/datasets/naist-nlp/Wiki-ImageReview1.0. Our results indicate that, although LVLMs exhibited consistent performance across languages, their correlation with human annotations was insufficient, highlighting the need for further advancements. These findings highlight the limitations of current evaluation methods and the need for approaches that better capture human reasoning in Vision & Language tasks.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12928">A Literature Review of Literature Reviews in Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Penghai Zhao, Xin Zhang, Jiayue Cao, Ming-Ming Cheng, Jian Yang, Xiang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancements in Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (PAMI) have led to an overwhelming expansion of scientific knowledge, spawning numerous literature reviews aimed at collecting and synthesizing fragmented information. This paper presents a thorough analysis of these literature reviews within the PAMI field, and tries to address three core research questions: (1) What are the prevalent structural and statistical characteristics of PAMI literature reviews? (2) What strategies can researchers employ to efficiently navigate the growing corpus of reviews? (3) What are the advantages and limitations of AI-generated reviews compared to human-authored ones? To address the first research question, we begin with a narrative overview to highlight common preferences in composing PAMI reviews, followed by a statistical analysis to quantitatively uncover patterns in these preferences. Our findings reveal several key insights. First, fewer than 20% of PAMI reviews currently comply with PRISMA standards, although this proportion is gradually increasing. Second, there is a moderate positive correlation between the quality of references and the scholarly impact of reviews, emphasizing the importance of reference selection. To further assist researchers in efficiently managing the rapidly growing number of literature reviews, we introduce four novel, real-time, article-level bibliometric indicators that facilitate the screening of numerous reviews. Finally, our comparative analysis reveals that AI-generated reviews currently fall short of human-authored ones in accurately evaluating the academic significance of newly published articles and integrating rich visual elements, which limits their practical utility. Overall, this study provides a deeper understanding of PAMI literature reviews by uncovering key trends, evaluating current practices, and highlighting areas for future improvement.</p>

<p>Abstract: Open-ended question answering requires models to find appropriate evidence to form wellreasoned, comprehensive and helpful answers. In practical applications, models also need to engage in extended discussions on potential scenarios closely relevant to the question. With augmentation of retrieval module, open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) can produce coherent answers often with different focuses, but are still sub-optimal in terms of reliable evidence selection and in-depth question analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel Chain-ofDiscussion framework to leverage the synergy among multiple open-source LLMs aiming to provide more correct and more comprehensive answers for open-ended QA, although they are not strong enough individually. Our experiments show that discussions among multiple LLMs play a vital role in enhancing the quality of answers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Neha Verma, Maha Elbayad</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent work on permutation-based model merging has shown impressive low- or zero-barrier mode connectivity between models from completely different initializations. However, this line of work has not yet extended to the Transformer architecture, despite its dominant popularity in the language domain. Therefore, in this work, we investigate the extent to which separate Transformer minima learn similar features, and propose a model merging technique to investigate the relationship between these minima in the loss landscape. The specifics of the architecture, like its residual connections, multi-headed attention, and discrete, sequential input, require specific interventions in order to compute model permutations that remain within the same functional equivalence class. In merging these models with our method, we consistently find lower loss barriers between minima compared to model averaging, across models trained on a masked-language modeling task or fine-tuned on a language understanding benchmark. Our results show that the minima of these models are less sharp and isolated than previously understood, and provide a basis for future work on merging separately trained Transformer models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zelalem Gero, Chandan Singh, Yiqing Xie, Sheng Zhang, Praveen Subramanian, Paul Vozila, Tristan Naumann, Jianfeng Gao, Hoifung Poon</p>
<p>Abstract: Summarizing clinical text is crucial in health decision-support and clinical research. Large language models (LLMs) have shown the potential to generate accurate clinical text summaries, but still struggle with issues regarding grounding and evaluation, especially in safety-critical domains such as health. Holistically evaluating text summaries is challenging because they may contain unsubstantiated information. Here, we explore a general mitigation framework using Attribute Structuring (AS), which structures the summary evaluation process. It decomposes the evaluation process into a grounded procedure that uses an LLM for relatively simple structuring and scoring tasks, rather than the full task of holistic summary evaluation. Experiments show that AS consistently improves the correspondence between human annotations and automated metrics in clinical text summarization. Additionally, AS yields interpretations in the form of a short text span corresponding to each output, which enables efficient human auditing, paving the way towards trustworthy evaluation of clinical information in resource-constrained scenarios. We release our code, prompts, and an open-source benchmark at https://github.com/microsoft/attribute-structuring.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit the ability to perform in-context learning (ICL), where they acquire new tasks directly from examples provided in demonstrations. This process is thought to operate through an implicit task selection mechanism that involves extracting and processing task definitions from these demonstrations. However, critical questions remain: Which is more essential -- task extraction or definition? And how can these capabilities be further improved? To address these questions, we propose \textbf{TEGEE} (Task Definition Guided Expert Ensembling), a method that explicitly extracts task definitions and generates responses based on specific tasks. Our framework employs a dual 3B model approach, with each model assigned a distinct role: one focuses on task definition extraction, while the other handles learning from demonstrations. This modular approach supports the hypothesis that extracting task definitions is more vital than processing the task itself. Empirical evaluations show that TEGEE performs comparably to the larger LLaMA2-13B model. By leveraging a modular design, our approach extends traditional ICL from few-shot to many-shot learning, supporting an unlimited number of demonstrations and enhancing continual learning capabilities.</p>

<p>Abstract: The advancement of autonomous driving systems hinges on the ability to achieve low-latency and high-accuracy perception. To address this critical need, this paper introduces Dynamic Routing Network (DyRoNet), a low-rank enhanced dynamic routing framework designed for streaming perception in autonomous driving systems. DyRoNet integrates a suite of pre-trained branch networks, each meticulously fine-tuned to function under distinct environmental conditions. At its core, the framework offers a speed router module, developed to assess and route input data to the most suitable branch for processing. This approach not only addresses the inherent limitations of conventional models in adapting to diverse driving conditions but also ensures the balance between performance and efficiency. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the adaptability of DyRoNet to diverse branch selection strategies, resulting in significant performance enhancements across different scenarios. This work establishes a new benchmark for streaming perception and provides valuable engineering insights for future work.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this report, we introduce the Gemini 1.5 family of models, representing the next generation of highly compute-efficient multimodal models capable of recalling and reasoning over fine-grained information from millions of tokens of context, including multiple long documents and hours of video and audio. The family includes two new models: (1) an updated Gemini 1.5 Pro, which exceeds the February version on the great majority of capabilities and benchmarks; (2) Gemini 1.5 Flash, a more lightweight variant designed for efficiency with minimal regression in quality. Gemini 1.5 models achieve near-perfect recall on long-context retrieval tasks across modalities, improve the state-of-the-art in long-document QA, long-video QA and long-context ASR, and match or surpass Gemini 1.0 Ultra's state-of-the-art performance across a broad set of benchmarks. Studying the limits of Gemini 1.5's long-context ability, we find continued improvement in next-token prediction and near-perfect retrieval (>99%) up to at least 10M tokens, a generational leap over existing models such as Claude 3.0 (200k) and GPT-4 Turbo (128k). Finally, we highlight real-world use cases, such as Gemini 1.5 collaborating with professionals on completing their tasks achieving 26 to 75% time savings across 10 different job categories, as well as surprising new capabilities of large language models at the frontier; when given a grammar manual for Kalamang, a language with fewer than 200 speakers worldwide, the model learns to translate English to Kalamang at a similar level to a person who learned from the same content.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Masoud Shokrnezhad, Hao Yu, Tarik Taleb, Richard Li, Kyunghan Lee, Jaeseung Song, Cedric Westphal</p>
<p>Abstract: In the context of advancing 6G, a substantial paradigm shift is anticipated, highlighting comprehensive everything-to-everything interactions characterized by numerous connections and stringent adherence to Quality of Service/Experience (QoS/E) prerequisites. The imminent challenge stems from resource scarcity, prompting a deliberate transition to Computing-Network Convergence (CNC) as an auspicious approach for joint resource orchestration. While CNC-based mechanisms have garnered attention, their effectiveness in realizing future services, particularly in use cases like the Metaverse, may encounter limitations due to the continually changing nature of users, services, and resources. Hence, this paper presents the concept of Adaptable CNC (ACNC) as an autonomous Machine Learning (ML)-aided mechanism crafted for the joint orchestration of computing and network resources, catering to dynamic and voluminous user requests with stringent requirements. ACNC encompasses two primary functionalities: state recognition and context detection. Given the intricate nature of the user-service-computing-network space, the paper employs dimension reduction to generate live, holistic, abstract system states in a hierarchical structure. To address the challenges posed by dynamic changes, Continual Learning (CL) is employed, classifying the system state into contexts controlled by dedicated ML agents, enabling them to operate efficiently. These two functionalities are intricately linked within a closed loop overseen by the End-to-End (E2E) orchestrator to allocate resources. The paper introduces the components of ACNC, proposes a Metaverse scenario to exemplify ACNC's role in resource provisioning with Segment Routing v6 (SRv6), outlines ACNC's workflow, details a numerical analysis for efficiency assessment, and concludes with discussions on relevant challenges and potential avenues for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinjie Zhang, Shenyuan Gao, Zhening Liu, Jiawei Shao, Xingtong Ge, Dailan He, Tongda Xu, Yan Wang, Jun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing learning-based stereo image codec adopt sophisticated transformation with simple entropy models derived from single image codecs to encode latent representations. However, those entropy models struggle to effectively capture the spatial-disparity characteristics inherent in stereo images, which leads to suboptimal rate-distortion results. In this paper, we propose a stereo image compression framework, named CAMSIC. CAMSIC independently transforms each image to latent representation and employs a powerful decoder-free Transformer entropy model to capture both spatial and disparity dependencies, by introducing a novel content-aware masked image modeling (MIM) technique. Our content-aware MIM facilitates efficient bidirectional interaction between prior information and estimated tokens, which naturally obviates the need for an extra Transformer decoder. Experiments show that our stereo image codec achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance on two stereo image datasets Cityscapes and InStereo2K with fast encoding and decoding speed.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jun Liu, Zhenglun Kong, Pu Zhao, Changdi Yang, Hao Tang, Xuan Shen, Geng Yuan, Wei Niu, Wenbin Zhang, Xue Lin, Dong Huang, Yanzhi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Structured pruning for large language models (LLMs) has garnered significant academic interest due to its ability to efficiently compress and accelerate LLMs by eliminating redundant weight groups at a coarse-grained granularity. Current structured pruning methods for LLMs typically depend on a singular granularity for assessing weight importance, resulting in notable performance degradation in downstream tasks. Intriguingly, our empirical investigations reveal that utilizing unstructured pruning, which achieves better performance retention by pruning weights at a finer granularity, \emph{i.e.}, individual weights, yields significantly varied sparse LLM structures when juxtaposed to structured pruning. This suggests that evaluating both holistic and individual assessment for weight importance is essential for LLM pruning. Building on this insight, we introduce the Hybrid-grained Weight Importance Assessment (HyWIA), a novel method that merges fine-grained and coarse-grained evaluations of weight importance for the pruning of LLMs. Leveraging an attention mechanism, HyWIA adaptively determines the optimal blend of granularity in weight importance assessments in an end-to-end pruning manner. Extensive experiments on LLaMA-V1/V2, Vicuna, Baichuan, and Bloom across various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of HyWIA in pruning LLMs. For example, HyWIA surpasses the cutting-edge LLM-Pruner by an average margin of 2.82\% in accuracy across seven downstream tasks when pruning LLaMA-7B by 50\%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunrui Li, Hao Xu, Ambrish Kumar, Duosheng Wang, Christian Heiss, Parastoo Azadi, Pengyu Hong</p>
<p>Abstract: Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is essential for revealing molecular structure, electronic environment, and dynamics. Accurate NMR shift prediction allows researchers to validate structures by comparing predicted and observed shifts. While Machine Learning (ML) has improved one-dimensional (1D) NMR shift prediction, predicting 2D NMR remains challenging due to limited annotated data. To address this, we introduce an unsupervised training framework for predicting cross-peaks in 2D NMR, specifically Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence (HSQC).Our approach pretrains an ML model on an annotated 1D dataset of 1H and 13C shifts, then finetunes it in an unsupervised manner using unlabeled HSQC data, which simultaneously generates cross-peak annotations. Our model also adjusts for solvent effects. Evaluation on 479 expert-annotated HSQC spectra demonstrates our model's superiority over traditional methods (ChemDraw and Mestrenova), achieving Mean Absolute Errors (MAEs) of 2.05 ppm and 0.165 ppm for 13C shifts and 1H shifts respectively. Our algorithmic annotations show a 95.21% concordance with experts' assignments, underscoring the approach's potential for structural elucidation in fields like organic chemistry, pharmaceuticals, and natural products.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leying Zhang, Yao Qian, Long Zhou, Shujie Liu, Dongmei Wang, Xiaofei Wang, Midia Yousefi, Yanmin Qian, Jinyu Li, Lei He, Sheng Zhao, Michael Zeng</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) modeling have led to significant strides in generating high-fidelity and diverse speech. However, dialogue generation, along with achieving human-like naturalness in speech, continues to be a challenge. In this paper, we introduce CoVoMix: Conversational Voice Mixture Generation, a novel model for zero-shot, human-like, multi-speaker, multi-round dialogue speech generation. CoVoMix first converts dialogue text into multiple streams of discrete tokens, with each token stream representing semantic information for individual talkers. These token streams are then fed into a flow-matching based acoustic model to generate mixed mel-spectrograms. Finally, the speech waveforms are produced using a HiFi-GAN model. Furthermore, we devise a comprehensive set of metrics for measuring the effectiveness of dialogue modeling and generation. Our experimental results show that CoVoMix can generate dialogues that are not only human-like in their naturalness and coherence but also involve multiple talkers engaging in multiple rounds of conversation. This is exemplified by instances generated in a single channel where one speaker's utterance is seamlessly mixed with another's interjections or laughter, indicating the latter's role as an attentive listener.

<p><b>Authors:</b> William Watson, Nicole Cho, Nishan Srishankar</p>
<p>Abstract: Hallucination continues to be one of the most critical challenges in the institutional adoption journey of Large Language Models (LLMs). While prior studies have primarily focused on the post-generation analysis and refinement of outputs, this paper centers on the effectiveness of queries in eliciting accurate responses from LLMs. We present HalluciBot, a model that estimates the query's propensity to hallucinate before generation, without invoking any LLMs during inference. HalluciBot can serve as a proxy reward model for query rewriting, offering a general framework to estimate query quality based on accuracy and consensus. In essence, HalluciBot investigates how poorly constructed queries can lead to erroneous outputs - moreover, by employing query rewriting guided by HalluciBot's empirical estimates, we demonstrate that 95.7% output accuracy can be achieved for Multiple Choice questions. The training procedure for HalluciBot consists of perturbing 369,837 queries n times, employing n+1 independent LLM agents, sampling an output from each query, conducting a Multi-Agent Monte Carlo simulation on the sampled outputs, and training an encoder classifier. The idea of perturbation is the outcome of our ablation studies that measures the increase in output diversity (+12.5 agreement spread) by perturbing a query in lexically different but semantically similar ways. Therefore, HalluciBot paves the way to ratiocinate (76.0% test F1 score, 46.6% in saved computation on hallucinatory queries), rewrite (+30.2% positive class transition from hallucinatory to non-hallucinatory), rank (+50.6% positive class transition from hallucinatory to non-hallucinatory), and route queries to effective pipelines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Teng-Fang Hsiao, Bo-Kai Ruan, Hong-Han Shuai</p>
<p>Abstract: Painterly image harmonization aims at seamlessly blending disparate visual elements within a single image. However, previous approaches often struggle due to limitations in training data or reliance on additional prompts, leading to inharmonious and content-disrupted output. To surmount these hurdles, we design a Training-and-prompt-Free General Painterly Harmonization method (TF-GPH). TF-GPH incorporates a novel ``Similarity Disentangle Mask'', which disentangles the foreground content and background image by redirecting their attention to corresponding reference images, enhancing the attention mechanism for multi-image inputs. Additionally, we propose a ``Similarity Reweighting'' mechanism to balance harmonization between stylization and content preservation. This mechanism minimizes content disruption by prioritizing the content-similar features within the given background style reference. Finally, we address the deficiencies in existing benchmarks by proposing novel range-based evaluation metrics and a new benchmark to better reflect real-world applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our method in all benchmarks. More detailed in https://github.com/BlueDyee/TF-GPH.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Katsiaryna Haitsiukevich, Onur Poyraz, Pekka Marttinen, Alexander Ilin</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper explores the efficacy of diffusion-based generative models as neural operators for partial differential equations (PDEs). Neural operators are neural networks that learn a mapping from the parameter space to the solution space of PDEs from data, and they can also solve the inverse problem of estimating the parameter from the solution. Diffusion models excel in many domains, but their potential as neural operators has not been thoroughly explored. In this work, we show that diffusion-based generative models exhibit many properties favourable for neural operators, and they can effectively generate the solution of a PDE conditionally on the parameter or recover the unobserved parts of the system. We propose to train a single model adaptable to multiple tasks, by alternating between the tasks during training. In our experiments with multiple realistic dynamical systems, diffusion models outperform other neural operators. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the probabilistic diffusion model can elegantly deal with systems which are only partially identifiable, by producing samples corresponding to the different possible solutions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhicheng Zhang, Yong Wang, Shaoqi Tan, Bowei Xia, Yujie Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, Transformer-based models for long sequence time series forecasting have demonstrated promising results. The self-attention mechanism as the core component of these Transformer-based models exhibits great potential in capturing various dependencies among data points. Despite these advancements, it has been a subject of concern to improve the efficiency of the self-attention mechanism. Unfortunately, current specific optimization methods are facing the challenges in applicability and scalability for the future design of long sequence time series forecasting models. Hence, in this article, we propose a novel architectural framework that enhances Transformer-based models through the integration of Surrogate Attention Blocks (SAB) and Surrogate Feed-Forward Neural Network Blocks (SFB). The framework reduces both time and space complexity by the replacement of the self-attention and feed-forward layers with SAB and SFB while maintaining their expressive power and architectural advantages. The equivalence of this substitution is fully demonstrated. The extensive experiments on 10 Transformer-based models across five distinct time series tasks demonstrate an average performance improvement of 12.4%, alongside 61.3% reduction in parameter counts.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent years have witnessed an increasing global population affected by neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), which traditionally require extensive healthcare resources and human effort for medical diagnosis and monitoring. As a crucial disease-related motor symptom, human gait can be exploited to characterize different NDs. The current advances in artificial intelligence (AI) models enable automatic gait analysis for NDs identification and classification, opening a new avenue to facilitate faster and more cost-effective diagnosis of NDs. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on recent progress of machine learning and deep learning based AI techniques applied to diagnosis of five typical NDs through gait. We provide an overview of the process of AI-assisted NDs diagnosis, and present a systematic taxonomy of existing gait data and AI models. Meanwhile, a novel quality evaluation criterion is proposed to quantitatively assess the quality of existing studies. Through an extensive review and analysis of 169 studies, we present recent technical advancements, discuss existing challenges, potential solutions, and future directions in this field. Finally, we envision the prospective utilization of 3D skeleton data for human gait representation and the development of more efficient AI models for NDs diagnosis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Robert Wang, Aseem Baranwal, Kimon Fountoulakis</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning for node classification on graphs is a prominent area driven by applications such as recommendation systems. State-of-the-art models often use multiple graph convolutions on the data, as empirical evidence suggests they can enhance performance. However, it has been shown empirically and theoretically, that too many graph convolutions can degrade performance significantly, a phenomenon known as oversmoothing. In this paper, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis, based on the two-class contextual stochastic block model (CSBM), of the performance of vanilla graph convolution from which we remove the principal eigenvector to avoid oversmoothing. We perform a spectral analysis for $k$ rounds of corrected graph convolutions, and we provide results for partial and exact classification. For partial classification, we show that each round of convolution can reduce the misclassification error exponentially up to a saturation level, after which performance does not worsen. We also extend this analysis to the multi-class setting with features distributed according to a Gaussian mixture model. For exact classification, we show that the separability threshold can be improved exponentially up to $O({\log{n}}/{\log\log{n}})$ corrected convolutions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zijian Zhou, Xiaoqiang Lin, Xinyi Xu, Alok Prakash, Daniela Rus, Bryan Kian Hsiang Low</p>
<p>Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) allows transformer-based language models that are pre-trained on general text to quickly learn a specific task with a few "task demonstrations" without updating their parameters, significantly boosting their flexibility and generality. ICL possesses many distinct characteristics from conventional machine learning, thereby requiring new approaches to interpret this learning paradigm. Taking the viewpoint of recent works showing that transformers learn in context by formulating an internal optimizer, we propose an influence function-based attribution technique, DETAIL, that addresses the specific characteristics of ICL. We empirically verify the effectiveness of our approach for demonstration attribution while being computationally efficient. Leveraging the results, we then show how DETAIL can help improve model performance in real-world scenarios through demonstration reordering and curation. Finally, we experimentally prove the wide applicability of DETAIL by showing our attribution scores obtained on white-box models are transferable to black-box models in improving model performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tong Ye, Yangkai Du, Tengfei Ma, Lingfei Wu, Xuhong Zhang, Shouling Ji, Wenhai Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in generating code. However, the misuse of LLM-generated (synthetic) code has raised concerns in both educational and industrial contexts, underscoring the urgent need for synthetic code detectors. Existing methods for detecting synthetic content are primarily designed for general text and struggle with code due to the unique grammatical structure of programming languages and the presence of numerous ''low-entropy'' tokens. Building on this, our work proposes a novel zero-shot synthetic code detector based on the similarity between the original code and its LLM-rewritten variants. Our method is based on the observation that differences between LLM-rewritten and original code tend to be smaller when the original code is synthetic. We utilize self-supervised contrastive learning to train a code similarity model and evaluate our approach on two synthetic code detection benchmarks. Our results demonstrate a significant improvement over existing SOTA synthetic content detectors, with AUROC scores increasing by 20.5% on the APPS benchmark and 29.1% on the MBPP benchmark.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rohan Chandra, Haresh Karnan, Negar Mehr, Peter Stone, Joydeep Biswas</p>
<p>Abstract: Social robot navigation in crowded public spaces such as university campuses, restaurants, grocery stores, and hospitals, is an increasingly important area of research. One of the core strategies for achieving this goal is to understand humans' intent--underlying psychological factors that govern their motion--by learning their reward functions, typically via inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). Despite significant progress in IRL, learning reward functions of multiple agents simultaneously in dense unstructured pedestrian crowds has remained intractable due to the nature of the tightly coupled social interactions that occur in these scenarios \textit{e.g.} passing, intersections, swerving, weaving, etc. In this paper, we present a new multi-agent maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning algorithm for real world unstructured pedestrian crowds. Key to our approach is a simple, but effective, mathematical trick which we name the so-called tractability-rationality trade-off trick that achieves tractability at the cost of a slight reduction in accuracy. We compare our approach to the classical single-agent MaxEnt IRL as well as state-of-the-art trajectory prediction methods on several datasets including the ETH, UCY, SCAND, JRDB, and a new dataset, called Speedway, collected at a busy intersection on a University campus focusing on dense, complex agent interactions. Our key findings show that, on the dense Speedway dataset, our approach ranks 1st among top 7 baselines with >2X improvement over single-agent IRL, and is competitive with state-of-the-art large transformer-based encoder-decoder models on sparser datasets such as ETH/UCY (ranks 3rd among top 7 baselines).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sangmin Woo, Jaehyuk Jang, Donguk Kim, Yubin Choi, Changick Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have revolutionized how machines understand and generate textual responses based on visual inputs, yet they often produce "hallucinatory" outputs that misinterpret visual information, posing challenges in reliability and trustworthiness. We propose RITUAL, a simple decoding method that reduces hallucinations by leveraging randomly transformed images as complementary inputs during decoding, adjusting the output probability distribution without additional training or external models. Our key insight is that random transformations expose the model to diverse visual perspectives, enabling it to correct misinterpretations that lead to hallucinations. Specifically, when a model hallucinates based on the original image, the transformed images -- altered in aspects such as orientation, scale, or color -- provide alternative viewpoints that help recalibrate the model's predictions. By integrating the probability distributions from both the original and transformed images, RITUAL effectively reduces hallucinations. To further improve reliability and address potential instability from arbitrary transformations, we introduce RITUAL+, an extension that selects image transformations based on self-feedback from the LVLM. Instead of applying transformations randomly, RITUAL+ uses the LVLM to evaluate and choose transformations that are most beneficial for reducing hallucinations in a given context. This self-adaptive approach mitigates the potential negative impact of certain transformations on specific tasks, ensuring more consistent performance across different scenarios. Experiments demonstrate that RITUAL and RITUAL+ significantly reduce hallucinations across several object hallucination benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Amir Fallah, Mehdi Monemi, Mehdi Rasti, Matti Latva-Aho</p>
<p>Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) spot beamfocusing (SBF), in contrast to conventional angular-domain beamforming, concentrates radiating power within a very small volume in both radial and angular domains in the near-field zone. Recently the implementation of channel-state-information (CSI)-independent machine learning (ML)-based approaches have been developed for effective SBF using extremely large-scale programmable metasurface (ELPMs). These methods involve dividing the ELPMs into subarrays and independently training them with Deep Reinforcement Learning to jointly focus the beam at the desired focal point (DFP).
  This paper explores near-field SBF using ELPMs, addressing challenges associated with lengthy training times resulting from independent training of subarrays. To achieve a faster CSI-independent solution, inspired by the correlation between the beamfocusing matrices of the subarrays, we leverage transfer learning techniques. First, we introduce a novel similarity criterion based on the phase distribution image (PDI) of subarray apertures. Then we devise a subarray policy propagation scheme that transfers the knowledge from trained to untrained subarrays. We further enhance learning by introducing quasi-liquid layers as a revised version of the adaptive policy reuse technique. We show through simulations that the proposed scheme improves the training speed about 5 times. Furthermore, for dynamic DFP management, we devised a DFP policy blending process, which augments the convergence rate up to 8-fold.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tao Fan, Guoqiang Ma, Yan Kang, Hanlin Gu, Yuanfeng Song, Lixin Fan, Kai Chen, Qiang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent research in federated large language models (LLMs) has primarily focused on enabling clients to fine-tune their locally deployed homogeneous LLMs collaboratively or on transferring knowledge from server-based LLMs to small language models (SLMs) at downstream clients. However, a significant gap remains in the simultaneous mutual enhancement of both the server's LLM and clients' SLMs. To bridge this gap, we propose FedMKT, a parameter-efficient federated mutual knowledge transfer framework for large and small language models. This framework is designed to adaptively transfer knowledge from the server's LLM to clients' SLMs while concurrently enriching the LLM with clients' unique domain insights. We facilitate token alignment using minimum edit distance (MinED) and then selective mutual knowledge transfer between client-side SLMs and a server-side LLM, aiming to collectively enhance their performance. Through extensive experiments across three distinct scenarios, we evaluate the effectiveness of FedMKT using various public LLMs and SLMs on a range of NLP text generation tasks. Empirical results demonstrate that FedMKT simultaneously boosts the performance of both LLMs and SLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shahriar Golchin, Nikhil Garuda, Christopher Impey, Matthew Wenger</p>
<p>Abstract: Massive open online courses (MOOCs) offer free education globally. Despite this democratization of learning, the massive enrollment in these courses makes it impractical for an instructor to assess every student's writing assignment. As a result, peer grading, often guided by a straightforward rubric, is the method of choice. While convenient, peer grading often falls short in terms of reliability and validity. In this study, we explore the feasibility of using large language models (LLMs) to replace peer grading in MOOCs. To this end, we adapt the zero-shot chain-of-thought (ZCoT) prompting technique to automate the feedback process once the LLM assigns a score to an assignment. Specifically, to instruct LLMs for grading, we use three distinct prompts based on ZCoT: (1) ZCoT with instructor-provided correct answers, (2) ZCoT with both instructor-provided correct answers and rubrics, and (3) ZCoT with instructor-provided correct answers and LLM-generated rubrics. We tested these prompts in 18 different scenarios using two LLMs, GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, across three MOOCs: Introductory Astronomy, Astrobiology, and the History and Philosophy of Astronomy. Our results show that ZCoT, when augmented with instructor-provided correct answers and rubrics, produces grades that are more aligned with those assigned by instructors compared to peer grading. Finally, our findings indicate a promising potential for automated grading systems in MOOCs, especially in subjects with well-defined rubrics, to improve the learning experience for millions of online learners worldwide.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boxuan Lyu, Hidetaka Kamigaito, Kotaro Funakoshi, Manabu Okumura</p>
<p>Abstract: Maximum a posteriori decoding, a commonly used method for neural machine translation (NMT), aims to maximize the estimated posterior probability. However, high estimated probability does not always lead to high translation quality. Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding (\citealp{kumar2004minimum}) offers an alternative by seeking hypotheses with the highest expected utility.
  Inspired by Quality Estimation (QE) reranking which uses the QE model as a ranker (\citealp{fernandes-etal-2022-quality}), we propose source-based MBR (sMBR) decoding, a novel approach that utilizes quasi-sources (generated via paraphrasing or back-translation) as ``support hypotheses'' and a reference-free quality estimation metric as the utility function, marking the first work to solely use sources in MBR decoding. Experiments show that sMBR outperforms QE reranking and the standard MBR decoding. Our findings suggest that sMBR is a promising approach for NMT decoding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arian Askari, Christian Poelitz, Xinye Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-correction in text-to-SQL is the process of prompting large language model (LLM) to revise its previously incorrectly generated SQL, and commonly relies on manually crafted self-correction guidelines by human experts that are not only labor-intensive to produce but also limited by the human ability in identifying all potential error patterns in LLM responses. We introduce MAGIC, a novel multi-agent method that automates the creation of the self-correction guideline. MAGIC uses three specialized agents: a manager, a correction, and a feedback agent. These agents collaborate on the failures of an LLM-based method on the training set to iteratively generate and refine a self-correction guideline tailored to LLM mistakes, mirroring human processes but without human involvement. Our extensive experiments show that MAGIC's guideline outperforms expert human's created ones. We empirically find out that the guideline produced by MAGIC enhance the interpretability of the corrections made, providing insights in analyzing the reason behind the failures and successes of LLMs in self-correction. We make all agent interactions publicly available to the research community, to foster further research in this area, offering a synthetic dataset for future explorations into automatic self-correction guideline generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cheol Jun Cho, Peter Wu, Tejas S. Prabhune, Dhruv Agarwal, Gopala K. Anumanchipalli</p>
<p>Abstract: Vocal tract articulation is a natural, grounded control space of speech production. The spatiotemporal coordination of articulators combined with the vocal source shapes intelligible speech sounds to enable effective spoken communication. Based on this physiological grounding of speech, we propose a new framework of neural encoding-decoding of speech -- Speech Articulatory Coding (SPARC). SPARC comprises an articulatory analysis model that infers articulatory features from speech audio, and an articulatory synthesis model that synthesizes speech audio from articulatory features. The articulatory features are kinematic traces of vocal tract articulators and source features, which are intuitively interpretable and controllable, being the actual physical interface of speech production. An additional speaker identity encoder is jointly trained with the articulatory synthesizer to inform the voice texture of individual speakers. By training on large-scale speech data, we achieve a fully intelligible, high-quality articulatory synthesizer that generalizes to unseen speakers. Furthermore, the speaker embedding is effectively disentangled from articulations, which enables accent-perserving zero-shot voice conversion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of universal, high-performance articulatory inference and synthesis, suggesting the proposed framework as a powerful coding system of speech.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to generating content that exhibits gender biases, raising significant ethical concerns. Alignment, the process of fine-tuning LLMs to better align with desired behaviors, is recognized as an effective approach to mitigate gender biases. Although proprietary LLMs have made significant strides in mitigating gender bias, their alignment datasets are not publicly available. The commonly used and publicly available alignment dataset, HH-RLHF, still exhibits gender bias to some extent. There is a lack of publicly available alignment datasets specifically designed to address gender bias. Hence, we developed a new dataset named GenderAlign, aiming at mitigating a comprehensive set of gender biases in LLMs. This dataset comprises 8k single-turn dialogues, each paired with a "chosen" and a "rejected" response. Compared to the "rejected" responses, the "chosen" responses demonstrate lower levels of gender bias and higher quality. Furthermore, we categorized the gender biases in the "rejected" responses of GenderAlign into 4 principal categories. The experimental results show the effectiveness of GenderAlign in reducing gender bias in LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Changhai Zhou, Shijie Han, Lining Yang, Yuhua Zhou, Xu Cheng, Yibin Wang, Hongguang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The efficient compression of large language models (LLMs) has become increasingly popular. However, recovering the performance of compressed LLMs remains a major challenge. The current practice in LLM compression entails the implementation of structural pruning, complemented by a recovery phase that leverages the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) algorithm. Structural pruning's uneven modification of model architecture, coupled with standard LoRA's fixed configuration allocation across layers in an online pipeline, leads to suboptimal performance in various downstream tasks for pruned models. To address this challenge, we introduce RankAdaptor, a hierarchical rank allocation method that enables efficient fine-tuning of pruned LLMs according to layerwise specific recovery requirements. We employ a performance model that conducts offline meta-learning and online incremental learning to explore optimal rank values for each layer. Comprehensive experiments on popular benchmarks show that RankAdaptor consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across a variety of pruning settings and LLM architectures, with improvements ranging from 0.7\% to 5.5\%.</p>

<p>Abstract: Sarcasm in social media, often expressed through text-image combinations, poses challenges for sentiment analysis and intention mining. Current multi-modal sarcasm detection methods have been demonstrated to overly rely on spurious cues within the textual modality, revealing a limited ability to genuinely identify sarcasm through nuanced text-image interactions. To solve this problem, we propose InterCLIP-MEP, which introduces Interactive CLIP (InterCLIP) with an efficient training strategy to extract enriched text-image representations by embedding cross-modal information directly into each encoder. Additionally, we design a Memory-Enhanced Predictor (MEP) with a dynamic dual-channel memory that stores valuable test sample knowledge during inference, acting as a non-parametric classifier for robust sarcasm recognition. Experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate that InterCLIP-MEP achieves state-of-the-art performance, with significant accuracy and F1 score improvements on MMSD and MMSD2.0.

<p>Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based applications consist of both LLM and non-LLM components, each contributing to the end-to-end latency. Despite great efforts to optimize LLM inference, end-to-end workflow optimization has been overlooked. Existing frameworks employ coarse-grained orchestration with task modules, which confines optimizations to within each module and yields suboptimal scheduling decisions. We propose fine-grained end-to-end orchestration, which utilizes task primitives as the basic units and represents each query's workflow as a primitive-level dataflow graph. This explicitly exposes a much larger design space, enables optimizations in parallelization and pipelining across primitives of different modules, and enhances scheduling to improve application-level performance. We build Teola, a novel orchestration framework for LLM-based applications that implements this scheme. Comprehensive experiments show that Teola can achieve up to 2.09x speedup over existing systems across various popular LLM applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in open-source code large language models (LLMs) have been driven by fine-tuning on the data generated from powerful closed-source LLMs, which are expensive to obtain. This paper explores whether it is possible to use a fine-tuned open-source model to generate additional data to augment its instruction-tuning dataset. We make two observations: (1) A code snippet can serve as the response to different instructions. (2) Instruction-tuned code LLMs perform better at translating code into instructions than the reverse. Based on these observations, we propose Inverse-Instruct, a data augmentation technique that uses a fine-tuned LLM to generate additional instructions of code responses from its own training dataset. The additional instruction-response pairs are added to the original dataset, and a stronger code LLM can be obtained by fine-tuning on the augmented dataset. We empirically validate Inverse-Instruct on a range of open-source code models (e.g. CodeLlama-Python and DeepSeek-Coder) and benchmarks (e.g., HumanEval(+), MBPP(+), DS-1000 and MultiPL-E), showing it consistently improves the base models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammed Alruqimi, Luca Di Persio</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate crude oil price forecasting is crucial for various economic activities, including energy trading, risk management, and investment planning. Although deep learning models have emerged as powerful tools for crude oil price forecasting, achieving accurate forecasts remains challenging. Deep learning models' performance is heavily influenced by hyperparameters tuning, and they are expected to perform differently under various circumstances. Furthermore, price volatility is also sensitive to external factors such as world events. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid approach that integrates metaheuristic optimization with an ensemble of five widely used neural network architectures for time series forecasting. Unlike existing methods that apply metaheuristics to optimise hyperparameters within the neural network architecture, we exploit the GWO metaheuristic optimiser at four levels: feature selection, data preparation, model training, and forecast blending. The proposed approach has been evaluated for forecasting three-ahead days using real-world Brent crude oil price data, and the obtained results demonstrate that the proposed approach improves the forecasting performance measured using various benchmarks, achieving 0.000127 of MSE.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengkun Jiao, Xinlan Wu, Bin Zhu, Jingjing Chen, Chong-Wah Ngo, Yugang Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs) have significantly advanced a variety of vision-language tasks. The scalability and availability of high-quality training data play a pivotal role in the success of LMMs. In the realm of food, while comprehensive food datasets such as Recipe1M offer an abundance of ingredient and recipe information, they often fall short of providing ample data for nutritional analysis. The Recipe1M+ dataset, despite offering a subset for nutritional evaluation, is limited in the scale and accuracy of nutrition information. To bridge this gap, we introduce Uni-Food, a unified food dataset that comprises over 100,000 images with various food labels, including categories, ingredients, recipes, and ingredient-level nutritional information. Uni-Food is designed to provide a more holistic approach to food data analysis, thereby enhancing the performance and capabilities of LMMs in this domain. To mitigate the conflicts arising from multi-task supervision during fine-tuning of LMMs, we introduce a novel Linear Rectification Mixture of Diverse Experts (RoDE) approach. RoDE utilizes a diverse array of experts to address tasks of varying complexity, thereby facilitating the coordination of trainable parameters, i.e., it allocates more parameters for more complex tasks and, conversely, fewer parameters for simpler tasks. RoDE implements linear rectification union to refine the router's functionality, thereby enhancing the efficiency of sparse task allocation. These design choices endow RoDE with features that ensure GPU memory efficiency and ease of optimization. Our experimental results validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in addressing the inherent challenges of food-related multitasking.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Danna Zheng, Mirella Lapata, Jeff Z. Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly explored as knowledge bases (KBs), yet current evaluation methods focus too narrowly on knowledge retention, overlooking other crucial criteria for reliable performance. In this work, we rethink the requirements for evaluating reliable LLM-as-KB usage and highlight two essential factors: factuality, ensuring accurate responses to seen and unseen knowledge, and consistency, maintaining stable answers to questions about the same knowledge. We introduce UnseenQA, a dataset designed to assess LLM performance on unseen knowledge, and propose new criteria and metrics to quantify factuality and consistency, leading to a final reliability score. Our experiments on 26 LLMs reveal several challenges regarding their use as KBs, underscoring the need for more principled and comprehensive evaluation.</p>

<p>Abstract: The integration of new modalities into frontier AI systems offers exciting capabilities, but also increases the possibility such systems can be adversarially manipulated in undesirable ways. In this work, we focus on a popular class of vision-language models (VLMs) that generate text outputs conditioned on visual and textual inputs. We conducted a large-scale empirical study to assess the transferability of gradient-based universal image ``jailbreaks" using a diverse set of over 40 open-parameter VLMs, including 18 new VLMs that we publicly release. Overall, we find that transferable gradient-based image jailbreaks are extremely difficult to obtain. When an image jailbreak is optimized against a single VLM or against an ensemble of VLMs, the jailbreak successfully jailbreaks the attacked VLM(s), but exhibits little-to-no transfer to any other VLMs; transfer is not affected by whether the attacked and target VLMs possess matching vision backbones or language models, whether the language model underwent instruction-following and/or safety-alignment training, or many other factors. Only two settings display partially successful transfer: between identically-pretrained and identically-initialized VLMs with slightly different VLM training data, and between different training checkpoints of a single VLM. Leveraging these results, we then demonstrate that transfer can be significantly improved against a specific target VLM by attacking larger ensembles of ``highly-similar" VLMs. These results stand in stark contrast to existing evidence of universal and transferable text jailbreaks against language models and transferable adversarial attacks against image classifiers, suggesting that VLMs may be more robust to gradient-based transfer attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingyun Sun, Chengxiao Dai, Zhongze Luo, Yangbo Chang, Yang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Legal Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in providing legal consultations to non-experts. However, most existing Chinese legal consultation models are based on single-agent systems, which differ from real-world legal consultations, where multiple professionals collaborate to offer more tailored responses. To better simulate real consultations, we propose LawLuo, a multi-agent framework for multi-turn Chinese legal consultations. LawLuo includes four agents: the receptionist agent, which assesses user intent and selects a lawyer agent; the lawyer agent, which interacts with the user; the secretary agent, which organizes conversation records and generates consultation reports; and the boss agent, which evaluates the performance of the lawyer and secretary agents to ensure optimal results. These agents' interactions mimic the operations of real law firms. To train them to follow different legal instructions, we developed distinct fine-tuning datasets. We also introduce a case graph-based RAG to help the lawyer agent address vague user inputs. Experimental results show that LawLuo outperforms baselines in generating more personalized and professional responses, handling ambiguous queries, and following legal instructions in multi-turn conversations. Our full code and constructed datasets will be open-sourced upon paper acceptance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shutong Jia, Biwei Cao, Qingqing Gao, Jiuxin Cao, Bo Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Differing from sentiment transfer, positive reframing seeks to substitute negative perspectives with positive expressions while preserving the original meaning. With the emergence of pre-trained language models (PLMs), it is possible to achieve acceptable results by fine-tuning PLMs. Nevertheless, generating fluent, diverse and task-constrained reframing text remains a significant challenge. To tackle this issue, a \textbf{m}ulti-\textbf{s}trategy \textbf{o}ptimization \textbf{f}ramework (MSOF) is proposed in this paper. Starting from the objective of positive reframing, we first design positive sentiment reward and content preservation reward to encourage the model to transform the negative expressions of the original text while ensuring the integrity and consistency of the semantics. Then, different decoding optimization approaches are introduced to improve the quality of text generation. Finally, based on the modeling formula of positive reframing, we propose a multi-dimensional re-ranking method that further selects candidate sentences from three dimensions: strategy consistency, text similarity and fluency. Extensive experiments on two Seq2Seq PLMs, BART and T5, demonstrate our framework achieves significant improvements on unconstrained and controlled positive reframing tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) approach is well-suited for multilingual and code-switching (CS) tasks due to its multi-expert architecture. This work introduces the DLG-MoE, a Dynamic Language Group-based MoE optimized for bilingual and CS scenarios. DLG-MoE operates based on a hierarchical routing mechanism. First, the language router explicitly models the language and dispatches the representations to the corresponding language expert groups. Subsequently, the unsupervised router within each language group implicitly models attributes beyond language, and coordinates expert routing and collaboration. The model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance while also having unparalleled flexibility. It supports different top-k inference and streaming capabilities, and can also prune the model parameters to obtain a monolingual sub-model. The Code will be released.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Feiyang Kang, Yifan Sun, Bingbing Wen, Si Chen, Dawn Song, Rafid Mahmood, Ruoxi Jia</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain reweighting is an emerging research area aimed at adjusting the relative weights of different data sources to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of language model pre-training. This paper demonstrates that the optimal composition of training data from different domains is scale-dependent, challenging the existing practice of determining optimal mixtures through small-scale experiments and directly applying them at larger scales. We derive an analytical model for the dependence of optimal weights on data scale and introduce *AutoScale*, a novel, practical approach for optimizing data compositions at potentially large training data scales. *AutoScale* first uses a principled optimization framework to find optimal compositions at smaller, feasible scales, then predicts optimal compositions at larger scales using our derived model. Our evaluation on GPT-2 Large and BERT pre-training demonstrates *AutoScale*'s effectiveness in improving training convergence and downstream performance. Particularly, for GPT-2 Large on RedPajama, *AutoScale* decreases validation perplexity 28% faster than baselines, with up to 38% speed-up over unweighted training, achieving the best performance across downstream tasks. This work provides insights into the varying benefits of data sources across training scales for language models, contributing to the burgeoning research on scale-dependent data curation. Code is open-sourced.</p>

<p>Abstract: This work presents a generative neural network that's able to generate expressive piano performance in MIDI format. The musical expressivity is reflected by vivid micro-timing, rich polyphonic texture, varied dynamics, and the sustain pedal effects. This model is innovative from many aspects of data processing to neural network design. We claim that this symbolic music generation model overcame the common critics of symbolic music and is able to generate expressive music flows as good as, if not better than generations with raw audio. One drawback is that, due to the limited time for submission, the model is not fine-tuned and sufficiently trained, thus the generation may sound incoherent and random at certain points. Despite that, this model shows its powerful generative ability to generate expressive piano pieces.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dang Huu-Tien, Trung-Tin Pham, Hoang Thanh-Tung, Naoya Inoue</p>
<p>Abstract: Representation Misdirection for Unlearning (RMU), which steers model representation in the intermediate layer to a target random representation, is an effective method for large language model (LLM) unlearning. Despite its high performance, the underlying cause and explanation remain underexplored. In this paper, we theoretically demonstrate that steering forget representations in the intermediate layer reduces token confidence, causing LLMs to generate wrong or nonsense responses. We investigate how the coefficient influences the alignment of forget-sample representations with the random direction and hint at the optimal coefficient values for effective unlearning across different network layers. We show that RMU unlearned models are robust against adversarial jailbreak attacks. Furthermore, our empirical analysis shows that RMU is less effective when applied to the middle and later layers in LLMs. To resolve this drawback, we propose Adaptive RMU -- a simple yet effective alternative method that makes unlearning effective with most layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Adaptive RMU significantly improves the unlearning performance compared to prior art while incurring no additional computational cost.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jerry Huang, Prasanna Parthasarathi, Mehdi Rezagholizadeh, Sarath Chandar</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite their widespread adoption, large language models (LLMs) remain prohibitive to use under resource constraints, with their ever growing sizes only increasing the barrier for use. One noted issue is the high latency associated with auto-regressive generation, rendering large LLMs use dependent on advanced computing infrastructure. Assisted decoding, where a smaller draft model guides a larger target model's generation, has helped alleviate this, but remains dependent on alignment between the two models. Thus if the draft model is insufficiently capable on some domain relative to the target model, performance can degrade. Alternatively, one can leverage multiple draft models to better cover the expertise of the target, but when multiple black-box draft models are available, selecting an assistant without details about its construction can be difficult. To better understand this decision making problem, we observe it as a contextual bandit, where a policy must choose a draft model based on a context. We show that even without prior knowledge of the draft models, creating an offline dataset from only outputs of independent draft/target models and training a policy over the alignment of these outputs can accelerate performance on multiple domains provided the candidates are effective. Further results show this to hold on various settings with multiple assisted decoding candidates, highlighting its flexibility and the advantageous role that such decision making can play.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiao Han, Zijian Zhang, Xiangyu Zhao, Yuanshao Zhu, Guojiang Shen, Xiangjie Kong, Xuetao Wei, Liqiang Nie, Jieping Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: As urban residents demand higher travel quality, vehicle dispatch has become a critical component of online ride-hailing services. However, current vehicle dispatch systems struggle to navigate the complexities of urban traffic dynamics, including unpredictable traffic conditions, diverse driver behaviors, and fluctuating supply and demand patterns. These challenges have resulted in travel difficulties for passengers in certain areas, while many drivers in other areas are unable to secure orders, leading to a decline in the overall quality of urban transportation services. To address these issues, this paper introduces GARLIC: a framework of GPT-Augmented Reinforcement Learning with Intelligent Control for vehicle dispatching. GARLIC utilizes multiview graphs to capture hierarchical traffic states, and learns a dynamic reward function that accounts for individual driving behaviors. The framework further integrates a GPT model trained with a custom loss function to enable high-precision predictions and optimize dispatching policies in real-world scenarios. Experiments conducted on two real-world datasets demonstrate that GARLIC effectively aligns with driver behaviors while reducing the empty load rate of vehicles.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generative LLM have achieved remarkable success in various industrial applications, owing to their promising In-Context Learning capabilities. However, the issue of long context in complex tasks poses a significant barrier to their wider adoption, manifested in two main aspects: (i) The excessively long context leads to high costs and inference delays. (ii) A substantial amount of task-irrelevant information introduced by long contexts exacerbates the "lost in the middle" problem. Existing methods compress context by removing redundant tokens using metrics such as self-information or PPL, which is inconsistent with the objective of retaining the most important tokens when conditioning on a given query. In this study, we introduce information bottleneck theory (IB) to model the problem, offering a novel perspective that thoroughly addresses the essential properties required for context compression. Additionally, we propose a cross-attention-based approach to approximate mutual information in IB, which can be flexibly replaced with suitable alternatives in different scenarios. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that our method achieves a 25% increase in compression rate compared to the state-of-the-art, while maintaining question answering performance. In particular, the context compressed by our method even outperform the full context in some cases.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite recent advancements in text-to-image generation, most existing methods struggle to create images with multiple objects and complex spatial relationships in the 3D world. To tackle this limitation, we introduce a generic AI system, namely MUSES, for 3D-controllable image generation from user queries. Specifically, our MUSES addresses this challenging task by developing a progressive workflow with three key components, including (1) Layout Manager for 2D-to-3D layout lifting, (2) Model Engineer for 3D object acquisition and calibration, (3) Image Artist for 3D-to-2D image rendering. By mimicking the collaboration of human professionals, this multi-modal agent pipeline facilitates the effective and automatic creation of images with 3D-controllable objects, through an explainable integration of top-down planning and bottom-up generation. Additionally, we find that existing benchmarks lack detailed descriptions of complex 3D spatial relationships of multiple objects. To fill this gap, we further construct a new benchmark of T2I-3DisBench (3D image scene), which describes diverse 3D image scenes with 50 detailed prompts. Extensive experiments show the state-of-the-art performance of MUSES on both T2I-CompBench and T2I-3DisBench, outperforming recent strong competitors such as DALL-E 3 and Stable Diffusion 3. These results demonstrate a significant step of MUSES forward in bridging natural language, 2D image generation, and 3D world.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ellie Y. Cheng, Eric Atkinson, Guillaume Baudart, Louis Mandel, Michael Carbin</p>
<p>Abstract: Advanced probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) using hybrid particle filtering combine symbolic exact inference and Monte Carlo methods to improve inference performance. These systems use heuristics to partition random variables within the program into variables that are encoded symbolically and variables that are encoded with sampled values, and the heuristics are not necessarily aligned with the developer's performance evaluation metrics. In this work, we present inference plans, a programming interface that enables developers to control the partitioning of random variables during hybrid particle filtering. We further present Siren, a new PPL that enables developers to use annotations to specify inference plans the inference system must implement. To assist developers with statically reasoning about whether an inference plan can be implemented, we present an abstract-interpretation-based static analysis for Siren for determining inference plan satisfiability. We prove the analysis is sound with respect to Siren's semantics. Our evaluation applies inference plans to three different hybrid particle filtering algorithms on a suite of benchmarks. It shows that the control provided by inference plans enables speed ups of 1.76x on average and up to 206x to reach a target accuracy, compared to the inference plans implemented by default heuristics; the results also show that inference plans improve accuracy by 1.83x on average and up to 595x with less or equal runtime, compared to the default inference plans. We further show that our static analysis is precise in practice, identifying all satisfiable inference plans in 27 out of the 33 benchmark-algorithm evaluation settings.</p>

Leveraging a unique and comprehensive dataset from Massachusetts General Hospital, comprising over 6.5 million de-identified medical reports across various imaging modalities, the model demonstrates significant improvements in generating accurate and clinically relevant radiology impressions given the corresponding findings.

<p>Abstract: Over the recent years, the protection of the so-called `soft-targets', i.e. locations easily accessible by the general public with relatively low, though, security measures, has emerged as a rather challenging and increasingly important issue. The complexity and seriousness of this security threat growths nowadays exponentially, due to the emergence of new advanced technologies (e.g. Artificial Intelligence (AI), Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), 3D printing, etc.); especially when it comes to large-scale, popular and diverse public spaces. In this paper, a novel Digital Twin-as-a-Security-Service (DTaaSS) architecture is introduced for holistically and significantly enhancing the protection of public spaces (e.g. metro stations, leisure sites, urban squares, etc.). The proposed framework combines a Digital Twin (DT) conceptualization with additional cutting-edge technologies, including Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, Big Data analytics and AI. In particular, DTaaSS comprises a holistic, real-time, large-scale, comprehensive and data-driven security solution for the efficient/robust protection of public spaces, supporting: a) data collection and analytics, b) area monitoring/control and proactive threat detection, c) incident/attack prediction, and d) quantitative and data-driven vulnerability assessment. Overall, the designed architecture exhibits increased potential in handling complex, hybrid and combined threats over large, critical and popular soft-targets. The applicability and robustness of DTaaSS is discussed in detail against representative and diverse real-world application scenarios, including complex attacks to: a) a metro station, b) a leisure site, and c) a cathedral square.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fenglei Fan, Juntong Fan, Dayang Wang, Jingbo Zhang, Zelin Dong, Shijun Zhang, Ge Wang, Tieyong Zeng</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid growth of large models' size has far outpaced that of GPU memory. To bridge this gap, inspired by the parsimonious relationship between genotype and phenotype, we turn the model compression problem into the issue of parameter representation to propose the so-called hyper-compression. The hyper-compression uses a hyperfunction to represent the parameters of the target network per ergodic theory, that addresses the following approximation problem: if a low-dimensional dynamic system can fill the high-dimensional space eventually. Empirically, the proposed hyper-compression enjoys the following merits: 1) \textbf{P}referable compression ratio; 2) \textbf{N}o post-hoc retraining; 3) \textbf{A}ffordable inference time; and 4) \textbf{S}hort compression time. It compresses LLaMA2-7B in an hour and achieves close-to-int4-quantization performance, without retraining and with a performance drop of less than 1\%. Our work can facilitate the harmony between the scaling law and the stagnation of hardware upgradation in terms of saving both computation and data.

<p>Abstract: Adverse conditions like snow, rain, nighttime, and fog, pose challenges for autonomous driving perception systems. Existing methods have limited effectiveness in improving essential computer vision tasks, such as semantic segmentation, and often focus on only one specific condition, such as removing rain or translating nighttime images into daytime ones. To address these limitations, we propose a method to improve the visual quality and clarity degraded by such adverse conditions. Our method, AllWeather-Net, utilizes a novel hierarchical architecture to enhance images across all adverse conditions. This architecture incorporates information at three semantic levels: scene, object, and texture, by discriminating patches at each level. Furthermore, we introduce a Scaled Illumination-aware Attention Mechanism (SIAM) that guides the learning towards road elements critical for autonomous driving perception. SIAM exhibits robustness, remaining unaffected by changes in weather conditions or environmental scenes. AllWeather-Net effectively transforms images into normal weather and daytime scenes, demonstrating superior image enhancement results and subsequently enhancing the performance of semantic segmentation, with up to a 5.3% improvement in mIoU in the trained domain. We also show our model's generalization ability by applying it to unseen domains without re-training, achieving up to 3.9% mIoU improvement.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yao Mu, Tianxing Chen, Shijia Peng, Zanxin Chen, Zeyu Gao, Yude Zou, Lunkai Lin, Zhiqiang Xie, Ping Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: In the rapidly advancing field of robotics, dual-arm coordination and complex object manipulation are essential capabilities for developing advanced autonomous systems. However, the scarcity of diverse, high-quality demonstration data and real-world-aligned evaluation benchmarks severely limits such development. To address this, we introduce RoboTwin, a generative digital twin framework that uses 3D generative foundation models and large language models to produce diverse expert datasets and provide a real-world-aligned evaluation platform for dual-arm robotic tasks. Specifically, RoboTwin creates varied digital twins of objects from single 2D images, generating realistic and interactive scenarios. It also introduces a spatial relation-aware code generation framework that combines object annotations with large language models to break down tasks, determine spatial constraints, and generate precise robotic movement code. Our framework offers a comprehensive benchmark with both simulated and real-world data, enabling standardized evaluation and better alignment between simulated training and real-world performance. We validated our approach using the open-source COBOT Magic Robot platform. Policies pre-trained on RoboTwin-generated data and fine-tuned with limited real-world samples improve the success rate of over 70% for single-arm tasks and over 40% for dual-arm tasks compared to models trained solely on real-world data. This significant improvement demonstrates RoboTwin's potential to enhance the development and evaluation of dual-arm robotic manipulation systems.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Riccardo De Monte, Davide Dalle Pezze, Marina Ceccon, Francesco Pasti, Francesco Paissan, Elisabetta Farella, Gian Antonio Susto, Nicola Bellotto</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) aims to learn new data while remembering previously acquired knowledge. In contrast to CL for image classification, CL for Object Detection faces additional challenges such as the missing annotations problem. In this scenario, images from previous tasks may contain instances of unknown classes that could reappear as labeled in future tasks, leading to task interference in replay-based approaches. Consequently, most approaches in the literature have focused on distillation-based techniques, which are effective when there is a significant class overlap between tasks. In our work, we propose an alternative to distillation-based approaches with a novel approach called Replay Consolidation with Label Propagation for Object Detection (RCLPOD). RCLPOD enhances the replay memory by improving the quality of the stored samples through a technique that promotes class balance while also improving the quality of the ground truth associated with these samples through a technique called label propagation. RCLPOD outperforms existing techniques on well-established benchmarks such as VOC and COC. Moreover, our approach is developed to work with modern architectures like YOLOv8, making it suitable for dynamic, real-world applications such as autonomous driving and robotics, where continuous learning and resource efficiency are essential.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahao Lai, Jiaqi Li, Jian Xu, Yanru Wu, Boshi Tang, Siqi Chen, Yongfeng Huang, Wenbo Ding, Yang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a decentralized approach to model training, where data remains local and only model parameters are shared between the clients and the central server. Traditional methods, such as Federated Averaging (FedAvg), linearly aggregate these parameters which are usually trained on heterogeneous data distributions, potentially overlooking the complex, high-dimensional nature of the parameter space. This can result in degraded performance of the aggregated model. While personalized FL approaches can mitigate the heterogeneous data issue to some extent, the limitation of linear aggregation remains unresolved. To alleviate this issue, we investigate the generative approach of diffusion model and propose a novel generative parameter aggregation framework for personalized FL, \texttt{pFedGPA}. In this framework, we deploy a diffusion model on the server to integrate the diverse parameter distributions and propose a parameter inversion method to efficiently generate a set of personalized parameters for each client. This inversion method transforms the uploaded parameters into a latent code, which is then aggregated through denoising sampling to produce the final personalized parameters. By encoding the dependence of a client's model parameters on the specific data distribution using the high-capacity diffusion model, \texttt{pFedGPA} can effectively decouple the complexity of the overall distribution of all clients' model parameters from the complexity of each individual client's parameter distribution. Our experimental results consistently demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method across multiple datasets, surpassing baseline approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yechan Kim, SooYeon Kim, Moongu Jeon</p>
<p>Abstract: Data augmentation has shown significant advancements in computer vision to improve model performance over the years, particularly in scenarios with limited and insufficient data. Currently, most studies focus on adjusting the image or its features to expand the size, quality, and variety of samples during training in various tasks including object detection. However, we argue that it is necessary to investigate bounding box transformations as a data augmentation technique rather than image-level transformations, especially in aerial imagery due to potentially inconsistent bounding box annotations. Hence, this letter presents a thorough investigation of bounding box transformation in terms of scaling, rotation, and translation for remote sensing object detection. We call this augmentation strategy NBBOX (Noise Injection into Bounding Box). We conduct extensive experiments on DOTA and DIOR-R, both well-known datasets that include a variety of rotated generic objects in aerial images. Experimental results show that our approach significantly improves remote sensing object detection without whistles and bells and it is more time-efficient than other state-of-the-art augmentation strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Paula Ontalvilla, Aitor Ormazabal, Gorka Azkune</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of autoregressive Language Models (LM) it has been shown that due to reporting bias, LMs lack visual knowledge, i.e. they do not know much about the visual world and its properties. To augment LMs with visual knowledge, existing solutions often rely on explicit images, requiring time-consuming retrieval or image generation systems. This paper shows that explicit images are not necessary to visually augment an LM. Instead, we use visually-grounded text representations obtained from the well-known CLIP multimodal system. For a fair comparison, we modify VALM, a visually-augmented LM which uses image retrieval and representation, to work directly with visually-grounded text representations. We name this new model BLIND-VALM. We show that BLIND-VALM performs on par with VALM for Visual Language Understanding (VLU), Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Language Modeling tasks, despite being significantly more efficient and simpler. We also show that scaling up our model within the compute budget of VALM, either increasing the model or pre-training corpus size, we outperform VALM for all the evaluation tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents LOLA, a massively multilingual large language model trained on more than 160 languages using a sparse Mixture-of-Experts Transformer architecture. Our architectural and implementation choices address the challenge of harnessing linguistic diversity while maintaining efficiency and avoiding the common pitfalls of multilinguality.

Additionally, we demonstrate how the learned expert-routing mechanism exploits implicit phylogenetic linguistic patterns to potentially alleviate the curse of multilinguality. We provide an in-depth look at the training process, an analysis of the datasets, and a balanced exploration of the model's strengths and limitations. As an open-source model, LOLA promotes reproducibility and serves as a robust foundation for future research. Our findings enable the development of compute-efficient multilingual models with strong, scalable performance across languages.</p>

<p>Abstract: Arabic, with its rich diversity of dialects, remains significantly underrepresented in Large Language Models, particularly in dialectal variations. We address this gap by introducing seven synthetic datasets in dialects alongside Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), created using Machine Translation (MT) combined with human post-editing. We present AraDiCE, a benchmark for Arabic Dialect and Cultural Evaluation. We evaluate LLMs on dialect comprehension and generation, focusing specifically on low-resource Arabic dialects. Additionally, we introduce the first-ever fine-grained benchmark designed to evaluate cultural awareness across the Gulf, Egypt, and Levant regions, providing a novel dimension to LLM evaluation. Our findings demonstrate that while Arabic-specific models like Jais and AceGPT outperform multilingual models on dialectal tasks, significant challenges persist in dialect identification, generation, and translation. This work contributes $\approx$45K post-edited samples, a cultural benchmark, and highlights the importance of tailored training to improve LLM performance in capturing the nuances of diverse Arabic dialects and cultural contexts. We have released the dialectal translation models and benchmarks developed in this study (https://huggingface.co/datasets/QCRI/AraDiCE).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrianos Michail, Simon Clematide, Juri Opitz</p>
<p>Abstract: The task of determining whether two texts are paraphrases has long been a challenge in NLP. However, the prevailing notion of paraphrase is often quite simplistic, offering only a limited view of the vast spectrum of paraphrase phenomena. Indeed, we find that evaluating models in a paraphrase dataset can leave uncertainty about their true semantic understanding. To alleviate this, we create PARAPHRASUS, a benchmark designed for multi-dimensional assessment, benchmarking and selection of paraphrase detection models. We find that paraphrase detection models under our fine-grained evaluation lens exhibit trade-offs that cannot be captured through a single classification dataset. Furthermore, PARAPHRASUS allows prompt calibration for different use cases, tailoring LLM models to specific strictness levels. PARAPHRASUS includes 3 challenges spanning over 10 datasets, including 8 repurposed and 2 newly annotated; we release it along with a benchmarking library at https://github.com/impresso/paraphrasus</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youngsun Lim, Hojun Choi, Hyunjung Shim</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the impressive success of text-to-image (TTI) generation models, existing studies overlook the issue of whether these models accurately convey factual information. In this paper, we focus on the problem of image hallucination, where images created by generation models fail to faithfully depict factual content. To address this, we introduce I-HallA (Image Hallucination evaluation with Question Answering), a novel automated evaluation metric that measures the factuality of generated images through visual question answering (VQA). We also introduce I-HallA v1.0, a curated benchmark dataset for this purpose. As part of this process, we develop a pipeline that generates high-quality question-answer pairs using multiple GPT-4 Omni-based agents, with human judgments to ensure accuracy. Our evaluation protocols measure image hallucination by testing if images from existing text-to-image models can correctly respond to these questions. The I-HallA v1.0 dataset comprises 1.2K diverse image-text pairs across nine categories with 1,000 rigorously curated questions covering various compositional challenges. We evaluate five text-to-image models using I-HallA and reveal that these state-of-the-art models often fail to accurately convey factual information. Moreover, we validate the reliability of our metric by demonstrating a strong Spearman correlation (rho=0.95) with human judgments. We believe our benchmark dataset and metric can serve as a foundation for developing factually accurate text-to-image generation models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> \c{S}aban \"Ozt\"urk, O\u{g}uz Can Duran, Tolga \c{C}ukur</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) lower potential risks linked to radiation exposure while relying on advanced denoising algorithms to maintain diagnostic quality in reconstructed images. The reigning paradigm in LDCT denoising is based on neural network models that learn data-driven image priors to separate noise evoked by dose reduction from underlying tissue signals. Naturally, the fidelity of these priors depend on the model's ability to capture the broad range of contextual features evident in CT images. Earlier convolutional neural networks (CNN) are highly adept at efficiently capturing short-range spatial context, but their limited receptive fields reduce sensitivity to interactions over longer distances. Although transformers based on self-attention mechanisms have recently been posed to increase sensitivity to long-range context, they can suffer from suboptimal performance and efficiency due to elevated model complexity, particularly for high-resolution CT images. For high-quality restoration of LDCT images, here we introduce DenoMamba, a novel denoising method based on state-space modeling (SSM), that efficiently captures short- and long-range context in medical images. Following an hourglass architecture with encoder-decoder stages, DenoMamba employs a spatial SSM module to encode spatial context and a novel channel SSM module equipped with a secondary gated convolution network to encode latent features of channel context at each stage. Feature maps from the two modules are then consolidated with low-level input features via a convolution fusion module (CFM). Comprehensive experiments on LDCT datasets with 25\% and 10\% dose reduction demonstrate that DenoMamba outperforms state-of-the-art denoisers with average improvements of 1.4dB PSNR, 1.1% SSIM, and 1.6% RMSE in recovered image quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hang Chen, Jiaying Zhu, Xinyu Yang, Wenya Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Circuit discovery with edge-level ablation has become a foundational framework for mechanism interpretability of language models. However, its focus on individual edges often overlooks the sequential, path-level causal relationships that underpin complex behaviors, thus potentially leading to misleading or incomplete circuit discoveries. To address this issue, we propose a novel path-level circuit discovery framework capturing how behaviors emerge through interconnected linear chain and build towards complex behaviors. Our framework is constructed upon a fully-disentangled linear combinations of ``memory circuits'' decomposed from the original model. To discover functional circuit paths, we leverage a 2-step pruning strategy by first reducing the computational graph to a faithful and minimal subgraph and then applying causal mediation to identify common paths of a specific skill, termed as skill paths. In contrast to circuit graph from existing works, we focus on the complete paths of a generic skill rather than on the fine-grained responses to individual components of the input. To demonstrate this, we explore three generic language skills, namely Previous Token Skill, Induction Skill and In-Context Learning Skill using our framework and provide more compelling evidence to substantiate stratification and inclusiveness of these skills.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaewoo Lee, Joonho Ko, Jinheon Baek, Soyeong Jeong, Sung Ju Hwang</p>
<p>Abstract: Information Retrieval (IR) methods aim to identify documents relevant to a query, which have been widely applied in various natural language tasks. However, existing approaches typically consider only the textual content within documents, overlooking the fact that documents can contain multiple modalities, including images and tables. Also, they often segment each long document into multiple discrete passages for embedding, which prevents them from capturing the overall document context and interactions between paragraphs. To address these two challenges, we propose a method that holistically embeds documents interleaved with multiple modalities by leveraging the capability of recent vision-language models that enable the processing and integration of text, images, and tables into a unified format and representation. Moreover, to mitigate the information loss from segmenting documents into passages, instead of representing and retrieving passages individually, we further merge the representations of segmented passages into one single document representation, while we additionally introduce a reranking strategy to decouple and identify the relevant passage within the document if necessary. Then, through extensive experiments on diverse IR scenarios considering both the textual and multimodal queries, we show that our approach substantially outperforms relevant baselines, thanks to the consideration of the multimodal information within documents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shujin Wu, May Fung, Cheng Qian, Jeonghwan Kim, Dilek Hakkani-Tur, Heng Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) demonstrate increasingly advanced capabilities, aligning their behaviors with human values and preferences becomes crucial for their wide adoption. While previous research focuses on general alignment to principles such as helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty, the need to account for individual and diverse preferences has been largely overlooked, potentially undermining customized human experiences. To address this gap, we train LLMs that can ''interact to align'', essentially cultivating the meta-skill of LLMs to implicitly infer the unspoken personalized preferences of the current user through multi-turn conversations, and then dynamically align their following behaviors and responses to these inferred preferences. Our approach involves establishing a diverse pool of 3,310 distinct user personas by initially creating seed examples, which are then expanded through iterative self-generation and filtering. Guided by distinct user personas, we leverage multi-LLM collaboration to develop a multi-turn preference dataset containing 3K+ multi-turn conversations in tree structures. Finally, we apply supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to enhance LLMs using this dataset. For evaluation, we establish the ALOE (ALign With CustOmized PrEferences) benchmark, consisting of 100 carefully selected examples and well-designed metrics to measure the customized alignment performance during conversations. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in enabling dynamic, personalized alignment via interaction.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have a transformative impact on a variety of scientific tasks across disciplines including biology, chemistry, medicine, and physics. However, ensuring the safety alignment of these models in scientific research remains an underexplored area, with existing benchmarks primarily focusing on textual content and overlooking key scientific representations such as molecular, protein, and genomic languages. Moreover, the safety mechanisms of LLMs in scientific tasks are insufficiently studied. To address these limitations, we introduce SciSafeEval, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the safety alignment of LLMs across a range of scientific tasks. SciSafeEval spans multiple scientific languages-including textual, molecular, protein, and genomic-and covers a wide range of scientific domains. We evaluate LLMs in zero-shot, few-shot and chain-of-thought settings, and introduce a "jailbreak" enhancement feature that challenges LLMs equipped with safety guardrails, rigorously testing their defenses against malicious intention. Our benchmark surpasses existing safety datasets in both scale and scope, providing a robust platform for assessing the safety and performance of LLMs in scientific contexts. This work aims to facilitate the responsible development and deployment of LLMs, promoting alignment with safety and ethical standards in scientific research.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models have been successfully applied to programming assistance tasks, such as code completion, code insertion, and instructional code editing. However, these applications remain insufficiently automated and struggle to effectively integrate various types of information during the programming process, including coding history, current code, and user instructions. In this work, we propose a new conversational framework that comprehensively integrates these information sources, collect data to train our models and evaluate their performance. Firstly, to thoroughly evaluate how well models align with different types of information and the quality of their outputs, we introduce a new benchmark, APEval (Assist Programming Eval), to comprehensively assess the performance of models in programming assistance tasks. Then, for data collection, we develop a data generation pipeline, Programming-Instruct, which synthesizes training data from diverse sources, such as GitHub and online judge platforms. This pipeline can automatically generate various types of messages throughout the programming process. Finally, using this pipeline, we generate 219K samples, fine-tune multiple models, and develop the CursorCore series. We show that CursorCore outperforms other models of comparable size. This framework unifies applications such as inline chat and automated editing, contributes to the advancement of coding assistants.

<p>Abstract: Recent works integrating Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have led to promising improvements in enhancing reasoning accuracy of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, current benchmarks focus mainly on closed-ended tasks, leaving a gap in the assessment of more complex real-world scenarios. This gap has also obscured the evaluation of KGs' potential to mitigate the problem of hallucination in LLMs. To fill the gap, we introduce OKGQA, a new benchmark specifically designed to assess LLMs enhanced with KGs under open-ended, real-world question answering scenarios. OKGQA is designed to closely reflect the complexities of practical applications using questions from different types, and incorporates specific metrics to measure both the reduction in hallucinations and the enhancement in reasoning capabilities. To consider the scenario in which KGs may have varying levels of mistakes, we propose another benchmark variant OKGQA-P to assess model performance when the semantics and structure of KGs are deliberately perturbed and contaminated. OKGQA aims to (1) explore whether KGs can make LLMs more trustworthy in an open-ended setting, and (2) conduct a comparative analysis to shed light on methods and future directions for leveraging KGs to reduce LLMs' hallucination. We believe that this study can facilitate a more complete performance comparison and encourage continuous improvement in integrating KGs with LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingni Wang, Tiantian Geng, Zhiyuan Wang, Teng Wang, Bo Fu, Feng Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) exhibit promising advancements across various tasks, yet they still encounter significant trustworthiness issues. Prior studies apply Split Conformal Prediction (SCP) in language modeling to construct prediction sets with statistical guarantees. However, these methods typically rely on internal model logits or are restricted to multiple-choice settings, which hampers their generalizability and adaptability in dynamic, open-ended environments. In this paper, we introduce TRON, a two-step framework for risk control and assessment, applicable to any MLLM that supports sampling in both open-ended and closed-ended scenarios. TRON comprises two main components: (1) a novel conformal score to sample response sets of minimum size, and (2) a nonconformity score to identify high-quality responses based on self-consistency theory, controlling the error rates by two specific risk levels. Furthermore, we investigate semantic redundancy in prediction sets within open-ended contexts for the first time, leading to a promising evaluation metric for MLLMs based on average set size. Our comprehensive experiments across four Video Question-Answering (VideoQA) datasets utilizing eight MLLMs show that TRON achieves desired error rates bounded by two user-specified risk levels. Additionally, deduplicated prediction sets maintain adaptiveness while being more efficient and stable for risk assessment under different risk levels.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maximilian Xiling Li, Korbinian Franz Rudolf, Nils Blank, Rudolf Lioutikov</p>
<p>Abstract: Prototype Learning methods provide an interpretable alternative to black-box deep learning models. Approaches such as ProtoPNet learn, which part of a test image "look like" known prototypical parts from training images, combining predictive power with the inherent interpretability of case-based reasoning. However, existing approaches have two main drawbacks: A) They rely solely on deterministic similarity scores without statistical confidence. B) The prototypes are learned in a black-box manner without human input. This work introduces HyperPg, a new prototype representation leveraging Gaussian distributions on a hypersphere in latent space, with learnable mean and variance. HyperPg prototypes adapt to the spread of clusters in the latent space and output likelihood scores. The new architecture, HyperPgNet, leverages HyperPg to learn prototypes aligned with human concepts from pixel-level annotations. Consequently, each prototype represents a specific concept such as color, image texture, or part of the image subject. A concept extraction pipeline built on foundation models provides pixel-level annotations, significantly reducing human labeling effort. Experiments on CUB-200-2011 and Stanford Cars datasets demonstrate that HyperPgNet outperforms other prototype learning architectures while using fewer parameters and training steps. Additionally, the concept-aligned HyperPg prototypes are learned transparently, enhancing model interpretability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinjin Cai, Ruiqi Wang, Dezhong Zhao, Ziqin Yuan, Victoria McKenna, Aaron Friedman, Rachel Foot, Susan Storey, Ryan Boente, Sudip Vhaduri, Byung-Cheol Min</p>
<p>Abstract: Audio-based disease prediction is emerging as a promising supplement to traditional medical diagnosis methods, facilitating early, convenient, and non-invasive disease detection and prevention. Multimodal fusion, which integrates features from various domains within or across bio-acoustic modalities, has proven effective in enhancing diagnostic performance. However, most existing methods in the field employ unilateral fusion strategies that focus solely on either intra-modal or inter-modal fusion. This approach limits the full exploitation of the complementary nature of diverse acoustic feature domains and bio-acoustic modalities. Additionally, the inadequate and isolated exploration of latent dependencies within modality-specific and modality-shared spaces curtails their capacity to manage the inherent heterogeneity in multimodal data. To fill these gaps, we propose a transformer-based hierarchical fusion network designed for general multimodal audio-based disease prediction. Specifically, we seamlessly integrate intra-modal and inter-modal fusion in a hierarchical manner and proficiently encode the necessary intra-modal and inter-modal complementary correlations, respectively. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in predicting three diseases: COVID-19, Parkinson's disease, and pathological dysarthria, showcasing its promising potential in a broad context of audio-based disease prediction tasks. Additionally, extensive ablation studies and qualitative analyses highlight the significant benefits of each main component within our model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Biplov Paneru, Bishwash Paneru, Khem Narayan Poudyal</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents an Artificial Intelligence (AI) integrated novel approach to Brain-Computer Interface (BCI)-based wheelchair development, utilizing a voluntary Right Left Hand Movement mechanism for control. The system is designed to simulate wheelchair navigation based on voluntary right and left-hand movements using electroencephalogram (EEG) data. A pre-filtered dataset, obtained from an open-source EEG repository, was segmented into arrays of 19x200 to capture the onset of hand movements. The data was acquired at a sampling frequency 200Hz in the laboratory experiment. The system integrates a Tkinter-based interface for simulating wheelchair movements, offering users a functional and intuitive control system. Various machine learning models, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), XGBoost, random forest, and a Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) attention-based model, were developed. The random forest model obtained 79% accuracy. Great performance was seen on the Logistic Regression model which outperforms other models with 92% accuracy and 91% accuracy on the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model. The Bi-LSTM attention-based model achieved a mean accuracy of 86% through cross-validation, showcasing the potential of attention mechanisms in BCI applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Advanced applied mathematics problems are underrepresented in existing Large Language Model (LLM) benchmark datasets. To address this, we introduce HARDMath, a dataset inspired by a graduate course on asymptotic methods, featuring challenging applied mathematics problems that require analytical approximation techniques. These problems demand a combination of mathematical reasoning, computational tools, and subjective judgment, making them difficult for LLMs. Our framework auto-generates a large number of problems with solutions validated against numerical ground truths. We evaluate both open- and closed-source LLMs on HARDMath-mini, a sub-sampled test set of 366 problems, as well as on 40 word problems formulated in applied science contexts. Even leading closed-source models like GPT-4 achieve only 43.8% overall accuracy with few-shot Chain-of-Thought prompting, and all models demonstrate significantly lower performance compared to results on existing mathematics benchmark datasets. We additionally conduct a detailed error analysis to gain insights into the failure cases of LLMs. These results demonstrate limitations of current LLM performance on advanced graduate-level applied math problems and underscore the importance of datasets like HARDMath to advance mathematical abilities of LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lisa Dunlap, Krishna Mandal, Trevor Darrell, Jacob Steinhardt, Joseph E Gonzalez</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit subtle yet distinctive characteristics in their outputs that users intuitively recognize, but struggle to quantify. These "vibes" -- such as tone, formatting, or writing style -- influence user preferences, yet traditional evaluations focus primarily on the singular axis of correctness. We introduce VibeCheck, a system for automatically comparing a pair of LLMs by discovering identifying traits of a model (vibes) that are well-defined, differentiating, and user-aligned. VibeCheck iteratively discovers vibes from model outputs and then utilizes a panel of LLM judges to quantitatively measure the utility of each vibe. We validate that the vibes generated by VibeCheck align with those found in human discovery and run VibeCheck on pairwise preference data from real-world user conversations with Llama-3-70b vs GPT-4. VibeCheck reveals that Llama has a friendly, funny, and somewhat controversial vibe. These vibes predict model identity with 80% accuracy and human preference with 61% accuracy. Lastly, we run VibeCheck on a variety of models and tasks including summarization, math, and captioning to provide insight into differences in model behavior. VibeCheck discovers vibes like Command X prefers to add concrete intros and conclusions when summarizing in comparison to TNGL, Llama-405b often overexplains its thought process on math problems compared to GPT-4o, and GPT-4 prefers to focus on the mood and emotions of the scene when captioning compared to Gemini-1.5-Flash.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joshua Kazdan, Rylan Schaeffer, Apratim Dey, Matthias Gerstgrasser, Rafael Rafailov, David L. Donoho, Sanmi Koyejo</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing presence of AI-generated content on the internet raises a critical question: What happens when generative machine learning models are pretrained on web-scale datasets containing data created by earlier models? Some authors prophesy \textit{model collapse} under a `{\it replace}' scenario: a sequence of models, the first trained with real data and each later one trained {\it only on} synthetic data from its preceding model. In this scenario, models successively degrade. Others see collapse as avoidable; in an `{\it accumulate}' scenario, a sequence of models is trained, but each training uses all real and synthetic data generated so far. In this work, we deepen and extend the study of these contrasting scenarios. First, collapse versus avoidance of collapse is studied by comparing the replace and accumulate scenarios on each of three prominent generative modeling settings; we find the same contrast emerges in all three settings. Second, we study a compromise scenario; the available data remains the same as in the {\it accumulate} scenario -- but unlike {\it accumulate} and like {\it replace}, each model is trained using a fixed compute budget; we demonstrate that model test loss on real data is larger than in the {\it accumulate} scenario, but apparently plateaus, unlike the divergence seen with {\it replace}. Third, we study the relative importance of cardinality and proportion of real data for avoiding model collapse. Surprisingly, we find a non-trivial interaction between real and synthetic data, where the value of synthetic data for reducing test loss depends on the absolute quantity of real data. Our insights are particularly important when forecasting whether future frontier generative models will collapse or thrive, and our results open avenues for empirically and mathematically studying the context-dependent value of synthetic data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jerry Huang, Prasanna Parthasarathi, Mehdi Rezagholizadeh, Boxing Chen, Sarath Chandar</p>
<p>Abstract: The growth in prominence of large language models (LLMs) in everyday life can be largely attributed to their generative abilities, yet some of this is also owed to the risks and costs associated with their use. On one front is their tendency to \textit{hallucinate} false or misleading information, limiting their reliability. On another is the increasing focus on the computational limitations associated with traditional self-attention based LLMs, which has brought about new alternatives, in particular recurrent models, meant to overcome them. Yet it remains uncommon to consider these two concerns simultaneously. Do changes in architecture exacerbate/alleviate existing concerns about hallucinations? Do they affect how and where they occur? Through an extensive evaluation, we study how these architecture-based inductive biases affect the propensity to hallucinate. While hallucination remains a general phenomenon not limited to specific architectures, the situations in which they occur and the ease with which specific types of hallucinations can be induced can significantly differ based on the model architecture. These findings highlight the need for better understanding both these problems in conjunction with each other, as well as consider how to design more universal techniques for handling hallucinations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Woosung Koh, Jang Han Yoon, MinHyung Lee, Youngjin Song, Jaegwan Cho, Jaehyun Kang, Taehyeon Kim, Se-young Yun, Youngjae Yu, Bongshin Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating high-quality charts with Large Language Models (LLMs) presents significant challenges due to limited data and the high cost of scaling through human curation. $\langle \text{instruction}, \text{data}, \text{code} \rangle$ triplets are scarce and expensive to manually curate as their creation demands technical expertise. To address this scalability challenge, we introduce a reference-free automatic feedback generator, which eliminates the need for costly human intervention. Our novel framework, C$^2$, consists of (1) an automatic feedback provider (ChartAF) and (2) a diverse, reference-free dataset (ChartUIE-8K). The results are compelling: in our first experiment, 74% of respondents strongly preferred, and 10% preferred, the results after feedback. The second post-feedback experiment demonstrates that ChartAF outperform nine baselines. Moreover, ChartUIE-8K significantly improves data diversity by increasing queries, datasets, and chart types by 5982%, 1936%, and 91%, respectively, over benchmarks. Finally, a study of LLM users revealed that 94% of participants preferred ChartUIE-8K's queries, with 93% deeming them aligned with real-world use cases. Core contributions are available as open-source at chartsquared.github.io, with ample qualitative examples.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zixuan Gong, Guangyin Bao, Qi Zhang, Zhongwei Wan, Duoqian Miao, Shoujin Wang, Lei Zhu, Changwei Wang, Rongtao Xu, Liang Hu, Ke Liu, Yu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Reconstruction of static visual stimuli from non-invasion brain activity fMRI achieves great success, owning to advanced deep learning models such as CLIP and Stable Diffusion. However, the research on fMRI-to-video reconstruction remains limited since decoding the spatiotemporal perception of continuous visual experiences is formidably challenging. We contend that the key to addressing these challenges lies in accurately decoding both high-level semantics and low-level perception flows, as perceived by the brain in response to video stimuli. To the end, we propose NeuroClips, an innovative framework to decode high-fidelity and smooth video from fMRI. NeuroClips utilizes a semantics reconstructor to reconstruct video keyframes, guiding semantic accuracy and consistency, and employs a perception reconstructor to capture low-level perceptual details, ensuring video smoothness. During inference, it adopts a pre-trained T2V diffusion model injected with both keyframes and low-level perception flows for video reconstruction. Evaluated on a publicly available fMRI-video dataset, NeuroClips achieves smooth high-fidelity video reconstruction of up to 6s at 8FPS, gaining significant improvements over state-of-the-art models in various metrics, e.g., a 128% improvement in SSIM and an 81% improvement in spatiotemporal metrics.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Changyuan Zhao, Hongyang Du, Guangyuan Liu, Dusit Niyato</p>
<p>Abstract: Score-based generative models can effectively learn the distribution of data by estimating the gradient of the distribution. Due to the multi-step denoising characteristic, researchers have recently considered combining score-based generative models with the gradient boosting algorithm, a multi-step supervised learning algorithm, to solve supervised learning tasks. However, existing generative model algorithms are often limited by the stochastic nature of the models and the long inference time, impacting prediction performances. Therefore, we propose a Supervised Score-based Model (SSM), which can be viewed as a gradient boosting algorithm combining score matching. We provide a theoretical analysis of learning and sampling for SSM to balance inference time and prediction accuracy. Via the ablation experiment in selected examples, we demonstrate the outstanding performances of the proposed techniques. Additionally, we compare our model with other probabilistic models, including Natural Gradient Boosting (NGboost), Classification and Regression Diffusion Models (CARD), Diffusion Boosted Trees (DBT), and non-probabilistic GBM models. The experimental results show that our model outperforms existing models in both accuracy and inference time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yujia Hu, Tuan-Phong Nguyen, Shrestha Ghosh, Simon Razniewski</p>
<p>Abstract: LLMs have majorly advanced NLP and AI, and next to their ability to perform a wide range of procedural tasks, a major success factor is their internalized factual knowledge. Since (Petroni et al., 2019), analyzing this knowledge has gained attention. However, most approaches investigate one question at a time via modest-sized pre-defined samples, introducing an availability bias (Tversky and Kahnemann, 1973) that prevents the discovery of knowledge (or beliefs) of LLMs beyond the experimenter's predisposition.
  To address this challenge, we propose a novel methodology to comprehensively materializing an LLM's factual knowledge through recursive querying and result consolidation.
  As a prototype, we employ GPT-4o-mini to construct GPTKB, a large-scale knowledge base (KB) comprising 105 million triples for over 2.9 million entities - achieved at 1% of the cost of previous KB projects. This work marks a milestone in two areas: For LLM research, for the first time, it provides constructive insights into the scope and structure of LLMs' knowledge (or beliefs). For KB construction, it pioneers new pathways for the long-standing challenge of general-domain KB construction. GPTKB is accessible at https://gptkb.org.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shauli Ravfogel, Anej Svete, V\'esteinn Sn{\ae}bjarnarson, Ryan Cotterell</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding and manipulating the causal generation mechanisms in language models is essential for controlling their behavior. Previous work has primarily relied on techniques such as representation surgery -- e.g., model ablations or manipulation of linear subspaces tied to specific concepts -- to \emph{intervene} on these models. To understand the impact of interventions precisely, it is useful to examine counterfactuals -- e.g., how a given sentence would have appeared had it been generated by the model following a specific intervention. We highlight that counterfactual reasoning is conceptually distinct from interventions, as articulated in Pearl's causal hierarchy. Based on this observation, we propose a framework for generating true string counterfactuals by reformulating language models as a structural equation model using the Gumbel-max trick, which we called Gumbel counterfactual generation. This reformulation allows us to model the joint distribution over original strings and their counterfactuals resulting from the same instantiation of the sampling noise. We develop an algorithm based on hindsight Gumbel sampling that allows us to infer the latent noise variables and generate counterfactuals of observed strings. Our experiments demonstrate that the approach produces meaningful counterfactuals while at the same time showing that commonly used intervention techniques have considerable undesired side effects.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Caspar Oesterheld, Emery Cooper, Miles Kodama, Linh Chi Nguyen, Ethan Perez</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a dataset of natural-language questions in the decision theory of so-called Newcomb-like problems. Newcomb-like problems include, for instance, decision problems in which an agent interacts with a similar other agent, and thus has to reason about the fact that the other agent will likely reason in similar ways. Evaluating LLM reasoning about Newcomb-like problems is important because interactions between foundation-model-based agents will often be Newcomb-like. Some ways of reasoning about Newcomb-like problems may allow for greater cooperation between models.
  Our dataset contains both capabilities questions (i.e., questions with a unique, uncontroversially correct answer) and attitude questions (i.e., questions about which decision theorists would disagree). We use our dataset for an investigation of decision-theoretical capabilities and expressed attitudes and their interplay in existing models (different models by OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, GDM, Reka, etc.), as well as models under simple prompt-based interventions. We find, among other things, that attitudes vary significantly between existing models; that high capabilities are associated with attitudes more favorable toward so-called evidential decision theory; and that attitudes are consistent across different types of questions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxuan Hu, Ke Wang, Xiaokang Zhang, Fanjin Zhang, Cuiping Li, Hong Chen, Jing Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Speculative decoding (SD) has been demonstrated as an effective technique for lossless LLM inference acceleration. Retrieval-based SD methods, one kind of model-free method, have yielded promising speedup, but they often rely on incomplete retrieval resources, inefficient retrieval methods, and are constrained to certain domains. This paper presents a novel retrieval-based speculative decoding method that adapts suffix automaton (SAM) for efficient and accurate draft generation by utilizing common text corpus and dynamic text sequence. Unlike existing $n$-gram matching methods, SAM-Decoding finds the exact longest suffix match, achieving an average time complexity of O(1) per generation step of SAM update and suffix retrieval. It can also integrate with existing methods, adaptively selecting a draft generation strategy based on match length to generalize to broader domains. Extensive experiments on Spec-Bench show that our method is $18\%+$ faster than other retrieval-based SD methods. Additionally, when combined with advanced EAGLE-2, it provides an additional speedup of $3.28\%$ -- $11.13\%$ across various-sized LLM backbones.

The model training involved several key steps, including extensive data preprocessing, the creation of a custom German tokenizer, the training itself, as well as the evaluation of the final models on various benchmarks. Throughout the training process, multiple checkpoints were saved and analyzed using the SuperGLEBer benchmark to monitor the models' learning dynamics. Compared to state-of-the-art models on the SuperGLEBer benchmark, both LL\"aMmlein models performed competitively, consistently matching or surpassing models with similar parameter sizes. The results show that the models' quality scales with size as expected, but performance improvements on some tasks plateaued early, offering valuable insights into resource allocation for future model development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zixin Liu, Ji Zhang, Yiran Ding</p>
<p>Abstract: Group polarization is an important research direction in social media content analysis, attracting many researchers to explore this field. Therefore, how to effectively measure group polarization has become a critical topic. Measuring group polarization on social media presents several challenges that have not yet been addressed by existing solutions. First, social media group polarization measurement involves processing vast amounts of text, which poses a significant challenge for information extraction. Second, social media texts often contain hard-to-understand content, including sarcasm, memes, and internet slang. Additionally, group polarization research focuses on holistic analysis, while texts is typically fragmented. To address these challenges, we designed a solution based on a multi-agent system and used a graph-structured Community Sentiment Network (CSN) to represent polarization states. Furthermore, we developed a metric called Community Opposition Index (COI) based on the CSN to quantify polarization. Finally, we tested our multi-agent system through a zero-shot stance detection task and achieved outstanding results. In summary, the proposed approach has significant value in terms of usability, accuracy, and interpretability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huaizhi Ge, Yiming Li, Qifan Wang, Yongfeng Zhang, Ruixiang Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to be vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where triggers embedded in poisoned samples can maliciously alter LLMs' behaviors. In this paper, we move beyond attacking LLMs and instead examine backdoor attacks through the novel lens of natural language explanations. Specifically, we leverage LLMs' generative capabilities to produce human-readable explanations for their decisions, enabling direct comparisons between explanations for clean and poisoned samples. Our results show that backdoored models produce coherent explanations for clean inputs but diverse and logically flawed explanations for poisoned data, a pattern consistent across classification and generation tasks for different backdoor attacks. Further analysis reveals key insights into the explanation generation process. At the token level, explanation tokens associated with poisoned samples only appear in the final few transformer layers. At the sentence level, attention dynamics indicate that poisoned inputs shift attention away from the original input context during explanation generation. These findings enhance our understanding of backdoor mechanisms in LLMs and present a promising framework for detecting vulnerabilities through explainability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Max Lovitt, Haotian Ma, Song Wang, Yifan Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: With social media communities increasingly becoming places where suicidal individuals post and congregate, natural language processing presents an exciting avenue for the development of automated suicide risk assessment systems. However, past efforts suffer from a lack of labeled data and class imbalances within the available labeled data. To accommodate this task's imperfect data landscape, we propose a semi-supervised framework that leverages labeled (n=500) and unlabeled (n=1,500) data and expands upon the self-training algorithm with a novel pseudo-label acquisition process designed to handle imbalanced datasets. To further ensure pseudo-label quality, we manually verify a subset of the pseudo-labeled data that was not predicted unanimously across multiple trials of pseudo-label generation. We test various models to serve as the backbone for this framework, ultimately deciding that RoBERTa performs the best. Ultimately, by leveraging partially validated pseudo-labeled data in addition to ground-truth labeled data, we substantially improve our model's ability to assess suicide risk from social media posts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zheni Zeng, Yuxuan Chen, Shi Yu, Ruobing Wang, Yukun Yan, Zhenghao Liu, Shuo Wang, Xu Han, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Humans can utilize techniques to quickly acquire knowledge from specific materials in advance, such as creating self-assessment questions, enabling us to achieving related tasks more efficiently. In contrast, large language models (LLMs) usually relies on retrieval-augmented generation to exploit knowledge materials in an instant manner, or requires external signals such as human preference data and stronger LLM annotations to conduct knowledge adaptation. To unleash the self-learning potential of LLMs, we propose KBAlign, an approach designed for efficient adaptation to downstream tasks involving knowledge bases. Our method utilizes iterative training with self-annotated data such as Q&A pairs and revision suggestions, enabling the model to grasp the knowledge content efficiently. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, significantly boosting model performance in downstream tasks that require specific knowledge at a low cost. Notably, our approach achieves over 90% of the performance improvement that can be obtained by using GPT-4-turbo annotation, while relying entirely on self-supervision. We release our experimental data, models, and process analyses to the community for further exploration (https://github.com/thunlp/KBAlign).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mackenzie Weygandt Mathis</p>
<p>Abstract: Biological intelligence is inherently adaptive -- animals continually adjust their actions based on environmental feedback. However, creating adaptive artificial intelligence (AI) remains a major challenge. The next frontier is to go beyond traditional AI to develop "adaptive intelligence," defined here as harnessing insights from biological intelligence to build agents that can learn online, generalize, and rapidly adapt to changes in their environment. Recent advances in neuroscience offer inspiration through studies that increasingly focus on how animals naturally learn and adapt their world models. In this Perspective, I will review the behavioral and neural foundations of adaptive biological intelligence, the parallel progress in AI, and explore brain-inspired approaches for building more adaptive algorithms.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate and consistent evaluation is crucial for decision-making across numerous fields, yet it remains a challenging task due to inherent subjectivity, variability, and scale. Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse domains, leading to the emergence of "LLM-as-a-Judge," where LLMs are employed as evaluators for complex tasks. With their ability to process diverse data types and provide scalable, cost-effective, and consistent assessments, LLMs present a compelling alternative to traditional expert-driven evaluations. However, ensuring the reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge systems remains a significant challenge that requires careful design and standardization. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of LLM-as-a-Judge, addressing the core question: How can reliable LLM-as-a-Judge systems be built? We explore strategies to enhance reliability, including improving consistency, mitigating biases, and adapting to diverse assessment scenarios. Additionally, we propose methodologies for evaluating the reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge systems, supported by a novel benchmark designed for this purpose. To advance the development and real-world deployment of LLM-as-a-Judge systems, we also discussed practical applications, challenges, and future directions. This survey serves as a foundational reference for researchers and practitioners in this rapidly evolving field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaojiang Liu, Jiajun Zou, Zhendan Liu, Meixia Dong, Zhiping Wan</p>
<p>Abstract: With the widespread application of human body 3D reconstruction technology across various fields, the demands for data transmission and processing efficiency continue to rise, particularly in scenarios where network bandwidth is limited and low latency is required. This paper introduces an Adversarial Feature Learning-based Semantic Communication method (AFLSC) for human body 3D reconstruction, which focuses on extracting and transmitting semantic information crucial for the 3D reconstruction task, thereby significantly optimizing data flow and alleviating bandwidth pressure. At the sender's end, we propose a multitask learning-based feature extraction method to capture the spatial layout, keypoints, posture, and depth information from 2D human images, and design a semantic encoding technique based on adversarial feature learning to encode these feature information into semantic data. We also develop a dynamic compression technique to efficiently transmit this semantic data, greatly enhancing transmission efficiency and reducing latency. At the receiver's end, we design an efficient multi-level semantic feature decoding method to convert semantic data back into key image features. Finally, an improved ViT-diffusion model is employed for 3D reconstruction, producing human body 3D mesh models. Experimental results validate the advantages of our method in terms of data transmission efficiency and reconstruction quality, demonstrating its excellent potential for application in bandwidth-limited environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have revolutionized the field of talking head generation, yet still face challenges in expressiveness, controllability, and stability in long-time generation. In this research, we propose an EmotiveTalk framework to address these issues. Firstly, to realize better control over the generation of lip movement and facial expression, a Vision-guided Audio Information Decoupling (V-AID) approach is designed to generate audio-based decoupled representations aligned with lip movements and expression. Specifically, to achieve alignment between audio and facial expression representation spaces, we present a Diffusion-based Co-speech Temporal Expansion (Di-CTE) module within V-AID to generate expression-related representations under multi-source emotion condition constraints. Then we propose a well-designed Emotional Talking Head Diffusion (ETHD) backbone to efficiently generate highly expressive talking head videos, which contains an Expression Decoupling Injection (EDI) module to automatically decouple the expressions from reference portraits while integrating the target expression information, achieving more expressive generation performance. Experimental results show that EmotiveTalk can generate expressive talking head videos, ensuring the promised controllability of emotions and stability during long-time generation, yielding state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arian Fooroogh Mand Arabi, Cansu Koyuturk, Michael O'Mahony, Raffaella Calati, Dimitri Ognibene</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents the iterative development of Habit Coach, a GPT-based chatbot designed to support users in habit change through personalized interaction. Employing a user-centered design approach, we developed the chatbot using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, which enables behavior personalization without retraining the underlying language model (GPT-4). The system leverages document retrieval and specialized prompts to tailor interactions, drawing from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and narrative therapy techniques. A key challenge in the development process was the difficulty of translating declarative knowledge into effective interaction behaviors. In the initial phase, the chatbot was provided with declarative knowledge about CBT via reference textbooks and high-level conversational goals. However, this approach resulted in imprecise and inefficient behavior, as the GPT model struggled to convert static information into dynamic and contextually appropriate interactions. This highlighted the limitations of relying solely on declarative knowledge to guide chatbot behavior, particularly in nuanced, therapeutic conversations. Over four iterations, we addressed this issue by gradually transitioning towards procedural knowledge, refining the chatbot's interaction strategies, and improving its overall effectiveness. In the final evaluation, 5 participants engaged with the chatbot over five consecutive days, receiving individualized CBT interventions. The Self-Report Habit Index (SRHI) was used to measure habit strength before and after the intervention, revealing a reduction in habit strength post-intervention. These results underscore the importance of procedural knowledge in driving effective, personalized behavior change support in RAG-based systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: The transformer architecture has become an integral part of the field of modern neural networks, playing a crucial role in a variety of tasks, such as text generation, machine translation, image and audio processing, among others. There is also an alternative approach to building intelligent systems, proposed by Jeff Hawkins and inspired by the processes occurring in the neocortex. In our article we want to combine some of these ideas and to propose the use of homeostasis mechanisms, such as RFB-kWTA and "Smart" Inhibition, in the attention mechanism of the transformer and at the output of the transformer block, as well as conducting an experiment involving the introduction of sparse distributed representations of the transformer at various points. RFB-kWTA utilizes statistics of layer activations across time to adjust the entire layer, enhancing the values of rare activations while reducing those of frequent ones. "Smart" Inhibition also uses activation statistics to sample sparsity masks, with rarer activation times are more likely to be activated. Our proposed mechanisms significantly outperform the classical transformer 0.2768 BLEU and a model that only makes use of dropout in the attention mechanism and output of the transformer block 0.3007 BLEU, achieving a score of 0.3062 on the Multi30K dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract: The advancement of generative AI, particularly large language models (LLMs), has a significant impact on politics and democracy, offering potential across various domains, including policymaking, political communication, analysis, and governance. This paper surveys the recent and potential applications of LLMs in politics, examining both their promises and the associated challenges. This paper examines the ways in which LLMs are being employed in legislative processes, political communication, and political analysis. Moreover, we investigate the potential of LLMs in diplomatic and national security contexts, economic and social modeling, and legal applications. While LLMs offer opportunities to enhance efficiency, inclusivity, and decision-making in political processes, they also present challenges related to bias, transparency, and accountability. The paper underscores the necessity for responsible development, ethical considerations, and governance frameworks to ensure that the integration of LLMs into politics aligns with democratic values and promotes a more just and equitable society.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongxin Wang, Meng Cao, Haokun Lin, Mingfei Han, Liang Ma, Jin Jiang, Yuhao Cheng, Xiaodan Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress on various visual question answering and reasoning tasks leveraging instruction fine-tuning specific datasets. They can also learn from preference data annotated by human to enhance their reasoning ability and mitigate hallucinations. Most of preference data is generated from the model itself. However, existing methods require high-quality critical labels, which are costly and rely on human or proprietary models like GPT-4V. In this work, we propose Enhancing Alignment in MLLMs via Critical Observation (EACO), which aligns MLLMs by self-generated preference data using only 5k images economically. Our approach begins with collecting and refining a Scoring Evaluation Instruction-tuning dataset to train a critical evaluation model, termed the Critic. This Critic observes model responses across multiple dimensions, selecting preferred and non-preferred outputs for refined Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) tuning. To further enhance model performance, we employ an additional supervised fine-tuning stage after preference tuning. EACO reduces the overall hallucinations by 65.6% on HallusionBench and improves the reasoning ability by 21.8% on MME-Cognition. EACO achieves an 8.5% improvement over LLaVA-v1.6-Mistral-7B across multiple benchmarks. Remarkably, EACO also shows the potential critical ability in open-source MLLMs, demonstrating that EACO is a viable path to boost the competence of MLLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minzheng Wang, Xinghua Zhang, Kun Chen, Nan Xu, Haiyang Yu, Fei Huang, Wenji Mao, Yongbin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made dialogue one of the central modes in human-machine interaction, leading to the vast amounts of conversation logs and increasing demand for dialogue generation. The dialogue's life-cycle spans from the $\textit{Prelude}$ through the $\textit{Interlocution}$ to the $\textit{Epilogue}$, encompassing rich dialogue elements. Despite the large volumes of dialogue-related studies, there is a lack of benchmark that encompasses comprehensive dialogue elements, which hinders precise modeling, generation and systematic evaluation. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we introduce a new research task $\textbf{D}$ialogue $\textbf{E}$lement $\textbf{MO}$deling, including $\textit{Element Awareness}$ and $\textit{Dialogue Agent Interaction}$, and propose a novel benchmark, $\textbf{DEMO}$, designed for a comprehensive dialogue modeling and assessment. On this basis, we further build the DEMO agent with the adept ability to model dialogue elements via imitation learning. Extensive experiments on DEMO indicate that current representative LLMs still have considerable potential for enhancement, and our DEMO agent performs well in both dialogue element modeling and out-of-domain tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite the significant strides made by generative AI in just a few short years, its future progress is constrained by the challenge of building modular and robust systems. This capability has been a cornerstone of past technological revolutions, which relied on combining components to create increasingly sophisticated and reliable systems. Cars, airplanes, computers, and software consist of components-such as engines, wheels, CPUs, and libraries-that can be assembled, debugged, and replaced. A key tool for building such reliable and modular systems is specification: the precise description of the expected behavior, inputs, and outputs of each component. However, the generality of LLMs and the inherent ambiguity of natural language make defining specifications for LLM-based components (e.g., agents) both a challenging and urgent problem. In this paper, we discuss the progress the field has made so far-through advances like structured outputs, process supervision, and test-time compute-and outline several future directions for research to enable the development of modular and reliable LLM-based systems through improved specifications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Botnets could autonomously infect, propagate, communicate and coordinate with other members in the botnet, enabling cybercriminals to exploit the cumulative computing and bandwidth of its bots to facilitate cybercrime. Traditional detection methods are becoming increasingly unsuitable against various network-based detection evasion methods. These techniques ultimately render signature-based fingerprinting detection infeasible and thus this research explores the application of network flow-based behavioural modelling to facilitate the binary classification of bot network activity, whereby the detection is independent of underlying communications architectures, ports, protocols and payload-based detection evasion mechanisms. A comparative evaluation of various machine learning classification methods is conducted, to precisely determine the average accuracy of each classifier on bot datasets like CTU-13, ISOT 2010 and ISCX 2014. Additionally, hyperparameter tuning using Genetic Algorithm (GA), aiming to efficiently converge to the fittest hyperparameter set for each dataset was done. The bioinspired optimisation of Random Forest (RF) with GA achieved an average accuracy of 99.85% when it was tested against the three datasets. The model was then developed into a software product.

<p>Abstract: Stochastic configuration networks (SCNs), as a class of randomized learner models, are featured by its way of random parameters assignment in the light of a supervisory mechanism, resulting in the universal approximation property at algorithmic level. This paper presents a kernel version of SCNs, termed KSCNs, aiming to enhance model's representation learning capability and performance stability. The random bases of a built SCN model can be used to span a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), followed by our proposed algorithm for constructing KSCNs. It is shown that the data distribution in the reconstructive space is favorable for regression solving and the proposed KSCN learner models hold the universal approximation property. Three benchmark datasets including two industrial datasets are used in this study for performance evaluation. Experimental results with comparisons against existing solutions clearly demonstrate that the proposed KSCN remarkably outperforms the original SCNs and some typical kernel methods for resolving nonlinear regression problems in terms of the learning performance, the model's stability and robustness with respect to the kernel parameter settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruoxi Cheng, Yizhong Ding, Shuirong Cao, Ranjie Duan, Xiaoshuang Jia, Shaowei Yuan, Zhiqiang Wang, Xiaojun Jia</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding the vulnerabilities of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) to jailbreak attacks is essential for their responsible real-world deployment. Most previous work requires access to model gradients, or is based on human knowledge (prompt engineering) to complete jailbreak, and they hardly consider the interaction of images and text, resulting in inability to jailbreak in black box scenarios or poor performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Prior-Guided Bimodal Interactive Black-Box Jailbreak Attack for toxicity maximization, referred to as PBI-Attack. Our method begins by extracting malicious features from a harmful corpus using an alternative LVLM and embedding these features into a benign image as prior information. Subsequently, we enhance these features through bidirectional cross-modal interaction optimization, which iteratively optimizes the bimodal perturbations in an alternating manner through greedy search, aiming to maximize the toxicity of the generated response. The toxicity level is quantified using a well-trained evaluation model. Experiments demonstrate that PBI-Attack outperforms previous state-of-the-art jailbreak methods, achieving an average attack success rate of 92.5% across three open-source LVLMs and around 67.3% on three closed-source LVLMs. Disclaimer: This paper contains potentially disturbing and offensive content.</p>

<p>Abstract: Traditional greedy tokenization methods have been a critical step in Natural Language Processing (NLP), influencing how text is converted into tokens and directly impacting model performance. While subword tokenizers like Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) are widely used, questions remain about their optimality across model scales and languages. In this work, we demonstrate through extensive experiments that an optimal BPE configuration significantly reduces token count compared to greedy segmentation, yielding improvements in token-saving percentages and performance benefits, particularly for smaller models. We evaluate tokenization performance across various intrinsic and extrinsic tasks, including generation and classification. Our findings suggest that compression-optimized tokenization strategies could provide substantial advantages for multilingual and low-resource language applications, highlighting a promising direction for further research and inclusive NLP.</p>

<p>Abstract: Image Translation (IT) holds immense potential across diverse domains, enabling the translation of textual content within images into various languages. However, existing datasets often suffer from limitations in scale, diversity, and quality, hindering the development and evaluation of IT models. To address this issue, we introduce MIT-10M, a large-scale parallel corpus of multilingual image translation with over 10M image-text pairs derived from real-world data, which has undergone extensive data cleaning and multilingual translation validation. It contains 840K images in three sizes, 28 categories, tasks with three levels of difficulty and 14 languages image-text pairs, which is a considerable improvement on existing datasets. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate and train models on MIT-10M. The experimental results clearly indicate that our dataset has higher adaptability when it comes to evaluating the performance of the models in tackling challenging and complex image translation tasks in the real world. Moreover, the performance of the model fine-tuned with MIT-10M has tripled compared to the baseline model, further confirming its superiority.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junwei Su, Shan Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) are a family of graph neural networks designed to model and learn dynamic information from temporal graphs. Given their substantial empirical success, there is an escalating interest in TGNNs within the research community. However, the majority of these efforts have been channelled towards algorithm and system design, with the evaluation metrics receiving comparatively less attention. Effective evaluation metrics are crucial for providing detailed performance insights, particularly in the temporal domain. This paper investigates the commonly used evaluation metrics for TGNNs and illustrates the failure mechanisms of these metrics in capturing essential temporal structures in the predictive behaviour of TGNNs. We provide a mathematical formulation of existing performance metrics and utilize an instance-based study to underscore their inadequacies in identifying volatility clustering (the occurrence of emerging errors within a brief interval). This phenomenon has profound implications for both algorithm and system design in the temporal domain. To address this deficiency, we introduce a new volatility-aware evaluation metric (termed volatility cluster statistics), designed for a more refined analysis of model temporal performance. Additionally, we demonstrate how this metric can serve as a temporal-volatility-aware training objective to alleviate the clustering of temporal errors. Through comprehensive experiments on various TGNN models, we validate our analysis and the proposed approach. The empirical results offer revealing insights: 1) existing TGNNs are prone to making errors with volatility clustering, and 2) TGNNs with different mechanisms to capture temporal information exhibit distinct volatility clustering patterns. Our empirical findings demonstrate that our proposed training objective effectively reduces volatility clusters in error.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihao Li, Lecheng Zheng, Bowen Jin, Dongqi Fu, Baoyu Jing, Yikun Ban, Jingrui He, Jiawei Han</p>
<p>Abstract: While great success has been achieved in building vision models with Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) over Internet-scale image-text pairs, building transferable Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with CLIP pipeline is challenging because of three fundamental issues: the scarcity of labeled data and text supervision, different levels of downstream tasks, and the conceptual gaps between domains. In this work, to address these issues, we leverage multi-modal prompt learning to effectively adapt pre-trained GNN to downstream tasks and data, given only a few semantically labeled samples, each with extremely weak text supervision. Our new paradigm embeds the graphs directly in the same space as the Large Language Models (LLMs) by learning both graph prompts and text prompts simultaneously. To accomplish this, we improve state-of-the-art graph prompt method, and then propose the first graph-language multi-modal prompt learning approach for exploiting the knowledge in pre-trained models. Notably, due to the insufficient supervision for fine-tuning, in our paradigm, the pre-trained GNN and the LLM are kept frozen, so the learnable parameters are much fewer than fine-tuning any pre-trained model. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate the superior performance of our paradigm in few-shot, multi-task-level, and cross-domain settings. Moreover, we build the first CLIP-style zero-shot classification prototype that can generalize GNNs to unseen classes with extremely weak text supervision.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziqi Gao, Weikai Huang, Jieyu Zhang, Aniruddha Kembhavi, Ranjay Krishna</p>
<p>Abstract: DALL-E and Sora have gained attention by producing implausible images, such as "astronauts riding a horse in space." Despite the proliferation of text-to-vision models that have inundated the internet with synthetic visuals, from images to 3D assets, current benchmarks predominantly evaluate these models on real-world scenes paired with captions. We introduce Generate Any Scene, a framework that systematically enumerates scene graphs representing a vast array of visual scenes, spanning realistic to imaginative compositions. Generate Any Scene leverages 'scene graph programming', a method for dynamically constructing scene graphs of varying complexity from a structured taxonomy of visual elements. This taxonomy includes numerous objects, attributes, and relations, enabling the synthesis of an almost infinite variety of scene graphs. Using these structured representations, Generate Any Scene translates each scene graph into a caption, enabling scalable evaluation of text-to-vision models through standard metrics. We conduct extensive evaluations across multiple text-to-image, text-to-video, and text-to-3D models, presenting key findings on model performance. We find that DiT-backbone text-to-image models align more closely with input captions than UNet-backbone models. Text-to-video models struggle with balancing dynamics and consistency, while both text-to-video and text-to-3D models show notable gaps in human preference alignment. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Generate Any Scene by conducting three practical applications leveraging captions generated by Generate Any Scene: 1) a self-improving framework where models iteratively enhance their performance using generated data, 2) a distillation process to transfer specific strengths from proprietary models to open-source counterparts, and 3) improvements in content moderation by identifying and generating challenging synthetic data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lifan Zhao, Yanyan Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series forecasting always faces the challenge of concept drift, where data distributions evolve over time, leading to a decline in forecast model performance. Existing solutions are based on online learning, which continually organize recent time series observations as new training samples and update model parameters according to the forecasting feedback on recent data. However, they overlook a critical issue: obtaining ground-truth future values of each sample should be delayed until after the forecast horizon. This delay creates a temporal gap between the training samples and the test sample. Our empirical analysis reveals that the gap can introduce concept drift, causing forecast models to adapt to outdated concepts. In this paper, we present \textsc{Proceed}, a novel proactive model adaptation framework for online time series forecasting. \textsc{Proceed} first estimates the concept drift between the recently used training samples and the current test sample. It then employs an adaptation generator to efficiently translate the estimated drift into parameter adjustments, proactively adapting the model to the test sample. To enhance the generalization capability of the framework, \textsc{Proceed} is trained on synthetic diverse concept drifts. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets across various forecast models demonstrate that \textsc{Proceed} brings more performance improvements than the state-of-the-art online learning methods, significantly facilitating forecast models' resilience against concept drifts.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Kang, Srikant Bharadwaj, James Hensman, Tushar Krishna, Victor Ruhle, Saravan Rajmohan</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language model (LLM) inference demands significant amount of computation and memory, especially in the key attention mechanism. While techniques, such as quantization and acceleration algorithms, like FlashAttention, have improved efficiency of the overall inference, they address different aspects of the problem: quantization focuses on weight-activation operations, while FlashAttention improves execution but requires high-precision formats. Recent Key-value (KV) cache quantization reduces memory bandwidth but still needs floating-point dequantization for attention operation.
  We present TurboAttention, a comprehensive approach to enable quantized execution of attention that simultaneously addresses both memory and computational efficiency. Our solution introduces two key innovations: FlashQ, a headwise attention quantization technique that enables both compression of KV cache and quantized execution of activation-activation multiplication, and Sparsity-based Softmax Approximation (SAS), which eliminates the need for dequantization to FP32 during exponentiation operation in attention. Experimental results demonstrate that TurboAttention achieves 1.2-1.8x speedup in attention, reduces the KV cache size by over 4.4x, and enables up to 2.37x maximum throughput over the FP16 baseline while outperforming state-of-the-art quantization and compression techniques across various datasets and models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhoulin Ji, Chenhao Lin, Hang Wang, Chao Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting synthetic from real speech is increasingly crucial due to the risks of misinformation and identity impersonation. While various datasets for synthetic speech analysis have been developed, they often focus on specific areas, limiting their utility for comprehensive research. To fill this gap, we propose the Speech-Forensics dataset by extensively covering authentic, synthetic, and partially forged speech samples that include multiple segments synthesized by different high-quality algorithms. Moreover, we propose a TEmporal Speech LocalizaTion network, called TEST, aiming at simultaneously performing authenticity detection, multiple fake segments localization, and synthesis algorithms recognition, without any complex post-processing. TEST effectively integrates LSTM and Transformer to extract more powerful temporal speech representations and utilizes dense prediction on multi-scale pyramid features to estimate the synthetic spans. Our model achieves an average mAP of 83.55% and an EER of 5.25% at the utterance level. At the segment level, it attains an EER of 1.07% and a 92.19% F1 score. These results highlight the model's robust capability for a comprehensive analysis of synthetic speech, offering a promising avenue for future research and practical applications in this field.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09645">Evaluation Agent: Efficient and Promptable Evaluation Framework for Visual Generative Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Fan Zhang, Shulin Tian, Ziqi Huang, Yu Qiao, Ziwei Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in visual generative models have enabled high-quality image and video generation, opening diverse applications. However, evaluating these models often demands sampling hundreds or thousands of images or videos, making the process computationally expensive, especially for diffusion-based models with inherently slow sampling. Moreover, existing evaluation methods rely on rigid pipelines that overlook specific user needs and provide numerical results without clear explanations. In contrast, humans can quickly form impressions of a model's capabilities by observing only a few samples. To mimic this, we propose the Evaluation Agent framework, which employs human-like strategies for efficient, dynamic, multi-round evaluations using only a few samples per round, while offering detailed, user-tailored analyses. It offers four key advantages: 1) efficiency, 2) promptable evaluation tailored to diverse user needs, 3) explainability beyond single numerical scores, and 4) scalability across various models and tools. Experiments show that Evaluation Agent reduces evaluation time to 10% of traditional methods while delivering comparable results. The Evaluation Agent framework is fully open-sourced to advance research in visual generative models and their efficient evaluation.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10257">Targeted Angular Reversal of Weights (TARS) for Knowledge Removal in Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Harry J. Davies, Giorgos Iacovides, Danilo P. Mandic</p>
<p>Abstract: The sheer scale of data required to train modern large language models (LLMs) poses significant risks, as models are likely to gain knowledge of sensitive topics such as bio-security, as well the ability to replicate copyrighted works. Methods designed to remove such knowledge must do so from all prompt directions, in a multi-lingual capacity and without degrading general model performance. To this end, we introduce the targeted angular reversal (TARS) method of knowledge removal from LLMs. The TARS method firstly leverages the LLM in combination with a detailed prompt to aggregate information about a selected concept in the internal representation space of the LLM. It then refines this approximate concept vector to trigger the concept token with high probability, by perturbing the approximate concept vector with noise and transforming it into token scores with the language model head. The feedforward weight vectors in the LLM which operate directly on the internal representation space, and have the highest cosine similarity with this targeting vector, are then replaced by a reversed targeting vector, thus limiting the ability of the concept to propagate through the model. The modularity of the TARS method allows for a sequential removal of concepts from Llama 3.1 8B, such as the famous literary detective Sherlock Holmes, and the planet Saturn. It is demonstrated that the probability of triggering target concepts can be reduced to 0.00 with as few as 1 TARS edit, whilst simultaneously removing the knowledge bi-directionally. Moreover, knowledge is shown to be removed across all languages despite only being targeted in English. Importantly, TARS has minimal impact on the general model capabilities, as after removing 5 diverse concepts in a modular fashion, there is minimal KL divergence in the next token probabilities of the LLM on large corpora of Wikipedia text (median of 0.0015).</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10316">BrushEdit: All-In-One Image Inpainting and Editing</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaowei Li, Yuxuan Bian, Xuan Ju, Zhaoyang Zhang, Ying Shan, Yuexian Zou, Qiang Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Image editing has advanced significantly with the development of diffusion models using both inversion-based and instruction-based methods. However, current inversion-based approaches struggle with big modifications (e.g., adding or removing objects) due to the structured nature of inversion noise, which hinders substantial changes. Meanwhile, instruction-based methods often constrain users to black-box operations, limiting direct interaction for specifying editing regions and intensity. To address these limitations, we propose BrushEdit, a novel inpainting-based instruction-guided image editing paradigm, which leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and image inpainting models to enable autonomous, user-friendly, and interactive free-form instruction editing. Specifically, we devise a system enabling free-form instruction editing by integrating MLLMs and a dual-branch image inpainting model in an agent-cooperative framework to perform editing category classification, main object identification, mask acquisition, and editing area inpainting. Extensive experiments show that our framework effectively combines MLLMs and inpainting models, achieving superior performance across seven metrics including mask region preservation and editing effect coherence.</p>
