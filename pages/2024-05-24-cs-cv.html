<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongsheng Wang, Yang Wang, Yalan Liu, Fayuan Hu, Shengyu Zhang, Fei Wu, Feng Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: In real-world road scenes, diverse material properties lead to complex light reflection phenomena, making accurate color reproduction crucial for enhancing the realism and safety of simulated driving environments. However, existing methods often struggle to capture the full spectrum of lighting effects, particularly in dynamic scenarios where viewpoint changes induce significant material color variations. To address this challenge, we introduce NieR (Normal-Based Lighting Scene Rendering), a novel framework that takes into account the nuances of light reflection on diverse material surfaces, leading to more precise rendering. To simulate the lighting synthesis process, we present the LD (Light Decomposition) module, which captures the lighting reflection characteristics on surfaces. Furthermore, to address dynamic lighting scenes, we propose the HNGD (Hierarchical Normal Gradient Densification) module to overcome the limitations of sparse Gaussian representation. Specifically, we dynamically adjust the Gaussian density based on normal gradients. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in terms of visual quality and exhibits significant advantages in performance indicators.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sara Sarto, Marcella Cornia, Lorenzo Baraldi, Alessandro Nicolosi, Rita Cucchiara</p>
<p>Abstract: The objective of image captioning models is to bridge the gap between the visual and linguistic modalities by generating natural language descriptions that accurately reflect the content of input images. In recent years, researchers have leveraged deep learning-based models and made advances in the extraction of visual features and the design of multimodal connections to tackle this task. This work presents a novel approach towards developing image captioning models that utilize an external kNN memory to improve the generation process. Specifically, we propose two model variants that incorporate a knowledge retriever component that is based on visual similarities, a differentiable encoder to represent input images, and a kNN-augmented language model to predict tokens based on contextual cues and text retrieved from the external memory. We experimentally validate our approach on COCO and nocaps datasets and demonstrate that incorporating an explicit external memory can significantly enhance the quality of captions, especially with a larger retrieval corpus. This work provides valuable insights into retrieval-augmented captioning models and opens up new avenues for improving image captioning at a larger scale.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13152">Enhancing Interaction Modeling with Agent Selection and Physical Methods for Trajectory Prediction</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiji Huang, Lei Ye, Min Chen, Wenhai Luo, Chenqi Xu, Deyuan Liang, Dihong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this study, we address the limitations inherent in most existing vehicle trajectory prediction methodologies that indiscriminately incorporate all agents within a predetermined proximity when accounting for inter-agent interactions. These approaches commonly employ attention-based architecture or graph neural networks for encoding interactions, which introduces three challenges: (i) The indiscriminate selection of all nearby agents substantially escalates the computational demands of the model, particularly in those interaction-rich scenarios. (ii) Moreover, the simplistic feature extraction of current time agents falls short of adequately capturing the nuanced dynamics of interactions. (iii) Compounded by the inherently low interpretability of attention mechanism and graph neural networks, there is a propensity for the model to allocate unreliable correlation coefficients to certain agents, adversely impacting the accuracy of trajectory predictions. To mitigate these issues, we introduce ASPILin, a novel approach that enhances the selection of interacting agents by considering their current and future lanes, extending this consideration across all historical frames. Utilizing the states of the agents, we estimate the nearest future distance between agents and the time needed to reach this distance. Then, combine these with their current distances to derive a physical correlation coefficient to encode interactions. Experiments conducted on popular trajectory prediction datasets demonstrate that our method is efficient and straightforward, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hugues Thomas, Yao-Hung Hubert Tsai, Timothy D. Barfoot, Jian Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In the field of deep point cloud understanding, KPConv is a unique architecture that uses kernel points to locate convolutional weights in space, instead of relying on Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) encodings. While it initially achieved success, it has since been surpassed by recent MLP networks that employ updated designs and training strategies. Building upon the kernel point principle, we present two novel designs: KPConvD (depthwise KPConv), a lighter design that enables the use of deeper architectures, and KPConvX, an innovative design that scales the depthwise convolutional weights of KPConvD with kernel attention values. Using KPConvX with a modern architecture and training strategy, we are able to outperform current state-of-the-art approaches on the ScanObjectNN, Scannetv2, and S3DIS datasets. We validate our design choices through ablation studies and release our code and models.</p>

<p>Abstract: We extend multimodal transformers to include 3D camera motion as a conditioning signal for the task of video generation. Generative video models are becoming increasingly powerful, thus focusing research efforts on methods of controlling the output of such models. We propose to add virtual 3D camera controls to generative video methods by conditioning generated video on an encoding of three-dimensional camera movement over the course of the generated video. Results demonstrate that we are (1) able to successfully control the camera during video generation, starting from a single frame and a camera signal, and (2) we demonstrate the accuracy of the generated 3D camera paths using traditional computer vision methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhanchao Huang, Wenjun Hong, Hua Su</p>
<p>Abstract: The recognition of sea ice is of great significance for reflecting climate change and ensuring the safety of ship navigation. Recently, many deep learning based methods have been proposed and applied to segment and recognize sea ice regions. However, the diverse scales of sea ice areas, the zigzag and fine edge contours, and the difficulty in distinguishing different types of sea ice pose challenges to existing sea ice recognition models. In this paper, a Global-Local Detail Guided Transformer (GDGT) method is proposed for sea ice recognition in optical remote sensing images. In GDGT, a global-local feature fusiont mechanism is designed to fuse global structural correlation features and local spatial detail features. Furthermore, a detail-guided decoder is developed to retain more high-resolution detail information during feature reconstruction for improving the performance of sea ice recognition. Experiments on the produced sea ice dataset demonstrated the effectiveness and advancement of GDGT.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nawfal Guefrachi, Hakim Ghazzai, Ahmad Alsharoa</p>
<p>Abstract: The 3D object detection capabilities in urban environments have been enormously improved by recent developments in Light Detection and Range (LiDAR) technology. This paper presents a novel framework that transforms the detection and analysis of 3D objects in traffic scenarios by utilizing the power of elevated LiDAR sensors. We are presenting our methodology's remarkable capacity to collect complex 3D point cloud data, which allows us to accurately and in detail capture the dynamics of urban traffic. Due to the limitation in obtaining real-world traffic datasets, we utilize the simulator to generate 3D point cloud for specific scenarios. To support our experimental analysis, we firstly simulate various 3D point cloud traffic-related objects. Then, we use this dataset as a basis for training and evaluating our 3D object detection models, in identifying and monitoring both vehicles and pedestrians in simulated urban traffic environments. Next, we fine tune the Point Voxel-Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (PV-RCNN) architecture, making it more suited to handle and understand the massive volumes of point cloud data generated by our urban traffic simulations. Our results show the effectiveness of the proposed solution in accurately detecting objects in traffic scenes and highlight the role of LiDAR in improving urban safety and advancing intelligent transportation systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rong Gao, Xin Liu, Bohao Xing, Zitong Yu, Bjorn W. Schuller, Heikki K\"alvi\"ainen</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we focus on a special group of human body language -- the micro-gesture (MG), which differs from the range of ordinary illustrative gestures in that they are not intentional behaviors performed to convey information to others, but rather unintentional behaviors driven by inner feelings. This characteristic introduces two novel challenges regarding micro-gestures that are worth rethinking. The first is whether strategies designed for other action recognition are entirely applicable to micro-gestures. The second is whether micro-gestures, as supplementary data, can provide additional insights for emotional understanding. In recognizing micro-gestures, we explored various augmentation strategies that take into account the subtle spatial and brief temporal characteristics of micro-gestures, often accompanied by repetitiveness, to determine more suitable augmentation methods. Considering the significance of temporal domain information for micro-gestures, we introduce a simple and efficient plug-and-play spatiotemporal balancing fusion method. We not only studied our method on the considered micro-gesture dataset but also conducted experiments on mainstream action datasets. The results show that our approach performs well in micro-gesture recognition and on other datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to previous micro-gesture recognition methods. For emotional understanding based on micro-gestures, we construct complex emotional reasoning scenarios. Our evaluation, conducted with large language models, shows that micro-gestures play a significant and positive role in enhancing comprehensive emotional understanding. The scenarios we developed can be extended to other micro-gesture-based tasks such as deception detection and interviews. We confirm that our new insights contribute to advancing research in micro-gesture and emotional artificial intelligence.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13218">Computational Tradeoffs in Image Synthesis: Diffusion, Masked-Token, and Next-Token Prediction</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Maciej Kilian, Varun Japan, Luke Zettlemoyer</p>
<p>Abstract: Nearly every recent image synthesis approach, including diffusion, masked-token prediction, and next-token prediction, uses a Transformer network architecture. Despite this common backbone, there has been no direct, compute controlled comparison of how these approaches affect performance and efficiency. We analyze the scalability of each approach through the lens of compute budget measured in FLOPs. We find that token prediction methods, led by next-token prediction, significantly outperform diffusion on prompt following. On image quality, while next-token prediction initially performs better, scaling trends suggest it is eventually matched by diffusion. We compare the inference compute efficiency of each approach and find that next token prediction is by far the most efficient. Based on our findings we recommend diffusion for applications targeting image quality and low latency; and next-token prediction when prompt following or throughput is more important.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Obadage Rochana Rumalshan, Pramuka Weerasinghe, Mohamed Shaheer, Prabhath Gunathilake, Erunika Dayaratna</p>
<p>Abstract: The extreme popularity over the years for railway transportation urges the necessity to maintain efficient railway management systems around the globe. Even though, at present, there exist a large collection of Computer Aided Designed Railway Technical Maps (RTMs) but available only in the portable document format (PDF). Using Deep Learning and Optical Character Recognition techniques, this research work proposes a generic system to digitize the relevant map component data from a given input image and create a formatted text file per image. Out of YOLOv3, SSD and Faster-RCNN object detection models used, Faster-RCNN yields the highest mean Average Precision (mAP) and the highest F1 score values 0.68 and 0.76 respectively. Further it is proven from the results obtained that, one can improve the results with OCR when the text containing image is being sent through a sophisticated pre-processing pipeline to remove distortions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mahdi Jamebozorg, Mohsen Hami, Sajjad Deh Deh Jani</p>
<p>Abstract: Optimal management of traffic light timing is one of the most effective factors in reducing urban traffic. In most old systems, fixed timing was used along with human factors to control traffic, which is not very efficient in terms of time and cost. Nowadays, methods in the field of traffic management are based on the use of artificial intelligence. In this method, by using real-time processing of video surveillance camera images along with reinforcement learning, the optimal timing of traffic lights is determined and applied according to several parameters. In the research, deep learning methods were used in vehicle detection using the YOLOv9-C model to estimate the number and other characteristics of vehicles such as speed. Finally, by modeling vehicles in an urban environment simulator at OpenAI Gym using multi-factor reinforcement learning and the DQN Rainbow algorithm, timing is applied to traffic lights at intersections. Additionally, the use of transfer learning along with retraining the model on images of Iranian cars has increased the accuracy of the model. The results of the proposed method show a model that is reasonably accurate in both parts of analyzing surveillance cameras and finding the optimal timing, and it has been observed that it has better accuracy than previous research.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13267">FLARE up your data: Diffusion-based Augmentation Method in Astronomical Imaging</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammed Talha Alam, Raza Imam, Mohsen Guizani, Fakhri Karray</p>
<p>Abstract: The intersection of Astronomy and AI encounters significant challenges related to issues such as noisy backgrounds, lower resolution (LR), and the intricate process of filtering and archiving images from advanced telescopes like the James Webb. Given the dispersion of raw images in feature space, we have proposed a \textit{two-stage augmentation framework} entitled as \textbf{FLARE} based on \underline{f}eature \underline{l}earning and \underline{a}ugmented \underline{r}esolution \underline{e}nhancement. We first apply lower (LR) to higher resolution (HR) conversion followed by standard augmentations. Secondly, we integrate a diffusion approach to synthetically generate samples using class-concatenated prompts. By merging these two stages using weighted percentiles, we realign the feature space distribution, enabling a classification model to establish a distinct decision boundary and achieve superior generalization on various in-domain and out-of-domain tasks. We conducted experiments on several downstream cosmos datasets and on our optimally distributed \textbf{SpaceNet} dataset across 8-class fine-grained and 4-class macro classification tasks. FLARE attains the highest performance gain of 20.78\% for fine-grained tasks compared to similar baselines, while across different classification models, FLARE shows a consistent increment of an average of +15\%. This outcome underscores the effectiveness of the FLARE method in enhancing the precision of image classification, ultimately bolstering the reliability of astronomical research outcomes. % Our code and SpaceNet dataset will be released to the public soon.

<p>Abstract: Virtual staining streamlines traditional staining procedures by digitally generating stained images from unstained or differently stained images. While conventional staining methods involve time-consuming chemical processes, virtual staining offers an efficient and low infrastructure alternative. Leveraging microscopy-based techniques, such as confocal microscopy, researchers can expedite tissue analysis without the need for physical sectioning. However, interpreting grayscale or pseudo-color microscopic images remains a challenge for pathologists and surgeons accustomed to traditional histologically stained images. To fill this gap, various studies explore digitally simulating staining to mimic targeted histological stains. This paper introduces a novel network, In-and-Out Net, specifically designed for virtual staining tasks. Based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), our model efficiently transforms Reflectance Confocal Microscopy (RCM) images into Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained images. We enhance nuclei contrast in RCM images using aluminum chloride preprocessing for skin tissues. Training the model with virtual H\&E labels featuring two fluorescence channels eliminates the need for image registration and provides pixel-level ground truth. Our contributions include proposing an optimal training strategy, conducting a comparative analysis demonstrating state-of-the-art performance, validating the model through an ablation study, and collecting perfectly matched input and ground truth images without registration. In-and-Out Net showcases promising results, offering a valuable tool for virtual staining tasks and advancing the field of histological image analysis.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel method designed to enhance label efficiency in satellite imagery analysis by integrating semi-supervised learning (SSL) with active learning strategies. Our approach utilizes contrastive learning together with uncertainty estimations via Monte Carlo Dropout (MC Dropout), with a particular focus on Sentinel-2 imagery analyzed using the Eurosat dataset. We explore the effectiveness of our method in scenarios featuring both balanced and unbalanced class distributions. Our results show that for unbalanced classes, our method is superior to the random approach, enabling significant savings in labeling effort while maintaining high classification accuracy. These findings highlight the potential of our approach to facilitate scalable and cost-effective satellite image analysis, particularly advantageous for extensive environmental monitoring and land use classification tasks. Note on preliminary results: This paper presents a new method for active learning and includes results from an initial experiment comparing random selection with our proposed method. We acknowledge that these results are preliminary. We are currently conducting further experiments and will update this paper with additional findings, including comparisons with other methods, in the coming weeks.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13335">Vision Transformer with Sparse Scan Prior</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Qihang Fan, Huaibo Huang, Mingrui Chen, Ran He</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, Transformers have achieved remarkable progress in computer vision tasks. However, their global modeling often comes with substantial computational overhead, in stark contrast to the human eye's efficient information processing. Inspired by the human eye's sparse scanning mechanism, we propose a \textbf{S}parse \textbf{S}can \textbf{S}elf-\textbf{A}ttention mechanism ($\rm{S}^3\rm{A}$). This mechanism predefines a series of Anchors of Interest for each token and employs local attention to efficiently model the spatial information around these anchors, avoiding redundant global modeling and excessive focus on local information. This approach mirrors the human eye's functionality and significantly reduces the computational load of vision models. Building on $\rm{S}^3\rm{A}$, we introduce the \textbf{S}parse \textbf{S}can \textbf{Vi}sion \textbf{T}ransformer (SSViT). Extensive experiments demonstrate the outstanding performance of SSViT across a variety of tasks. Specifically, on ImageNet classification, without additional supervision or training data, SSViT achieves top-1 accuracies of \textbf{84.4\%/85.7\%} with \textbf{4.4G/18.2G} FLOPs. SSViT also excels in downstream tasks such as object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation. Its robustness is further validated across diverse datasets.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13337">Semantic Equitable Clustering: A Simple, Fast and Effective Strategy for Vision Transformer</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Qihang Fan, Huaibo Huang, Mingrui Chen, Ran He</p>
<p>Abstract: The Vision Transformer (ViT) has gained prominence for its superior relational modeling prowess. However, its global attention mechanism's quadratic complexity poses substantial computational burdens. A common remedy spatially groups tokens for self-attention, reducing computational requirements. Nonetheless, this strategy neglects semantic information in tokens, possibly scattering semantically-linked tokens across distinct groups, thus compromising the efficacy of self-attention intended for modeling inter-token dependencies. Motivated by these insights, we introduce a fast and balanced clustering method, named \textbf{S}emantic \textbf{E}quitable \textbf{C}lustering (SEC). SEC clusters tokens based on their global semantic relevance in an efficient, straightforward manner. In contrast to traditional clustering methods requiring multiple iterations, our method achieves token clustering in a single pass. Additionally, SEC regulates the number of tokens per cluster, ensuring a balanced distribution for effective parallel processing on current computational platforms without necessitating further optimization. Capitalizing on SEC, we propose a versatile vision backbone, SecViT. Comprehensive experiments in image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation validate to the effectiveness of SecViT. Remarkably, SecViT attains an impressive \textbf{84.2\%} image classification accuracy with only \textbf{27M} parameters and \textbf{4.4G} FLOPs, without the need for for additional supervision or data.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenting Wang, Vikash Sehwag, Chen Chen, Lingjuan Lyu, Dimitris N. Metaxas, Shiqing Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Latent generative models (e.g., Stable Diffusion) have become more and more popular, but concerns have arisen regarding potential misuse related to images generated by these models. It is, therefore, necessary to analyze the origin of images by inferring if a particular image was generated by a specific latent generative model. Most existing methods (e.g., image watermark and model fingerprinting) require extra steps during training or generation. These requirements restrict their usage on the generated images without such extra operations, and the extra required operations might compromise the quality of the generated images. In this work, we ask whether it is possible to effectively and efficiently trace the images generated by a specific latent generative model without the aforementioned requirements. To study this problem, we design a latent inversion based method called LatentTracer to trace the generated images of the inspected model by checking if the examined images can be well-reconstructed with an inverted latent input. We leverage gradient based latent inversion and identify a encoder-based initialization critical to the success of our approach. Our experiments on the state-of-the-art latent generative models, such as Stable Diffusion, show that our method can distinguish the images generated by the inspected model and other images with a high accuracy and efficiency. Our findings suggest the intriguing possibility that today's latent generative generated images are naturally watermarked by the decoder used in the source models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liyu Chen, Huaao Tang, Yi Wen, Hanting Chen, Wei Li, Junchao Liu, Jie Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent semi-supervised object detection (SSOD) has achieved remarkable progress by leveraging unlabeled data for training. Mainstream SSOD methods rely on Consistency Regularization methods and Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which form a cyclic data flow. However, the EMA updating training approach leads to weight coupling between the teacher and student models. This coupling in a cyclic data flow results in a decrease in the utilization of unlabeled data information and the confirmation bias on low-quality or erroneous pseudo-labels. To address these issues, we propose the Collaboration of Teachers Framework (CTF), which consists of multiple pairs of teacher and student models for training. In the learning process of CTF, the Data Performance Consistency Optimization module (DPCO) informs the best pair of teacher models possessing the optimal pseudo-labels during the past training process, and these most reliable pseudo-labels generated by the best performing teacher would guide the other student models. As a consequence, this framework greatly improves the utilization of unlabeled data and prevents the positive feedback cycle of unreliable pseudo-labels. The CTF achieves outstanding results on numerous SSOD datasets, including a 0.71% mAP improvement on the 10% annotated COCO dataset and a 0.89% mAP improvement on the VOC dataset compared to LabelMatch and converges significantly faster. Moreover, the CTF is plug-and-play and can be integrated with other mainstream SSOD methods.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13376">Markerless retro-identification complements re-identification of individual insect subjects in archived image data of biological experiments</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Asaduz Zaman, Vanessa Kellermann, Alan Dorin</p>
<p>Abstract: This study introduces markerless retro-identification of animals, a novel concept and practical technique to identify past occurrences of organisms in archived data, that complements traditional forward-looking chronological re-identification methods in longitudinal behavioural research. Identification of a key individual among multiple subjects may occur late in an experiment if it reveals itself through interesting behaviour after a period of undifferentiated performance. Often, longitudinal studies also encounter subject attrition during experiments. Effort invested in training software models to recognise and track such individuals is wasted if they fail to complete the experiment. Ideally, we would be able to select individuals who both complete an experiment and/or differentiate themselves via interesting behaviour, prior to investing computational resources in training image classification software to recognise them. We propose retro-identification for model training to achieve this aim. This reduces manual annotation effort and computational resources by identifying subjects only after they differentiate themselves late, or at an experiment's conclusion. Our study dataset comprises observations made of morphologically similar reed bees (\textit{Exoneura robusta}) over five days. We evaluated model performance by training on final day five data, testing on the sequence of preceding days, and comparing results to the usual chronological evaluation from day one. Results indicate no significant accuracy difference between models. This underscores retro-identification's value in improving resource efficiency in longitudinal animal studies.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13382">VTG-LLM: Integrating Timestamp Knowledge into Video LLMs for Enhanced Video Temporal Grounding</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongxin Guo, Jingyu Liu, Mingda Li, Xiaoying Tang, Xi Chen, Bo Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) focuses on accurately identifying event timestamps within a particular video based on a linguistic query, playing a vital role in downstream tasks such as video browsing and editing. While Video Large Language Models (video LLMs) have made significant progress in understanding video content, they often face challenges in accurately pinpointing timestamps within videos, which limits their performance on VTG tasks. Therefore, to improve video LLMs' ability to effectively locate timestamps, we argue that two critical aspects need to be enhanced. First, it is essential to have high-quality instructional tuning datasets that encompass mainstream VTG tasks. Second, directly incorporating timestamp knowledge into video LLMs is crucial, as it enables models to efficiently comprehend timestamp information. To address these needs, we first introduce VTG-IT-120K, a high-quality and comprehensive instruction tuning dataset that covers VTG tasks such as moment retrieval, dense video captioning, video summarization, and video highlight detection. Furthermore, we propose a specially designed video LLM model for VTG tasks, VTG-LLM, which (1) effectively integrates timestamp knowledge into visual tokens; (2) incorporates absolute-time tokens that specifically handle timestamp knowledge, thereby avoiding concept shifts; and (3) introduces a lightweight, high-performance slot-based token compression method to facilitate the sampling of more video frames. Comprehensive experiments showcase the superior performance of VTG-LLM in comparison to other video LLM methods across various VTG tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dingwen Zhang, Hao Li, Diqi He, Nian Liu, Lechao Cheng, Jingdong Wang, Junwei Han</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent times, following the paradigm of DETR (DEtection TRansformer), query-based end-to-end instance segmentation (QEIS) methods have exhibited superior performance compared to CNN-based models, particularly when trained on large-scale datasets. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of these QEIS methods diminishes significantly when confronted with limited training data. This limitation arises from their reliance on substantial data volumes to effectively train the pivotal queries/kernels that are essential for acquiring localization and shape priors. To address this problem, we propose a novel method for unsupervised pre-training in low-data regimes. Inspired by the recently successful prompting technique, we introduce a new method, Unsupervised Pre-training with Language-Vision Prompts (UPLVP), which improves QEIS models' instance segmentation by bringing language-vision prompts to queries/kernels. Our method consists of three parts: (1) Masks Proposal: Utilizes language-vision models to generate pseudo masks based on unlabeled images. (2) Prompt-Kernel Matching: Converts pseudo masks into prompts and injects the best-matched localization and shape features to their corresponding kernels. (3) Kernel Supervision: Formulates supervision for pre-training at the kernel level to ensure robust learning. With the help of our pre-training method, QEIS models can converge faster and perform better than CNN-based models in low-data regimes. Experimental evaluations conducted on MS COCO, Cityscapes, and CTW1500 datasets indicate that the QEIS models' performance can be significantly improved when pre-trained with our method.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunfan Lu, Zipeng Wang, Yusheng Wang, Hui Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: Continuous space-time video super-resolution (C-STVSR) aims to simultaneously enhance video resolution and frame rate at an arbitrary scale. Recently, implicit neural representation (INR) has been applied to video restoration, representing videos as implicit fields that can be decoded at an arbitrary scale. However, the highly ill-posed nature of C-STVSR limits the effectiveness of current INR-based methods: they assume linear motion between frames and use interpolation or feature warping to generate features at arbitrary spatiotemporal positions with two consecutive frames. This restrains C-STVSR from capturing rapid and nonlinear motion and long-term dependencies (involving more than two frames) in complex dynamic scenes. In this paper, we propose a novel C-STVSR framework, called HR-INR, which captures both holistic dependencies and regional motions based on INR. It is assisted by an event camera, a novel sensor renowned for its high temporal resolution and low latency. To fully utilize the rich temporal information from events, we design a feature extraction consisting of (1) a regional event feature extractor - taking events as inputs via the proposed event temporal pyramid representation to capture the regional nonlinear motion and (2) a holistic event-frame feature extractor for long-term dependence and continuity motion. We then propose a novel INR-based decoder with spatiotemporal embeddings to capture long-term dependencies with a larger temporal perception field. We validate the effectiveness and generalization of our method on four datasets (both simulated and real data), showing the superiority of our method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Harish Prakash, Jia Cheng Shang, Ken M. Nsiempba, Yuhao Chen, David A. Clausi, John S. Zelek</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi Object Tracking (MOT) in ice hockey pursues the combined task of localizing and associating players across a given sequence to maintain their identities. Tracking players from monocular broadcast feeds is an important computer vision problem offering various downstream analytics and enhanced viewership experience. However, existing trackers encounter significant difficulties in dealing with occlusions, blurs, and agile player movements prevalent in telecast feeds. In this work, we propose a novel tracking approach by formulating MOT as a bipartite graph matching problem infused with homography. We disentangle the positional representations of occluded and overlapping players in broadcast view, by mapping their foot keypoints to an overhead rink template, and encode these projected positions into the graph network. This ensures reliable spatial context for consistent player tracking and unfragmented tracklet prediction. Our results show considerable improvements in both the IDsw and IDF1 metrics on the two available broadcast ice hockey datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Moises Diaz, Miguel Angel Ferrer, Donato Impedovo, Giuseppe Pirlo, Gennaro Vessio</p>
<p>Abstract: Computer aided diagnosis systems can provide non-invasive, low-cost tools to support clinicians. These systems have the potential to assist the diagnosis and monitoring of neurodegenerative disorders, in particular Parkinson's disease (PD). Handwriting plays a special role in the context of PD assessment. In this paper, the discriminating power of "dynamically enhanced" static images of handwriting is investigated. The enhanced images are synthetically generated by exploiting simultaneously the static and dynamic properties of handwriting. Specifically, we propose a static representation that embeds dynamic information based on: (i) drawing the points of the samples, instead of linking them, so as to retain temporal/velocity information; and (ii) adding pen-ups for the same purpose. To evaluate the effectiveness of the new handwriting representation, a fair comparison between this approach and state-of-the-art methods based on static and dynamic handwriting is conducted on the same dataset, i.e. PaHaW. The classification workflow employs transfer learning to extract meaningful features from multiple representations of the input data. An ensemble of different classifiers is used to achieve the final predictions. Dynamically enhanced static handwriting is able to outperform the results obtained by using static and dynamic handwriting separately.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13451">A Label Propagation Strategy for CutMix in Multi-Label Remote Sensing Image Classification</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Tom Burgert, Tim Siebert, Kai Norman Clasen, Beg\"um Demir</p>
<p>Abstract: The development of supervised deep learning-based methods for multi-label scene classification (MLC) is one of the prominent research directions in remote sensing (RS). Yet, collecting annotations for large RS image archives is time-consuming and costly. To address this issue, several data augmentation methods have been introduced in RS. Among others, the data augmentation technique CutMix, which combines parts of two existing training images to generate an augmented image, stands out as a particularly effective approach. However, the direct application of CutMix in RS MLC can lead to the erasure or addition of class labels (i.e., label noise) in the augmented (i.e., combined) training image. To address this problem, we introduce a label propagation (LP) strategy that allows the effective application of CutMix in the context of MLC problems in RS without being affected by label noise. To this end, our proposed LP strategy exploits pixel-level class positional information to update the multi-label of the augmented training image. We propose to access such class positional information from reference maps associated to each training image (e.g., thematic products) or from class explanation masks provided by an explanation method if no reference maps are available. Similarly to pairing two training images, our LP strategy carries out a pairing operation on the associated pixel-level class positional information to derive the updated multi-label for the augmented image. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our LP strategy in general and its robustness in the case of various simulated and real scenarios with noisy class positional information in particular.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13459">Adapting Multi-modal Large Language Model to Concept Drift in the Long-tailed Open World</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyu Yang, Jie Lu, En Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-world data often exhibit extreme imbalances and out-of-distribution (OOD) instances, which significantly biases the model training. While it has been extensively studied in vision and language domains separately, the impact of long-tailed open worlds on multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) has been largely overlooked. In this paper, we first demonstrate the susceptibility and vulnerability of vision-language models to significant biases caused by tail drift and out-of-distribution (OOD) drift during both the pre-training and fine-tuning stages. To eliminate the bias from different sources, we integrate the tailed drift adaptation and OOD drift detection into a unified framework by extending the concept drift theory to multi-modal. Specifically, a T-distribution-based drift adapter is proposed to effectively mitigate the bias induced by the long-tailed problem, which also facilitates the model in distinguishing OOD data through explicit distribution modelling. Extensive experiments show significant improvements in our model's ability to adapt to tailed drift and OOD drift. Moreover, it enhances the efficiency and accuracy of image-text alignment in vision language model pre-training, particularly in the long-tail open world scenario. Furthermore, we create a set of multi-modal datasets called OpenMMlo, specifically tailored for the long-tailed open world scenario, to validate our findings. To foster the development of the multi-modal community, we have made both OpenMMlo datasets and our code publicly available at: https://github.com/Anonymous0Knight/ConceptDriftMLLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Di Qiu, Xinyang Lin, Kaiye Wang, Xiangxiang Chu, Pengfei Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: With the growing attention on data privacy and communication security in face recognition applications, federated learning has been introduced to learn a face recognition model with decentralized datasets in a privacy-preserving manner. However, existing works still face challenges such as unsatisfying performance and additional communication costs, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective federated face recognition framework called AdaFedFR, by devising an adaptive inter-class representation learning algorithm to enhance the generalization of the generic face model and the efficiency of federated training under strict privacy-preservation. In particular, our work delicately utilizes feature representations of public identities as learnable negative knowledge to optimize the local objective within the feature space, which further encourages the local model to learn powerful representations and optimize personalized models for clients. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms previous approaches on several prevalent face recognition benchmarks within less than 3 communication rounds, which shows communication-friendly and great efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Self-rewarding have emerged recently as a powerful tool in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), allowing language models to generate high-quality relevant responses by providing their own rewards during training. This innovative technique addresses the limitations of other methods that rely on human preferences. In this paper, we build upon the concept of self-rewarding models and introduce its vision equivalent for Text-to-Image generative AI models. This approach works by fine-tuning diffusion model on a self-generated self-judged dataset, making the fine-tuning more automated and with better data quality. The proposed mechanism makes use of other pre-trained models such as vocabulary based-object detection, image captioning and is conditioned by the a set of object for which the user might need to improve generated data quality. The approach has been implemented, fine-tuned and evaluated on stable diffusion and has led to a performance that has been evaluated to be at least 60\% better than existing commercial and research Text-to-image models. Additionally, the built self-rewarding mechanism allowed a fully automated generation of images, while increasing the visual quality of the generated images and also more efficient following of prompt instructions.

Furthermore, we develop a taxonomy for the reviewed studies, identify the challenges, and provide insights to overcome them. We also critically discuss the current state of continual learning in medical imaging, including identifying open problems and outlining promising future directions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Ibraheem Siddiqui, Muhammad Umer Sheikh, Hassan Abid, Muhammad Haris Khan</p>
<p>Abstract: Leveraging large-scale pre-training, vision foundational models showcase notable performance benefits. While recent years have witnessed significant advancements in segmentation algorithms, existing models still face challenges to automatically segment personalized instances in dense and crowded scenarios. The primary factor behind this limitation stems from bounding box-based detections, which are constrained by occlusions, background clutter, and object orientation, particularly when dealing with dense images. To this end, we propose PerSense, an end-to-end, training-free, and model-agnostic one-shot framework to address the personalized instance segmentation in dense images. Towards developing this framework, we make following core contributions. (a) We propose an Instance Detection Module (IDM) and leverage a Vision-Language Model, a grounding object detector, and a few-shot object counter (FSOC) to realize a new baseline. (b) To tackle false positives within candidate point prompts, we design Point Prompt Selection Module (PPSM). Both IDM and PPSM transform density maps from FSOC into personalized instance-level point prompts for segmentation and offer a seamless integration in our model-agnostic framework. (c) We introduce a feedback mechanism which enables PerSense to harness the full potential of FSOC by automating the exemplar selection process. (d) To promote algorithmic advances and effective tools for this relatively underexplored task, we introduce PerSense-D, a dataset exclusive to personalized instance segmentation in dense images. We validate the effectiveness of PerSense on the task of personalized instance segmentation in dense images on PerSense-D and comparison with SOTA. Additionally, our qualitative findings demonstrate the adaptability of our framework to images captured in-the-wild.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite the notable advancements achieved by leveraging pre-trained vision-language (VL) models through few-shot tuning for downstream tasks, our detailed empirical study highlights a significant dependence of few-shot learning outcomes on the careful selection of training examples - a facet that has been previously overlooked in research. In this study, we delve into devising more effective strategies for the meticulous selection of few-shot training examples, as opposed to relying on random sampling, to enhance the potential of existing few-shot prompt learning methodologies. To achieve this, we assess the effectiveness of various Active Learning (AL) techniques for instance selection, such as Entropy and Margin of Confidence, within the context of few-shot training. Furthermore, we introduce two innovative selection methods - Representativeness (REPRE) and Gaussian Monte Carlo (Montecarlo) - designed to proactively pinpoint informative examples for labeling in relation to pre-trained VL models. Our findings demonstrate that both REPRE and Montecarlo significantly surpass both random selection and AL-based strategies in few-shot training scenarios. The research also underscores that these instance selection methods are model-agnostic, offering a versatile enhancement to a wide array of few-shot training methodologies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hai Ni, Rui Wang, Scarlett Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Railway detection is critical for the automation of railway systems. Existing models often prioritize either speed or accuracy, but achieving both remains a challenge. To address the limitations of presetting anchor groups that struggle with varying track proportions from different camera angles, an ultra-fast adaptive track detection network is proposed in this paper. This network comprises a backbone network and two specialized branches (Horizontal Coordinate Locator and Perspective Identifier). The Perspective Identifier selects the suitable anchor group from preset anchor groups, thereby determining the row coordinates of the railway track. Subsequently, the Horizontal Coordinate Locator provides row classification results based on multiple preset anchor groups. Then, utilizing the results from the Perspective Identifier, it generates the column coordinates of the railway track. This network is evaluated on multiple datasets, with the lightweight version achieving an F1 score of 98.68% on the SRail dataset and a detection rate of up to 473 FPS. Compared to the SOTA, the proposed model is competitive in both speed and accuracy. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/idnihai/UFATD</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13540">Directly Denoising Diffusion Model</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Dan Zhang, Jingjing Wang, Feng Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present the Directly Denoising Diffusion Model (DDDM): a simple and generic approach for generating realistic images with few-step sampling, while multistep sampling is still preserved for better performance. DDDMs require no delicately designed samplers nor distillation on pre-trained distillation models. DDDMs train the diffusion model conditioned on an estimated target that was generated from previous training iterations of its own. To generate images, samples generated from the previous time step are also taken into consideration, guiding the generation process iteratively. We further propose Pseudo-LPIPS, a novel metric loss that is more robust to various values of hyperparameter. Despite its simplicity, the proposed approach can achieve strong performance in benchmark datasets. Our model achieves FID scores of 2.57 and 2.33 on CIFAR-10 in one-step and two-step sampling respectively, surpassing those obtained from GANs and distillation-based models. By extending the sampling to 1000 steps, we further reduce FID score to 1.79, aligning with state-of-the-art methods in the literature.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Moises Diaz, Miguel A. Ferrer, Donato Impedovo, Muhammad Imran Malik, Giuseppe Pirlo, Rejean Plamondon</p>
<p>Abstract: Handwritten signatures are biometric traits at the center of debate in the scientific community. Over the last 40 years, the interest in signature studies has grown steadily, having as its main reference the application of automatic signature verification, as previously published reviews in 1989, 2000, and 2008 bear witness. Ever since, and over the last 10 years, the application of handwritten signature technology has strongly evolved, and much research has focused on the possibility of applying systems based on handwritten signature analysis and processing to a multitude of new fields. After several years of haphazard growth of this research area, it is time to assess its current developments for their applicability in order to draw a structured way forward. This perspective reports a systematic review of the last 10 years of the literature on handwritten signatures with respect to the new scenario, focusing on the most promising domains of research and trying to elicit possible future research directions in this subject.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiping Yu, Chenyang Liu, Liqin Liu, Zhenwei Shi, Zhengxia Zou</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent advancement of generative foundational models has ushered in a new era of image generation in the realm of natural images, revolutionizing art design, entertainment, environment simulation, and beyond. Despite producing high-quality samples, existing methods are constrained to generating images of scenes at a limited scale. In this paper, we present MetaEarth, a generative foundation model that breaks the barrier by scaling image generation to a global level, exploring the creation of worldwide, multi-resolution, unbounded, and virtually limitless remote sensing images. In MetaEarth, we propose a resolution-guided self-cascading generative framework, which enables the generating of images at any region with a wide range of geographical resolutions. To achieve unbounded and arbitrary-sized image generation, we design a novel noise sampling strategy for denoising diffusion models by analyzing the generation conditions and initial noise. To train MetaEarth, we construct a large dataset comprising multi-resolution optical remote sensing images with geographical information. Experiments have demonstrated the powerful capabilities of our method in generating global-scale images. Additionally, the MetaEarth serves as a data engine that can provide high-quality and rich training data for downstream tasks. Our model opens up new possibilities for constructing generative world models by simulating Earth visuals from an innovative overhead perspective.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenbo Sui, Daniel Lichau, Josselin Lef\`evre, Harold Phelippeau</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies of multi-modal Industrial Anomaly Detection (IAD) based on point clouds and RGB images indicated the importance of exploiting redundancy and complementarity among modalities for accurate classification and segmentation. However, achieving multi-modal IAD in practical production lines remains a work in progress that requires consideration of the trade-offs between costs and benefits associated with introducing new modalities, while ensuring compatibility with current processes. Combining fast in-line inspections with high-resolution, time-consuming, near-line characterization techniques to enhance detection accuracy fits well into the existing quality control process, but only part of the samples can be tested with expensive near-line methods. Thus, the model must have the ability to leverage multi-modal training and handle incomplete modalities during inference. One solution is generating cross-modal hallucination to transfer knowledge among modalities for missing modality issues. In this paper, we propose CMDIAD, a Cross-Modal Distillation framework for IAD to demonstrate the feasibility of Multi-modal Training, Few-modal Inference pipeline. Moreover, we investigate reasons behind the asymmetric performance improvement using point clouds or RGB images as main modality of inference. This lays the foundation of our future multi-modal dataset construction for efficient IAD from manufacturing scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Omar Moured, Jiaming Zhang, M. Saquib Sarfraz, Rainer Stiefelhagen</p>
<p>Abstract: Chart summarization is a crucial task for blind and visually impaired individuals as it is their primary means of accessing and interpreting graphical data. Crafting high-quality descriptions is challenging because it requires precise communication of essential details within the chart without vision perception. Many chart analysis methods, however, produce brief, unstructured responses that may contain significant hallucinations, affecting their reliability for blind people. To address these challenges, this work presents three key contributions: (1) We introduce the AltChart dataset, comprising 10,000 real chart images, each paired with a comprehensive summary that features long-context, and semantically rich annotations. (2) We propose a new method for pretraining Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to learn fine-grained chart representations through training with multiple pretext tasks, yielding a performance gain with ${\sim}2.5\%$. (3) We conduct extensive evaluations of four leading chart summarization models, analyzing how accessible their descriptions are. Our dataset and codes are publicly available on our project page: https://github.com/moured/AltChart.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhendong Liu, Yuanbi Nie, Yingshui Tan, Xiangyu Yue, Qiushi Cui, Chongjun Wang, Xiaoyong Zhu, Bo Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Benefiting from the powerful capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), pre-trained visual encoder models connected to an LLMs can realize Vision Language Models (VLMs). However, existing research shows that the visual modality of VLMs is vulnerable, with attackers easily bypassing LLMs' safety alignment through visual modality features to launch attacks. To address this issue, we enhance the existing VLMs' visual modality safety alignment by adding safety modules, including a safety projector, safety tokens, and a safety head, through a two-stage training process, effectively improving the model's defense against risky images. For example, building upon the LLaVA-v1.5 model, we achieve a safety score of 8.26, surpassing the GPT-4V on the Red Teaming Visual Language Models (RTVLM) benchmark. Our method boasts ease of use, high flexibility, and strong controllability, and it enhances safety while having minimal impact on the model's general performance. Moreover, our alignment strategy also uncovers some possible risky content within commonly used open-source multimodal datasets. Our code will be open sourced after the anonymous review.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Florinel-Alin Croitoru, Vlad Hondru, Radu Tudor Ionescu, Nicu Sebe, Mubarak Shah</p>
<p>Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has been proposed as an effective and efficient alternative to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). In this paper, we propose a novel and enhanced version of DPO based on curriculum learning for text-to-image generation. Our method is divided into two training stages. First, a ranking of the examples generated for each prompt is obtained by employing a reward model. Then, increasingly difficult pairs of examples are sampled and provided to a text-to-image generative (diffusion or consistency) model. Generated samples that are far apart in the ranking are considered to form easy pairs, while those that are close in the ranking form hard pairs. In other words, we use the rank difference between samples as a measure of difficulty. The sampled pairs are split into batches according to their difficulty levels, which are gradually used to train the generative model. Our approach, Curriculum DPO, is compared against state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches on three benchmarks, outperforming the competing methods in terms of text alignment, aesthetics and human preference.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13659">EgoChoir: Capturing 3D Human-Object Interaction Regions from Egocentric Views</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhang Yang, Wei Zhai, Chengfeng Wang, Chengjun Yu, Yang Cao, Zheng-Jun Zha</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding egocentric human-object interaction (HOI) is a fundamental aspect of human-centric perception, facilitating applications like AR/VR and embodied AI. For the egocentric HOI, in addition to perceiving semantics e.g., ''what'' interaction is occurring, capturing ''where'' the interaction specifically manifests in 3D space is also crucial, which links the perception and operation. Existing methods primarily leverage observations of HOI to capture interaction regions from an exocentric view. However, incomplete observations of interacting parties in the egocentric view introduce ambiguity between visual observations and interaction contents, impairing their efficacy. From the egocentric view, humans integrate the visual cortex, cerebellum, and brain to internalize their intentions and interaction concepts of objects, allowing for the pre-formulation of interactions and making behaviors even when interaction regions are out of sight. In light of this, we propose harmonizing the visual appearance, head motion, and 3D object to excavate the object interaction concept and subject intention, jointly inferring 3D human contact and object affordance from egocentric videos. To achieve this, we present EgoChoir, which links object structures with interaction contexts inherent in appearance and head motion to reveal object affordance, further utilizing it to model human contact. Additionally, a gradient modulation is employed to adopt appropriate clues for capturing interaction regions across various egocentric scenarios. Moreover, 3D contact and affordance are annotated for egocentric videos collected from Ego-Exo4D and GIMO to support the task. Extensive experiments on them demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of EgoChoir. Code and data will be open.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13672">Advancing Spiking Neural Networks towards Multiscale Spatiotemporal Interaction Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yimeng Shan, Malu Zhang, Rui-jie Zhu, Xuerui Qiu, Jason K. Eshraghian, Haicheng Qu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in neuroscience research have propelled the development of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), which not only have the potential to further advance neuroscience research but also serve as an energy-efficient alternative to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) due to their spike-driven characteristics. However, previous studies often neglected the multiscale information and its spatiotemporal correlation between event data, leading SNN models to approximate each frame of input events as static images. We hypothesize that this oversimplification significantly contributes to the performance gap between SNNs and traditional ANNs. To address this issue, we have designed a Spiking Multiscale Attention (SMA) module that captures multiscale spatiotemporal interaction information. Furthermore, we developed a regularization method named Attention ZoneOut (AZO), which utilizes spatiotemporal attention weights to reduce the model's generalization error through pseudo-ensemble training. Our approach has achieved state-of-the-art results on mainstream neural morphology datasets. Additionally, we have reached a performance of 77.1% on the Imagenet-1K dataset using a 104-layer ResNet architecture enhanced with SMA and AZO. This achievement confirms the state-of-the-art performance of SNNs with non-transformer architectures and underscores the effectiveness of our method in bridging the performance gap between SNN models and traditional ANN models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhu Yu, Runming Zhang, Jiacheng Ying, Junchen Yu, Xiaohai Hu, Lun Luo, Siyuan Cao, Huiliang Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-based Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) has gained much attention due to its widespread applications in various 3D perception tasks. Existing sparse-to-dense approaches typically employ shared context-independent queries across various input images, which fails to capture distinctions among them as the focal regions of different inputs vary and may result in undirected feature aggregation of cross-attention. Additionally, the absence of depth information may lead to points projected onto the image plane sharing the same 2D position or similar sampling points in the feature map, resulting in depth ambiguity. In this paper, we present a novel context and geometry aware voxel transformer. It utilizes a context aware query generator to initialize context-dependent queries tailored to individual input images, effectively capturing their unique characteristics and aggregating information within the region of interest. Furthermore, it extend deformable cross-attention from 2D to 3D pixel space, enabling the differentiation of points with similar image coordinates based on their depth coordinates. Building upon this module, we introduce a neural network named CGFormer to achieve semantic scene completion. Simultaneously, CGFormer leverages multiple 3D representations (i.e., voxel and TPV) to boost the semantic and geometric representation abilities of the transformed 3D volume from both local and global perspectives. Experimental results demonstrate that CGFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks, attaining a mIoU of 16.87 and 20.05, as well as an IoU of 45.99 and 48.07, respectively. Remarkably, CGFormer even outperforms approaches employing temporal images as inputs or much larger image backbone networks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Divya Kothandaraman, Ming Lin, Dinesh Manocha</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a novel approach for prompt mixing, aiming to generate images at the intersection of multiple text prompts using pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models. At each time step during diffusion denoising, our algorithm forecasts predictions w.r.t. the generated image and makes informed text conditioning decisions. To do so, we leverage the connection between diffusion models (rooted in non-equilibrium thermodynamics) and the Black-Scholes model for pricing options in Finance, and draw analogies between the variables in both contexts to derive an appropriate algorithm for prompt mixing using the Black Scholes model. Specifically, the parallels between diffusion models and the Black-Scholes model enable us to leverage properties related to the dynamics of the Markovian model derived in the Black-Scholes algorithm. Our prompt-mixing algorithm is data-efficient, meaning it does not need additional training. Furthermore, it operates without human intervention or hyperparameter tuning. We highlight the benefits of our approach by comparing it qualitatively and quantitatively to other prompt mixing techniques, including linear interpolation, alternating prompts, step-wise prompt switching, and CLIP-guided prompt selection across various scenarios such as single object per text prompt, multiple objects per text prompt and objects against backgrounds.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuyu Jia, Wei Huang, Junyu Gao, Qi Wang, Qiang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Few-shot segmentation (FSS) for remote sensing (RS) imagery leverages supporting information from limited annotated samples to achieve query segmentation of novel classes. Previous efforts are dedicated to mining segmentation-guiding visual cues from a constrained set of support samples. However, they still struggle to address the pronounced intra-class differences in RS images, as sparse visual cues make it challenging to establish robust class-specific representations. In this paper, we propose a holistic semantic embedding (HSE) approach that effectively harnesses general semantic knowledge, i.e., class description (CD) embeddings.Instead of the naive combination of CD embeddings and visual features for segmentation decoding, we investigate embedding the general semantic knowledge during the feature extraction stage.Specifically, in HSE, a spatial dense interaction module allows the interaction of visual support features with CD embeddings along the spatial dimension via self-attention.Furthermore, a global content modulation module efficiently augments the global information of the target category in both support and query features, thanks to the transformative fusion of visual features and CD embeddings.These two components holistically synergize general CD embeddings and visual cues, constructing a robust class-specific representation.Through extensive experiments on the standard FSS benchmark, the proposed HSE approach demonstrates superior performance compared to peer work, setting a new state-of-the-art.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Licheng Shen, Ho Ngai Chow, Lingyun Wang, Tong Zhang, Mengqiu Wang, Yuxing Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in neural rendering techniques have significantly enhanced the fidelity of 3D reconstruction. Notably, the emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has marked a significant milestone by adopting a discrete scene representation, facilitating efficient training and real-time rendering. Several studies have successfully extended the real-time rendering capability of 3DGS to dynamic scenes. However, a challenge arises when training images are captured under vastly differing weather and lighting conditions. This scenario poses a challenge for 3DGS and its variants in achieving accurate reconstructions. Although NeRF-based methods (NeRF-W, CLNeRF) have shown promise in handling such challenging conditions, their computational demands hinder real-time rendering capabilities. In this paper, we present Gaussian Time Machine (GTM) which models the time-dependent attributes of Gaussian primitives with discrete time embedding vectors decoded by a lightweight Multi-Layer-Perceptron(MLP). By adjusting the opacity of Gaussian primitives, we can reconstruct visibility changes of objects. We further propose a decomposed color model for improved geometric consistency. GTM achieved state-of-the-art rendering fidelity on 3 datasets and is 100 times faster than NeRF-based counterparts in rendering. Moreover, GTM successfully disentangles the appearance changes and renders smooth appearance interpolation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yujun Shi, Jun Hao Liew, Hanshu Yan, Vincent Y. F. Tan, Jiashi Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: Accuracy and speed are critical in image editing tasks. Pan et al. introduced a drag-based image editing framework that achieves pixel-level control using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). A flurry of subsequent studies enhanced this framework's generality by leveraging large-scale diffusion models. However, these methods often suffer from inordinately long processing times (exceeding 1 minute per edit) and low success rates. Addressing these issues head on, we present InstaDrag, a rapid approach enabling high quality drag-based image editing in ~1 second. Unlike most previous methods, we redefine drag-based editing as a conditional generation task, eliminating the need for time-consuming latent optimization or gradient-based guidance during inference. In addition, the design of our pipeline allows us to train our model on large-scale paired video frames, which contain rich motion information such as object translations, changing poses and orientations, zooming in and out, etc. By learning from videos, our approach can significantly outperform previous methods in terms of accuracy and consistency. Despite being trained solely on videos, our model generalizes well to perform local shape deformations not presented in the training data (e.g., lengthening of hair, twisting rainbows, etc.). Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations on benchmark datasets corroborate the superiority of our approach.

<p>Abstract: Quadrilateral mesh generation plays a crucial role in numerical simulations within Computer-Aided Design and Engineering (CAD/E). The quality of the cross field is essential for generating a quadrilateral mesh. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised neural representation of the cross field, named NeurCross, comprising two modules: one to fit the signed distance function (SDF) and another to predict the cross field. Unlike most existing approaches that operate directly on the given polygonal surface, NeurCross takes the SDF as a bridge to allow for SDF overfitting and the prediction of the cross field to proceed simultaneously. By utilizing a neural SDF, we achieve a smooth representation of the base surface, minimizing the impact of piecewise planar discretization and minor surface variations. Moreover, the principal curvatures and directions are fully encoded by the Hessian of the SDF, enabling the regularization of the overall cross field through minor adjustments to the SDF. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, NeurCross significantly improves the placement of singular points and the approximation accuracy between the input triangular surface and the output quad mesh, as demonstrated in the teaser figure.</p>

Existing methods have achieved encouraging results on RGB-D SLAM, but studies of the monocular case are still scarce. Moreover, they also fail to correct drift errors due to the lack of loop closure and global optimization.

Our key idea is to represent the global map as 3D Gaussian and use it to guide the estimation of the scene geometry, thus mitigating the efforts of missing depth information. Further, an additional language-extended loop closure module which is based on CLIP feature is designed to continually perform global optimization to correct drift errors accumulated as the system runs. Our system shows promising results on multiple challenging datasets in both tracking and mapping and even surpasses some existing RGB-D methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: The widespread adoption of deep neural networks in machine learning calls for an objective quantification of esoteric trust. In this paper we propose GradTrust, a classification trust measure for large-scale neural networks at inference. The proposed method utilizes variance of counterfactual gradients, i.e. the required changes in the network parameters if the label were different. We show that GradTrust is superior to existing techniques for detecting misprediction rates on $50000$ images from ImageNet validation dataset. Depending on the network, GradTrust detects images where either the ground truth is incorrect or ambiguous, or the classes are co-occurring. We extend GradTrust to Video Action Recognition on Kinetics-400 dataset. We showcase results on $14$ architectures pretrained on ImageNet and $5$ architectures pretrained on Kinetics-400. We observe the following: (i) simple methodologies like negative log likelihood and margin classifiers outperform state-of-the-art uncertainty and out-of-distribution detection techniques for misprediction rates, and (ii) the proposed GradTrust is in the Top-2 performing methods on $37$ of the considered $38$ experimental modalities.

<p>Abstract: Training diffusion models for audiovisual sequences allows for a range of generation tasks by learning conditional distributions of various input-output combinations of the two modalities. Nevertheless, this strategy often requires training a separate model for each task which is expensive. Here, we propose a novel training approach to effectively learn arbitrary conditional distributions in the audiovisual space.Our key contribution lies in how we parameterize the diffusion timestep in the forward diffusion process. Instead of the standard fixed diffusion timestep, we propose applying variable diffusion timesteps across the temporal dimension and across modalities of the inputs. This formulation offers flexibility to introduce variable noise levels for various portions of the input, hence the term mixture of noise levels. We propose a transformer-based audiovisual latent diffusion model and show that it can be trained in a task-agnostic fashion using our approach to enable a variety of audiovisual generation tasks at inference time. Experiments demonstrate the versatility of our method in tackling cross-modal and multimodal interpolation tasks in the audiovisual space. Notably, our proposed approach surpasses baselines in generating temporally and perceptually consistent samples conditioned on the input. Project page: avdit2024.github.io</p>

<p>Abstract: We study cultural and socioeconomic diversity in contrastive vision-language models (VLMs). Using a broad range of benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics, we bring to attention several important findings. First, the common filtering of training data to English image-text pairs disadvantages communities of lower socioeconomic status and negatively impacts cultural understanding. Notably, this performance gap is not captured by -- and even at odds with -- the currently popular evaluation metrics derived from the Western-centric ImageNet and COCO datasets. Second, pretraining with global, unfiltered data before fine-tuning on English content can improve cultural understanding without sacrificing performance on said popular benchmarks. Third, we introduce the task of geo-localization as a novel evaluation metric to assess cultural diversity in VLMs. Our work underscores the value of using diverse data to create more inclusive multimodal systems and lays the groundwork for developing VLMs that better represent global perspectives.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tarun Kalluri, Jihyeon Lee, Kihyuk Sohn, Sahil Singla, Manmohan Chandraker, Joseph Xu, Jeremiah Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a simple and efficient method to leverage emerging text-to-image generative models in creating large-scale synthetic supervision for the task of damage assessment from aerial images. While significant recent advances have resulted in improved techniques for damage assessment using aerial or satellite imagery, they still suffer from poor robustness to domains where manual labeled data is unavailable, directly impacting post-disaster humanitarian assistance in such under-resourced geographies. Our contribution towards improving domain robustness in this scenario is two-fold. Firstly, we leverage the text-guided mask-based image editing capabilities of generative models and build an efficient and easily scalable pipeline to generate thousands of post-disaster images from low-resource domains. Secondly, we propose a simple two-stage training approach to train robust models while using manual supervision from different source domains along with the generated synthetic target domain data. We validate the strength of our proposed framework under cross-geography domain transfer setting from xBD and SKAI images in both single-source and multi-source settings, achieving significant improvements over a source-only baseline in each case.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingxue Yu, Vidit Vidit, Andrey Davydov, Martin Engilberge, Pascal Fua</p>
<p>Abstract: Animal Re-ID is crucial for wildlife conservation, yet it faces unique challenges compared to person Re-ID. First, the scarcity and lack of diversity in datasets lead to background-biased models. Second, animal Re-ID depends on subtle, species-specific cues, further complicated by variations in pose, background, and lighting. This study addresses background biases by proposing a method to systematically remove backgrounds in both training and evaluation phases. And unlike prior works that depend on pose annotations, our approach utilizes an unsupervised technique for feature alignment across body parts and pose variations, enhancing practicality. Our method achieves superior results on three key animal Re-ID datasets: ATRW, YakReID-103, and ELPephants.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huanjin Yao, Wenhao Wu, Taojiannan Yang, YuXin Song, Mengxi Zhang, Haocheng Feng, Yifan Sun, Zhiheng Li, Wanli Ouyang, Jingdong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Do we fully leverage the potential of visual encoder in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)? The recent outstanding performance of MLLMs in multimodal understanding has garnered broad attention from both academia and industry. In the current MLLM rat race, the focus seems to be predominantly on the linguistic side. We witness the rise of larger and higher-quality instruction datasets, as well as the involvement of larger-sized LLMs. Yet, scant attention has been directed towards the visual signals utilized by MLLMs, often assumed to be the final high-level features extracted by a frozen visual encoder. In this paper, we introduce the Dense Connector - a simple, effective, and plug-and-play vision-language connector that significantly enhances existing MLLMs by leveraging multi-layer visual features, with minimal additional computational overhead. Furthermore, our model, trained solely on images, showcases remarkable zero-shot capabilities in video understanding as well. Experimental results across various vision encoders, image resolutions, training dataset scales, varying sizes of LLMs (2.7B->70B), and diverse architectures of MLLMs (e.g., LLaVA and Mini-Gemini) validate the versatility and scalability of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance on across 19 image and video benchmarks. We hope that this work will provide valuable experience and serve as a basic module for future MLLM development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuting Wang, Jinpeng Wang, Bin Chen, Tao Dai, Ruisheng Luo, Shu-Tao Xia</p>
<p>Abstract: Given a text query, partially relevant video retrieval (PRVR) aims to retrieve untrimmed videos containing relevant moments. Due to the lack of moment annotations, the uncertainty lying in clip modeling and text-clip correspondence leads to major challenges. Despite the great progress, existing solutions either sacrifice efficiency or efficacy to capture varying and uncertain video moments. What's worse, few methods have paid attention to the text-clip matching pattern under such uncertainty, exposing the risk of semantic collapse. To address these issues, we present GMMFormer v2, an uncertainty-aware framework for PRVR. For clip modeling, we improve a strong baseline GMMFormer with a novel temporal consolidation module upon multi-scale contextual features, which maintains efficiency and improves the perception for varying moments. To achieve uncertainty-aware text-clip matching, we upgrade the query diverse loss in GMMFormer to facilitate fine-grained uniformity and propose a novel optimal matching loss for fine-grained text-clip alignment. Their collaboration alleviates the semantic collapse phenomenon and neatly promotes accurate correspondence between texts and moments. We conduct extensive experiments and ablation studies on three PRVR benchmarks, demonstrating remarkable improvement of GMMFormer v2 compared to the past SOTA competitor and the versatility of uncertainty-aware text-clip matching for PRVR.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Senmao Tian, Haoyu Gao, Gangyi Hong, Shuyun Wang, JingJie Wang, Xin Yu, Shunli Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing deep learning methods have made significant progress in gait recognition. Typically, appearance-based models binarize inputs into silhouette sequences. However, mainstream quantization methods prioritize minimizing task loss over quantization error, which is detrimental to gait recognition with binarized inputs. Minor variations in silhouette sequences can be diminished in the network's intermediate layers due to the accumulation of quantization errors. To address this, we propose a differentiable soft quantizer, which better simulates the gradient of the round function during backpropagation. This enables the network to learn from subtle input perturbations. However, our theoretical analysis and empirical studies reveal that directly applying the soft quantizer can hinder network convergence. We further refine the training strategy to ensure convergence while simulating quantization errors. Additionally, we visualize the distribution of outputs from different samples in the feature space and observe significant changes compared to the full precision network, which harms performance. Based on this, we propose an Inter-class Distance-guided Distillation (IDD) strategy to preserve the relative distance between the embeddings of samples with different labels. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating state-of-the-art accuracy across various settings and datasets. The code will be made publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Diwei Huang, Kunyang Lin, Peihao Chen, Qing Du, Mingkui Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: Few-shot audio-visual acoustics modeling seeks to synthesize the room impulse response in arbitrary locations with few-shot observations. To sufficiently exploit the provided few-shot data for accurate acoustic modeling, we present a *map-guided* framework by constructing acoustic-related visual semantic feature maps of the scenes. Visual features preserve semantic details related to sound and maps provide explicit structural regularities of sound propagation, which are valuable for modeling environment acoustics. We thus extract pixel-wise semantic features derived from observations and project them into a top-down map, namely the **observation semantic map**. This map contains the relative positional information among points and the semantic feature information associated with each point. Yet, limited information extracted by few-shot observations on the map is not sufficient for understanding and modeling the whole scene. We address the challenge by generating a **scene semantic map** via diffusing features and anticipating the observation semantic map. The scene semantic map then interacts with echo encoding by a transformer-based encoder-decoder to predict RIR for arbitrary speaker-listener query pairs. Extensive experiments on Matterport3D and Replica dataset verify the efficacy of our framework.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose a simple and effective method to estimate the uncertainty of closed-source deep neural network image classification models. Given a base image, our method creates multiple transformed versions and uses them to query the top-1 prediction of the closed-source model. We demonstrate significant improvements in the calibration of uncertainty estimates compared to the naive baseline of assigning 100\% confidence to all predictions. While we initially explore Gaussian perturbations, our empirical findings indicate that natural transformations, such as rotations and elastic deformations, yield even better-calibrated predictions. Furthermore, through empirical results and a straightforward theoretical analysis, we elucidate the reasons behind the superior performance of natural transformations over Gaussian noise. Leveraging these insights, we propose a transfer learning approach that further improves our calibration results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chong Mou, Mingdeng Cao, Xintao Wang, Zhaoyang Zhang, Ying Shan, Jian Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite significant advancements in video generation and editing using diffusion models, achieving accurate and localized video editing remains a substantial challenge. Additionally, most existing video editing methods primarily focus on altering visual content, with limited research dedicated to motion editing. In this paper, we present a novel attempt to Remake a Video (ReVideo) which stands out from existing methods by allowing precise video editing in specific areas through the specification of both content and motion. Content editing is facilitated by modifying the first frame, while the trajectory-based motion control offers an intuitive user interaction experience. ReVideo addresses a new task involving the coupling and training imbalance between content and motion control. To tackle this, we develop a three-stage training strategy that progressively decouples these two aspects from coarse to fine. Furthermore, we propose a spatiotemporal adaptive fusion module to integrate content and motion control across various sampling steps and spatial locations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ReVideo has promising performance on several accurate video editing applications, i.e., (1) locally changing video content while keeping the motion constant, (2) keeping content unchanged and customizing new motion trajectories, (3) modifying both content and motion trajectories. Our method can also seamlessly extend these applications to multi-area editing without specific training, demonstrating its flexibility and robustness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ganggui Ding, Canyu Zhao, Wen Wang, Zhen Yang, Zide Liu, Hao Chen, Chunhua Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Benefiting from large-scale pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) generative models, impressive progress has been achieved in customized image generation, which aims to generate user-specified concepts. Existing approaches have extensively focused on single-concept customization and still encounter challenges when it comes to complex scenarios that involve combining multiple concepts. These approaches often require retraining/fine-tuning using a few images, leading to time-consuming training processes and impeding their swift implementation. Furthermore, the reliance on multiple images to represent a singular concept increases the difficulty of customization. To this end, we propose FreeCustom, a novel tuning-free method to generate customized images of multi-concept composition based on reference concepts, using only one image per concept as input. Specifically, we introduce a new multi-reference self-attention (MRSA) mechanism and a weighted mask strategy that enables the generated image to access and focus more on the reference concepts. In addition, MRSA leverages our key finding that input concepts are better preserved when providing images with context interactions. Experiments show that our method's produced images are consistent with the given concepts and better aligned with the input text. Our method outperforms or performs on par with other training-based methods in terms of multi-concept composition and single-concept customization, but is simpler.

<p>Abstract: Identifying robust and accurate correspondences across images is a fundamental problem in computer vision that enables various downstream tasks. Recent semi-dense matching methods emphasize the effectiveness of fusing relevant cross-view information through Transformer. In this paper, we propose several improvements upon this paradigm. Firstly, we introduce affine-based local attention to model cross-view deformations. Secondly, we present selective fusion to merge local and global messages from cross attention. Apart from network structure, we also identify the importance of enforcing spatial smoothness in loss design, which has been omitted by previous works. Based on these augmentations, our network demonstrate strong matching capacity under different settings. The full version of our network achieves state-of-the-art performance among semi-dense matching methods at a similar cost to LoFTR, while the slim version reaches LoFTR baseline's performance with only 15% computation cost and 18% parameters.</p>

<p>Abstract: Jersey number recognition is an important task in sports video analysis, partly due to its importance for long-term player tracking. It can be viewed as a variant of scene text recognition. However, there is a lack of published attempts to apply scene text recognition models on jersey number data. Here we introduce a novel public jersey number recognition dataset for hockey and study how scene text recognition methods can be adapted to this problem. We address issues of occlusions and assess the degree to which training on one sport (hockey) can be generalized to another (soccer). For the latter, we also consider how jersey number recognition at the single-image level can be aggregated across frames to yield tracklet-level jersey number labels. We demonstrate high performance on image- and tracklet-level tasks, achieving 91.4% accuracy for hockey images and 87.4% for soccer tracklets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongyi Pan, Emadeldeen Hamdan, Xin Zhu, Koushik Biswas, Ahmet Cetin, Ulas Bagci</p>
<p>Abstract: Central to the Transformer architectures' effectiveness is the self-attention mechanism, a function that maps queries, keys, and values into a high-dimensional vector space. However, training the attention weights of queries, keys, and values is non-trivial from a state of random initialization. In this paper, we propose two methods. (i) We first address the initialization problem of Vision Transformers by introducing a simple, yet highly innovative, initialization approach utilizing Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients. Our proposed DCT-based attention initialization marks a significant gain compared to traditional initialization strategies; offering a robust foundation for the attention mechanism. Our experiments reveal that the DCT-based initialization enhances the accuracy of Vision Transformers in classification tasks. (ii) We also recognize that since DCT effectively decorrelates image information in the frequency domain, this decorrelation is useful for compression because it allows the quantization step to discard many of the higher-frequency components. Based on this observation, we propose a novel DCT-based compression technique for the attention function of Vision Transformers. Since high-frequency DCT coefficients usually correspond to noise, we truncate the high-frequency DCT components of the input patches. Our DCT-based compression reduces the size of weight matrices for queries, keys, and values. While maintaining the same level of accuracy, our DCT compressed Swin Transformers obtain a considerable decrease in the computational overhead.</p>

<p>Abstract: Emotion recognition is relevant for human behaviour understanding, where facial expression and speech recognition have been widely explored by the computer vision community. Literature in the field of behavioural psychology indicates that gait, described as the way a person walks, is an additional indicator of emotions. In this work, we propose a deep framework for emotion recognition through the analysis of gait. More specifically, our model is composed of a sequence of spatial-temporal Graph Convolutional Networks that produce a robust skeleton-based representation for the task of emotion classification. We evaluate our proposed framework on the E-Gait dataset, composed of a total of 2177 samples. The results obtained represent an improvement of approximately 5% in accuracy compared to the state of the art. In addition, during training we observed a faster convergence of our model compared to the state-of-the-art methodologies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Li, Hehe Fan, Yongkang Wong, Mohan Kankanhalli, Yi Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in image understanding have benefited from the extensive use of web image-text pairs. However, video understanding remains a challenge despite the availability of substantial web video-text data. This difficulty primarily arises from the inherent complexity of videos and the inefficient language supervision in recent web-collected video-text datasets. In this paper, we introduce Text-Only Pre-Alignment (TOPA), a novel approach to extend large language models (LLMs) for video understanding, without the need for pre-training on real video data. Specifically, we first employ an advanced LLM to automatically generate Textual Videos comprising continuous textual frames, along with corresponding annotations to simulate real video-text data. Then, these annotated textual videos are used to pre-align a language-only LLM with the video modality. To bridge the gap between textual and real videos, we employ the CLIP model as the feature extractor to align image and text modalities. During text-only pre-alignment, the continuous textual frames, encoded as a sequence of CLIP text features, are analogous to continuous CLIP image features, thus aligning the LLM with real video representation. Extensive experiments, including zero-shot evaluation and finetuning on various video understanding tasks, demonstrate that TOPA is an effective and efficient framework for aligning video content with LLMs. In particular, without training on any video data, the TOPA-Llama2-13B model achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 51.0% on the challenging long-form video understanding benchmark, Egoschema. This performance surpasses previous video-text pre-training approaches and proves competitive with recent GPT-3.5-based video agents.</p>

<p>Abstract: The recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) show promising results on the novel view synthesis (NVS) task. With its superior rendering performance and high-fidelity rendering quality, 3DGS is excelling at its previous NeRF counterparts. The most recent 3DGS method focuses either on improving the instability of rendering efficiency or reducing the model size. On the other hand, the training efficiency of 3DGS on large-scale scenes has not gained much attention. In this work, we propose DoGaussian, a method that trains 3DGS distributedly. Our method first decomposes a scene into K blocks and then introduces the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) into the training procedure of 3DGS. During training, our DoGaussian maintains one global 3DGS model on the master node and K local 3DGS models on the slave nodes. The K local 3DGS models are dropped after training and we only query the global 3DGS model during inference. The training time is reduced by scene decomposition, and the training convergence and stability are guaranteed through the consensus on the shared 3D Gaussians. Our method accelerates the training of 3DGS by 6+ times when evaluated on large-scale scenes while concurrently achieving state-of-the-art rendering quality.

<p>Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) within the surgical domain, utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs), offers a distinct opportunity to improve intra-operative decision-making and facilitate intuitive surgeon-AI interaction. However, the development of LLMs for surgical VQA is hindered by the scarcity of diverse and extensive datasets with complex reasoning tasks. Moreover, contextual fusion of the image and text modalities remains an open research challenge due to the inherent differences between these two types of information and the complexity involved in aligning them. This paper introduces PitVQA, a novel dataset specifically designed for VQA in endonasal pituitary surgery and PitVQA-Net, an adaptation of the GPT2 with a novel image-grounded text embedding for surgical VQA. PitVQA comprises 25 procedural videos and a rich collection of question-answer pairs spanning crucial surgical aspects such as phase and step recognition, context understanding, tool detection and localization, and tool-tissue interactions. PitVQA-Net consists of a novel image-grounded text embedding that projects image and text features into a shared embedding space and GPT2 Backbone with an excitation block classification head to generate contextually relevant answers within the complex domain of endonasal pituitary surgery. Our image-grounded text embedding leverages joint embedding, cross-attention and contextual representation to understand the contextual relationship between questions and surgical images. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PitVQA-Net on both the PitVQA and the publicly available EndoVis18-VQA dataset, achieving improvements in balanced accuracy of 8% and 9% over the most recent baselines, respectively.

<p>Abstract: We present a method for multi-concept customization of pretrained text-to-video (T2V) models. Intuitively, the multi-concept customized video can be derived from the (non-linear) intersection of the video manifolds of the individual concepts, which is not straightforward to find. We hypothesize that sequential and controlled walking towards the intersection of the video manifolds, directed by text prompting, leads to the solution. To do so, we generate the various concepts and their corresponding interactions, sequentially, in an autoregressive manner. Our method can generate videos of multiple custom concepts (subjects, action and background) such as a teddy bear running towards a brown teapot, a dog playing violin and a teddy bear swimming in the ocean. We quantitatively evaluate our method using videoCLIP and DINO scores, in addition to human evaluation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmad Bdeir, Niels Landwehr</p>
<p>Abstract: Hyperbolic deep learning has become a growing research direction in computer vision for the unique properties afforded by the alternate embedding space. The negative curvature and exponentially growing distance metric provide a natural framework for capturing hierarchical relationships between datapoints and allowing for finer separability between their embeddings. However, these methods are still computationally expensive and prone to instability, especially when attempting to learn the negative curvature that best suits the task and the data. Current Riemannian optimizers do not account for changes in the manifold which greatly harms performance and forces lower learning rates to minimize projection errors. Our paper focuses on curvature learning by introducing an improved schema for popular learning algorithms and providing a novel normalization approach to constrain embeddings within the variable representative radius of the manifold. Additionally, we introduce a novel formulation for Riemannian AdamW, and alternative hybrid encoder techniques and foundational formulations for current convolutional hyperbolic operations, greatly reducing the computational penalty of the hyperbolic embedding space. Our approach demonstrates consistent performance improvements across both direct classification and hierarchical metric learning tasks while allowing for larger hyperbolic models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anthony Fuller, Daniel G. Kyrollos, Yousef Yassin, James R. Green</p>
<p>Abstract: High-resolution images offer more information about scenes that can improve model accuracy. However, the dominant model architecture in computer vision, the vision transformer (ViT), cannot effectively leverage larger images without finetuning -- ViTs poorly extrapolate to more patches at test time, although transformers offer sequence length flexibility. We attribute this shortcoming to the current patch position encoding methods, which create a distribution shift when extrapolating.
  We propose a drop-in replacement for the position encoding of plain ViTs that restricts attention heads to fixed fields of view, pointed in different directions, using 2D attention masks. Our novel method, called LookHere, provides translation-equivariance, ensures attention head diversity, and limits the distribution shift that attention heads face when extrapolating. We demonstrate that LookHere improves performance on classification (avg. 1.6%), against adversarial attack (avg. 5.4%), and decreases calibration error (avg. 1.5%) -- on ImageNet without extrapolation. With extrapolation, LookHere outperforms the current SoTA position encoding method, 2D-RoPE, by 21.7% on ImageNet when trained at $224^2$ px and tested at $1024^2$ px. Additionally, we release a high-resolution test set to improve the evaluation of high-resolution image classifiers, called ImageNet-HR.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Diogo Lavado, Cl\'audia Soares, Alessandra Micheletti, Ricardo Santos, Andr\'e Coelho, Jo\~ao Santos</p>
<p>Abstract: Research on supervised learning algorithms in 3D scene understanding has risen in prominence and witness great increases in performance across several datasets. The leading force of this research is the problem of autonomous driving followed by indoor scene segmentation. However, openly available 3D data on these tasks mainly focuses on urban scenarios. In this paper, we propose TS40K, a 3D point cloud dataset that encompasses more than 40,000 Km on electrical transmission systems situated in European rural terrain. This is not only a novel problem for the research community that can aid in the high-risk mission of power-grid inspection, but it also offers 3D point clouds with distinct characteristics from those in self-driving and indoor 3D data, such as high point-density and no occlusion. In our dataset, each 3D point is labeled with 1 out of 22 annotated classes. We evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art methods on our dataset concerning 3D semantic segmentation and 3D object detection. Finally, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the results along with key challenges such as using labels that were not originally intended for learning tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenying Liu, Hunsoo Song, Anamika Shreevastava, Conrad M Albrecht</p>
<p>Abstract: Local climate zones (LCZs) established a standard classification system to categorize the landscape universe for improved urban climate studies. Existing LCZ mapping is guided by human interaction with geographic information systems (GIS) or modelled from remote sensing (RS) data. GIS-based methods do not scale to large areas. However, RS-based methods leverage machine learning techniques to automatize LCZ classification from RS. Yet, RS-based methods require huge amounts of manual labels for training.
  We propose a novel LCZ mapping framework, termed AutoLCZ, to extract the LCZ classification features from high-resolution RS modalities. We study the definition of numerical rules designed to mimic the LCZ definitions. Those rules model geometric and surface cover properties from LiDAR data. Correspondingly, we enable LCZ classification from RS data in a GIS-based scheme. The proposed AutoLCZ method has potential to reduce the human labor to acquire accurate metadata. At the same time, AutoLCZ sheds light on the physical interpretability of RS-based methods. In a proof-of-concept for New York City (NYC) we leverage airborne LiDAR surveys to model 4 LCZ features to distinguish 10 LCZ types. The results indicate the potential of AutoLCZ as promising avenue for large-scale LCZ mapping from RS data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hari Iyer, Neel Macwan, Shenghan Guo, Heejin Jeong</p>
<p>Abstract: The performance of physical workers is significantly influenced by the quantity of their motions. However, monitoring and assessing these motions is challenging due to the complexities of motion sensing, tracking, and quantification. Recent advancements have utilized in-situ video analysis for real-time observation of worker behaviors, enabling data-driven quantification of motion amounts. Nevertheless, there are limitations to monitoring worker movements using video data. This paper introduces a novel framework based on computer vision to track and quantify the motion of workers' upper and lower limbs, issuing alerts when the motion reaches critical thresholds. Using joint position data from posture estimation, the framework employs Hotelling's T$^2$ statistic to quantify and monitor motion amounts, integrating computer vision tools to address challenges in automated worker training and enhance exploratory research in this field. We collected data of participants performing lifting and moving tasks with large boxes and small wooden cubes, to simulate macro and micro assembly tasks respectively. It was found that the correlation between workers' joint motion amount and the Hotelling's T$^2$ statistic was approximately 35% greater for micro tasks compared to macro tasks, highlighting the framework's ability to identify fine-grained motion differences. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed system in real-time applications across various industry settings. It provides a tool for enhancing worker safety and productivity through precision motion analysis and proactive ergonomic adjustments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Baiyu Chen, Sixian Chan, Xiaoqin Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Video Object Segmentation (VOS) aims to track objects across frames in a video and segment them based on the initial annotated frame of the target objects. Previous VOS works typically rely on fully annotated videos for training. However, acquiring fully annotated training videos for VOS is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Meanwhile, self-supervised VOS methods have attempted to build VOS systems through correspondence learning and label propagation. Still, the absence of mask priors harms their robustness to complex scenarios, and the label propagation paradigm makes them impractical in terms of efficiency. To address these issues, we propose, for the first time, a general one-shot training framework for VOS, requiring only a single labeled frame per training video and applicable to a majority of state-of-the-art VOS networks. Specifically, our algorithm consists of: i) Inferring object masks time-forward based on the initial labeled frame. ii) Reconstructing the initial object mask time-backward using the masks from step i). Through this bi-directional training, a satisfactory VOS network can be obtained. Notably, our approach is extremely simple and can be employed end-to-end. Finally, our approach uses a single labeled frame of YouTube-VOS and DAVIS datasets to achieve comparable results to those trained on fully labeled datasets. The code will be released.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fangqiang Ding, Xiangyu Wen, Yunzhou Zhu, Yiming Li, Chris Xiaoxuan Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D occupancy-based perception pipeline has significantly advanced autonomous driving by capturing detailed scene descriptions and demonstrating strong generalizability across various object categories and shapes. Current methods predominantly rely on LiDAR or camera inputs for 3D occupancy prediction. These methods are susceptible to adverse weather conditions, limiting the all-weather deployment of self-driving cars. To improve perception robustness, we leverage the recent advances in automotive radars and introduce a novel approach that utilizes 4D imaging radar sensors for 3D occupancy prediction. Our method, RadarOcc, circumvents the limitations of sparse radar point clouds by directly processing the 4D radar tensor, thus preserving essential scene details. RadarOcc innovatively addresses the challenges associated with the voluminous and noisy 4D radar data by employing Doppler bins descriptors, sidelobe-aware spatial sparsification, and range-wise self-attention mechanisms. To minimize the interpolation errors associated with direct coordinate transformations, we also devise a spherical-based feature encoding followed by spherical-to-Cartesian feature aggregation. We benchmark various baseline methods based on distinct modalities on the public K-Radar dataset. The results demonstrate RadarOcc's state-of-the-art performance in radar-based 3D occupancy prediction and promising results even when compared with LiDAR- or camera-based methods. Additionally, we present qualitative evidence of the superior performance of 4D radar in adverse weather conditions and explore the impact of key pipeline components through ablation studies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Zhang, Di Chang, Fang Li, Mohammad Soleymani, Narendra Ahuja</p>
<p>Abstract: With the success of 2D and 3D visual generative models, there is growing interest in generating 4D content. Existing methods primarily rely on text prompts to produce 4D content, but they often fall short of accurately defining complex or rare motions. To address this limitation, we propose MagicPose4D, a novel framework for refined control over both appearance and motion in 4D generation. Unlike traditional methods, MagicPose4D accepts monocular videos as motion prompts, enabling precise and customizable motion generation. MagicPose4D comprises two key modules:
  i) Dual-Phase 4D Reconstruction Module} which operates in two phases. The first phase focuses on capturing the model's shape using accurate 2D supervision and less accurate but geometrically informative 3D pseudo-supervision without imposing skeleton constraints. The second phase refines the model using more accurate pseudo-3D supervision, obtained in the first phase and introduces kinematic chain-based skeleton constraints to ensure physical plausibility. Additionally, we propose a Global-local Chamfer loss that aligns the overall distribution of predicted mesh vertices with the supervision while maintaining part-level alignment without extra annotations.
  ii) Cross-category Motion Transfer Module} leverages the predictions from the 4D reconstruction module and uses a kinematic-chain-based skeleton to achieve cross-category motion transfer. It ensures smooth transitions between frames through dynamic rigidity, facilitating robust generalization without additional training.
  Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that MagicPose4D significantly improves the accuracy and consistency of 4D content generation, outperforming existing methods in various benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present a keypoint-based foundation model for general purpose brain MRI registration, based on the recently-proposed KeyMorph framework. Our model, called BrainMorph, serves as a tool that supports multi-modal, pairwise, and scalable groupwise registration. BrainMorph is trained on a massive dataset of over 100,000 3D volumes, skull-stripped and non-skull-stripped, from nearly 16,000 unique healthy and diseased subjects. BrainMorph is robust to large misalignments, interpretable via interrogating automatically-extracted keypoints, and enables rapid and controllable generation of many plausible transformations with different alignment types and different degrees of nonlinearity at test-time. We demonstrate the superiority of BrainMorph in solving 3D rigid, affine, and nonlinear registration on a variety of multi-modal brain MRI scans of healthy and diseased subjects, in both the pairwise and groupwise setting. In particular, we show registration accuracy and speeds that surpass current state-of-the-art methods, especially in the context of large initial misalignments and large group settings.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mykhailo Uss, Ruslan Yermolenko, Olena Kolodiazhna, Oleksii Shashko, Ivan Safonov, Volodymyr Savin, Yoonjae Yeo, Seowon Ji, Jaeyun Jeong</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantization is widely used to increase deep neural networks' (DNN) memory, computation, and power efficiency. Various techniques, such as post-training quantization and quantization-aware training, have been proposed to improve quantization quality. We introduce a novel approach for DNN quantization that uses a redundant representation of DNN's output. We represent the target quantity as a point on a 2D parametric curve. The DNN model is modified to predict 2D points that are mapped back to the target quantity at a post-processing stage. We demonstrate that this mapping can reduce quantization error. For the low-order parametric Hilbert curve, Depth-From-Stereo task, and two models represented by U-Net architecture and vision transformer, we achieved a quantization error reduction by about 5 times for the INT8 model at both CPU and DSP delegates. This gain comes with a minimal inference time increase (less than 7%). Our approach can be applied to other tasks, including segmentation, object detection, and key-points prediction.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14030">Refining Skewed Perceptions in Vision-Language Models through Visual Representations</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Haocheng Dai, Sarang Joshi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have become foundational, demonstrating remarkable success across a variety of downstream tasks. Despite their advantages, these models, akin to other foundational systems, inherit biases from the disproportionate distribution of real-world data, leading to misconceptions about the actual environment. Prevalent datasets like ImageNet are often riddled with non-causal, spurious correlations that can diminish VLM performance in scenarios where these contextual elements are absent. This study presents an investigation into how a simple linear probe can effectively distill task-specific core features from CLIP's embedding for downstream applications. Our analysis reveals that the CLIP text representations are often tainted by spurious correlations, inherited in the biased pre-training dataset. Empirical evidence suggests that relying on visual representations from CLIP, as opposed to text embedding, is more practical to refine the skewed perceptions in VLMs, emphasizing the superior utility of visual representations in overcoming embedded biases. Our codes will be available here.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rongyi Zhu, Zeliang Zhang, Susan Liang, Zhuo Liu, Chenliang Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial examples, crafted by adding perturbations imperceptible to humans, can deceive neural networks. Recent studies identify the adversarial transferability across various models, \textit{i.e.}, the cross-model attack ability of adversarial samples. To enhance such adversarial transferability, existing input transformation-based methods diversify input data with transformation augmentation. However, their effectiveness is limited by the finite number of available transformations. In our study, we introduce a novel approach named Learning to Transform (L2T). L2T increases the diversity of transformed images by selecting the optimal combination of operations from a pool of candidates, consequently improving adversarial transferability. We conceptualize the selection of optimal transformation combinations as a trajectory optimization problem and employ a reinforcement learning strategy to effectively solve the problem. Comprehensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset, as well as practical tests with Google Vision and GPT-4V, reveal that L2T surpasses current methodologies in enhancing adversarial transferability, thereby confirming its effectiveness and practical significance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zakaria Patel, Kirill Serkh</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models are a powerful class of generative models capable of producing high-quality images from pure noise. In particular, conditional diffusion models allow one to specify the contents of the desired image using a simple text prompt. Conditioning on a text prompt alone, however, does not allow for fine-grained control over the composition and layout of the final image, which instead depends closely on the initial noise distribution. While most methods which introduce spatial constraints (e.g., bounding boxes) require fine-tuning, a smaller and more recent subset of these methods are training-free. They are applicable whenever the prompt influences the model through an attention mechanism, and generally fall into one of two categories. The first entails modifying the cross-attention maps of specific tokens directly to enhance the signal in certain regions of the image. The second works by defining a loss function over the cross-attention maps, and using the gradient of this loss to guide the latent. While previous work explores these as alternative strategies, we provide an interpretation for these methods which highlights their complimentary features, and demonstrate that it is possible to obtain superior performance when both methods are used in concert.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bum Jun Kim, Sang Woo Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in a variety of vision tasks. Despite their promising capabilities, training a ViT requires a large amount of diverse data. Several studies empirically found that using rich data augmentations, such as Mixup, Cutmix, and random erasing, is critical to the successful training of ViTs. Now, the use of rich data augmentations has become a standard practice in the current state. However, we report a vulnerability to this practice: Certain data augmentations such as Mixup cause a variance shift in the positional embedding of ViT, which has been a hidden factor that degrades the performance of ViT during the test phase. We claim that achieving a stable effect from positional embedding requires a specific condition on the image, which is often broken for the current data augmentation methods. We provide a detailed analysis of this problem as well as the correct configuration for these data augmentations to remove the side effects of variance shift. Experiments showed that adopting our guidelines improves the performance of ViTs compared with the current configuration of data augmentations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chongwei Liu, Haojie Li, Zhihui Wang, Rui Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) have achieved remarkable success in short-term association within the decoupled tracking-by-detection online paradigm. However, long-term tracking still remains a challenging task. Although graph-based approaches can address this issue by modeling trajectories as a graph in the decoupled manner, their non-online nature poses obstacles for real-time applications. In this paper, we demonstrate that the trajectory graph is a directed acyclic graph, which can be represented by an object sequence arranged by frame and a binary adjacency matrix. It is a coincidence that the binary matrix matches the attention mask in the Transformer, and the object sequence serves exactly as a natural input sequence. Intuitively, we propose that a pure Transformer can naturally unify short- and long-term associations in a decoupled and online manner. Our experiments show that a classic Transformer architecture naturally suits the association problem and achieves a strong baseline compared to existing foundational methods across four datasets: DanceTrack, SportsMOT, MOT17, and MOT20, as well as superior generalizability in domain shift. Moreover, the decoupled property also enables efficient training and inference. This work pioneers a promising Transformer-based approach for the MOT task, and provides code to facilitate further research. https://github.com/chongweiliu/PuTR</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuzhang Shang, Dan Xu, Gaowen Liu, Ramana Rao Kompella, Yan Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-task learning for dense prediction has emerged as a pivotal area in computer vision, enabling simultaneous processing of diverse yet interrelated pixel-wise prediction tasks. However, the substantial computational demands of state-of-the-art (SoTA) models often limit their widespread deployment. This paper addresses this challenge by introducing network binarization to compress resource-intensive multi-task dense predictors. Specifically, our goal is to significantly accelerate multi-task dense prediction models via Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) while maintaining and even improving model performance at the same time. To reach this goal, we propose a Binary Multi-task Dense Predictor, Bi-MTDP, and several variants of Bi-MTDP, in which a multi-task dense predictor is constructed via specified binarized modules. Our systematical analysis of this predictor reveals that performance drop from binarization is primarily caused by severe information degradation. To address this issue, we introduce a deep information bottleneck layer that enforces representations for downstream tasks satisfying Gaussian distribution in forward propagation. Moreover, we introduce a knowledge distillation mechanism to correct the direction of information flow in backward propagation. Intriguingly, one variant of Bi-MTDP outperforms full-precision (FP) multi-task dense prediction SoTAs, ARTC (CNN-based) and InvPT (ViT-Based). This result indicates that Bi-MTDP is not merely a naive trade-off between performance and efficiency, but is rather a benefit of the redundant information flow thanks to the multi-task architecture.

The challenge is the lack of labeled data for the training of foundation model. To handle this issue, a CLIP-style retinal image foundation model is developed in this paper. Our foundation model, RET-CLIP, is specifically trained on a dataset of 193,865 patients to extract general features of color fundus photographs (CFPs), employing a tripartite optimization strategy to focus on left eye, right eye, and patient level to reflect real-world clinical scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RET-CLIP outperforms existing benchmarks across eight diverse datasets spanning four critical diagnostic categories: diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, multiple disease diagnosis, and multi-label classification of multiple diseases, which demonstrate the performance and generality of our foundation model.

Users request recommendations for books or music that evoke similar feelings to those captured in the images, and recommendations are endorsed by the community through upvotes. This dataset supports two recommendation tasks: title generation and multiple-choice selection. Our experiments with large foundation models reveal their limitations in these tasks. Particularly, vision-language models show no significant advantage over language-only counterparts that use descriptions, which we hypothesize is due to underutilized visual capabilities. To better harness these abilities, we propose the chain-of-imagery prompting, which results in notable improvements. We release our code and datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuan Zhang, Fei Xiao, Tao Huang, Chun-Kai Fan, Hongyuan Dong, Jiawen Li, Jiacong Wang, Kuan Cheng, Shanghang Zhang, Haoyuan Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have recently achieved rapid progress, exhibiting great perception and reasoning abilities concerning visual information. However, when faced with prompts in different sizes of solution spaces, LVLMs fail to always give consistent answers regarding the same knowledge point. This inconsistency of answers between different solution spaces is prevalent in LVLMs and erodes trust. To this end, we provide a multi-modal benchmark ConBench, to intuitively analyze how LVLMs perform when the solution space of a prompt revolves around a knowledge point. Based on the ConBench tool, we are the first to reveal the tapestry and get the following findings: (1) In the discriminate realm, the larger the solution space of the prompt, the lower the accuracy of the answers. (2) Establish the relationship between the discriminative and generative realms: the accuracy of the discriminative question type exhibits a strong positive correlation with its Consistency with the caption. (3) Compared to open-source models, closed-source models exhibit a pronounced bias advantage in terms of Consistency. Eventually, we ameliorate the consistency of LVLMs by trigger-based diagnostic refinement, indirectly improving the performance of their caption. We hope this paper will accelerate the research community in better evaluating their models and encourage future advancements in the consistency domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taylor Archibald, Tony Martinez</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficient categorization of historical documents is crucial for fields such as genealogy, legal research, and historical scholarship, where manual classification is impractical for large collections due to its labor-intensive and error-prone nature. To address this, we propose a representational learning strategy that integrates semantic segmentation and deep learning models -- ResNets, CLIP, the Document Image Transformer (DiT), and masked auto-encoders (MAE) -- to generate embeddings that capture document features without predefined labels. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to evaluate embeddings on fine-grained, unsupervised form classification. To improve these embeddings, we propose to first employ semantic segmentation as a preprocessing step. We contribute two novel datasets -- French 19th-century and U.S. 1950 Census records -- to demonstrate our approach. Our results show the effectiveness of these various embedding techniques in distinguishing similar document types and indicate that applying semantic segmentation can greatly improve clustering and classification results. The census datasets are available at \href{https://github.com/tahlor/census_forms}{https://github.com/tahlor/census\_forms}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nhat Chung, Sensen Gao, Tuan-Anh Vu, Jie Zhang, Aishan Liu, Yun Lin, Jin Song Dong, Qing Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Large-Language-Models (Vision-LLMs) are increasingly being integrated into autonomous driving (AD) systems due to their advanced visual-language reasoning capabilities, targeting the perception, prediction, planning, and control mechanisms. However, Vision-LLMs have demonstrated susceptibilities against various types of adversarial attacks, which would compromise their reliability and safety. To further explore the risk in AD systems and the transferability of practical threats, we propose to leverage typographic attacks against AD systems relying on the decision-making capabilities of Vision-LLMs. Different from the few existing works developing general datasets of typographic attacks, this paper focuses on realistic traffic scenarios where these attacks can be deployed, on their potential effects on the decision-making autonomy, and on the practical ways in which these attacks can be physically presented. To achieve the above goals, we first propose a dataset-agnostic framework for automatically generating false answers that can mislead Vision-LLMs' reasoning. Then, we present a linguistic augmentation scheme that facilitates attacks at image-level and region-level reasoning, and we extend it with attack patterns against multiple reasoning tasks simultaneously. Based on these, we conduct a study on how these attacks can be realized in physical traffic scenarios. Through our empirical study, we evaluate the effectiveness, transferability, and realizability of typographic attacks in traffic scenes. Our findings demonstrate particular harmfulness of the typographic attacks against existing Vision-LLMs (e.g., LLaVA, Qwen-VL, VILA, and Imp), thereby raising community awareness of vulnerabilities when incorporating such models into AD systems. We will release our source code upon acceptance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zipeng Qi, Chenyang Liu, Zili Liu, Hao Chen, Yongchang Wu, Zhengxia Zou, Zhenwei Sh</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-view segmentation in Remote Sensing (RS) seeks to segment images from diverse perspectives within a scene. Recent methods leverage 3D information extracted from an Implicit Neural Field (INF), bolstering result consistency across multiple views while using limited accounts of labels (even within 3-5 labels) to streamline labor. Nonetheless, achieving superior performance within the constraints of limited-view labels remains challenging due to inadequate scene-wide supervision and insufficient semantic features within the INF. To address these. we propose to inject the prior of the visual foundation model-Segment Anything(SAM), to the INF to obtain better results under the limited number of training data. Specifically, we contrast SAM features between testing and training views to derive pseudo labels for each testing view, augmenting scene-wide labeling information. Subsequently, we introduce SAM features via a transformer into the INF of the scene, supplementing the semantic information. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the mainstream method, confirming the efficacy of SAM as a supplement to the INF for this task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuheng Shi, Minjing Dong, Chang Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the significant achievements of Vision Transformers (ViTs) in various vision tasks, they are constrained by the quadratic complexity. Recently, State Space Models (SSMs) have garnered widespread attention due to their global receptive field and linear complexity with respect to the input length, demonstrating substantial potential across fields including natural language processing and computer vision. To improve the performance of SSMs in vision tasks, a multi-scan strategy is widely adopted, which leads to significant redundancy of SSMs. For a better trade-off between efficiency and performance, we analyze the underlying reasons behind the success of the multi-scan strategy, where long-range dependency plays an important role. Based on the analysis, we introduce Multi-Scale Vision Mamba (MSVMamba) to preserve the superiority of SSMs in vision tasks with limited parameters. It employs a multi-scale 2D scanning technique on both original and downsampled feature maps, which not only benefits long-range dependency learning but also reduces computational costs. Additionally, we integrate a Convolutional Feed-Forward Network (ConvFFN) to address the lack of channel mixing. Our experiments demonstrate that MSVMamba is highly competitive, with the MSVMamba-Tiny model achieving 82.8% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, 46.9% box mAP, and 42.2% instance mAP with the Mask R-CNN framework, 1x training schedule on COCO, and 47.6% mIoU with single-scale testing on ADE20K.Code is available at \url{https://github.com/YuHengsss/MSVMamba}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> He Zou, Meng'en Qin, Yu Song, Xiaohui Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: In the realm of neural network models, the perpetual challenge remains in retaining task-relevant information while effectively discarding redundant data during propagation. In this paper, we introduce IB-AdCSCNet, a deep learning model grounded in information bottleneck theory. IB-AdCSCNet seamlessly integrates the information bottleneck trade-off strategy into deep networks by dynamically adjusting the trade-off hyperparameter $\lambda$ through gradient descent, updating it within the FISTA(Fast Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm ) framework. By optimizing the compressive excitation loss function induced by the information bottleneck principle, IB-AdCSCNet achieves an optimal balance between compression and fitting at a global level, approximating the globally optimal representation feature. This information bottleneck trade-off strategy driven by downstream tasks not only helps to learn effective features of the data, but also improves the generalization of the model. This study's contribution lies in presenting a model with consistent performance and offering a fresh perspective on merging deep learning with sparse representation theory, grounded in the information bottleneck concept. Experimental results on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets demonstrate that IB-AdCSCNet not only matches the performance of deep residual convolutional networks but also outperforms them when handling corrupted data. Through the inference of the IB trade-off, the model's robustness is notably enhanced.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenyu Wei, Yujie He, Zhanchuan Cai</p>
<p>Abstract: RGB-D tracking significantly improves the accuracy of object tracking. However, its dependency on real depth inputs and the complexity involved in multi-modal fusion limit its applicability across various scenarios. The utilization of depth information in RGB-D tracking inspired us to propose a new method, named MDETrack, which trains a tracking network with an additional capability to understand the depth of scenes, through supervised or self-supervised auxiliary Monocular Depth Estimation learning. The outputs of MDETrack's unified feature extractor are fed to the side-by-side tracking head and auxiliary depth estimation head, respectively. The auxiliary module will be discarded in inference, thus keeping the same inference speed. We evaluated our models with various training strategies on multiple datasets, and the results show an improved tracking accuracy even without real depth. Through these findings we highlight the potential of depth estimation in enhancing object tracking performance.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14200">Awesome Multi-modal Object Tracking</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Chunhui Zhang, Li Liu, Hao Wen, Xi Zhou, Yanfeng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-modal object tracking (MMOT) is an emerging field that combines data from various modalities, \eg vision (RGB), depth, thermal infrared, event, language and audio, to estimate the state of an arbitrary object in a video sequence. It is of great significance for many applications such as autonomous driving and intelligent surveillance. In recent years, MMOT has received more and more attention. However, existing MMOT algorithms mainly focus on two modalities (\eg RGB+depth, RGB+thermal infrared, and RGB+language). To leverage more modalities, some recent efforts have been made to learn a unified visual object tracking model for any modality. Additionally, some large-scale multi-modal tracking benchmarks have been established by simultaneously providing more than two modalities, such as vision-language-audio (\eg WebUAV-3M) and vision-depth-language (\eg UniMod1K). To track the latest progress in MMOT, we conduct a comprehensive investigation in this report. Specifically, we first divide existing MMOT tasks into five main categories, \ie RGBL tracking, RGBE tracking, RGBD tracking, RGBT tracking, and miscellaneous (RGB+X), where X can be any modality, such as language, depth, and event. Then, we analyze and summarize each MMOT task, focusing on widely used datasets and mainstream tracking algorithms based on their technical paradigms (\eg self-supervised learning, prompt learning, knowledge distillation, generative models, and state space models). Finally, we maintain a continuously updated paper list for MMOT at https://github.com/983632847/Awesome-Multimodal-Object-Tracking.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youcan Xu, Zhen Wang, Jun Xiao, Wei Liu, Long Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: With the advance of diffusion models, various personalized image generation methods have been proposed. However, almost all existing work only focuses on either subject-driven or style-driven personalization. Meanwhile, state-of-the-art methods face several challenges in realizing compositional personalization, i.e., composing different subject and style concepts, such as concept disentanglement, unified reconstruction paradigm, and insufficient training data. To address these issues, we introduce FreeTuner, a flexible and training-free method for compositional personalization that can generate any user-provided subject in any user-provided style (see Figure 1). Our approach employs a disentanglement strategy that separates the generation process into two stages to effectively mitigate concept entanglement. FreeTuner leverages the intermediate features within the diffusion model for subject concept representation and introduces style guidance to align the synthesized images with the style concept, ensuring the preservation of both the subject's structure and the style's aesthetic features. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the generation ability of FreeTuner across various personalization settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guotao Liang, Baoquan Zhang, Yaowei Wang, Xutao Li, Yunming Ye, Huaibin Wang, Chuyao Luo, Kola Ye, linfeng Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Vector quantization (VQ) is a key technique in high-resolution and high-fidelity image synthesis, which aims to learn a codebook to encode an image with a sequence of discrete codes and then generate an image in an auto-regression manner. Although existing methods have shown superior performance, most methods prefer to learn a single-modal codebook (\emph{e.g.}, image), resulting in suboptimal performance when the codebook is applied to multi-modal downstream tasks (\emph{e.g.}, text-to-image, image captioning) due to the existence of modal gaps. In this paper, we propose a novel language-guided codebook learning framework, called LG-VQ, which aims to learn a codebook that can be aligned with the text to improve the performance of multi-modal downstream tasks. Specifically, we first introduce pre-trained text semantics as prior knowledge, then design two novel alignment modules (\emph{i.e.}, Semantic Alignment Module, and Relationship Alignment Module) to transfer such prior knowledge into codes for achieving codebook text alignment. In particular, our LG-VQ method is model-agnostic, which can be easily integrated into existing VQ models. Experimental results show that our method achieves superior performance on reconstruction and various multi-modal downstream tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanwei Zhang, Luo Cheng, Qisong He, Wei Huang, Renjue Li, Ronan Sicre, Xiaowei Huang, Holger Hermanns, Lijun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Classification of 3D point clouds is a challenging machine learning (ML) task with important real-world applications in a spectrum from autonomous driving and robot-assisted surgery to earth observation from low orbit. As with other ML tasks, classification models are notoriously brittle in the presence of adversarial attacks. These are rooted in imperceptible changes to inputs with the effect that a seemingly well-trained model ends up misclassifying the input. This paper adds to the understanding of adversarial attacks by presenting Eidos, a framework providing Efficient Imperceptible aDversarial attacks on 3D pOint cloudS. Eidos supports a diverse set of imperceptibility metrics. It employs an iterative, two-step procedure to identify optimal adversarial examples, thereby enabling a runtime-imperceptibility trade-off. We provide empirical evidence relative to several popular 3D point cloud classification models and several established 3D attack methods, showing Eidos' superiority with respect to efficiency as well as imperceptibility.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has significantly advanced their ability to process and understand complex visual and textual information. However, the integration of multiple images and extensive textual contexts remains a challenge due to the inherent limitation of the models' capacity to handle long input sequences efficiently. In this paper, we introduce SEEKER, a multimodal large language model designed to tackle this issue. SEEKER aims to optimize the compact encoding of long text by compressing the text sequence into the visual pixel space via images, enabling the model to handle long text within a fixed token-length budget efficiently. Our empirical experiments on six long-context multimodal tasks demonstrate that SEEKER can leverage fewer image tokens to convey the same amount of textual information compared with the OCR-based approach, and is more efficient in understanding long-form multimodal input and generating long-form textual output, outperforming all existing proprietary and open-source MLLMs by large margins.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved great success in image generation, with the backbone evolving from U-Net to Vision Transformers. However, the computational cost of Transformers is quadratic to the number of tokens, leading to significant challenges when dealing with high-resolution images. In this work, we propose Diffusion Mamba (DiM), which combines the efficiency of Mamba, a sequence model based on State Space Models (SSM), with the expressive power of diffusion models for efficient high-resolution image synthesis. To address the challenge that Mamba cannot generalize to 2D signals, we make several architecture designs including multi-directional scans, learnable padding tokens at the end of each row and column, and lightweight local feature enhancement. Our DiM architecture achieves inference-time efficiency for high-resolution images. In addition, to further improve training efficiency for high-resolution image generation with DiM, we investigate ``weak-to-strong'' training strategy that pretrains DiM on low-resolution images ($256\times 256$) and then finetune it on high-resolution images ($512 \times 512$). We further explore training-free upsampling strategies to enable the model to generate higher-resolution images (e.g., $1024\times 1024$ and $1536\times 1536$) without further fine-tuning. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our DiM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guangyu Guo, Jiawen Yao, Yingda Xia, Tony C. W. Mok, Zhilin Zheng, Junwei Han, Le Lu, Dingwen Zhang, Jian Zhou, Ling Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The absence of adequately sufficient expert-level tumor annotations hinders the effectiveness of supervised learning based opportunistic cancer screening on medical imaging. Clinical reports (that are rich in descriptive textual details) can offer a "free lunch'' supervision information and provide tumor location as a type of weak label to cope with screening tasks, thus saving human labeling workloads, if properly leveraged. However, predicting cancer only using such weak labels can be very changeling since tumors are usually presented in small anatomical regions compared to the whole 3D medical scans. Weakly semi-supervised learning (WSSL) utilizes a limited set of voxel-level tumor annotations and incorporates alongside a substantial number of medical images that have only off-the-shelf clinical reports, which may strike a good balance between minimizing expert annotation workload and optimizing screening efficacy. In this paper, we propose a novel text-guided learning method to achieve highly accurate cancer detection results. Through integrating diagnostic and tumor location text prompts into the text encoder of a vision-language model (VLM), optimization of weakly supervised learning can be effectively performed in the latent space of VLM, thereby enhancing the stability of training. Our approach can leverage clinical knowledge by large-scale pre-trained VLM to enhance generalization ability, and produce reliable pseudo tumor masks to improve cancer detection. Our extensive quantitative experimental results on a large-scale cancer dataset, including 1,651 unique patients, validate that our approach can reduce human annotation efforts by at least 70% while maintaining comparable cancer detection accuracy to competing fully supervised methods (AUC value 0.961 versus 0.966).</p>

<p>Abstract: Point Cloud Interpolation confronts challenges from point sparsity, complex spatiotemporal dynamics, and the difficulty of deriving complete 3D point clouds from sparse temporal information. This paper presents NeuroGauss4D-PCI, which excels at modeling complex non-rigid deformations across varied dynamic scenes. The method begins with an iterative Gaussian cloud soft clustering module, offering structured temporal point cloud representations. The proposed temporal radial basis function Gaussian residual utilizes Gaussian parameter interpolation over time, enabling smooth parameter transitions and capturing temporal residuals of Gaussian distributions. Additionally, a 4D Gaussian deformation field tracks the evolution of these parameters, creating continuous spatiotemporal deformation fields. A 4D neural field transforms low-dimensional spatiotemporal coordinates ($x,y,z,t$) into a high-dimensional latent space. Finally, we adaptively and efficiently fuse the latent features from neural fields and the geometric features from Gaussian deformation fields. NeuroGauss4D-PCI outperforms existing methods in point cloud frame interpolation, delivering leading performance on both object-level (DHB) and large-scale autonomous driving datasets (NL-Drive), with scalability to auto-labeling and point cloud densification tasks.

<p>Abstract: Contrastive image-to-LiDAR knowledge transfer, commonly used for learning 3D representations with synchronized images and point clouds, often faces a self-conflict dilemma. This issue arises as contrastive losses unintentionally dissociate features of unmatched points and pixels that share semantic labels, compromising the integrity of learned representations. To overcome this, we harness Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), which have revolutionized the acquisition of pixel-level semantics, to enhance 3D representation learning. Specifically, we utilize off-the-shelf VFMs to generate semantic labels for weakly-supervised pixel-to-point contrastive distillation. Additionally, we employ von Mises-Fisher distributions to structure the feature space, ensuring semantic embeddings within the same class remain consistent across varying inputs. Furthermore, we adapt sampling probabilities of points to address imbalances in spatial distribution and category frequency, promoting comprehensive and balanced learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach mitigates the challenges posed by traditional methods and consistently surpasses existing image-to-LiDAR contrastive distillation methods in downstream tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joanna Waczy\'nska, Piotr Borycki, Joanna Kaleta, S{\l}awomir Tadeja, Przemys{\l}aw Spurek</p>
<p>Abstract: Over the past years, we have observed an abundance of approaches for modeling dynamic 3D scenes using Gaussian Splatting (GS). Such solutions use GS to represent the scene's structure and the neural network to model dynamics. Such approaches allow fast rendering and extracting each element of such a dynamic scene. However, modifying such objects over time is challenging. SC-GS (Sparse Controlled Gaussian Splatting) enhanced with Deformed Control Points partially solves this issue. However, this approach necessitates selecting elements that need to be kept fixed, as well as centroids that should be adjusted throughout editing. Moreover, this task poses additional difficulties regarding the re-productivity of such editing. To address this, we propose Dynamic Multi-Gaussian Soup (D-MiSo), which allows us to model the mesh-inspired representation of dynamic GS. Additionally, we propose a strategy of linking parameterized Gaussian splats, forming a Triangle Soup with the estimated mesh. Consequently, we can separately construct new trajectories for the 3D objects composing the scene. Thus, we can make the scene's dynamic editable over time or while maintaining partial dynamics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kai Yao, Zhaorui Tan, Zixian Su, Xi Yang, Jie Sun, Kaizhu Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Open compound domain adaptation (OCDA) aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain to a mix of unlabeled homogeneous compound target domains while generalizing to open unseen domains. Existing OCDA methods solve the intra-domain gaps by a divide-and-conquer strategy, which divides the problem into several individual and parallel domain adaptation (DA) tasks. Such approaches often contain multiple sub-networks or stages, which may constrain the model's performance. In this work, starting from the general DA theory, we establish the generalization bound for the setting of OCDA. Built upon this, we argue that conventional OCDA approaches may substantially underestimate the inherent variance inside the compound target domains for model generalization. We subsequently present Stochastic Compound Mixing (SCMix), an augmentation strategy with the primary objective of mitigating the divergence between source and mixed target distributions. We provide theoretical analysis to substantiate the superiority of SCMix and prove that the previous methods are sub-groups of our methods. Extensive experiments show that our method attains a lower empirical risk on OCDA semantic segmentation tasks, thus supporting our theories. Combining the transformer architecture, SCMix achieves a notable performance boost compared to the SoTA results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengfei Li, Ziyue Ma, Hong Wang, Juan Deng, Yan Wang, Zhenyu Xu, Feng Yan, Wenjun Tu, Hong Sha</p>
<p>Abstract: Background and Objective: In neurosurgery, fusing clinical images and depth images that can improve the information and details is beneficial to surgery. We found that the registration of face depth images was invalid frequently using existing methods. To abundant traditional image methods with depth information, a method in registering with depth images and traditional clinical images was investigated. Methods: We used the dlib library, a C++ library that could be used in face recognition, and recognized the key points on faces from the structure light camera and CT image. The two key point clouds were registered for coarse registration by the ICP method. Fine registration was finished after coarse registration by the ICP method. Results: RMSE after coarse and fine registration is as low as 0.995913 mm. Compared with traditional methods, it also takes less time. Conclusions: The new method successfully registered the facial depth image from structure light images and CT with a low error, and that would be promising and efficient in clinical application of neurosurgery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaobo Yang, Xiaojin Gong</p>
<p>Abstract: This work presents a tuning-free semantic segmentation framework based on classifying SAM masks by CLIP, which is universally applicable to various types of supervision. Initially, we utilize CLIP's zero-shot classification ability to generate pseudo-labels or perform open-vocabulary segmentation. However, the misalignment between mask and CLIP text embeddings leads to suboptimal results. To address this issue, we propose discrimination-bias aligned CLIP to closely align mask and text embedding, offering an overhead-free performance gain. We then construct a global-local consistent classifier to classify SAM masks, which reveals the intrinsic structure of high-quality embeddings produced by DBA-CLIP and demonstrates robustness against noisy pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments validate the efficiency and effectiveness of our method, and we achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) or competitive performance across various datasets and supervision types.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenglong Liu, Haoran Wei, Jinyue Chen, Lingyu Kong, Zheng Ge, Zining Zhu, Liang Zhao, Jianjian Sun, Chunrui Han, Xiangyu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern LVLMs still struggle to achieve fine-grained document understanding, such as OCR/translation/caption for regions of interest to the user, tasks that require the context of the entire page, or even multiple pages. Accordingly, this paper proposes Fox, an effective pipeline, hybrid data, and tuning strategy, that catalyzes LVLMs to focus anywhere on single/multi-page documents. We introduce a novel task to boost the document understanding by making LVLMs focus attention on the document-level region, such as redefining full-page OCR as foreground focus. We employ multiple vision vocabularies to extract visual hybrid knowledge for interleaved document pages (e.g., a page containing a photo). Meanwhile, we render cross-vocabulary vision data as the catalyzer to achieve a full reaction of multiple visual vocabularies and in-document figure understanding. Further, without modifying the weights of multiple vision vocabularies, the above catalyzed fine-grained understanding capabilities can be efficiently tuned to multi-page documents, enabling the model to focus anywhere in both format-free and page-free manners. Besides, we build a benchmark including 9 fine-grained sub-tasks (e.g., region-level OCR/summary, color-guided OCR) to promote document analysis in the community. The experimental results verify the superiority of our model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Paulina Tomaszewska, Mateusz Sperkowski, Przemys{\l}aw Biecek</p>
<p>Abstract: The development of Artificial Intelligence for healthcare is of great importance. Models can sometimes achieve even superior performance to human experts, however, they can reason based on spurious features. This is not acceptable to the experts as it is expected that the models catch the valid patterns in the data following domain expertise. In the work, we analyse whether Deep Learning (DL) models for vision follow the histopathologists' practice so that when diagnosing a part of a lesion, they take into account also the surrounding tissues which serve as context. It turns out that the performance of DL models significantly decreases when the amount of contextual information is limited, therefore contextual information is valuable at prediction time. Moreover, we show that the models sometimes behave in an unstable way as for some images, they change the predictions many times depending on the size of the context. It may suggest that partial contextual information can be misleading.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14312">Improving Gloss-free Sign Language Translation by Reducing Representation Density</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinhui Ye, Xing Wang, Wenxiang Jiao, Junwei Liang, Hui Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: Gloss-free sign language translation (SLT) aims to develop well-performing SLT systems with no requirement for the costly gloss annotations, but currently still lags behind gloss-based approaches significantly. In this paper, we identify a representation density problem that could be a bottleneck in restricting the performance of gloss-free SLT. Specifically, the representation density problem describes that the visual representations of semantically distinct sign gestures tend to be closely packed together in feature space, which makes gloss-free methods struggle with distinguishing different sign gestures and suffer from a sharp performance drop. To address the representation density problem, we introduce a simple but effective contrastive learning strategy, namely SignCL, which encourages gloss-free models to learn more discriminative feature representation in a self-supervised manner. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed SignCL can significantly reduce the representation density and improve performance across various translation frameworks. Specifically, SignCL achieves a significant improvement in BLEU score for the Sign Language Transformer and GFSLT-VLP on the CSL-Daily dataset by 39% and 46%, respectively, without any increase of model parameters. Compared to Sign2GPT, a state-of-the-art method based on large-scale pre-trained vision and language models, SignCL achieves better performance with only 35% of its parameters.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoran Chen, Micah Goldblum, Zuxuan Wu, Yu-Gang Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual learning, also known as lifelong learning or incremental learning, refers to the process by which a model learns from a stream of incoming data over time. A common problem in continual learning is the classification layer's bias towards the most recent task. Traditionally, methods have relied on incorporating data from past tasks during training to mitigate this issue. However, the recent shift in continual learning to memory-free environments has rendered these approaches infeasible. In this study, we propose a solution focused on the testing phase. We first introduce a simple Out-of-Task Detection method, OTD, designed to accurately identify samples from past tasks during testing. Leveraging OTD, we then propose: (1) an Adaptive Retention mechanism for dynamically tuning the classifier layer on past task data; (2) an Adaptive Correction mechanism for revising predictions when the model classifies data from previous tasks into classes from the current task. We name our approach Adaptive Retention & Correction (ARC). While designed for memory-free environments, ARC also proves effective in memory-based settings. Extensive experiments show that our proposed method can be plugged in to virtually any existing continual learning approach without requiring any modifications to its training procedure. Specifically, when integrated with state-of-the-art approaches, ARC achieves an average performance increase of 2.7% and 2.6% on the CIFAR-100 and Imagenet-R datasets, respectively.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14325">Dinomaly: The Less Is More Philosophy in Multi-Class Unsupervised Anomaly Detection</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jia Guo, Shuai Lu, Weihang Zhang, Huiqi Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies highlighted a practical setting of unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) that builds a unified model for multi-class images, serving as an alternative to the conventional one-class-one-model setup. Despite various advancements addressing this challenging task, the detection performance under the multi-class setting still lags far behind state-of-the-art class-separated models. Our research aims to bridge this substantial performance gap. In this paper, we introduce a minimalistic reconstruction-based anomaly detection framework, namely Dinomaly, which leverages pure Transformer architectures without relying on complex designs, additional modules, or specialized tricks. Given this powerful framework consisted of only Attentions and MLPs, we found four simple components that are essential to multi-class anomaly detection: (1) Foundation Transformers that extracts universal and discriminative features, (2) Noisy Bottleneck where pre-existing Dropouts do all the noise injection tricks, (3) Linear Attention that naturally cannot focus, and (4) Loose Reconstruction that does not force layer-to-layer and point-by-point reconstruction. Extensive experiments are conducted across three popular anomaly detection benchmarks including MVTec-AD, VisA, and the recently released Real-IAD. Our proposed Dinomaly achieves impressive image AUROC of 99.6%, 98.7%, and 89.3% on the three datasets respectively, which is not only superior to state-of-the-art multi-class UAD methods, but also surpasses the most advanced class-separated UAD records.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mateusz Pach, Dawid Rymarczyk, Koryna Lewandowska, Jacek Tabor, Bartosz Zieli\'nski</p>
<p>Abstract: Prototypical parts networks combine the power of deep learning with the explainability of case-based reasoning to make accurate, interpretable decisions. They follow the this looks like that reasoning, representing each prototypical part with patches from training images. However, a single image patch comprises multiple visual features, such as color, shape, and texture, making it difficult for users to identify which feature is important to the model.
  To reduce this ambiguity, we introduce the Lucid Prototypical Parts Network (LucidPPN), a novel prototypical parts network that separates color prototypes from other visual features. Our method employs two reasoning branches: one for non-color visual features, processing grayscale images, and another focusing solely on color information. This separation allows us to clarify whether the model's decisions are based on color, shape, or texture. Additionally, LucidPPN identifies prototypical parts corresponding to semantic parts of classified objects, making comparisons between data classes more intuitive, e.g., when two bird species might differ primarily in belly color.
  Our experiments demonstrate that the two branches are complementary and together achieve results comparable to baseline methods. More importantly, LucidPPN generates less ambiguous prototypical parts, enhancing user understanding.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14334">Hierarchical Salient Patch Identification for Interpretable Fundus Disease Localization</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yitao Peng, Lianghua He, Die Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: With the widespread application of deep learning technology in medical image analysis, how to effectively explain model decisions and improve diagnosis accuracy has become an urgent problem that needs to be solved. Attribution methods have become a key tool to help doctors better understand the diagnostic basis of models, and they are used to explain and localize diseases in medical images. However, previous methods suffer from inaccurate and incomplete localization problems for fundus diseases with complex and diverse structures. In order to solve the above problems, we propose a weakly supervised interpretable fundus disease localization method hierarchical salient patch identification (HSPI), which can achieve interpretable disease localization using only image-level labels and neural network classifiers. First, we proposed salient patch identification (SPI), which divides the image into several patches and optimizes consistency loss to identify which patch in the input image is most important for decision-making to locate the disease. Secondly, we propose a hierarchical identification strategy to force SPI to analyze the importance of different areas to neural network classifiers decision-making to comprehensively locate disease areas. Then, we introduced conditional peak focusing to ensure that the mask vector can accurately locate the decision area. Finally, we also propose patch selection based on multi-size intersection to filter out incorrectly or additionally identified non-disease regions. We conduct disease localization experiments on medical image datasets and achieve the best performance on multiple evaluation metrics compared with previous interpretable attribution methods. We performed additional ablation studies to verify the effectiveness of each method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiuming Liu, Jinru Han, Lihao Liu, Angelica I. Aviles-Rivero, Chaokang Jiang, Zhe Liu, Hesheng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Point cloud videos effectively capture real-world spatial geometries and temporal dynamics, which are essential for enabling intelligent agents to understand the dynamically changing 3D world we live in. Although static 3D point cloud processing has witnessed significant advancements, designing an effective 4D point cloud video backbone remains challenging, mainly due to the irregular and unordered distribution of points and temporal inconsistencies across frames. Moreover, recent state-of-the-art 4D backbones predominantly rely on transformer-based architectures, which commonly suffer from large computational costs due to their quadratic complexity, particularly when processing long video sequences. To address these challenges, we propose a novel 4D point cloud video understanding backbone based on the recently advanced State Space Models (SSMs). Specifically, our backbone begins by disentangling space and time in raw 4D sequences, and then establishing spatio-temporal correlations using our newly developed Intra-frame Spatial Mamba and Inter-frame Temporal Mamba blocks. The Intra-frame Spatial Mamba module is designed to encode locally similar or related geometric structures within a certain temporal searching stride, which can effectively capture short-term dynamics. Subsequently, these locally correlated tokens are delivered to the Inter-frame Temporal Mamba module, which globally integrates point features across the entire video with linear complexity, further establishing long-range motion dependencies. Experimental results on human action recognition and 4D semantic segmentation tasks demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method. Especially, for long video sequences, our proposed Mamba-based method has an 87.5% GPU memory reduction, 5.36 times speed-up, and much higher accuracy (up to +10.4%) compared with transformer-based counterparts on MSR-Action3D dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiheng Feng, Wenhua Wu, Hesheng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Road surface reconstruction plays a crucial role in autonomous driving, which can be used for road lane perception and autolabeling tasks. Recently, mesh-based road surface reconstruction algorithms show promising reconstruction results. However, these mesh-based methods suffer from slow speed and poor rendering quality. In contrast, the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) shows superior rendering speed and quality. Although 3DGS employs explicit Gaussian spheres to represent the scene, it lacks the ability to directly represent the geometric information of the scene. To address this limitation, we propose a novel large-scale road surface reconstruction approach based on 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS), named RoGS. The geometric shape of the road is explicitly represented using 2D Gaussian surfels, where each surfel stores color, semantics, and geometric information. Compared to Gaussian spheres, the Gaussian surfels aligns more closely with the physical reality of the road. Distinct from previous initialization methods that rely on point clouds for Gaussian spheres, we introduce a trajectory-based initialization for Gaussian surfels. Thanks to the explicit representation of the Gaussian surfels and a good initialization, our method achieves a significant acceleration while improving reconstruction quality. We achieve excellent results in reconstruction of roads surfaces in a variety of challenging real-world scenes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lingshun Kong, Jiangxin Dong, Ming-Hsuan Yang, Jinshan Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved excellent performance in image restoration. ViTs typically yield superior results in image restoration compared to CNNs due to their ability to capture long-range dependencies and input-dependent characteristics. However, the computational complexity of Transformer-based models grows quadratically with the image resolution, limiting their practical appeal in high-resolution image restoration tasks. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective visual state space model (EVSSM) for image deblurring, leveraging the benefits of state space models (SSMs) to visual data. In contrast to existing methods that employ several fixed-direction scanning for feature extraction, which significantly increases the computational cost, we develop an efficient visual scan block that applies various geometric transformations before each SSM-based module, capturing useful non-local information and maintaining high efficiency. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed EVSSM performs favorably against state-of-the-art image deblurring methods on benchmark datasets and real-captured images.</p>

<p>Abstract: Learning invariant representations has been the longstanding approach to self-supervised learning. However, recently progress has been made in preserving equivariant properties in representations, yet do so with highly prescribed architectures. In this work, we propose an invariant-equivariant self-supervised architecture that employs Capsule Networks (CapsNets) which have been shown to capture equivariance with respect to novel viewpoints. We demonstrate that the use of CapsNets in equivariant self-supervised architectures achieves improved downstream performance on equivariant tasks with higher efficiency and fewer network parameters. To accommodate the architectural changes of CapsNets, we introduce a new objective function based on entropy minimisation. This approach, which we name CapsIE (Capsule Invariant Equivariant Network), achieves state-of-the-art performance across all invariant and equivariant downstream tasks on the 3DIEBench dataset, while outperforming supervised baselines. Our results demonstrate the ability of CapsNets to learn complex and generalised representations for large-scale, multi-task datasets compared to previous CapsNet benchmarks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Supreeth Mysore Venkatesh, Antonio Macaluso, Marlon Nuske, Matthias Klusch, Andreas Dengel</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantum computing is expected to transform a range of computational tasks beyond the reach of classical algorithms. In this work, we examine the application of variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) for unsupervised image segmentation to partition images into separate semantic regions. Specifically, we formulate the task as a graph cut optimization problem and employ two established qubit-efficient VQAs, which we refer to as Parametric Gate Encoding (PGE) and Ancilla Basis Encoding (ABE), to find the optimal segmentation mask. In addition, we propose Adaptive Cost Encoding (ACE), a new approach that leverages the same circuit architecture as ABE but adopts a problem-dependent cost function. We benchmark PGE, ABE and ACE on synthetically generated images, focusing on quality and trainability. ACE shows consistently faster convergence in training the parameterized quantum circuits in comparison to PGE and ABE. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis of the scalability of these approaches against the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), showing a significant cutback in the quantum resources, especially in the number of qubits that logarithmically depends on the number of pixels. The results validate the strengths of ACE, while concurrently highlighting its inherent limitations and challenges. This paves way for further research in quantum-enhanced computer vision.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Moises Diaz, Miguel A. Ferrer, Soodamani Ramalingam, Richard Guest</p>
<p>Abstract: In automatic signature verification, questioned specimens are usually compared with reference signatures. In writer-dependent schemes, a number of reference signatures are required to build up the individual signer model while a writer-independent system requires a set of reference signatures from several signers to develop the model of the system. This paper addresses the problem of automatic signature verification when no reference signatures are available. The scenario we explore consists of a set of signatures, which could be signed by the same author or by multiple signers. As such, we discuss three methods which estimate automatically the common authorship of a set of off-line signatures. The first method develops a score similarity matrix, worked out with the assistance of duplicated signatures; the second uses a feature-distance matrix for each pair of signatures; and the last method introduces pre-classification based on the complexity of each signature. Publicly available signatures were used in the experiments, which gave encouraging results. As a baseline for the performance obtained by our approaches, we carried out a visual Turing Test where forensic and non-forensic human volunteers, carrying out the same task, performed less well than the automatic schemes.</p>

<p>Abstract: Field-captured video allows for detailed studies of spatiotemporal aspects of animal locomotion, decision-making, and environmental interactions. However, despite the affordability of data capture with mass-produced hardware, storage, processing, and transmission overheads pose a significant hurdle to acquiring high-resolution video from field-deployed camera traps. Therefore, efficient compression algorithms are crucial for monitoring with camera traps that have limited access to power, storage, and bandwidth. In this article, we introduce a new motion analysis-based video compression algorithm designed to run on camera trap devices. We implemented and tested this algorithm using a case study of insect-pollinator motion tracking. The algorithm identifies and stores only image regions depicting motion relevant to pollination monitoring, reducing the overall data size by an average of 84% across a diverse set of test datasets while retaining the information necessary for relevant behavioural analysis. The methods outlined in this paper facilitate the broader application of computer vision-enabled, low-powered camera trap devices for remote, in-situ video-based animal motion monitoring.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiannan Wang, Jiarui Fang, Aoyu Li, PengCheng Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces PipeFusion, a novel approach that harnesses multi-GPU parallelism to address the high computational and latency challenges of generating high-resolution images with diffusion transformers (DiT) models. PipeFusion splits images into patches and distributes the network layers across multiple devices. It employs a pipeline parallel manner to orchestrate communication and computations. By leveraging the high similarity between the input from adjacent diffusion steps, PipeFusion eliminates the waiting time in the pipeline by reusing the one-step stale feature maps to provide context for the current step. Our experiments demonstrate that it can generate higher image resolution where existing DiT parallel approaches meet OOM. PipeFusion significantly reduces the required communication bandwidth, enabling DiT inference to be hosted on GPUs connected via PCIe rather than the more costly NVLink infrastructure, which substantially lowers the overall operational expenses for serving DiT models.

<p>Abstract: Despite the recent progress in medical image segmentation with scribble-based annotations, the segmentation results of most models are still not ro-bust and generalizable enough in open environments. Evidential deep learn-ing (EDL) has recently been proposed as a promising solution to model predictive uncertainty and improve the reliability of medical image segmen-tation. However directly applying EDL to scribble-supervised medical im-age segmentation faces a tradeoff between accuracy and reliability. To ad-dress the challenge, we propose a novel framework called Dual-Branch Evi-dential Deep Learning (DuEDL). Firstly, the decoder of the segmentation network is changed to two different branches, and the evidence of the two branches is fused to generate high-quality pseudo-labels. Then the frame-work applies partial evidence loss and two-branch consistent loss for joint training of the model to adapt to the scribble supervision learning. The pro-posed method was tested on two cardiac datasets: ACDC and MSCMRseg. The results show that our method significantly enhances the reliability and generalization ability of the model without sacrificing accuracy, outper-forming state-of-the-art baselines.

<p>Abstract: Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) excels in photo-realistically static scenes, inspiring numerous efforts to facilitate volumetric videos. However, rendering dynamic and long-sequence radiance fields remains challenging due to the significant data required to represent volumetric videos. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end joint optimization scheme of dynamic NeRF representation and compression, called JointRF, thus achieving significantly improved quality and compression efficiency against the previous methods. Specifically, JointRF employs a compact residual feature grid and a coefficient feature grid to represent the dynamic NeRF. This representation handles large motions without compromising quality while concurrently diminishing temporal redundancy. We also introduce a sequential feature compression subnetwork to further reduce spatial-temporal redundancy. Finally, the representation and compression subnetworks are end-to-end trained combined within the JointRF. Extensive experiments demonstrate that JointRF can achieve superior compression performance across various datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Teng Xu, Jiamin Chen, Peng Chen, Youjia Zhang, Junqing Yu, Wei Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Editing objects within a scene is a critical functionality required across a broad spectrum of applications in computer vision and graphics. As 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) emerges as a frontier in scene representation, the effective modification of 3D Gaussian scenes has become increasingly vital. This process entails accurately retrieve the target objects and subsequently performing modifications based on instructions. Though available in pieces, existing techniques mainly embed sparse semantics into Gaussians for retrieval, and rely on an iterative dataset update paradigm for editing, leading to over-smoothing or inconsistency issues. To this end, this paper proposes a systematic approach, namely TIGER, for coherent text-instructed 3D Gaussian retrieval and editing. In contrast to the top-down language grounding approach for 3D Gaussians, we adopt a bottom-up language aggregation strategy to generate a denser language embedded 3D Gaussians that supports open-vocabulary retrieval. To overcome the over-smoothing and inconsistency issues in editing, we propose a Coherent Score Distillation (CSD) that aggregates a 2D image editing diffusion model and a multi-view diffusion model for score distillation, producing multi-view consistent editing with much finer details. In various experiments, we demonstrate that our TIGER is able to accomplish more consistent and realistic edits than prior work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ao Wang, Hui Chen, Lihao Liu, Kai Chen, Zijia Lin, Jungong Han, Guiguang Ding</p>
<p>Abstract: Over the past years, YOLOs have emerged as the predominant paradigm in the field of real-time object detection owing to their effective balance between computational cost and detection performance. Researchers have explored the architectural designs, optimization objectives, data augmentation strategies, and others for YOLOs, achieving notable progress. However, the reliance on the non-maximum suppression (NMS) for post-processing hampers the end-to-end deployment of YOLOs and adversely impacts the inference latency. Besides, the design of various components in YOLOs lacks the comprehensive and thorough inspection, resulting in noticeable computational redundancy and limiting the model's capability. It renders the suboptimal efficiency, along with considerable potential for performance improvements. In this work, we aim to further advance the performance-efficiency boundary of YOLOs from both the post-processing and model architecture. To this end, we first present the consistent dual assignments for NMS-free training of YOLOs, which brings competitive performance and low inference latency simultaneously. Moreover, we introduce the holistic efficiency-accuracy driven model design strategy for YOLOs. We comprehensively optimize various components of YOLOs from both efficiency and accuracy perspectives, which greatly reduces the computational overhead and enhances the capability. The outcome of our effort is a new generation of YOLO series for real-time end-to-end object detection, dubbed YOLOv10. Extensive experiments show that YOLOv10 achieves state-of-the-art performance and efficiency across various model scales. For example, our YOLOv10-S is 1.8$\times$ faster than RT-DETR-R18 under the similar AP on COCO, meanwhile enjoying 2.8$\times$ smaller number of parameters and FLOPs. Compared with YOLOv9-C, YOLOv10-B has 46\% less latency and 25\% fewer parameters for the same performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Kienzle, Marco Kantonis, Robin Sch\"on, Rainer Lienhart</p>
<p>Abstract: Utilizing transformer architectures for semantic segmentation of high-resolution images is hindered by the attention's quadratic computational complexity in the number of tokens. A solution to this challenge involves decreasing the number of tokens through token merging, which has exhibited remarkable enhancements in inference speed, training efficiency, and memory utilization for image classification tasks. In this paper, we explore various token merging strategies within the framework of the Segformer architecture and perform experiments on multiple semantic segmentation and human pose estimation datasets. Notably, without model re-training, we, for example, achieve an inference acceleration of 61% on the Cityscapes dataset while maintaining the mIoU performance. Consequently, this paper facilitates the deployment of transformer-based architectures on resource-constrained devices and in real-time applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruiyuan Gao, Kai Chen, Zhihao Li, Lanqing Hong, Zhenguo Li, Qiang Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: While controllable generative models for images and videos have achieved remarkable success, high-quality models for 3D scenes, particularly in unbounded scenarios like autonomous driving, remain underdeveloped due to high data acquisition costs. In this paper, we introduce MagicDrive3D, a novel pipeline for controllable 3D street scene generation that supports multi-condition control, including BEV maps, 3D objects, and text descriptions. Unlike previous methods that reconstruct before training the generative models, MagicDrive3D first trains a video generation model and then reconstructs from the generated data. This innovative approach enables easily controllable generation and static scene acquisition, resulting in high-quality scene reconstruction. To address the minor errors in generated content, we propose deformable Gaussian splatting with monocular depth initialization and appearance modeling to manage exposure discrepancies across viewpoints. Validated on the nuScenes dataset, MagicDrive3D generates diverse, high-quality 3D driving scenes that support any-view rendering and enhance downstream tasks like BEV segmentation. Our results demonstrate the framework's superior performance, showcasing its transformative potential for autonomous driving simulation and beyond.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lv Tang, HaoKe Xiao, Peng-Tao Jiang, Hao Zhang, Jinwei Chen, Bo Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundational models have significantly advanced in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), with the Transformer architecture becoming a standard backbone. However, the Transformer's quadratic complexity poses challenges for handling longer sequences and higher resolution images. To address this challenge, State Space Models (SSMs) like Mamba have emerged as efficient alternatives, initially matching Transformer performance in NLP tasks and later surpassing Vision Transformers (ViTs) in various CV tasks. To improve the performance of SSMs, one crucial aspect is effective serialization of image patches. Existing methods, relying on linear scanning curves, often fail to capture complex spatial relationships and produce repetitive patterns, leading to biases. To address these limitations, we propose using fractal scanning curves for patch serialization. Fractal curves maintain high spatial proximity and adapt to different image resolutions, avoiding redundancy and enhancing SSMs' ability to model complex patterns accurately. We validate our method in image classification, detection, and segmentation tasks, and the superior performance validates its effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Sohail Danish, Muhammad Haris Khan, Muhammad Akhtar Munir, M. Saquib Sarfraz, Mohsen Ali</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we tackle the problem of domain generalization for object detection, specifically focusing on the scenario where only a single source domain is available. We propose an effective approach that involves two key steps: diversifying the source domain and aligning detections based on class prediction confidence and localization. Firstly, we demonstrate that by carefully selecting a set of augmentations, a base detector can outperform existing methods for single domain generalization by a good margin. This highlights the importance of domain diversification in improving the performance of object detectors. Secondly, we introduce a method to align detections from multiple views, considering both classification and localization outputs. This alignment procedure leads to better generalized and well-calibrated object detector models, which are crucial for accurate decision-making in safety-critical applications. Our approach is detector-agnostic and can be seamlessly applied to both single-stage and two-stage detectors. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods, we conduct extensive experiments and ablations on challenging domain-shift scenarios. The results consistently demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to existing methods. Our code and models are available at: https://github.com/msohaildanish/DivAlign</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuanle Zhao, Yue Sun, Tielin Zhang, Bo Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Spatiotemporal prediction plays an important role in solving natural problems and processing video frames, especially in weather forecasting and human action recognition. Recent advances attempt to incorporate prior physical knowledge into the deep learning framework to estimate the unknown governing partial differential equations (PDEs), which have shown promising results in spatiotemporal prediction tasks. However, previous approaches only restrict neural network architectures or loss functions to acquire physical or PDE features, which decreases the representative capacity of a neural network. Meanwhile, the updating process of the physical state cannot be effectively estimated. To solve the above mentioned problems, this paper proposes a physical-guided neural network, which utilizes the frequency-enhanced Fourier module and moment loss to strengthen the model's ability to estimate the spatiotemporal dynamics. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive second-order Runge-Kutta method with physical constraints to model the physical states more precisely. We evaluate our model on both spatiotemporal and video prediction tasks. The experimental results show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods and performs best in several datasets, with a much smaller parameter count.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zuoyong Li, Qinghua Lin, Haoyi Fan, Tiesong Zhao, David Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Semi-supervised learning suffers from the imbalance of labeled and unlabeled training data in the video surveillance scenario. In this paper, we propose a new semi-supervised learning method called SIAVC for industrial accident video classification. Specifically, we design a video augmentation module called the Super Augmentation Block (SAB). SAB adds Gaussian noise and randomly masks video frames according to historical loss on the unlabeled data for model optimization. Then, we propose a Video Cross-set Augmentation Module (VCAM) to generate diverse pseudo-label samples from the high-confidence unlabeled samples, which alleviates the mismatch of sampling experience and provides high-quality training data. Additionally, we construct a new industrial accident surveillance video dataset with frame-level annotation, namely ECA9, to evaluate our proposed method. Compared with the state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning based methods, SIAVC demonstrates outstanding video classification performance, achieving 88.76\% and 89.13\% accuracy on ECA9 and Fire Detection datasets, respectively. The source code and the constructed dataset ECA9 will be released in \url{https://github.com/AlchemyEmperor/SIAVC}.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14516">Towards Realistic Long-tailed Semi-supervised Learning in an Open World</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuanpeng He, Lijian Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Open-world long-tailed semi-supervised learning (OLSSL) has increasingly attracted attention. However, existing OLSSL algorithms generally assume that the distributions between known and novel categories are nearly identical. Against this backdrop, we construct a more \emph{Realistic Open-world Long-tailed Semi-supervised Learning} (\textbf{ROLSSL}) setting where there is no premise on the distribution relationships between known and novel categories. Furthermore, even within the known categories, the number of labeled samples is significantly smaller than that of the unlabeled samples, as acquiring valid annotations is often prohibitively costly in the real world. Under the proposed ROLSSL setting, we propose a simple yet potentially effective solution called dual-stage post-hoc logit adjustments. The proposed approach revisits the logit adjustment strategy by considering the relationships among the frequency of samples, the total number of categories, and the overall size of data. Then, it estimates the distribution of unlabeled data for both known and novel categories to dynamically readjust the corresponding predictive probabilities, effectively mitigating category bias during the learning of known and novel classes with more selective utilization of imbalanced unlabeled data. Extensive experiments on datasets such as CIFAR100 and ImageNet100 have demonstrated performance improvements of up to 50.1\%, validating the superiority of our proposed method and establishing a strong baseline for this task.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingguang Jiang, Xiaofeng Bian, Chenggang Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Depth estimation based on stereo matching is a classic but popular computer vision problem, which has a wide range of real-world applications. Current stereo matching methods generally adopt the deep Siamese neural network architecture, and have achieved impressing performance by constructing feature matching cost volumes and using 3D convolutions for cost aggregation. However, most existing methods suffer from large number of parameters and slow running time due to the sequential use of 3D convolutions. In this paper, we propose Ghost-Stereo, a novel end-to-end stereo matching network. The feature extraction part of the network uses the GhostNet to form a U-shaped structure. The core of Ghost-Stereo is a GhostNet feature-based cost volume enhancement (Ghost-CVE) module and a GhostNet-inspired lightweight cost volume aggregation (Ghost-CVA) module. For the Ghost-CVE part, cost volumes are constructed and fused by the GhostNet-based features to enhance the spatial context awareness. For the Ghost-CVA part, a lightweight 3D convolution bottleneck block based on the GhostNet is proposed to reduce the computational complexity in this module. By combining with the context and geometry fusion module, a classical hourglass-shaped cost volume aggregate structure is constructed. Ghost-Stereo achieves a comparable performance than state-of-the-art real-time methods on several publicly benchmarks, and shows a better generalization ability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simon Damm, Mike Laszkiewicz, Johannes Lederer, Asja Fischer</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal foundation models have set new standards in few-shot anomaly detection. This paper explores whether high-quality visual features alone are sufficient to rival existing state-of-the-art vision-language models. We affirm this by adapting DINOv2 for one-shot and few-shot anomaly detection, with a focus on industrial applications. We show that this approach does not only rival existing techniques but can even outmatch them in many settings. Our proposed vision-only approach, AnomalyDINO, is based on patch similarities and enables both image-level anomaly prediction and pixel-level anomaly segmentation. The approach is methodologically simple and training-free and, thus, does not require any additional data for fine-tuning or meta-learning. Despite its simplicity, AnomalyDINO achieves state-of-the-art results in one- and few-shot anomaly detection (e.g., pushing the one-shot performance on MVTec-AD from an AUROC of 93.1% to 96.6%). The reduced overhead, coupled with its outstanding few-shot performance, makes AnomalyDINO a strong candidate for fast deployment, for example, in industrial contexts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinran Nicole Han, Todd Zickler, Ko Nishino</p>
<p>Abstract: Models for monocular shape reconstruction of surfaces with diffuse reflection -- shape from shading -- ought to produce distributions of outputs, because there are fundamental mathematical ambiguities of both continuous (e.g., bas-relief) and discrete (e.g., convex/concave) varieties which are also experienced by humans. Yet, the outputs of current models are limited to point estimates or tight distributions around single modes, which prevent them from capturing these effects. We introduce a model that reconstructs a multimodal distribution of shapes from a single shading image, which aligns with the human experience of multistable perception. We train a small denoising diffusion process to generate surface normal fields from $16\times 16$ patches of synthetic images of everyday 3D objects. We deploy this model patch-wise at multiple scales, with guidance from inter-patch shape consistency constraints. Despite its relatively small parameter count and predominantly bottom-up structure, we show that multistable shape explanations emerge from this model for ''ambiguous'' test images that humans experience as being multistable. At the same time, the model produces veridical shape estimates for object-like images that include distinctive occluding contours and appear less ambiguous. This may inspire new architectures for stochastic 3D shape perception that are more efficient and better aligned with human experience.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chuanhao Li, Zhen Li, Chenchen Jing, Shuo Liu, Wenqi Shao, Yuwei Wu, Ping Luo, Yu Qiao, Kaipeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are ignorant of the up-to-date knowledge, such as LLaVA series, because they cannot be updated frequently due to the large amount of resources required, and therefore fail in many cases. For example, if a LVLM was released on January 2024, and it wouldn't know the detailed plot of the new movie Dune 2, which wasn't released until February 2024. To solve the problem, a promising solution is to provide LVLMs with up-to-date knowledge via internet search during inference, i.e., internet-augmented generation (IAG), which is already integrated in some closed-source commercial LVLMs such as GPT-4V. However, the specific mechanics underpinning them remain a mystery. In this paper, we propose a plug-and-play framework, for augmenting existing LVLMs in handling visual question answering (VQA) about up-to-date knowledge, dubbed UDKAG. A hierarchical filtering model is trained to effectively and efficiently find the most helpful content from the websites returned by a search engine to prompt LVLMs with up-to-date knowledge. To train the model and evaluate our framework's performance, we propose a pipeline to automatically generate news-related VQA samples to construct a dataset, dubbed UDK-VQA. A multi-model voting mechanism is introduced to label the usefulness of website/content for VQA samples to construct the training set. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, outperforming GPT-4V by about 25% in accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Continuous photoplethysmography (PPG)-based blood pressure monitoring is necessary for healthcare and fitness applications. In Artificial Intelligence (AI), signal classification levels with the machine and deep learning arrangements need to be explored further. Techniques based on time-frequency spectra, such as Short-time Fourier Transform (STFT), have been used to address the challenges of motion artifact correction. Therefore, the proposed study works with PPG signals of more than 200 patients (650+ signal samples) with hypertension, using STFT with various Neural Networks (Convolution Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM), followed by machine learning classifiers, such as, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF). The classification has been done for two categories: Prehypertension (normal levels) and Hypertension (includes Stage I and Stage II). Various performance metrics have been obtained with two batch sizes of 3 and 16 for the fusion of the neural networks. With precision and specificity of 100% and recall of 82.1%, the LSTM model provides the best results among all combinations of Neural Networks. However, the maximum accuracy of 71.9% is achieved by the LSTM-CNN model. Further stacked Ensemble method has been used to achieve 100% accuracy for Meta-LSTM-RF, Meta- LSTM-CNN-RF and Meta- STFT-CNN-SVM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Loris Giulivi, Giacomo Boracchi</p>
<p>Abstract: Advances in multi-modal embeddings, and in particular CLIP, have recently driven several breakthroughs in Computer Vision (CV). CLIP has shown impressive performance on a variety of tasks, yet, its inherently opaque architecture may hinder the application of models employing CLIP as backbone, especially in fields where trust and model explainability are imperative, such as in the medical domain. Current explanation methodologies for CV models rely on Saliency Maps computed through gradient analysis or input perturbation. However, these Saliency Maps can only be computed to explain classes relevant to the end task, often smaller in scope than the backbone training classes. In the context of models implementing CLIP as their vision backbone, a substantial portion of the information embedded within the learned representations is thus left unexplained.
  In this work, we propose Concept Visualization (ConVis), a novel saliency methodology that explains the CLIP embedding of an image by exploiting the multi-modal nature of the embeddings. ConVis makes use of lexical information from WordNet to compute task-agnostic Saliency Maps for any concept, not limited to concepts the end model was trained on. We validate our use of WordNet via an out of distribution detection experiment, and test ConVis on an object localization benchmark, showing that Concept Visualizations correctly identify and localize the image's semantic content. Additionally, we perform a user study demonstrating that our methodology can give users insight on the model's functioning.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce PoseCrafter, a one-shot method for personalized video generation following the control of flexible poses. Built upon Stable Diffusion and ControlNet, we carefully design an inference process to produce high-quality videos without the corresponding ground-truth frames. First, we select an appropriate reference frame from the training video and invert it to initialize all latent variables for generation. Then, we insert the corresponding training pose into the target pose sequences to enhance faithfulness through a trained temporal attention module. Furthermore, to alleviate the face and hand degradation resulting from discrepancies between poses of training videos and inference poses, we implement simple latent editing through an affine transformation matrix involving facial and hand landmarks. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate that PoseCrafter achieves superior results to baselines pre-trained on a vast collection of videos under 8 commonly used metrics. Besides, PoseCrafter can follow poses from different individuals or artificial edits and simultaneously retain the human identity in an open-domain training video.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mariusz Wi\'sniewski, Loris Giulivi, Giacomo Boracchi</p>
<p>Abstract: For more than a decade, deep learning models have been dominating in various 2D imaging tasks. Their application is now extending to 3D imaging, with 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D CNNs) being able to process LIDAR, MRI, and CT scans, with significant implications for fields such as autonomous driving and medical imaging. In these critical settings, explaining the model's decisions is fundamental. Despite recent advances in Explainable Artificial Intelligence, however, little effort has been devoted to explaining 3D CNNs, and many works explain these models via inadequate extensions of 2D saliency methods.
  One fundamental limitation to the development of 3D saliency methods is the lack of a benchmark to quantitatively assess them on 3D data. To address this issue, we propose SE3D: a framework for Saliency method Evaluation in 3D imaging. We propose modifications to ShapeNet, ScanNet, and BraTS datasets, and evaluation metrics to assess saliency methods for 3D CNNs. We evaluate both state-of-the-art saliency methods designed for 3D data and extensions of popular 2D saliency methods to 3D. Our experiments show that 3D saliency methods do not provide explanations of sufficient quality, and that there is margin for future improvements and safer applications of 3D CNNs in critical fields.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, with the realistic generation results and a wide range of personalized applications, diffusion-based generative models gain huge attention in both visual and audio generation areas. Compared to the considerable advancements of text2image or text2audio generation, research in audio2visual or visual2audio generation has been relatively slow. The recent audio-visual generation methods usually resort to huge large language model or composable diffusion models. Instead of designing another giant model for audio-visual generation, in this paper we take a step back showing a simple and lightweight generative transformer, which is not fully investigated in multi-modal generation, can achieve excellent results on image2audio generation. The transformer operates in the discrete audio and visual Vector-Quantized GAN space, and is trained in the mask denoising manner. After training, the classifier-free guidance could be deployed off-the-shelf achieving better performance, without any extra training or modification. Since the transformer model is modality symmetrical, it could also be directly deployed for audio2image generation and co-generation. In the experiments, we show that our simple method surpasses recent image2audio generation methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tom Fischer, Pascal Peter, Joachim Weickert, Eddy Ilg</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized the field of computer vision by introducing large scale neural networks with millions of parameters. Training these networks requires massive datasets and leads to intransparent models that can fail to generalize. At the other extreme, models designed from partial differential equations (PDEs) embed specialized domain knowledge into mathematical equations and usually rely on few manually chosen hyperparameters. This makes them transparent by construction and if designed and calibrated carefully, they can generalize well to unseen scenarios. In this paper, we show how to bring model- and data-driven approaches together by combining the explicit PDE-based approaches with convolutional neural networks to obtain the best of both worlds. We illustrate a joint architecture for the task of inpainting optical flow fields and show that the combination of model- and data-driven modeling leads to an effective architecture. Our model outperforms both fully explicit and fully data-driven baselines in terms of reconstruction quality, robustness and amount of required training data. Averaging the endpoint error across different mask densities, our method outperforms the explicit baselines by 11-27%, the GAN baseline by 47% and the Probabilisitic Diffusion baseline by 42%. With that, our method sets a new state of the art for inpainting of optical flow fields from random masks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Loris Giulivi, Giacomo Boracchi</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating content across various modalities, such as images and text. However, their interpretability remains a challenge, hindering their adoption in critical applications. This research proposes a novel approach to enhance the interpretability of MLLMs by focusing on the image embedding component. We combine an open-world localization model with a MLLM, thus creating a new architecture able to simultaneously produce text and object localization outputs from the same vision embedding. The proposed architecture greatly promotes interpretability, enabling us to design a novel saliency map to explain any output token, to identify model hallucinations, and to assess model biases through semantic adversarial perturbations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Laura Duarte, Pedro Neto</p>
<p>Abstract: The featured dataset, the Event-based Dataset of Assembly Tasks (EDAT24), showcases a selection of manufacturing primitive tasks (idle, pick, place, and screw), which are basic actions performed by human operators in any manufacturing assembly. The data were captured using a DAVIS240C event camera, an asynchronous vision sensor that registers events when changes in light intensity value occur. Events are a lightweight data format for conveying visual information and are well-suited for real-time detection and analysis of human motion. Each manufacturing primitive has 100 recorded samples of DAVIS240C data, including events and greyscale frames, for a total of 400 samples. In the dataset, the user interacts with objects from the open-source CT-Benchmark in front of the static DAVIS event camera. All data are made available in raw form (.aedat) and in pre-processed form (.npy). Custom-built Python code is made available together with the dataset to aid researchers to add new manufacturing primitives or extend the dataset with more samples.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qijian Zhang, Junhui Hou, Wenping Wang, Ying He</p>
<p>Abstract: Surface parameterization plays an essential role in numerous computer graphics and geometry processing applications. Traditional parameterization approaches are designed for high-quality meshes laboriously created by specialized 3D modelers, thus unable to meet the processing demand for the current explosion of ordinary 3D data. Moreover, their working mechanisms are typically restricted to certain simple topologies, thus relying on cumbersome manual efforts (e.g., surface cutting, part segmentation) for pre-processing. In this paper, we introduce the Flatten Anything Model (FAM), an unsupervised neural architecture to achieve global free-boundary surface parameterization via learning point-wise mappings between 3D points on the target geometric surface and adaptively-deformed UV coordinates within the 2D parameter domain. To mimic the actual physical procedures, we ingeniously construct geometrically-interpretable sub-networks with specific functionalities of surface cutting, UV deforming, unwrapping, and wrapping, which are assembled into a bi-directional cycle mapping framework. Compared with previous methods, our FAM directly operates on discrete surface points without utilizing connectivity information, thus significantly reducing the strict requirements for mesh quality and even applicable to unstructured point cloud data. More importantly, our FAM is fully-automated without the need for pre-cutting and can deal with highly-complex topologies, since its learning process adaptively finds reasonable cutting seams and UV boundaries. Extensive experiments demonstrate the universality, superiority, and inspiring potential of our proposed neural surface parameterization paradigm. The code will be publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanrong Zhang, Zhenting Wang, Tingxu Han, Mingyu Jin, Chenlu Zhan, Mengnan Du, Hongwei Wang, Shiqing Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Existing backdoor attacks that are effective in self-supervised learning often involve noticeable triggers, like colored patches, which are vulnerable to human inspection. In this paper, we propose an imperceptible and effective backdoor attack against self-supervised models. We first find that existing imperceptible triggers designed for supervised learning are not as effective in compromising self-supervised models. We then identify this ineffectiveness is attributed to the overlap in distributions between the backdoor and augmented samples used in self-supervised learning. Building on this insight, we design an attack using optimized triggers that are disentangled to the augmented transformation in the self-supervised learning, while also remaining imperceptible to human vision. Experiments on five datasets and seven SSL algorithms demonstrate our attack is highly effective and stealthy. It also has strong resistance to existing backdoor defenses.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhechao Wang, Peirui Cheng, Mingxin Chen, Pengju Tian, Zhirui Wang, Xinming Li, Xue Yang, Xian Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Collaborative trajectory prediction can comprehensively forecast the future motion of objects through multi-view complementary information. However, it encounters two main challenges in multi-drone collaboration settings. The expansive aerial observations make it difficult to generate precise Bird's Eye View (BEV) representations. Besides, excessive interactions can not meet real-time prediction requirements within the constrained drone-based communication bandwidth. To address these problems, we propose a novel framework named "Drones Help Drones" (DHD). Firstly, we incorporate the ground priors provided by the drone's inclined observation to estimate the distance between objects and drones, leading to more precise BEV generation. Secondly, we design a selective mechanism based on the local feature discrepancy to prioritize the critical information contributing to prediction tasks during inter-drone interactions. Additionally, we create the first dataset for multi-drone collaborative prediction, named "Air-Co-Pred", and conduct quantitative and qualitative experiments to validate the effectiveness of our DHD framework.The results demonstrate that compared to state-of-the-art approaches, DHD reduces position deviation in BEV representations by over 20% and requires only a quarter of the transmission ratio for interactions while achieving comparable prediction performance. Moreover, DHD also shows promising generalization to the collaborative 3D object detection in CoPerception-UAVs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Customizing diffusion models to generate identity-preserving images from user-provided reference images is an intriguing new problem. The prevalent approaches typically require training on extensive domain-specific images to achieve identity preservation, which lacks flexibility across different use cases. To address this issue, we exploit classifier guidance, a training-free technique that steers diffusion models using an existing classifier, for personalized image generation. Our study shows that based on a recent rectified flow framework, the major limitation of vanilla classifier guidance in requiring a special classifier can be resolved with a simple fixed-point solution, allowing flexible personalization with off-the-shelf image discriminators. Moreover, its solving procedure proves to be stable when anchored to a reference flow trajectory, with a convergence guarantee. The derived method is implemented on rectified flow with different off-the-shelf image discriminators, delivering advantageous personalization results for human faces, live subjects, and certain objects.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ting Liu, Xuyang Liu, Liangtao Shi, Zunnan Xu, Siteng Huang, Yi Xin, Quanjun Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a popular approach for adapting pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) models to downstream applications. While current PEFT methods achieve parameter efficiency, they overlook GPU memory and time efficiency during both fine-tuning and inference, due to the repeated computation of redundant tokens in the ViT architecture. This falls short of practical requirements for downstream task adaptation. In this paper, we propose \textbf{Sparse-Tuning}, a novel tuning paradigm that substantially enhances both fine-tuning and inference efficiency for pre-trained ViT models. Sparse-Tuning efficiently fine-tunes the pre-trained ViT by sparsely preserving the informative tokens and merging redundant ones, enabling the ViT to focus on the foreground while reducing computational costs on background regions in the images. To accurately distinguish informative tokens from uninformative ones, we introduce a tailored Dense Adapter, which establishes dense connections across different encoder layers in the ViT, thereby enhancing the representational capacity and quality of token sparsification. Empirical results on VTAB-1K, three complete image datasets, and two complete video datasets demonstrate that Sparse-Tuning reduces the GFLOPs to \textbf{62\%-70\%} of the original ViT-B while achieving state-of-the-art performance.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14701">High Fidelity Scene Text Synthesis</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yibin Wang, Weizhong Zhang, Jianwei Zheng, Cheng Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Scene text synthesis involves rendering specified texts onto arbitrary images. Current methods typically formulate this task in an end-to-end manner but lack effective character-level guidance during training. Besides, their text encoders, pre-trained on a single font type, struggle to adapt to the diverse font styles encountered in practical applications. Consequently, these methods suffer from character distortion, repetition, and absence, particularly in polystylistic scenarios. To this end, this paper proposes DreamText for high-fidelity scene text synthesis. Our key idea is to reconstruct the diffusion training process, introducing more refined guidance tailored to this task, to expose and rectify the model's attention at the character level and strengthen its learning of text regions. This transformation poses a hybrid optimization challenge, involving both discrete and continuous variables. To effectively tackle this challenge, we employ a heuristic alternate optimization strategy. Meanwhile, we jointly train the text encoder and generator to comprehensively learn and utilize the diverse font present in the training dataset. This joint training is seamlessly integrated into the alternate optimization process, fostering a synergistic relationship between learning character embedding and re-estimating character attention. Specifically, in each step, we first encode potential character-generated position information from cross-attention maps into latent character masks. These masks are then utilized to update the representation of specific characters in the current step, which, in turn, enables the generator to correct the character's attention in the subsequent steps. Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate the superiority of our method to the state of the art.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengyue Jia, Yiding Liu, Xiaopeng Li, Xiangyu Zhao, Yuhao Wang, Yantong Du, Xiao Han, Xuetao Wei, Shuaiqiang Wang, Dawei Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Worldwide geolocalization aims to locate the precise location at the coordinate level of photos taken anywhere on the Earth. It is very challenging due to 1) the difficulty of capturing subtle location-aware visual semantics, and 2) the heterogeneous geographical distribution of image data. As a result, existing studies have clear limitations when scaled to a worldwide context. They may easily confuse distant images with similar visual contents, or cannot adapt to various locations worldwide with different amounts of relevant data. To resolve these limitations, we propose G3, a novel framework based on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). In particular, G3 consists of three steps, i.e., Geo-alignment, Geo-diversification, and Geo-verification to optimize both retrieval and generation phases of worldwide geolocalization. During Geo-alignment, our solution jointly learns expressive multi-modal representations for images, GPS and textual descriptions, which allows us to capture location-aware semantics for retrieving nearby images for a given query. During Geo-diversification, we leverage a prompt ensembling method that is robust to inconsistent retrieval performance for different image queries. Finally, we combine both retrieved and generated GPS candidates in Geo-verification for location prediction. Experiments on two well-established datasets IM2GPS3k and YFCC4k verify the superiority of G3 compared to other state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sixian Zhang, Bohan Wang, Junqiang Wu, Yan Li, Tingting Gao, Di Zhang, Zhongyuan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Current metrics for text-to-image models typically rely on statistical metrics which inadequately represent the real preference of humans. Although recent work attempts to learn these preferences via human annotated images, they reduce the rich tapestry of human preference to a single overall score. However, the preference results vary when humans evaluate images with different aspects. Therefore, to learn the multi-dimensional human preferences, we propose the Multi-dimensional Preference Score (MPS), the first multi-dimensional preference scoring model for the evaluation of text-to-image models. The MPS introduces the preference condition module upon CLIP model to learn these diverse preferences. It is trained based on our Multi-dimensional Human Preference (MHP) Dataset, which comprises 918,315 human preference choices across four dimensions (i.e., aesthetics, semantic alignment, detail quality and overall assessment) on 607,541 images. The images are generated by a wide range of latest text-to-image models. The MPS outperforms existing scoring methods across 3 datasets in 4 dimensions, enabling it a promising metric for evaluating and improving text-to-image generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuheng Ge, Haoyu Xing, Li Zhang, Xiangqian Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Creating realistic, natural, and lip-readable talking face videos remains a formidable challenge. Previous research primarily concentrated on generating and aligning single-frame images while overlooking the smoothness of frame-to-frame transitions and temporal dependencies. This often compromised visual quality and effects in practical settings, particularly when handling complex facial data and audio content, which frequently led to semantically incongruent visual illusions. Specifically, synthesized videos commonly featured disorganized lip movements, making them difficult to understand and recognize. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces the application of optical flow to guide facial image generation, enhancing inter-frame continuity and semantic consistency. We propose "OpFlowTalker", a novel approach that utilizes predicted optical flow changes from audio inputs rather than direct image predictions. This method smooths image transitions and aligns changes with semantic content. Moreover, it employs a sequence fusion technique to replace the independent generation of single frames, thus preserving contextual information and maintaining temporal coherence. We also developed an optical flow synchronization module that regulates both full-face and lip movements, optimizing visual synthesis by balancing regional dynamics. Furthermore, we introduce a Visual Text Consistency Score (VTCS) that accurately measures lip-readability in synthesized videos. Extensive empirical evidence validates the effectiveness of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Young Kyun Jang, Ser-nam Lim</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern retrieval systems often struggle with upgrading to new and more powerful models due to the incompatibility of embeddings between the old and new models. This necessitates a costly process known as backfilling, which involves re-computing the embeddings for a large number of data samples. In vision, Backward-compatible Training (BT) has been proposed to ensure that the new model aligns with the old model's embeddings. This paper extends the concept of vision-only BT to the field of cross-modal retrieval, marking the first attempt to address Cross-modal BT (XBT). Our goal is to achieve backward-compatibility between Vision-Language Pretraining (VLP) models, such as CLIP, for the cross-modal retrieval task. To address XBT challenges, we propose an efficient solution: a projection module that maps the new model's embeddings to those of the old model. This module, pretrained solely with text data, significantly reduces the number of image-text pairs required for XBT learning, and, once it is pretrained, it avoids using the old model during training. Furthermore, we utilize parameter-efficient training strategies that improve efficiency and preserve the off-the-shelf new model's knowledge by avoiding any modifications. Experimental results on cross-modal retrieval datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of XBT and its potential to enable backfill-free upgrades when a new VLP model emerges.</p>

<p>Abstract: The progression of X-ray technology introduces diverse image styles that need to be adapted to the preferences of radiologists. To support this task, we introduce a novel deep learning-based metric that quantifies style differences of non-matching image pairs. At the heart of our metric is an encoder capable of generating X-ray image style representations. This encoder is trained without any explicit knowledge of style distances by exploiting Simple Siamese learning. During inference, the style representations produced by the encoder are used to calculate a distance metric for non-matching image pairs. Our experiments investigate the proposed concept for a disclosed reproducible and a proprietary image processing pipeline along two dimensions: First, we use a t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) analysis to illustrate that the encoder outputs provide meaningful and discriminative style representations. Second, the proposed metric calculated from the encoder outputs is shown to quantify style distances for non-matching pairs in good alignment with the human perception. These results confirm that our proposed method is a promising technique to quantify style differences, which can be used for guided style selection as well as automatic optimization of image pipeline parameters.</p>

<p>Abstract: ``Learning to hash'' is a practical solution for efficient retrieval, offering fast search speed and low storage cost. It is widely applied in various applications, such as image-text cross-modal search. In this paper, we explore the potential of enhancing the performance of learning to hash with the proliferation of powerful large pre-trained models, such as Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models. We introduce a novel method named Distillation for Cross-Modal Quantization (DCMQ), which leverages the rich semantic knowledge of VLP models to improve hash representation learning. Specifically, we use the VLP as a `teacher' to distill knowledge into a `student' hashing model equipped with codebooks. This process involves the replacement of supervised labels, which are composed of multi-hot vectors and lack semantics, with the rich semantics of VLP. In the end, we apply a transformation termed Normalization with Paired Consistency (NPC) to achieve a discriminative target for distillation. Further, we introduce a new quantization method, Product Quantization with Gumbel (PQG) that promotes balanced codebook learning, thereby improving the retrieval performance. Extensive benchmark testing demonstrates that DCMQ consistently outperforms existing supervised cross-modal hashing approaches, showcasing its significant potential.</p>

<p>Abstract: Real world re-identfication (ReID) algorithms aim to map new observations of an object to previously recorded instances. These systems are often constrained by quantity and size of the stored embeddings. To combat this scaling problem, we attempt to shrink the size of these vectors by using a variety of compression techniques. In this paper, we benchmark quantization-aware-training along with three different dimension reduction methods: iterative structured pruning, slicing the embeddings at initialize, and using low rank embeddings. We find that ReID embeddings can be compressed by up to 96x with minimal drop in performance. This implies that modern re-identification paradigms do not fully leverage the high dimensional latent space, opening up further research to increase the capabilities of these systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in dataset distillation have demonstrated the significant benefits of employing soft labels generated by pre-trained teacher models. In this paper, we introduce a novel perspective by emphasizing the full utilization of labels. We first conduct a comprehensive comparison of various loss functions for soft label utilization in dataset distillation, revealing that the model trained on the synthetic dataset exhibits high sensitivity to the choice of loss function for soft label utilization. This finding highlights the necessity of a universal loss function for training models on synthetic datasets. Building on these insights, we introduce an extremely simple yet surprisingly effective plug-and-play approach, GIFT, which encompasses soft label refinement and a cosine similarity-based loss function to efficiently leverage full label information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GIFT consistently enhances the state-of-the-art dataset distillation methods across various scales datasets without incurring additional computational costs. For instance, on ImageNet-1K with IPC = 10, GIFT improves the SOTA method RDED by 3.9% and 1.8% on ConvNet and ResNet-18, respectively. Code: https://github.com/LINs-lab/GIFT.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Fu, Naman Patel, Prashanth Krishnamurthy, Farshad Khorrami</p>
<p>Abstract: Detection of out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is crucial for safe real-world deployment of machine learning models. Recent advances in vision language foundation models have made them capable of detecting OOD samples without requiring in-distribution (ID) images. However, these zero-shot methods often underperform as they do not adequately consider ID class likelihoods in their detection confidence scoring. Hence, we introduce CLIPScope, a zero-shot OOD detection approach that normalizes the confidence score of a sample by class likelihoods, akin to a Bayesian posterior update. Furthermore, CLIPScope incorporates a novel strategy to mine OOD classes from a large lexical database.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chongjie Si, Xuehui Wang, Xue Yang, Zhengqin Xu, Qingyun Li, Jifeng Dai, Yu Qiao, Xiaokang Yang, Wei Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Adapting pre-trained foundation models for various downstream tasks has been prevalent in artificial intelligence. Due to the vast number of tasks and high costs, adjusting all parameters becomes unfeasible. To mitigate this, several fine-tuning techniques have been developed to update the pre-trained model weights in a more resource-efficient manner, such as through low-rank adjustments. Yet, almost all of these methods focus on linear weights, neglecting the intricacies of parameter spaces in higher dimensions like 4D. Alternatively, some methods can be adapted for high-dimensional parameter space by compressing changes in the original space into two dimensions and then employing low-rank matrix decomposition. However, these approaches destructs the structural integrity of the involved high-dimensional spaces. To tackle the diversity of dimensional spaces across different foundation models and provide a more precise representation of the changes within these spaces, this paper introduces a generalized parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework, FLoRA, designed for various dimensional parameter space. Specifically, utilizing Tucker decomposition, FLoRA asserts that changes in each dimensional parameter space are based on a low-rank core space which maintains the consistent topological structure with the original space. It then models the changes through this core space alongside corresponding weights to reconstruct alterations in the original space. FLoRA effectively preserves the structural integrity of the change of original N-dimensional parameter space, meanwhile decomposes it via low-rank tensor decomposition. Extensive experiments on computer vision, natural language processing and multi-modal tasks validate FLoRA's effectiveness. Codes are available at https://github.com/SJTU-DeepVisionLab/FLoRA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanping Fu, Wenbin Liao, Xinyuan Liu, Hang xu, Yike Ma, Feng Dai, Yucheng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: As an emerging task that integrates perception and reasoning, topology reasoning in autonomous driving scenes has recently garnered widespread attention. However, existing work often emphasizes "perception over reasoning": they typically boost reasoning performance by enhancing the perception of lanes and directly adopt MLP to learn lane topology from lane query. This paradigm overlooks the geometric features intrinsic to the lanes themselves and are prone to being influenced by inherent endpoint shifts in lane detection.
  To tackle this issue, we propose an interpretable method for lane topology reasoning based on lane geometric distance and lane query similarity, named TopoLogic.
  This method mitigates the impact of endpoint shifts in geometric space, and introduces explicit similarity calculation in semantic space as a complement. By integrating results from both spaces, our methods provides more comprehensive information for lane topology.
  Ultimately, our approach significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods on the mainstream benchmark OpenLane-V2 (23.9 v.s. 10.9 in TOP$_{ll}$ and 44.1 v.s. 39.8 in OLS on subset_A. Additionally, our proposed geometric distance topology reasoning method can be incorporated into well-trained models without re-training, significantly boost the performance of lane topology reasoning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ling Yang, Bohan Zeng, Jiaming Liu, Hong Li, Minghao Xu, Wentao Zhang, Shuicheng Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have significantly improved the performance of image editing. Existing methods realize various approaches to achieve high-quality image editing, including but not limited to text control, dragging operation, and mask-and-inpainting. Among these, instruction-based editing stands out for its convenience and effectiveness in following human instructions across diverse scenarios. However, it still focuses on simple editing operations like adding, replacing, or deleting, and falls short of understanding aspects of world dynamics that convey the realistic dynamic nature in the physical world. Therefore, this work, EditWorld, introduces a new editing task, namely world-instructed image editing, which defines and categorizes the instructions grounded by various world scenarios. We curate a new image editing dataset with world instructions using a set of large pretrained models (e.g., GPT-3.5, Video-LLava and SDXL). To enable sufficient simulation of world dynamics for image editing, our EditWorld trains model in the curated dataset, and improves instruction-following ability with designed post-edit strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method significantly outperforms existing editing methods in this new task.

<p>Abstract: This work explores the effectiveness of masked image modelling for learning representations of retinal OCT images. To this end, we leverage Masked Autoencoders (MAE), a simple and scalable method for self-supervised learning, to obtain a powerful and general representation for OCT images by training on 700K OCT images from 41K patients collected under real world clinical settings. We also provide the first extensive evaluation for a model of OCT on a challenging battery of 6 downstream tasks. Our model achieves strong performance when fully finetuned but can also serve as a versatile frozen feature extractor for many tasks using lightweight adapters. Furthermore, we propose an extension of the MAE pretraining to fuse OCT with an auxiliary modality, namely, IR fundus images and learn a joint model for both. We demonstrate our approach improves performance on a multimodal downstream application. Our experiments utilize most publicly available OCT datasets, thus enabling future comparisons.

<p>Abstract: We introduce SEA-RAFT, a more simple, efficient, and accurate RAFT for optical flow. Compared with RAFT, SEA-RAFT is trained with a new loss (mixture of Laplace). It directly regresses an initial flow for faster convergence in iterative refinements and introduces rigid-motion pre-training to improve generalization.

In addition, SEA-RAFT obtains the best cross-dataset generalization on KITTI and Spring. With its high efficiency, SEA-RAFT operates at least 2.3x faster than existing methods while maintaining competitive performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohamed Debbagh, Yixue Liu, Zhouzhou Zheng, Xintong Jiang, Shangpeng Sun, Mark Lefsrud</p>
<p>Abstract: A plant growth simulation can be characterized as a reconstructed visual representation of a plant or plant system. The phenotypic characteristics and plant structures are controlled by the scene environment and other contextual attributes. Considering the temporal dependencies and compounding effects of various factors on growth trajectories, we formulate a probabilistic approach to the simulation task by solving a frame synthesis and pattern recognition problem. We introduce a Sequence-Informed Plant Growth Simulation framework (SI-PGS) that employs a conditional generative model to implicitly learn a distribution of possible plant representations within a dynamic scene from a fusion of low dimensional temporal sensor and context data. Methods such as controlled latent sampling and recurrent output connections are used to improve coherence in plant structures between frames of predictions. In this work, we demonstrate that SI-PGS is able to capture temporal dependencies and continuously generate realistic frames of a plant scene.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Raymond Wang, Nicholas R. Record, D. Whitney King, Tahiya Chowdhury</p>
<p>Abstract: Marine debris poses a significant ecological threat to birds, fish, and other animal life. Traditional methods for assessing debris accumulation involve labor-intensive and costly manual surveys. This study introduces a framework that utilizes aerial imagery captured by drones to conduct remote trash surveys. Leveraging computer vision techniques, our approach detects, classifies, and maps marine debris distributions. The framework uses Grounding DINO, a transformer-based zero-shot object detector, and CLIP, a vision-language model for zero-shot object classification, enabling the detection and classification of debris objects based on material type without the need for training labels. To mitigate over-counting due to different views of the same object, Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) is employed for duplicate matching using local object features. Additionally, we have developed a user-friendly web application that facilitates end-to-end analysis of drone images, including object detection, classification, and visualization on a map to support cleanup efforts. Our method achieves competitive performance in detection (0.69 mean IoU) and classification (0.74 F1 score) across seven debris object classes without labeled data, comparable to state-of-the-art supervised methods. This framework has the potential to streamline automated trash sampling surveys, fostering efficient and sustainable community-led cleanup initiatives.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongjun Kim, Chieh-Hsin Lai, Wei-Hsiang Liao, Yuhta Takida, Naoki Murata, Toshimitsu Uesaka, Yuki Mitsufuji, Stefano Ermon</p>
<p>Abstract: To accelerate sampling, diffusion models (DMs) are often distilled into generators that directly map noise to data in a single step. In this approach, the resolution of the generator is fundamentally limited by that of the teacher DM. To overcome this limitation, we propose Progressive Growing of Diffusion Autoencoder (PaGoDA), a technique to progressively grow the resolution of the generator beyond that of the original teacher DM. Our key insight is that a pre-trained, low-resolution DM can be used to deterministically encode high-resolution data to a structured latent space by solving the PF-ODE forward in time (data-to-noise), starting from an appropriately down-sampled image. Using this frozen encoder in an auto-encoder framework, we train a decoder by progressively growing its resolution. From the nature of progressively growing decoder, PaGoDA avoids re-training teacher/student models when we upsample the student model, making the whole training pipeline much cheaper. In experiments, we used our progressively growing decoder to upsample from the pre-trained model's 64x64 resolution to generate 512x512 samples, achieving 2x faster inference compared to single-step distilled Stable Diffusion like LCM. PaGoDA also achieved state-of-the-art FIDs on ImageNet across all resolutions from 64x64 to 512x512. Additionally, we demonstrated PaGoDA's effectiveness in solving inverse problems and enabling controllable generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiyao Xu, Caiyun Liu, Yuantao Chen, Zhenxin Zhu, Zike Yan, Yongliang Shi, Hao Zhao, Guyue Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Camera relocalization is a crucial problem in computer vision and robotics. Recent advancements in neural radiance fields (NeRFs) have shown promise in synthesizing photo-realistic images. Several works have utilized NeRFs for refining camera poses, but they do not account for lighting changes that can affect scene appearance and shadow regions, causing a degraded pose optimization process. In this paper, we propose a two-staged pipeline that normalizes images with varying lighting and shadow conditions to improve camera relocalization. We implement our scene representation upon a hash-encoded NeRF which significantly boosts up the pose optimization process. To account for the noisy image gradient computing problem in grid-based NeRFs, we further propose a re-devised truncated dynamic low-pass filter (TDLF) and a numerical gradient averaging technique to smoothen the process. Experimental results on several datasets with varying lighting conditions demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results in camera relocalization under varying lighting conditions. Code and data will be made publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Katherine Xu, Lingzhi Zhang, Jianbo Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have facilitated creative and photorealistic image synthesis. By varying the random seeds, we can generate various images for a fixed text prompt. Technically, the seed controls the initial noise and, in multi-step diffusion inference, the noise used for reparameterization at intermediate timesteps in the reverse diffusion process. However, the specific impact of the random seed on the generated images remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we conduct a large-scale scientific study into the impact of random seeds during diffusion inference. Remarkably, we reveal that the best 'golden' seed achieved an impressive FID of 21.60, compared to the worst 'inferior' seed's FID of 31.97. Additionally, a classifier can predict the seed number used to generate an image with over 99.9% accuracy in just a few epochs, establishing that seeds are highly distinguishable based on generated images. Encouraged by these findings, we examined the influence of seeds on interpretable visual dimensions. We find that certain seeds consistently produce grayscale images, prominent sky regions, or image borders. Seeds also affect image composition, including object location, size, and depth. Moreover, by leveraging these 'golden' seeds, we demonstrate improved image generation such as high-fidelity inference and diversified sampling. Our investigation extends to inpainting tasks, where we uncover some seeds that tend to insert unwanted text artifacts. Overall, our extensive analyses highlight the importance of selecting good seeds and offer practical utility for image generation.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14832">Direct3D: Scalable Image-to-3D Generation via 3D Latent Diffusion Transformer</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuang Wu, Youtian Lin, Feihu Zhang, Yifei Zeng, Jingxi Xu, Philip Torr, Xun Cao, Yao Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating high-quality 3D assets from text and images has long been challenging, primarily due to the absence of scalable 3D representations capable of capturing intricate geometry distributions. In this work, we introduce Direct3D, a native 3D generative model scalable to in-the-wild input images, without requiring a multiview diffusion model or SDS optimization. Our approach comprises two primary components: a Direct 3D Variational Auto-Encoder (D3D-VAE) and a Direct 3D Diffusion Transformer (D3D-DiT). D3D-VAE efficiently encodes high-resolution 3D shapes into a compact and continuous latent triplane space. Notably, our method directly supervises the decoded geometry using a semi-continuous surface sampling strategy, diverging from previous methods relying on rendered images as supervision signals. D3D-DiT models the distribution of encoded 3D latents and is specifically designed to fuse positional information from the three feature maps of the triplane latent, enabling a native 3D generative model scalable to large-scale 3D datasets. Additionally, we introduce an innovative image-to-3D generation pipeline incorporating semantic and pixel-level image conditions, allowing the model to produce 3D shapes consistent with the provided conditional image input. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our large-scale pre-trained Direct3D over previous image-to-3D approaches, achieving significantly better generation quality and generalization ability, thus establishing a new state-of-the-art for 3D content creation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yue Yang, Mona Gandhi, Yufei Wang, Yifan Wu, Michael S. Yao, Chris Callison-Burch, James C. Gee, Mark Yatskar</p>
<p>Abstract: While deep networks have achieved broad success in analyzing natural images, when applied to medical scans, they often fail in unexcepted situations. We investigate this challenge and focus on model sensitivity to domain shifts, such as data sampled from different hospitals or data confounded by demographic variables such as sex, race, etc, in the context of chest X-rays and skin lesion images. A key finding we show empirically is that existing visual backbones lack an appropriate prior from the architecture for reliable generalization in these settings. Taking inspiration from medical training, we propose giving deep networks a prior grounded in explicit medical knowledge communicated in natural language. To this end, we introduce Knowledge-enhanced Bottlenecks (KnoBo), a class of concept bottleneck models that incorporates knowledge priors that constrain it to reason with clinically relevant factors found in medical textbooks or PubMed. KnoBo uses retrieval-augmented language models to design an appropriate concept space paired with an automatic training procedure for recognizing the concept. We evaluate different resources of knowledge and recognition architectures on a broad range of domain shifts across 20 datasets. In our comprehensive evaluation with two imaging modalities, KnoBo outperforms fine-tuned models on confounded datasets by 32.4% on average. Finally, evaluations reveal that PubMed is a promising resource for making medical models less sensitive to domain shift, outperforming other resources on both diversity of information and final prediction performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihong Sun, Bharath Hariharan</p>
<p>Abstract: Embodied agents must detect and localize objects of interest, e.g. traffic participants for self-driving cars. Supervision in the form of bounding boxes for this task is extremely expensive. As such, prior work has looked at unsupervised object segmentation, but in the absence of annotated boxes, it is unclear how pixels must be grouped into objects and which objects are of interest. This results in over- / under-segmentation and irrelevant objects. Inspired both by the human visual system and by practical applications, we posit that the key missing cue is motion: objects of interest are typically mobile objects. We propose MOD-UV, a Mobile Object Detector learned from Unlabeled Videos only. We begin with pseudo-labels derived from motion segmentation, but introduce a novel training paradigm to progressively discover small objects and static-but-mobile objects that are missed by motion segmentation. As a result, though only learned from unlabeled videos, MOD-UV can detect and segment mobile objects from a single static image. Empirically, we achieve state-of-the-art performance in unsupervised mobile object detection on Waymo Open, nuScenes, and KITTI Dataset without using any external data or supervised models.

<p>Abstract: Novel-view synthesis of specular objects like shiny metals or glossy paints remains a significant challenge. Not only the glossy appearance but also global illumination effects, including reflections of other objects in the environment, are critical components to faithfully reproduce a scene. In this paper, we present Neural Directional Encoding (NDE), a view-dependent appearance encoding of neural radiance fields (NeRF) for rendering specular objects. NDE transfers the concept of feature-grid-based spatial encoding to the angular domain, significantly improving the ability to model high-frequency angular signals. In contrast to previous methods that use encoding functions with only angular input, we additionally cone-trace spatial features to obtain a spatially varying directional encoding, which addresses the challenging interreflection effects. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets show that a NeRF model with NDE (1) outperforms the state of the art on view synthesis of specular objects, and (2) works with small networks to allow fast (real-time) inference.

<p>Abstract: Recent developments in large-scale pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models have significantly improved the generation of high-fidelity images, particularly with the emergence of diffusion models based on transformer architecture (DiTs). Among these diffusion models, diffusion transformers have demonstrated superior image generation capabilities, boosting lower FID scores and higher scalability. However, deploying large-scale DiT models can be expensive due to their extensive parameter numbers. Although existing research has explored efficient deployment techniques for diffusion models such as model quantization, there is still little work concerning DiT-based models. To tackle this research gap, in this paper, we propose TerDiT, a quantization-aware training (QAT) and efficient deployment scheme for ternary diffusion models with transformers. We focus on the ternarization of DiT networks and scale model sizes from 600M to 4.2B. Our work contributes to the exploration of efficient deployment strategies for large-scale DiT models, demonstrating the feasibility of training extremely low-bit diffusion transformer models from scratch while maintaining competitive image generation capacities compared to full-precision models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yizhou Zhao, Tuanfeng Y. Wang, Bhiksha Raj, Min Xu, Jimei Yang, Chun-Hao Paul Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Remarkable strides have been made in reconstructing static scenes or human bodies from monocular videos. Yet, the two problems have largely been approached independently, without much synergy. Most visual SLAM methods can only reconstruct camera trajectories and scene structures up to scale, while most HMR methods reconstruct human meshes in metric scale but fall short in reasoning with cameras and scenes. This work introduces Synergistic Camera and Human Reconstruction (SynCHMR) to marry the best of both worlds. Specifically, we design Human-aware Metric SLAM to reconstruct metric-scale camera poses and scene point clouds using camera-frame HMR as a strong prior, addressing depth, scale, and dynamic ambiguities. Conditioning on the dense scene recovered, we further learn a Scene-aware SMPL Denoiser to enhance world-frame HMR by incorporating spatio-temporal coherency and dynamic scene constraints. Together, they lead to consistent reconstructions of camera trajectories, human meshes, and dense scene point clouds in a common world frame. Project page: https://paulchhuang.github.io/synchmr</p>

Our experiments highlight the expressivity of pretrained image encoders and necessity of semantic-based data filtering in achieving high-quality image generation. Once trained, it can adaptively generate new images from a dataset by simply using images from that dataset as input. We study the transfer properties of Semantica on ImageNet, LSUN Churches, LSUN Bedroom and SUN397.</p>

<p>Abstract: Similar to Vision Transformers, this paper identifies artifacts also present within the feature maps of Vision Mamba. These artifacts, corresponding to high-norm tokens emerging in low-information background areas of images, appear much more severe in Vision Mamba -- they exist prevalently even with the tiny-sized model and activate extensively across background regions. To mitigate this issue, we follow the prior solution of introducing register tokens into Vision Mamba. To better cope with Mamba blocks' uni-directional inference paradigm, two key modifications are introduced: 1) evenly inserting registers throughout the input token sequence, and 2) recycling registers for final decision predictions. We term this new architecture Mamba-R. Qualitative observations suggest, compared to vanilla Vision Mamba, Mamba-R's feature maps appear cleaner and more focused on semantically meaningful regions. Quantitatively, Mamba-R attains stronger performance and scales better. For example, on the ImageNet benchmark, our base-size Mamba-R attains 82.9% accuracy, significantly outperforming Vim-B's 81.8%; furthermore, we provide the first successful scaling to the large model size (i.e., with 341M parameters), attaining a competitive accuracy of 83.2% (84.5% if finetuned with 384x384 inputs). Additional validation on the downstream semantic segmentation task also supports Mamba-R's efficacy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeqi Xiao, Yifan Zhou, Shuai Yang, Xingang Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: Video generation primarily aims to model authentic and customized motion across frames, making understanding and controlling the motion a crucial topic. Most diffusion-based studies on video motion focus on motion customization with training-based paradigms, which, however, demands substantial training resources and necessitates retraining for diverse models. Crucially, these approaches do not explore how video diffusion models encode cross-frame motion information in their features, lacking interpretability and transparency in their effectiveness. To answer this question, this paper introduces a novel perspective to understand, localize, and manipulate motion-aware features in video diffusion models. Through analysis using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), our work discloses that robust motion-aware feature already exists in video diffusion models. We present a new MOtion FeaTure (MOFT) by eliminating content correlation information and filtering motion channels. MOFT provides a distinct set of benefits, including the ability to encode comprehensive motion information with clear interpretability, extraction without the need for training, and generalizability across diverse architectures. Leveraging MOFT, we propose a novel training-free video motion control framework. Our method demonstrates competitive performance in generating natural and faithful motion, providing architecture-agnostic insights and applicability in a variety of downstream tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanzhang Tu, Ruizhi Shao, Xue Dong, Shunyuan Zheng, Hao Zhang, Lili Chen, Meili Wang, Wenyu Li, Siyan Ma, Shengping Zhang, Boyao Zhou, Yebin Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a low-budget and high-authenticity bidirectional telepresence system, Tele-Aloha, targeting peer-to-peer communication scenarios. Compared to previous systems, Tele-Aloha utilizes only four sparse RGB cameras, one consumer-grade GPU, and one autostereoscopic screen to achieve high-resolution (2048x2048), real-time (30 fps), low-latency (less than 150ms) and robust distant communication. As the core of Tele-Aloha, we propose an efficient novel view synthesis algorithm for upper-body. Firstly, we design a cascaded disparity estimator for obtaining a robust geometry cue. Additionally a neural rasterizer via Gaussian Splatting is introduced to project latent features onto target view and to decode them into a reduced resolution. Further, given the high-quality captured data, we leverage weighted blending mechanism to refine the decoded image into the final resolution of 2K. Exploiting world-leading autostereoscopic display and low-latency iris tracking, users are able to experience a strong three-dimensional sense even without any wearable head-mounted display device. Altogether, our telepresence system demonstrates the sense of co-presence in real-life experiments, inspiring the next generation of communication.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianwei Yin, Micha\"el Gharbi, Taesung Park, Richard Zhang, Eli Shechtman, Fredo Durand, William T. Freeman</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent approaches have shown promises distilling diffusion models into efficient one-step generators. Among them, Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) produces one-step generators that match their teacher in distribution, without enforcing a one-to-one correspondence with the sampling trajectories of their teachers. However, to ensure stable training, DMD requires an additional regression loss computed using a large set of noise-image pairs generated by the teacher with many steps of a deterministic sampler. This is costly for large-scale text-to-image synthesis and limits the student's quality, tying it too closely to the teacher's original sampling paths. We introduce DMD2, a set of techniques that lift this limitation and improve DMD training. First, we eliminate the regression loss and the need for expensive dataset construction. We show that the resulting instability is due to the fake critic not estimating the distribution of generated samples accurately and propose a two time-scale update rule as a remedy. Second, we integrate a GAN loss into the distillation procedure, discriminating between generated samples and real images. This lets us train the student model on real data, mitigating the imperfect real score estimation from the teacher model, and enhancing quality. Lastly, we modify the training procedure to enable multi-step sampling. We identify and address the training-inference input mismatch problem in this setting, by simulating inference-time generator samples during training time. Taken together, our improvements set new benchmarks in one-step image generation, with FID scores of 1.28 on ImageNet-64x64 and 8.35 on zero-shot COCO 2014, surpassing the original teacher despite a 500X reduction in inference cost. Further, we show our approach can generate megapixel images by distilling SDXL, demonstrating exceptional visual quality among few-step methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Basile Van Hoorick, Rundi Wu, Ege Ozguroglu, Kyle Sargent, Ruoshi Liu, Pavel Tokmakov, Achal Dave, Changxi Zheng, Carl Vondrick</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate reconstruction of complex dynamic scenes from just a single viewpoint continues to be a challenging task in computer vision. Current dynamic novel view synthesis methods typically require videos from many different camera viewpoints, necessitating careful recording setups, and significantly restricting their utility in the wild as well as in terms of embodied AI applications. In this paper, we propose $\textbf{GCD}$, a controllable monocular dynamic view synthesis pipeline that leverages large-scale diffusion priors to, given a video of any scene, generate a synchronous video from any other chosen perspective, conditioned on a set of relative camera pose parameters. Our model does not require depth as input, and does not explicitly model 3D scene geometry, instead performing end-to-end video-to-video translation in order to achieve its goal efficiently. Despite being trained on synthetic multi-view video data only, zero-shot real-world generalization experiments show promising results in multiple domains, including robotics, object permanence, and driving environments. We believe our framework can potentially unlock powerful applications in rich dynamic scene understanding, perception for robotics, and interactive 3D video viewing experiences for virtual reality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuliang Xiu, Yufei Ye, Zhen Liu, Dimitrios Tzionas, Michael J. Black</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating personalized 3D avatars is crucial for AR/VR. However, recent text-to-3D methods that generate avatars for celebrities or fictional characters, struggle with everyday people. Methods for faithful reconstruction typically require full-body images in controlled settings. What if a user could just upload their personal "OOTD" (Outfit Of The Day) photo collection and get a faithful avatar in return? The challenge is that such casual photo collections contain diverse poses, challenging viewpoints, cropped views, and occlusion (albeit with a consistent outfit, accessories and hairstyle). We address this novel "Album2Human" task by developing PuzzleAvatar, a novel model that generates a faithful 3D avatar (in a canonical pose) from a personal OOTD album, while bypassing the challenging estimation of body and camera pose. To this end, we fine-tune a foundational vision-language model (VLM) on such photos, encoding the appearance, identity, garments, hairstyles, and accessories of a person into (separate) learned tokens and instilling these cues into the VLM. In effect, we exploit the learned tokens as "puzzle pieces" from which we assemble a faithful, personalized 3D avatar. Importantly, we can customize avatars by simply inter-changing tokens. As a benchmark for this new task, we collect a new dataset, called PuzzleIOI, with 41 subjects in a total of nearly 1K OOTD configurations, in challenging partial photos with paired ground-truth 3D bodies. Evaluation shows that PuzzleAvatar not only has high reconstruction accuracy, outperforming TeCH and MVDreamBooth, but also a unique scalability to album photos, and strong robustness. Our model and data will be public.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of autonomous driving, precise segmentation of LiDAR data is crucial for understanding complex 3D environments. Traditional approaches often rely on disparate, standalone codebases, hindering unified advancements and fair benchmarking across models. To address these challenges, we introduce MMDetection3D-lidarseg, a comprehensive toolbox designed for the efficient training and evaluation of state-of-the-art LiDAR segmentation models. We support a wide range of segmentation models and integrate advanced data augmentation techniques to enhance robustness and generalization. Additionally, the toolbox provides support for multiple leading sparse convolution backends, optimizing computational efficiency and performance. By fostering a unified framework, MMDetection3D-lidarseg streamlines development and benchmarking, setting new standards for research and application. Our extensive benchmark experiments on widely-used datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the toolbox. The codebase and trained models have been publicly available, promoting further research and innovation in the field of LiDAR segmentation for autonomous driving.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dor Verbin, Pratul P. Srinivasan, Peter Hedman, Ben Mildenhall, Benjamin Attal, Richard Szeliski, Jonathan T. Barron</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) typically struggle to reconstruct and render highly specular objects, whose appearance varies quickly with changes in viewpoint. Recent works have improved NeRF's ability to render detailed specular appearance of distant environment illumination, but are unable to synthesize consistent reflections of closer content. Moreover, these techniques rely on large computationally-expensive neural networks to model outgoing radiance, which severely limits optimization and rendering speed. We address these issues with an approach based on ray tracing: instead of querying an expensive neural network for the outgoing view-dependent radiance at points along each camera ray, our model casts reflection rays from these points and traces them through the NeRF representation to render feature vectors which are decoded into color using a small inexpensive network. We demonstrate that our model outperforms prior methods for view synthesis of scenes containing shiny objects, and that it is the only existing NeRF method that can synthesize photorealistic specular appearance and reflections in real-world scenes, while requiring comparable optimization time to current state-of-the-art view synthesis models.</p>

By building over principles of federated learning, we develop a distributed framework allowing for demanding the optimization process to a number of clients deployed in different environments. This makes it possible, for a deep stereo network running on resourced-constrained devices, to capitalize on the adaptation process carried out by other instances of the same architecture, and thus improve its accuracy in challenging environments even when it cannot carry out adaptation on its own. Experimental results show how federated adaptation performs equivalently to on-device adaptation, and even better when dealing with challenging environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Humans are adept at leveraging visual cues from lip movements for recognizing speech in adverse listening conditions. Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) models follow similar approach to achieve robust speech recognition in noisy conditions. In this work, we present a multilingual AVSR model incorporating several enhancements to improve performance and audio noise robustness. Notably, we adapt the recently proposed Fast Conformer model to process both audio and visual modalities using a novel hybrid CTC/RNN-T architecture. We increase the amount of audio-visual training data for six distinct languages, generating automatic transcriptions of unlabelled multilingual datasets (VoxCeleb2 and AVSpeech). Our proposed model achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the LRS3 dataset, reaching WER of 0.8%. On the recently introduced MuAViC benchmark, our model yields an absolute average-WER reduction of 11.9% in comparison to the original baseline. Finally, we demonstrate the ability of the proposed model to perform audio-only, visual-only, and audio-visual speech recognition at test time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saddam Hussain Khan (Artificial Intelligence Lab, Department of Computer Systems Engineering, University of Engineering,Applied Sciences)</p>
<p>Abstract: Alzheimer diseases (ADs) involves cognitive decline and abnormal brain protein accumulation, necessitating timely diagnosis for effective treatment. Therefore, CAD systems leveraging deep learning advancements have demonstrated success in AD detection but pose computational intricacies and the dataset minor contrast, structural, and texture variations. In this regard, a novel hybrid FME-Residual-HSCMT technique is introduced, comprised of residual CNN and Transformer concepts to capture global and local fine-grained AD analysis in MRI. This approach integrates three distinct elements: a novel CNN Meet Transformer (HSCMT), customized residual learning CNN, and a new Feature Map Enhancement (FME) strategy to learn diverse morphological, contrast, and texture variations of ADs. The proposed HSCMT at the initial stage utilizes stem convolution blocks that are integrated with CMT blocks followed by systematic homogenous and structural (HS) operations. The customized CMT block encapsulates each element with global contextual interactions through multi-head attention and facilitates computational efficiency through lightweight. Moreover, inverse residual and stem CNN in customized CMT enables effective extraction of local texture information and handling vanishing gradients. Furthermore, in the FME strategy, residual CNN blocks utilize TL-based generated auxiliary and are combined with the proposed HSCMT channels at the target level to achieve diverse enriched feature space. Finally, diverse enhanced channels are fed into a novel spatial attention mechanism for optimal pixel selection to reduce redundancy and discriminate minor contrast and texture inter-class variation. The proposed achieves an F1-score (98.55%), an accuracy of 98.42% and a sensitivity of 98.50%, a precision of 98.60% on the standard Kaggle dataset, and demonstrates outperformance existing ViTs and CNNs methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, model explanation methods have been designed to interpret model decisions faithfully and intuitively so that users can easily understand them. In this paper, we propose a framework, Faithful Attention Explainer (FAE), capable of generating faithful textual explanations regarding the attended-to features. Towards this goal, we deploy an attention module that takes the visual feature maps from the classifier for sentence generation. Furthermore, our method successfully learns the association between features and words, which allows a novel attention enforcement module for attention explanation. Our model achieves promising performance in caption quality metrics and a faithful decision-relevance metric on two datasets (CUB and ACT-X). In addition, we show that FAE can interpret gaze-based human attention, as human gaze indicates the discriminative features that humans use for decision-making, demonstrating the potential of deploying human gaze for advanced human-AI interaction.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent years have witnessed an increasing global population affected by neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), which traditionally require extensive healthcare resources and human effort for medical diagnosis and monitoring. As a crucial disease-related motor symptom, human gait can be exploited to characterize different NDs. The current advances in artificial intelligence (AI) models enable automatic gait analysis for NDs identification and classification, opening a new avenue to facilitate faster and more cost-effective diagnosis of NDs. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on recent progress of machine learning and deep learning based AI techniques applied to diagnosis of five typical NDs through gait. We provide an overview of the process of AI-assisted NDs diagnosis, and present a systematic taxonomy of existing gait data and AI models. Through an extensive review and analysis of 164 studies, we identify and discuss the challenges, potential solutions, and future directions in this field. Finally, we envision the prospective utilization of 3D skeleton data for human gait representation and the development of more efficient AI models for NDs diagnosis.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lujia Zhong, Shuo Huang, Jiaxin Yue, Jianwei Zhang, Zhiwei Deng, Wenhao Chi, Yonggang Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: The emergence of tau PET imaging over the last decade has enabled Alzheimer's disease (AD) researchers to examine tau pathology in vivo and more effectively characterize the disease trajectories of AD. Current tau PET analysis methods, however, typically perform inferences on large cortical ROIs and are limited in the detection of localized tau pathology that varies across subjects. Furthermore, a high-resolution MRI is required to carry out conventional tau PET analysis, which is not commonly acquired in clinical practices and may not be acquired for many elderly patients with dementia due to strong motion artifacts, claustrophobia, or certain metal implants. In this work, we propose a novel conditional diffusion model to perform MRI-free anomaly detection from tau PET imaging data. By including individualized conditions and two complementary loss maps from pseudo-healthy and pseudo-unhealthy reconstructions, our model computes an anomaly map across the entire brain area that allows simply training a support vector machine (SVM) for classifying disease severity. We train our model on ADNI subjects (n=534) and evaluate its performance on a separate dataset from the preclinical subjects of the A4 clinical trial (n=447). We demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline generative models and the conventional Z-score-based method in anomaly localization without mis-detecting off-target bindings in sub-cortical and out-of-brain areas. By classifying the A4 subjects according to their anomaly map using the SVM trained on ADNI data, we show that our method can successfully group preclinical subjects with significantly different cognitive functions, which further demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in capturing biologically relevant anomaly in tau PET imaging.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurately localizing two-dimensional (2D) ultrasound (US) fetal brain images in the 3D brain, using minimal computational resources, is an important task for automated US analysis of fetal growth and development. We propose an uncertainty-aware deep learning model for automated 3D plane localization in 2D fetal brain images. Specifically, a multi-head network is trained to jointly regress 3D plane pose from 2D images in terms of different geometric transformations. The model explicitly learns to predict uncertainty to allocate higher weight to inputs with low variances across different transformations to improve performance. Our proposed method, QAERTS, demonstrates superior pose estimation accuracy than the state-of-the-art and most of the uncertainty-based approaches, leading to 9% improvement on plane angle (PA) for localization accuracy, and 8% on normalized cross-correlation (NCC) for sampled image quality. QAERTS also demonstrates efficiency, containing 5$\times$ fewer parameters than ensemble-based approach, making it advantageous in resource-constrained settings. In addition, QAERTS proves to be more robust to noise effects observed in freehand US scanning by leveraging rotational discontinuities and explicit output uncertainties.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in augmented reality (AR) have enabled the use of various sensors on smart glasses for applications like facial reconstruction, which is vital to improve AR experiences for virtual social activities. However, the size and power constraints of smart glasses demand a miniature and low-power sensing solution. AUGlasses achieves unobtrusive low-power facial reconstruction by placing inertial measurement units (IMU) against the temporal area on the face to capture the skin deformations, which are caused by facial muscle movements. These IMU signals, along with historical data on facial action units (AUs), are processed by a transformer-based deep learning model to estimate AU intensities in real-time, which are then used for facial reconstruction. Our results show that AUGlasses accurately predicts the strength (0-5 scale) of 14 key AUs with a cross-user mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.187 (STD = 0.025) and achieves facial reconstruction with a cross-user MAE of 1.93 mm (STD = 0.353). We also integrated various preprocessing and training techniques to ensure robust performance for continuous sensing. Micro-benchmark tests indicate that our system consistently performs accurate continuous facial reconstruction with a fine-tuned cross-user model, achieving an AU MAE of 0.35.</p>

Various deep learning-based techniques proposed in the literature have made significant progress in this field, however, they still face limitations in terms of accuracy due to the complex and variable nature of brain tumor morphology. In this research paper, we propose a novel Hybrid Multihead Attentive U-Net architecture, to address the challenges in accurate brain tumor segmentation, and to capture complex spatial relationships and subtle tumor boundaries. The U-Net architecture has proven effective in capturing contextual information and feature representations, while attention mechanisms enhance the model's ability to focus on informative regions and refine the segmentation boundaries. By integrating these two components, our proposed architecture improves accuracy in brain tumor segmentation. We test our proposed model on the BraTS 2020 benchmark dataset and compare its performance with the state-of-the-art well-known SegNet, FCN-8s, and Dense121 U-Net architectures. The results show that our proposed model outperforms the others in terms of the evaluated performance metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md. Toukir Ahmed, Mohammed Kamruzzaman</p>
<p>Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) has become a key technology for non-invasive quality evaluation in various fields, offering detailed insights through spatial and spectral data. Despite its efficacy, the complexity and high cost of HSI systems have hindered their widespread adoption. This study addressed these challenges by exploring deep learning-based hyperspectral image reconstruction from RGB (Red, Green, Blue) images, particularly for agricultural products. Specifically, different hyperspectral reconstruction algorithms, such as Hyperspectral Convolutional Neural Network - Dense (HSCNN-D), High-Resolution Network (HRNET), and Multi-Scale Transformer Plus Plus (MST++), were compared to assess the dry matter content of sweet potatoes. Among the tested reconstruction methods, HRNET demonstrated superior performance, achieving the lowest mean relative absolute error (MRAE) of 0.07, root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.03, and the highest peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 32.28 decibels (dB). Some key features were selected using the genetic algorithm (GA), and their importance was interpreted using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). Partial least squares regression (PLSR) models were developed using the RGB, reconstructed, and ground truth (GT) data. The visual and spectra quality of these reconstructed methods was compared with GT data, and predicted maps were generated. The results revealed the prospect of deep learning-based hyperspectral image reconstruction as a cost-effective and efficient quality assessment tool for agricultural and biological applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yasmeena Akhter, Rishabh Ranjan, Richa Singh, Mayank Vatsa</p>
<p>Abstract: This research addresses the challenges of diagnosing chest X-rays (CXRs) at low resolutions, a common limitation in resource-constrained healthcare settings. High-resolution CXR imaging is crucial for identifying small but critical anomalies, such as nodules or opacities. However, when images are downsized for processing in Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems, vital spatial details and receptive fields are lost, hampering diagnosis accuracy. To address this, this paper presents the Multilevel Collaborative Attention Knowledge (MLCAK) method. This approach leverages the self-attention mechanism of Vision Transformers (ViT) to transfer critical diagnostic knowledge from high-resolution images to enhance the diagnostic efficacy of low-resolution CXRs. MLCAK incorporates local pathological findings to boost model explainability, enabling more accurate global predictions in a multi-task framework tailored for low-resolution CXR analysis. Our research, utilizing the Vindr CXR dataset, shows a considerable enhancement in the ability to diagnose diseases from low-resolution images (e.g. 28 x 28), suggesting a critical transition from the traditional reliance on high-resolution imaging (e.g. 224 x 224).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luca Savant Aira, Antonio Montanaro, Emanuele Aiello, Diego Valsesia, Enrico Magli</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating videos with realistic and physically plausible motion is one of the main recent challenges in computer vision. While diffusion models are achieving compelling results in image generation, video diffusion models are limited by heavy training and huge models, resulting in videos that are still biased to the training dataset. In this work we propose MotionCraft, a new zero-shot video generator to craft physics-based and realistic videos. MotionCraft is able to warp the noise latent space of an image diffusion model, such as Stable Diffusion, by applying an optical flow derived from a physics simulation. We show that warping the noise latent space results in coherent application of the desired motion while allowing the model to generate missing elements consistent with the scene evolution, which would otherwise result in artefacts or missing content if the flow was applied in the pixel space. We compare our method with the state-of-the-art Text2Video-Zero reporting qualitative and quantitative improvements, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach to generate videos with finely-prescribed complex motion dynamics.

<p>Abstract: Efficient and precise quantification of lymphocytes in histopathology slides is imperative for the characterization of the tumor microenvironment and immunotherapy response insights. We developed a data-centric optimization pipeline that attain great lymphocyte detection performance using an off-the-shelf YOLOv5 model, without any architectural modifications. Our contribution that rely on strategic dataset augmentation strategies, includes novel biological upsampling and custom visual cohesion transformations tailored to the unique properties of tissue imagery, and enables to dramatically improve model performances. Our optimization reveals a pivotal realization: given intensive customization, standard computational pathology models can achieve high-capability biomarker development, without increasing the architectural complexity. We showcase the interest of this approach in the context of breast cancer where our strategies lead to good lymphocyte detection performances, echoing a broadly impactful paradigm shift. Furthermore, our data curation techniques enable crucial histological analysis benchmarks, highlighting improved generalizable potential.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Xu, Jiepeng Wang, Hao Pan, Yang Liu, Xin Tong, Shiqing Xin, Changhe Tu, Taku Komura, Wenping Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we study an under-explored but important factor of diffusion generative models, i.e., the combinatorial complexity. Data samples are generally high-dimensional, and for various structured generation tasks, there are additional attributes which are combined to associate with data samples. We show that the space spanned by the combination of dimensions and attributes is insufficiently sampled by existing training scheme of diffusion generative models, causing degraded test time performance. We present a simple fix to this problem by constructing stochastic processes that fully exploit the combinatorial structures, hence the name ComboStoc. Using this simple strategy, we show that network training is significantly accelerated across diverse data modalities, including images and 3D structured shapes. Moreover, ComboStoc enables a new way of test time generation which uses insynchronized time steps for different dimensions and attributes, thus allowing for varying degrees of control over them.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Etienne Chollet, Yael Balbastre, Caroline Magnain, Bruce Fischl, Hui Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Serial sectioning Optical Coherence Tomography (sOCT) is a high-throughput, label free microscopic imaging technique that is becoming increasingly popular to study post-mortem neurovasculature. Quantitative analysis of the vasculature requires highly accurate segmentation; however, sOCT has low signal-to-noise-ratio and displays a wide range of contrasts and artifacts that depend on acquisition parameters. Furthermore, labeled data is scarce and extremely time consuming to generate. Here, we leverage synthetic datasets of vessels to train a deep learning segmentation model. We construct the vessels with semi-realistic splines that simulate the vascular geometry and compare our model with realistic vascular labels generated by constrained constructive optimization. Both approaches yield similar Dice scores, although with very different false positive and false negative rates. This method addresses the complexity inherent in OCT images and paves the way for more accurate and efficient analysis of neurovascular structures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Filippo Ruffini, Lorenzo Tronchin, Zhuoru Wu, Wenting Chen, Paolo Soda, Linlin Shen, Valerio Guarrasi</p>
<p>Abstract: In the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, leveraging artificial intelligence to predict disease outcomes from chest radiographic images represents a significant scientific aim. The challenge, however, lies in the scarcity of large, labeled datasets with compatible tasks for training deep learning models without leading to overfitting. Addressing this issue, we introduce a novel multi-dataset multi-task training framework that predicts COVID-19 prognostic outcomes from chest X-rays (CXR) by integrating correlated datasets from disparate sources, distant from conventional multi-task learning approaches, which rely on datasets with multiple and correlated labeling schemes. Our framework hypothesizes that assessing severity scores enhances the model's ability to classify prognostic severity groups, thereby improving its robustness and predictive power. The proposed architecture comprises a deep convolutional network that receives inputs from two publicly available CXR datasets, AIforCOVID for severity prognostic prediction and BRIXIA for severity score assessment, and branches into task-specific fully connected output networks. Moreover, we propose a multi-task loss function, incorporating an indicator function, to exploit multi-dataset integration. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach are demonstrated through significant performance improvements in prognosis classification tasks across 18 different convolutional neural network backbones in different evaluation strategies. This improvement is evident over single-task baselines and standard transfer learning strategies, supported by extensive statistical analysis, showing great application potential.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guy Ohayon, Michael Elad, Tomer Michaeli</p>
<p>Abstract: Fairness in image restoration tasks is the desire to treat different sub-groups of images equally well. Existing definitions of fairness in image restoration are highly restrictive. They consider a reconstruction to be a correct outcome for a group (e.g., women) only if it falls within the group's set of ground truth images (e.g., natural images of women); otherwise, it is considered entirely incorrect. Consequently, such definitions are prone to controversy, as errors in image restoration can manifest in various ways. In this work we offer an alternative approach towards fairness in image restoration, by considering the Group Perceptual Index (GPI), which we define as the statistical distance between the distribution of the group's ground truth images and the distribution of their reconstructions. We assess the fairness of an algorithm by comparing the GPI of different groups, and say that it achieves perfect Perceptual Fairness (PF) if the GPIs of all groups are identical. We motivate and theoretically study our new notion of fairness, draw its connection to previous ones, and demonstrate its utility on state-of-the-art face image super-resolution algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md. Toukir Ahmed, Md Wadud Ahmed, Ocean Monjur, Jason Lee Emmert, Girish Chowdhary, Mohammed Kamruzzaman</p>
<p>Abstract: As the demand for food surges and the agricultural sector undergoes a transformative shift towards sustainability and efficiency, the need for precise and proactive measures to ensure the health and welfare of livestock becomes paramount. In the context of the broader agricultural landscape outlined, the application of Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) takes on profound significance. HSI has emerged as a cutting-edge, non-destructive technique for fast and accurate egg quality analysis, including the detection of chick embryo mortality. However, the high cost and operational complexity compared to conventional RGB imaging are significant bottlenecks in the widespread adoption of HSI technology. To overcome these hurdles and unlock the full potential of HSI, a promising solution is hyperspectral image reconstruction from standard RGB images. This study aims to reconstruct hyperspectral images from RGB images for non-destructive early prediction of chick embryo mortality. Firstly, the performance of different image reconstruction algorithms, such as HRNET, MST++, Restormer, and EDSR were compared to reconstruct the hyperspectral images of the eggs in the early incubation period. Later, the reconstructed spectra were used to differentiate live from dead chick-producing eggs using the XGBoost and Random Forest classification methods. Among the reconstruction methods, HRNET showed impressive reconstruction performance with MRAE of 0.0955, RMSE of 0.0159, and PSNR of 36.79 dB. This study motivated that harnessing imaging technology integrated with smart sensors and data analytics has the potential to improve automation, enhance biosecurity, and optimize resource management towards sustainable agriculture 4.0.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vahid Jebraeeli, Bo Jiang, Derya Cansever, Hamid Krim</p>
<p>Abstract: In the era of big data, the sheer volume and complexity of datasets pose significant challenges in machine learning, particularly in image processing tasks. This paper introduces an innovative Autoencoder-based Dataset Condensation Model backed by Koopman operator theory that effectively packs large datasets into compact, information-rich representations. Inspired by the predictive coding mechanisms of the human brain, our model leverages a novel approach to encode and reconstruct data, maintaining essential features and label distributions. The condensation process utilizes an autoencoder neural network architecture, coupled with Optimal Transport theory and Wasserstein distance, to minimize the distributional discrepancies between the original and synthesized datasets. We present a two-stage implementation strategy: first, condensing the large dataset into a smaller synthesized subset; second, evaluating the synthesized data by training a classifier and comparing its performance with a classifier trained on an equivalent subset of the original data. Our experimental results demonstrate that the classifiers trained on condensed data exhibit comparable performance to those trained on the original datasets, thus affirming the efficacy of our condensation model. This work not only contributes to the reduction of computational resources but also paves the way for efficient data handling in constrained environments, marking a significant step forward in data-efficient machine learning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and related rationale-based works have significantly improved the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex reasoning tasks. With the evolution of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), enhancing their capability to tackle complex multimodal reasoning problems is a crucial frontier. However, incorporating multimodal rationales in CoT has yet to be thoroughly investigated. We propose the Image-of-Thought (IoT) prompting method, which helps MLLMs to extract visual rationales step-by-step. Specifically, IoT prompting can automatically design critical visual information extraction operations based on the input images and questions. Each step of visual information refinement identifies specific visual rationales that support answers to complex visual reasoning questions. Beyond the textual CoT, IoT simultaneously utilizes visual and textual rationales to help MLLMs understand complex multimodal information. IoT prompting has improved zero-shot visual reasoning performance across various visual understanding tasks in different MLLMs. Moreover, the step-by-step visual feature explanations generated by IoT prompting elucidate the visual reasoning process, aiding in analyzing the cognitive processes of large multimodal models</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Sun, Haoran Duan, Jiahua Dong, Varun Ojha, Tejal Shah, Rajiv Ranjan</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a rehearsal-free federated domain incremental learning framework, RefFiL, based on a global prompt-sharing paradigm to alleviate catastrophic forgetting challenges in federated domain-incremental learning, where unseen domains are continually learned. Typical methods for mitigating forgetting, such as the use of additional datasets and the retention of private data from earlier tasks, are not viable in federated learning (FL) due to devices' limited resources. Our method, RefFiL, addresses this by learning domain-invariant knowledge and incorporating various domain-specific prompts from the domains represented by different FL participants. A key feature of RefFiL is the generation of local fine-grained prompts by our domain adaptive prompt generator, which effectively learns from local domain knowledge while maintaining distinctive boundaries on a global scale. We also introduce a domain-specific prompt contrastive learning loss that differentiates between locally generated prompts and those from other domains, enhancing RefFiL's precision and effectiveness. Compared to existing methods, RefFiL significantly alleviates catastrophic forgetting without requiring extra memory space, making it ideal for privacy-sensitive and resource-constrained devices.</p>

<p>Abstract: This work studies the learning problem of the energy-based prior model and the multi-layer generator model. The multi-layer generator model, which contains multiple layers of latent variables organized in a top-down hierarchical structure, typically assumes the Gaussian prior model. Such a prior model can be limited in modelling expressivity, which results in a gap between the generator posterior and the prior model, known as the prior hole problem. Recent works have explored learning the energy-based (EBM) prior model as a second-stage, complementary model to bridge the gap. However, the EBM defined on a multi-layer latent space can be highly multi-modal, which makes sampling from such marginal EBM prior challenging in practice, resulting in ineffectively learned EBM. To tackle the challenge, we propose to leverage the diffusion probabilistic scheme to mitigate the burden of EBM sampling and thus facilitate EBM learning. Our extensive experiments demonstrate a superior performance of our diffusion-learned EBM prior on various challenging tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Prashant Bhat, Bharath Renjith, Elahe Arani, Bahram Zonooz</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual learning (CL) remains a significant challenge for deep neural networks, as it is prone to forgetting previously acquired knowledge. Several approaches have been proposed in the literature, such as experience rehearsal, regularization, and parameter isolation, to address this problem. Although almost zero forgetting can be achieved in task-incremental learning, class-incremental learning remains highly challenging due to the problem of inter-task class separation. Limited access to previous task data makes it difficult to discriminate between classes of current and previous tasks. To address this issue, we propose `Attention-Guided Incremental Learning' (AGILE), a novel rehearsal-based CL approach that incorporates compact task attention to effectively reduce interference between tasks. AGILE utilizes lightweight, learnable task projection vectors to transform the latent representations of a shared task attention module toward task distribution. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we show that AGILE significantly improves generalization performance by mitigating task interference and outperforming rehearsal-based approaches in several CL scenarios. Furthermore, AGILE can scale well to a large number of tasks with minimal overhead while remaining well-calibrated with reduced task-recency bias.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, deep learning models comprising transformer components have pushed the performance envelope in medical image synthesis tasks. Contrary to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that use static, local filters, transformers use self-attention mechanisms to permit adaptive, non-local filtering to sensitively capture long-range context. However, this sensitivity comes at the expense of substantial model complexity, which can compromise learning efficacy particularly on relatively modest-sized imaging datasets. Here, we propose a novel adversarial model for multi-modal medical image synthesis, I2I-Mamba, that leverages selective state space modeling (SSM) to efficiently capture long-range context while maintaining local precision. To do this, I2I-Mamba injects channel-mixed Mamba (cmMamba) blocks in the bottleneck of a convolutional backbone. In cmMamba blocks, SSM layers are used to learn context across the spatial dimension and channel-mixing layers are used to learn context across the channel dimension of feature maps. Comprehensive demonstrations are reported for imputing missing images in multi-contrast MRI and MRI-CT protocols. Our results indicate that I2I-Mamba offers superior performance against state-of-the-art CNN- and transformer-based methods in synthesizing target-modality images.</p>

<p>Abstract: Simulating large scenes with many rigid objects is crucial for a variety of applications, such as robotics, engineering, film and video games. Rigid interactions are notoriously hard to model: small changes to the initial state or the simulation parameters can lead to large changes in the final state. Recently, learned simulators based on graph networks (GNNs) were developed as an alternative to hand-designed simulators like MuJoCo and PyBullet. They are able to accurately capture dynamics of real objects directly from real-world observations. However, current state-of-the-art learned simulators operate on meshes and scale poorly to scenes with many objects or detailed shapes. Here we present SDF-Sim, the first learned rigid-body simulator designed for scale. We use learned signed-distance functions (SDFs) to represent the object shapes and to speed up distance computation. We design the simulator to leverage SDFs and avoid the fundamental bottleneck of the previous simulators associated with collision detection. For the first time in literature, we demonstrate that we can scale the GNN-based simulators to scenes with hundreds of objects and up to 1.1 million nodes, where mesh-based approaches run out of memory. Finally, we show that SDF-Sim can be applied to real world scenes by extracting SDFs from multi-view images.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep learning has demonstrated remarkable success across many domains, including computer vision, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning. Representative artificial neural networks in these fields span convolutional neural networks, Transformers, and deep Q-networks. Built upon unimodal neural networks, numerous multi-modal models have been introduced to address a range of tasks such as visual question answering, image captioning, and speech recognition. The rise of instruction-following robotic policies in embodied AI has spurred the development of a novel category of multi-modal models known as vision-language-action models (VLAs). Their multi-modality capability has become a foundational element in robot learning. Various methods have been proposed to enhance traits such as versatility, dexterity, and generalizability. Some models focus on refining specific components through pretraining. Others aim to develop control policies adept at predicting low-level actions. Certain VLAs serve as high-level task planners capable of decomposing long-horizon tasks into executable subtasks. Over the past few years, a myriad of VLAs have emerged, reflecting the rapid advancement of embodied AI. Therefore, it is imperative to capture the evolving landscape through a comprehensive survey.</p>

Additionally, we propose a set of topological positional encodings specifically designed for cell complexes. By transforming three graph datasets into cell complex datasets, our experiments reveal that CT not only achieves state-of-the-art performance, but it does so without the need for more complex enhancements such as virtual nodes, in-domain structural encodings, or graph rewiring.</p>

<p>Abstract: In response to the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic, advanced automated technologies have emerged as valuable tools to aid healthcare professionals in managing an increased workload by improving radiology report generation and prognostic analysis. This study proposes Multi-modality Regional Alignment Network (MRANet), an explainable model for radiology report generation and survival prediction that focuses on high-risk regions. By learning spatial correlation in the detector, MRANet visually grounds region-specific descriptions, providing robust anatomical regions with a completion strategy. The visual features of each region are embedded using a novel survival attention mechanism, offering spatially and risk-aware features for sentence encoding while maintaining global coherence across tasks. A cross LLMs alignment is employed to enhance the image-to-text transfer process, resulting in sentences rich with clinical detail and improved explainability for radiologist.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bum Jun Kim, Yoshinobu Kawahara, Sang Woo Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Dynamical systems are often time-varying, whose modeling requires a function that evolves with respect to time. Recent studies such as the neural ordinary differential equation proposed a time-dependent neural network, which provides a neural network varying with respect to time. However, we claim that the architectural choice to build a time-dependent neural network significantly affects its time-awareness but still lacks sufficient validation in its current states. In this study, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the architecture of modern time-dependent neural networks. Here, we report a vulnerability of vanishing timestep embedding, which disables the time-awareness of a time-dependent neural network. Furthermore, we find that this vulnerability can also be observed in diffusion models because they employ a similar architecture that incorporates timestep embedding to discriminate between different timesteps during a diffusion process. Our analysis provides a detailed description of this phenomenon as well as several solutions to address the root cause. Through experiments on neural ordinary differential equations and diffusion models, we observed that ensuring alive time-awareness via proposed solutions boosted their performance, which implies that their current implementations lack sufficient time-dependency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikhilanj Pelluri</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual perception and navigation have emerged as major focus areas in the field of embodied artificial intelligence. We consider the task of image-goal navigation, where an agent is tasked to navigate to a goal specified by an image, relying only on images from an onboard camera. This task is particularly challenging since it demands robust scene understanding, goal-oriented planning and long-horizon navigation. Most existing approaches typically learn navigation policies reliant on recurrent neural networks trained via online reinforcement learning. However, training such policies requires substantial computational resources and time, and performance of these models is not reliable on long-horizon navigation. In this work, we present a generative Transformer based model that jointly models image goals, camera observations and the robot's past actions to predict future actions. We use state-of-the-art perception models and navigation policies to learn robust goal conditioned policies without the need for real-time interaction with the environment. Our model demonstrates capability in capturing and associating visual information across long time horizons, helping in effective navigation.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14129">AlignGPT: Multi-modal Large Language Models with Adaptive Alignment Capability</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Fei Zhao, Taotian Pang, Chunhui Li, Zhen Wu, Junjie Guo, Shangyu Xing, Xinyu Dai</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are widely regarded as crucial in the exploration of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). The core of MLLMs lies in their capability to achieve cross-modal alignment. To attain this goal, current MLLMs typically follow a two-phase training paradigm: the pre-training phase and the instruction-tuning phase. Despite their success, there are shortcomings in the modeling of alignment capabilities within these models. Firstly, during the pre-training phase, the model usually assumes that all image-text pairs are uniformly aligned, but in fact the degree of alignment between different image-text pairs is inconsistent. Secondly, the instructions currently used for finetuning incorporate a variety of tasks, different tasks's instructions usually require different levels of alignment capabilities, but previous MLLMs overlook these differentiated alignment needs. To tackle these issues, we propose a new multimodal large language model AlignGPT. In the pre-training stage, instead of treating all image-text pairs equally, we assign different levels of alignment capabilities to different image-text pairs. Then, in the instruction-tuning phase, we adaptively combine these different levels of alignment capabilities to meet the dynamic alignment needs of different instructions. Extensive experimental results show that our model achieves competitive performance on 12 benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Oleg I. Berngardt</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents an algorithm for searching for the minimum number of neurons in fully connected layers of an arbitrary network solving given problem, which does not require multiple training of the network with different number of neurons. The algorithm is based at training the initial wide network using the cross-validation method over at least two folds. Then by using truncated singular value decomposition autoencoder inserted after the studied layer of trained network we search the minimum number of neurons in inference only mode of the network.
  It is shown that the minimum number of neurons in a fully connected layer could be interpreted not as network hyperparameter associated with the other hyperparameters of the network, but as internal (latent) property of the solution, determined by the network architecture, the training dataset, layer position, and the quality metric used. So the minimum number of neurons can be estimated for each hidden fully connected layer independently. The proposed algorithm is the first approximation for estimating the minimum number of neurons in the layer, since, on the one hand, the algorithm does not guarantee that a neural network with the found number of neurons can be trained to the required quality, and on the other hand, it searches for the minimum number of neurons in a limited class of possible solutions.
  The solution was tested on several datasets in classification and regression problems.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the rising popularity of Large Language Models (LLMs), assessing their trustworthiness through security tasks has gained critical importance. Regarding the new task of universal goal hijacking, previous efforts have concentrated solely on optimization algorithms, overlooking the crucial role of the prompt. To fill this gap, we propose a universal goal hijacking method called POUGH that incorporates semantic-guided prompt processing strategies. Specifically, the method starts with a sampling strategy to select representative prompts from a candidate pool, followed by a ranking strategy that prioritizes the prompts. Once the prompts are organized sequentially, the method employs an iterative optimization algorithm to generate the universal fixed suffix for the prompts. Experiments conducted on four popular LLMs and ten types of target responses verified the effectiveness of our method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuofei Qiao, Runnan Fang, Ningyu Zhang, Yuqi Zhu, Xiang Chen, Shumin Deng, Yong Jiang, Pengjun Xie, Fei Huang, Huajun Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent endeavors towards directly using large language models (LLMs) as agent models to execute interactive planning tasks have shown commendable results. Despite their achievements, however, they still struggle with brainless trial-and-error in global planning and generating hallucinatory actions in local planning due to their poor understanding of the ''real'' physical world. Imitating humans' mental world knowledge model which provides global prior knowledge before the task and maintains local dynamic knowledge during the task, in this paper, we introduce parametric World Knowledge Model (WKM) to facilitate agent planning. Concretely, we steer the agent model to self-synthesize knowledge from both expert and sampled trajectories. Then we develop WKM, providing prior task knowledge to guide the global planning and dynamic state knowledge to assist the local planning. Experimental results on three complex real-world simulated datasets with three state-of-the-art open-source LLMs, Mistral-7B, Gemma-7B, and Llama-3-8B, demonstrate that our method can achieve superior performance compared to various strong baselines. Besides, we analyze to illustrate that our WKM can effectively alleviate the blind trial-and-error and hallucinatory action issues, providing strong support for the agent's understanding of the world. Other interesting findings include: 1) our instance-level task knowledge can generalize better to unseen tasks, 2) weak WKM can guide strong agent model planning, and 3) unified WKM training has promising potential for further development.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiwan Seo, Joonhyuk Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE) is an established technique in machine learning for learning discrete representations across various modalities. However, its scalability and applicability are limited by the need to retrain the model to adjust the codebook for different data or model scales. We introduce the Rate-Adaptive VQ-VAE (RAQ-VAE) framework, which addresses this challenge with two novel codebook representation methods: a model-based approach using a clustering-based technique on an existing well-trained VQ-VAE model, and a data-driven approach utilizing a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) model for variable-rate codebook generation. Our experiments demonstrate that RAQ-VAE achieves effective reconstruction performance across multiple rates, often outperforming conventional fixed-rate VQ-VAE models. This work enhances the adaptability and performance of VQ-VAEs, with broad applications in data reconstruction, generation, and computer vision tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammed Baharoon, Jonathan Klein, Dominik L. Michels</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language contrastive learning frameworks like CLIP enable learning representations from natural language supervision, and provide strong zero-shot classification capabilities. However, due to the nature of the supervisory signal in these paradigms, they lack the ability to learn localized features, leading to degraded performance on dense prediction tasks like segmentation and detection. On the other hand, self-supervised learning methods have shown the ability to learn granular representations, complementing the high-level features in vision-language training. In this work, we present Harmony, a framework that combines vision-language training with discriminative and generative self-supervision to learn visual features that can be generalized across vision downstream tasks. Our framework is specifically designed to work on web-scraped data by not relying on negative examples and addressing the one-to-one correspondence issue using soft CLIP targets generated by an EMA model. We comprehensively evaluate Harmony across various vision downstream tasks and find that it significantly outperforms the baseline CLIP and the previously leading joint self and weakly-supervised methods, MaskCLIP and SLIP. Specifically, when comparing against these methods, Harmony shows superior performance in fine-tuning and zero-shot classification on ImageNet-1k, semantic segmentation on ADE20K, and both object detection and instance segmentation on MS-COCO, when pre-training a ViT-S/16 on CC3M. We also show that Harmony outperforms other self-supervised learning methods like iBOT and MAE across all tasks evaluated. On https://github.com/MohammedSB/Harmony our code is publicly available.</p>

<p>Abstract: Malaria is a life-threatening infectious disease caused by Plasmodium parasites, which poses a significant public health challenge worldwide, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. Timely and accurate detection of malaria parasites in blood cells is crucial for effective treatment and control of the disease. In recent years, deep learning techniques have demonstrated remarkable success in medical image analysis tasks, offering promising avenues for improving diagnostic accuracy, with limited studies on hybrid mobile models due to the complexity of combining two distinct models and the significant memory demand of self-attention mechanism especially for edge devices. In this study, we explore the potential of designing a hybrid mobile model for efficient classification of plasmodium parasites in blood cell images. Therefore, we present M2ANET (Mobile Malaria Attention Network). The model integrates MBConv3 (MobileNetV3 blocks) for efficient capturing of local feature extractions within blood cell images and a modified global-MHSA (multi-head self-attention) mechanism in the latter stages of the network for capturing global context. Through extensive experimentation on benchmark, we demonstrate that M2ANET outperforms some state-of-the-art lightweight and mobile networks in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. Moreover, we discuss the potential implications of M2ANET in advancing malaria diagnosis and treatment, highlighting its suitability for deployment in resource-constrained healthcare settings. The development of M2ANET represents a significant advancement in the pursuit of efficient and accurate malaria detection, with broader implications for medical image analysis and global healthcare initiatives.</p>

<p>Abstract: Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a pivotal tool for assessing cardiac function. Precise segmentation of cardiac structures is imperative for accurate cardiac functional evaluation. This paper introduces a semi-supervised model for automatic segmentation of cardiac images and auxiliary diagnosis. By harnessing cardiac MRI images and necessitating only a small portion of annotated image data, the model achieves fully automated, high-precision segmentation of cardiac images, extraction of features, calculation of clinical indices, and prediction of diseases. The provided segmentation results, clinical indices, and prediction outcomes can aid physicians in diagnosis, thereby serving as auxiliary diagnostic tools. Experimental results showcase that this semi-supervised model for automatic segmentation of cardiac images and auxiliary diagnosis attains high accuracy in segmentation and correctness in prediction, demonstrating substantial practical guidance and application value.</p>

<p>Abstract: We demonstrate generating high-dynamic range (HDR) images using the concerted action of multiple black-box, pre-trained low-dynamic range (LDR) image diffusion models. Common diffusion models are not HDR as, first, there is no sufficiently large HDR image dataset available to re-train them, and second, even if it was, re-training such models is impossible for most compute budgets. Instead, we seek inspiration from the HDR image capture literature that traditionally fuses sets of LDR images, called "brackets", to produce a single HDR image. We operate multiple denoising processes to generate multiple LDR brackets that together form a valid HDR result. To this end, we introduce an exposure consistency term into the diffusion process to couple the brackets such that they agree across the exposure range they share. We demonstrate HDR versions of state-of-the-art unconditional and conditional as well as restoration-type (LDR2HDR) generative modeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikolaos Karaliolios, Herv\'e Le Borgne, Florian Chabot</p>
<p>Abstract: Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) seeks to leverage large amounts of non-annotated data along with the smallest amount possible of annotated data in order to achieve the same level of performance as if all data were annotated. A fruitful method in SSL is Pseudo-Labeling (PL), which, however, suffers from the important drawback that the associated loss function has discontinuities in its derivatives, which cause instabilities in performance when labels are very scarce. In the present work, we address this drawback with the introduction of a Smooth Pseudo-Labeling (SP L) loss function. It consists in adding a multiplicative factor in the loss function that smooths out the discontinuities in the derivative due to thresholding. In our experiments, we test our improvements on FixMatch and show that it significantly improves the performance in the regime of scarce labels, without addition of any modules, hyperparameters, or computational overhead. In the more stable regime of abundant labels, performance remains at the same level. Robustness with respect to variation of hyperparameters and training parameters is also significantly improved. Moreover, we introduce a new benchmark, where labeled images are selected randomly from the whole dataset, without imposing representation of each class proportional to its frequency in the dataset. We see that the smooth version of FixMatch does appear to perform better than the original, non-smooth implementation. However, more importantly, we notice that both implementations do not necessarily see their performance improve when labeled images are added, an important issue in the design of SSL algorithms that should be addressed so that Active Learning algorithms become more reliable and explainable.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guanxiong Luo, Shoujin Huang, Martin Uecker</p>
<p>Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a widely used non-invasive imaging modality. However, a persistent challenge lies in balancing image quality with imaging speed. This trade-off is primarily constrained by k-space measurements, which traverse specific trajectories in the spatial Fourier domain (k-space). These measurements are often undersampled to shorten acquisition times, resulting in image artifacts and compromised quality. Generative models learn image distributions and can be used to reconstruct high-quality images from undersampled k-space data. In this work, we present the autoregressive image diffusion (AID) model for image sequences and use it to sample the posterior for accelerated MRI reconstruction. The algorithm incorporates both undersampled k-space and pre-existing information. Models trained with fastMRI dataset are evaluated comprehensively. The results show that the AID model can robustly generate sequentially coherent image sequences. In 3D and dynamic MRI, the AID can outperform the standard diffusion model and reduce hallucinations, due to the learned inter-image dependencies.</p>

<p>Abstract: The choroid is a key vascular layer of the eye, supplying oxygen to the retinal photoreceptors. Non-invasive enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography (EDI-OCT) has recently improved access and visualisation of the choroid, making it an exciting frontier for discovering novel vascular biomarkers in ophthalmology and wider systemic health. However, current methods to measure the choroid often require use of multiple, independent semi-automatic and deep learning-based algorithms which are not made open-source. Previously, Choroidalyzer -- an open-source, fully automatic deep learning method trained on 5,600 OCT B-scans from 385 eyes -- was developed to fully segment and quantify the choroid in EDI-OCT images, thus addressing these issues. Using the same dataset, we propose a Robust, Resolution-agnostic and Efficient Attention-based network for CHoroid segmentation (REACH). REACHNet leverages multi-resolution training with domain-specific data augmentation to promote generalisation, and uses a lightweight architecture with resolution-agnostic self-attention which is not only faster than Choroidalyzer's previous network (4 images/s vs. 2.75 images/s on a standard laptop CPU), but has greater performance for segmenting the choroid region, vessels and fovea (Dice coefficient for region 0.9769 vs. 0.9749, vessels 0.8612 vs. 0.8192 and fovea 0.8243 vs. 0.3783) due to its improved hyperparameter configuration and model training pipeline. REACHNet can be used with Choroidalyzer as a drop-in replacement for the original model and will be made available upon publication.</p>

We also investigate the training methodologies and the decoder architecture of LiteVAE and propose several enhancements that improve the training dynamics and reconstruction quality. Our base LiteVAE model matches the quality of the established VAEs in current LDMs with a six-fold reduction in encoder parameters, leading to faster training and lower GPU memory requirements, while our larger model outperforms VAEs of comparable complexity across all evaluated metrics (rFID, LPIPS, PSNR, and SSIM).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuya Yoshikawa, Masanari Kimura, Ryotaro Shimizu, Yuki Saito</p>
<p>Abstract: Techniques that explain the predictions of black-box machine learning models are crucial to make the models transparent, thereby increasing trust in AI systems. The input features to the models often have a nested structure that consists of high- and low-level features, and each high-level feature is decomposed into multiple low-level features. For such inputs, both high-level feature attributions (HiFAs) and low-level feature attributions (LoFAs) are important for better understanding the model's decision. In this paper, we propose a model-agnostic local explanation method that effectively exploits the nested structure of the input to estimate the two-level feature attributions simultaneously. A key idea of the proposed method is to introduce the consistency property that should exist between the HiFAs and LoFAs, thereby bridging the separate optimization problems for estimating them. Thanks to this consistency property, the proposed method can produce HiFAs and LoFAs that are both faithful to the black-box models and consistent with each other, using a smaller number of queries to the models. In experiments on image classification in multiple instance learning and text classification using language models, we demonstrate that the HiFAs and LoFAs estimated by the proposed method are accurate, faithful to the behaviors of the black-box models, and provide consistent explanations.</p>

<p>Abstract: The presence of motion artifacts in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans poses a significant challenge, where even minor patient movements can lead to artifacts that may compromise the scan's utility. This paper introduces Masked Motion Correction (MAMOC), a novel method designed to address the issue of Retrospective Artifact Correction (RAC) in motion-affected MRI brain scans. MAMOC uses masked autoencoding self-supervision and test-time prediction to efficiently remove motion artifacts, producing state-of-the-art, native resolution scans. Until recently, realistic data to evaluate retrospective motion correction methods did not exist, motion artifacts had to be simulated. Leveraging the MR-ART dataset, this work is the first to evaluate motion correction in MRI scans using real motion data, showing the superiority of MAMOC to existing motion correction (MC) methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiyang Zhou, Zhiyuan Fan, Dongjie Cheng, Sihan Yang, Zhaorun Chen, Chenhang Cui, Xiyao Wang, Yun Li, Linjun Zhang, Huaxiu Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made substantial progress by integrating pre-trained large language models (LLMs) and vision models through instruction tuning. Despite these advancements, LVLMs often exhibit the hallucination phenomenon, where generated text responses appear linguistically plausible but contradict the input image, indicating a misalignment between image and text pairs. This misalignment arises because the model tends to prioritize textual information over visual input, even when both the language model and visual representations are of high quality. Existing methods leverage additional models or human annotations to curate preference data and enhance modality alignment through preference optimization. These approaches may not effectively reflect the target LVLM's preferences, making the curated preferences easily distinguishable. Our work addresses these challenges by proposing the Calibrated Self-Rewarding (CSR) approach, which enables the model to self-improve by iteratively generating candidate responses, evaluating the reward for each response, and curating preference data for fine-tuning. In the reward modeling, we employ a step-wise strategy and incorporate visual constraints into the self-rewarding process to place greater emphasis on visual input. Empirical results demonstrate that CSR enhances performance and reduces hallucinations across ten benchmarks and tasks, achieving substantial improvements over existing methods by 7.62%. Our empirical results are further supported by rigorous theoretical analysis, under mild assumptions, verifying the effectiveness of introducing visual constraints into the self-rewarding paradigm. Additionally, CSR shows compatibility with different vision-language models and the ability to incrementally improve performance through iterative fine-tuning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aditya Jonnalagadda, Bruno B. Barufaldi, Andrew D. A. Maidment, Susan P. Weinstein, Craig K. Abbey, Miguel P. Eckstein</p>
<p>Abstract: Model observers are computational tools to evaluate and optimize task-based medical image quality. Linear model observers, such as the Channelized Hotelling Observer (CHO), predict human accuracy in detection tasks with a few possible signal locations in clinical phantoms or real anatomic backgrounds. In recent years, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been proposed as a new type of model observer. What is not well understood is what CNNs add over the more common linear model observer approaches. We compare the CHO and CNN detection accuracy to the radiologist's accuracy in searching for two types of signals (mass and microcalcification) embedded in 2D/3D breast tomosynthesis phantoms (DBT). We show that the CHO model's accuracy is comparable to the CNN's performance for a location-known-exactly detection task. However, for the search task with 2D/3D DBT phantoms, the CHO's detection accuracy was significantly lower than the CNN accuracy. A comparison to the radiologist's accuracy showed that the CNN but not the CHO could match or exceed the radiologist's accuracy in the 2D microcalcification and 3D mass search conditions. An analysis of the eye position showed that radiologists fixated more often and longer at the locations corresponding to CNN false positives. Most CHO false positives were the phantom's normal anatomy and were not fixated by radiologists. In conclusion, we show that CNNs can be used as an anthropomorphic model observer for the search task for which traditional linear model observers fail due to their inability to discount false positives arising from the anatomical backgrounds.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Zhou, Long Quang, Carlos Nieto-Granda, Giuseppe Loianno</p>
<p>Abstract: In the past decade, although single-robot perception has made significant advancements, the exploration of multi-robot collaborative perception remains largely unexplored. This involves fusing compressed, intermittent, limited, heterogeneous, and asynchronous environmental information across multiple robots to enhance overall perception, despite challenges like sensor noise, occlusions, and sensor failures. One major hurdle has been the lack of real-world datasets. This paper presents a pioneering and comprehensive real-world multi-robot collaborative perception dataset to boost research in this area. Our dataset leverages the untapped potential of air-ground robot collaboration featuring distinct spatial viewpoints, complementary robot mobilities, coverage ranges, and sensor modalities. It features raw sensor inputs, pose estimation, and optional high-level perception annotation, thus accommodating diverse research interests. Compared to existing datasets predominantly designed for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), our setup ensures a diverse range and adequate overlap of sensor views to facilitate the study of multi-robot collaborative perception algorithms. We demonstrate the value of this dataset qualitatively through multiple collaborative perception tasks. We believe this work will unlock the potential research of high-level scene understanding through multi-modal collaborative perception in multi-robot settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peng Wang, Zexi Li, Ningyu Zhang, Ziwen Xu, Yunzhi Yao, Yong Jiang, Pengjun Xie, Fei Huang, Huajun Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) need knowledge updates to meet the ever-growing world facts and correct the hallucinated responses, facilitating the methods of lifelong model editing. Where the updated knowledge resides in memories is a fundamental question for model editing. In this paper, we find that editing either long-term memory (direct model parameters) or working memory (non-parametric knowledge of neural network activations/representations by retrieval) will result in an impossible triangle -- reliability, generalization, and locality can not be realized together in the lifelong editing settings. For long-term memory, directly editing the parameters will cause conflicts with irrelevant pretrained knowledge or previous edits (poor reliability and locality). For working memory, retrieval-based activations can hardly make the model understand the edits and generalize (poor generalization). Therefore, we propose WISE to bridge the gap between memories. In WISE, we design a dual parametric memory scheme, which consists of the main memory for the pretrained knowledge and a side memory for the edited knowledge. We only edit the knowledge in the side memory and train a router to decide which memory to go through when given a query. For continual editing, we devise a knowledge-sharding mechanism where different sets of edits reside in distinct subspaces of parameters, and are subsequently merged into a shared memory without conflicts. Extensive experiments show that WISE can outperform previous model editing methods and overcome the impossible triangle under lifelong model editing of question answering, hallucination, and out-of-distribution settings across trending LLM architectures, e.g., GPT, LLaMA, and Mistral.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Royson Lee, Javier Fernandez-Marques, Shell Xu Hu, Da Li, Stefanos Laskaridis, {\L}ukasz Dudziak, Timothy Hospedales, Ferenc Husz\'ar, Nicholas D. Lane</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has enabled distributed learning of a model across multiple clients in a privacy-preserving manner. One of the main challenges of FL is to accommodate clients with varying hardware capacities; clients have differing compute and memory requirements. To tackle this challenge, recent state-of-the-art approaches leverage the use of early exits. Nonetheless, these approaches fall short of mitigating the challenges of joint learning multiple exit classifiers, often relying on hand-picked heuristic solutions for knowledge distillation among classifiers and/or utilizing additional layers for weaker classifiers. In this work, instead of utilizing multiple classifiers, we propose a recurrent early exit approach named ReeFL that fuses features from different sub-models into a single shared classifier. Specifically, we use a transformer-based early-exit module shared among sub-models to i) better exploit multi-layer feature representations for task-specific prediction and ii) modulate the feature representation of the backbone model for subsequent predictions. We additionally present a per-client self-distillation approach where the best sub-model is automatically selected as the teacher of the other sub-models at each client. Our experiments on standard image and speech classification benchmarks across various emerging federated fine-tuning baselines demonstrate ReeFL's effectiveness over previous works.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shengfang Zhai, Huanran Chen, Yinpeng Dong, Jiajun Li, Qingni Shen, Yansong Gao, Hang Su, Yang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved tremendous success in the field of controllable image generation, while also coming along with issues of privacy leakage and data copyrights. Membership inference arises in these contexts as a potential auditing method for detecting unauthorized data usage. While some efforts have been made on diffusion models, they are not applicable to text-to-image diffusion models due to the high computation overhead and enhanced generalization capabilities. In this paper, we first identify a conditional overfitting phenomenon in text-to-image diffusion models, indicating that these models tend to overfit the conditional distribution of images given the text rather than the marginal distribution of images. Based on this observation, we derive an analytical indicator, namely Conditional Likelihood Discrepancy (CLiD), to perform membership inference. This indicator reduces the stochasticity in estimating the memorization of individual samples. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous methods across various data distributions and scales. Additionally, our method shows superior resistance to overfitting mitigation strategies such as early stopping and data augmentation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongxu Jiang, Muhammad Imran, Linhai Ma, Teng Zhang, Yuyin Zhou, Muxuan Liang, Kuang Gong, Wei Shao</p>
<p>Abstract: Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have achieved unprecedented success in computer vision. However, they remain underutilized in medical imaging, a field crucial for disease diagnosis and treatment planning. This is primarily due to the high computational cost associated with (1) the use of large number of time steps (e.g., 1,000) in diffusion processes and (2) the increased dimensionality of medical images, which are often 3D or 4D. Training a diffusion model on medical images typically takes days to weeks, while sampling each image volume takes minutes to hours. To address this challenge, we introduce Fast-DDPM, a simple yet effective approach capable of improving training speed, sampling speed, and generation quality simultaneously. Unlike DDPM, which trains the image denoiser across 1,000 time steps, Fast-DDPM trains and samples using only 10 time steps. The key to our method lies in aligning the training and sampling procedures. We introduced two efficient noise schedulers with 10 time steps: one with uniform time step sampling and another with non-uniform sampling. We evaluated Fast-DDPM across three medical image-to-image generation tasks: multi-image super-resolution, image denoising, and image-to-image translation. Fast-DDPM outperformed DDPM and current state-of-the-art methods based on convolutional networks and generative adversarial networks in all tasks. Additionally, Fast-DDPM reduced training time by a factor of 5 and sampling time by a factor of 100 compared to DDPM. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/mirthAI/Fast-DDPM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuri Ge, Joemon M. Jose, Songpei Xu, Xiao Liu, Hu Han</p>
<p>Abstract: The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) encodes the action units (AUs) in facial images, which has attracted extensive research attention due to its wide use in facial expression analysis. Many methods that perform well on automatic facial action unit (AU) detection primarily focus on modeling various types of AU relations between corresponding local muscle areas, or simply mining global attention-aware facial features, however, neglect the dynamic interactions among local-global features. We argue that encoding AU features just from one perspective may not capture the rich contextual information between regional and global face features, as well as the detailed variability across AUs, because of the diversity in expression and individual characteristics. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-level Graph Relational Reasoning Network (termed MGRR-Net) for facial AU detection. Each layer of MGRR-Net performs a multi-level (i.e., region-level, pixel-wise and channel-wise level) feature learning. While the region-level feature learning from local face patches features via graph neural network can encode the correlation across different AUs, the pixel-wise and channel-wise feature learning via graph attention network can enhance the discrimination ability of AU features from global face features. The fused features from the three levels lead to improved AU discriminative ability. Extensive experiments on DISFA and BP4D AU datasets show that the proposed approach achieves superior performance than the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juan Miguel Valverde, Artem Shatillo, Jussi Tohka</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Sauron, a filter pruning method that eliminates redundant feature maps of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Sauron optimizes, jointly with the loss function, a regularization term that promotes feature maps clustering at each convolutional layer by reducing the distance between feature maps. Sauron then eliminates the filters corresponding to the redundant feature maps by using automatically adjusted layer-specific thresholds. Unlike most filter pruning methods, Sauron requires minimal changes to typical neural network optimization because it prunes and optimizes CNNs jointly, which, in turn, accelerates the optimization over time. Moreover, unlike with other cluster-based approaches, the user does not need to specify the number of clusters in advance, a hyperparameter that is difficult to tune. We evaluated Sauron and five state-of-the-art filter pruning methods on four medical image segmentation tasks. This is an area where little attention has been paid to filter pruning, but where smaller CNN models are desirable for local deployment, mitigating privacy concerns associated with cloud-based solutions. Sauron was the only method that achieved a reduction in model size of over 90% without deteriorating substantially the performance. Sauron also achieved, overall, the fastest models at inference time in machines with and without GPUs. Finally, we show through experiments that the feature maps of models pruned with Sauron are highly interpretable, which is essential for medical image segmentation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Semantic segmentation from aerial views is a crucial task for autonomous drones, as they rely on precise and accurate segmentation to navigate safely and efficiently. However, aerial images present unique challenges such as diverse viewpoints, extreme scale variations, and high scene complexity. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end multi-class semantic segmentation diffusion model that addresses these challenges. We introduce recursive denoising to allow information to propagate through the denoising process, as well as a hierarchical multi-scale approach that complements the diffusion process. Our method achieves promising results on the UAVid dataset and state-of-the-art performance on the Vaihingen Building segmentation benchmark. Being the first iteration of this method, it shows great promise for future improvements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zidong Cao, Hao Ai, Athanasios V. Vasilakos, Lin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: To predict high-resolution (HR) omnidirectional depth map, existing methods typically leverage HR omnidirectional image (ODI) as the input via fully-supervised learning. However, in practice, taking HR ODI as input is undesired due to resource-constrained devices. In addition, depth maps are often with lower resolution than color images. Therefore, in this paper, we explore for the first time to estimate the HR omnidirectional depth directly from a low-resolution (LR) ODI, when no HR depth GT map is available. Our key idea is to transfer the scene structural knowledge from the HR image modality and the corresponding LR depth maps to achieve the goal of HR depth estimation without any extra inference cost. Specifically, we introduce ODI super-resolution (SR) as an auxiliary task and train both tasks collaboratively in a weakly supervised manner to boost the performance of HR depth estimation. The ODI SR task extracts the scene structural knowledge via uncertainty estimation. Buttressed by this, a scene structural knowledge transfer (SSKT) module is proposed with two key components. First, we employ a cylindrical implicit interpolation function (CIIF) to learn cylindrical neural interpolation weights for feature up-sampling and share the parameters of CIIFs between the two tasks. Then, we propose a feature distillation (FD) loss that provides extra structural regularization to help the HR depth estimation task learn more scene structural knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our weakly-supervised method outperforms baseline methods, and even achieves comparable performance with the fully-supervised methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dillon Reis, Jordan Kupec, Jacqueline Hong, Ahmad Daoudi</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a generalized model for real-time detection of flying objects that can be used for transfer learning and further research, as well as a refined model that achieves state-of-the-art results for flying object detection. We achieve this by training our first (generalized) model on a data set containing 40 different classes of flying objects, forcing the model to extract abstract feature representations. We then perform transfer learning with these learned parameters on a data set more representative of real world environments (i.e. higher frequency of occlusion, very small spatial sizes, rotations, etc.) to generate our refined model. Object detection of flying objects remains challenging due to large variances of object spatial sizes/aspect ratios, rate of speed, occlusion, and clustered backgrounds. To address some of the presented challenges while simultaneously maximizing performance, we utilize the current state-of-the-art single-shot detector, YOLOv8, in an attempt to find the best trade-off between inference speed and mean average precision (mAP). While YOLOv8 is being regarded as the new state-of-the-art, an official paper has not been released as of yet. Thus, we provide an in-depth explanation of the new architecture and functionality that YOLOv8 has adapted. Our final generalized model achieves a mAP50 of 79.2%, mAP50-95 of 68.5%, and an average inference speed of 50 frames per second (fps) on 1080p videos. Our final refined model maintains this inference speed and achieves an improved mAP50 of 99.1% and mAP50-95 of 83.5%</p>

<p>Abstract: The tremendous recent advances in generative artificial intelligence techniques have led to significant successes and promise in a wide range of different applications ranging from conversational agents and textual content generation to voice and visual synthesis. Amid the rise in generative AI and its increasing widespread adoption, there has been significant growing concern over the use of generative AI for malicious purposes. In the realm of visual content synthesis using generative AI, key areas of significant concern has been image forgery (e.g., generation of images containing or derived from copyright content), and data poisoning (i.e., generation of adversarially contaminated images). Motivated to address these key concerns to encourage responsible generative AI, we introduce the DeepfakeArt Challenge, a large-scale challenge benchmark dataset designed specifically to aid in the building of machine learning algorithms for generative AI art forgery and data poisoning detection. Comprising of over 32,000 records across a variety of generative forgery and data poisoning techniques, each entry consists of a pair of images that are either forgeries / adversarially contaminated or not. Each of the generated images in the DeepfakeArt Challenge benchmark dataset \footnote{The link to the dataset: http://anon\_for\_review.com} has been quality checked in a comprehensive manner.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emanuele Ballarin, Alessio Ansuini, Luca Bortolussi</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel adversarial defence mechanism for image classification - CARSO - blending the paradigms of adversarial training and adversarial purification in a synergistic robustness-enhancing way. The method builds upon an adversarially-trained classifier, and learns to map its internal representation associated with a potentially perturbed input onto a distribution of tentative clean reconstructions. Multiple samples from such distribution are classified by the same adversarially-trained model, and an aggregation of its outputs finally constitutes the robust prediction of interest. Experimental evaluation by a well-established benchmark of strong adaptive attacks, across different image datasets, shows that CARSO is able to defend itself against adaptive end-to-end white-box attacks devised for stochastic defences. Paying a modest clean accuracy toll, our method improves by a significant margin the state-of-the-art for CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet-200 $\ell_\infty$ robust classification accuracy against AutoAttack.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matthias Minderer, Alexey Gritsenko, Neil Houlsby</p>
<p>Abstract: Open-vocabulary object detection has benefited greatly from pretrained vision-language models, but is still limited by the amount of available detection training data. While detection training data can be expanded by using Web image-text pairs as weak supervision, this has not been done at scales comparable to image-level pretraining. Here, we scale up detection data with self-training, which uses an existing detector to generate pseudo-box annotations on image-text pairs. Major challenges in scaling self-training are the choice of label space, pseudo-annotation filtering, and training efficiency. We present the OWLv2 model and OWL-ST self-training recipe, which address these challenges. OWLv2 surpasses the performance of previous state-of-the-art open-vocabulary detectors already at comparable training scales (~10M examples). However, with OWL-ST, we can scale to over 1B examples, yielding further large improvement: With an L/14 architecture, OWL-ST improves AP on LVIS rare classes, for which the model has seen no human box annotations, from 31.2% to 44.6% (43% relative improvement). OWL-ST unlocks Web-scale training for open-world localization, similar to what has been seen for image classification and language modelling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siqi Fan, Haibao Yu, Wenxian Yang, Jirui Yuan, Zaiqing Nie</p>
<p>Abstract: Cooperative perception can effectively enhance individual perception performance by providing additional viewpoint and expanding the sensing field. Existing cooperation paradigms are either interpretable (result cooperation) or flexible (feature cooperation). In this paper, we propose the concept of query cooperation to enable interpretable instance-level flexible feature interaction. To specifically explain the concept, we propose a cooperative perception framework, termed QUEST, which let query stream flow among agents. The cross-agent queries are interacted via fusion for co-aware instances and complementation for individual unaware instances. Taking camera-based vehicle-infrastructure perception as a typical practical application scene, the experimental results on the real-world dataset, DAIR-V2X-Seq, demonstrate the effectiveness of QUEST and further reveal the advantage of the query cooperation paradigm on transmission flexibility and robustness to packet dropout. We hope our work can further facilitate the cross-agent representation interaction for better cooperative perception in practice.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruian He, Zhen Xing, Weimin Tan, Bo Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised representation learning has gained increasing attention for strong generalization ability without relying on paired datasets. However, it has not been explored sufficiently for facial representation. Self-supervised facial representation learning remains unsolved due to the coupling of facial identities, expressions, and external factors like pose and light. Prior methods primarily focus on contrastive learning and pixel-level consistency, leading to limited interpretability and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose LatentFace, a novel generative framework for self-supervised facial representations. We suggest that the disentangling problem can be also formulated as generative objectives in space and time, and propose the solution using a 3D-aware latent diffusion model. First, we introduce a 3D-aware autoencoder to encode face images into 3D latent embeddings. Second, we propose a novel representation diffusion model to disentangle 3D latent into facial identity and expression. Consequently, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in facial expression recognition (FER) and face verification among self-supervised facial representation learning models. Our model achieves a 3.75\% advantage in FER accuracy on RAF-DB and 3.35\% on AffectNet compared to SOTA methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: The fine-tuning paradigm in addressing long-tail learning tasks has sparked significant interest since the emergence of foundation models. Nonetheless, how fine-tuning impacts performance in long-tail learning was not explicitly quantified. In this paper, we disclose that heavy fine-tuning may even lead to non-negligible performance deterioration on tail classes, and lightweight fine-tuning is more effective. The reason is attributed to inconsistent class conditions caused by heavy fine-tuning. With the observation above, we develop a low-complexity and accurate long-tail learning algorithms LIFT with the goal of facilitating fast prediction and compact models by adaptive lightweight fine-tuning. Experiments clearly verify that both the training time and the learned parameters are significantly reduced with more accurate predictive performance compared with state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinrong Zhang, Wujun Wen, Shenglan Liu, Yunheng Li, Qifeng Li, Lin Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: The streaming temporal action segmentation (STAS) task, a supplementary task of temporal action segmentation (TAS), has not received adequate attention in the field of video understanding. Existing TAS methods are constrained to offline scenarios due to their heavy reliance on multimodal features and complete contextual information. The STAS task requires the model to classify each frame of the entire untrimmed video sequence clip by clip in time, thereby extending the applicability of TAS methods to online scenarios. However, directly applying existing TAS methods to SATS tasks results in significantly poor segmentation outcomes. In this paper, we thoroughly analyze the fundamental differences between STAS tasks and TAS tasks, attributing the severe performance degradation when transferring models to model bias and optimization dilemmas. We introduce an end-to-end streaming video temporal action segmentation model with reinforcement learning (SVTAS-RL). The end-to-end modeling method mitigates the modeling bias introduced by the change in task nature and enhances the feasibility of online solutions. Reinforcement learning is utilized to alleviate the optimization dilemma. Through extensive experiments, the SVTAS-RL model significantly outperforms existing STAS models and achieves competitive performance to the state-of-the-art TAS model on multiple datasets under the same evaluation criteria, demonstrating notable advantages on the ultra-long video dataset EGTEA.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingming Zhang, Qingjie Liu, Yunhong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning representations through self-supervision on unlabeled data has proven highly effective for understanding diverse images. However, remote sensing images often have complex and densely populated scenes with multiple land objects and no clear foreground objects. This intrinsic property generates high object density, resulting in false positive pairs or missing contextual information in self-supervised learning. To address these problems, we propose a context-enhanced masked image modeling method (CtxMIM), a simple yet efficient MIM-based self-supervised learning for remote sensing image understanding. CtxMIM formulates original image patches as a reconstructive template and employs a Siamese framework to operate on two sets of image patches. A context-enhanced generative branch is introduced to provide contextual information through context consistency constraints in the reconstruction. With the simple and elegant design, CtxMIM encourages the pre-training model to learn object-level or pixel-level features on a large-scale dataset without specific temporal or geographical constraints. Finally, extensive experiments show that features learned by CtxMIM outperform fully supervised and state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods on various downstream tasks, including land cover classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation. These results demonstrate that CtxMIM learns impressive remote sensing representations with high generalization and transferability. Code and data will be made public available.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in 3D generation have been remarkable, with methods such as DreamFusion leveraging large-scale text-to-image diffusion-based models to supervise 3D object generation. These methods enable the synthesis of detailed and photorealistic textured objects. However, the appearance of 3D objects produced by these text-to-3D models is unpredictable, and it is hard for the single-image-to-3D methods to deal with complex images, thus posing a challenge in generating appearance-controllable 3D objects. To achieve controllable complex 3D object synthesis, we propose IPDreamer, a novel approach that incorporates image prompt adaption to extract detailed and comprehensive appearance features from complex images, which are then utilized for 3D object generation. Our results demonstrate that IPDreamer effectively generates high-quality 3D objects that are consistent with both the provided text and the appearance of complex image prompts, demonstrating its promising capability in appearance-controllable 3D object generation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyu Zhang, Meng Liu, Yaowei Wang, Da Cao, Weili Guan, Liqiang Nie</p>
<p>Abstract: In contrast to conventional visual question answering, video-grounded dialog necessitates a profound understanding of both dialog history and video content for accurate response generation. Despite commendable progress made by existing approaches, they still face the challenges of incrementally understanding complex dialog history and assimilating video information. In response to these challenges, we present an iterative search and reasoning framework, which consists of a textual encoder, a visual encoder, and a generator. Specifically, we devise a path search and aggregation strategy in the textual encoder, mining core cues from dialog history that are pivotal to understanding the posed questions. Concurrently, our visual encoder harnesses an iterative reasoning network to extract and emphasize critical visual markers from videos, enhancing the depth of visual comprehension. Finally, we utilize the pre-trained GPT-2 model as our answer generator to decode the mined hidden clues into coherent and contextualized answers. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our proposed framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bo Peng, Xinyuan Chen, Yaohui Wang, Chaochao Lu, Yu Qiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent works have successfully extended large-scale text-to-image models to the video domain, producing promising results but at a high computational cost and requiring a large amount of video data. In this work, we introduce ConditionVideo, a training-free approach to text-to-video generation based on the provided condition, video, and input text, by leveraging the power of off-the-shelf text-to-image generation methods (e.g., Stable Diffusion). ConditionVideo generates realistic dynamic videos from random noise or given scene videos. Our method explicitly disentangles the motion representation into condition-guided and scenery motion components. To this end, the ConditionVideo model is designed with a UNet branch and a control branch. To improve temporal coherence, we introduce sparse bi-directional spatial-temporal attention (sBiST-Attn). The 3D control network extends the conventional 2D controlnet model, aiming to strengthen conditional generation accuracy by additionally leveraging the bi-directional frames in the temporal domain. Our method exhibits superior performance in terms of frame consistency, clip score, and conditional accuracy, outperforming other compared methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shashanka Venkataramanan, Mamshad Nayeem Rizve, Jo\~ao Carreira, Yuki M. Asano, Yannis Avrithis</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning has unlocked the potential of scaling up pretraining to billions of images, since annotation is unnecessary. But are we making the best use of data? How more economical can we be? In this work, we attempt to answer this question by making two contributions. First, we investigate first-person videos and introduce a "Walking Tours" dataset. These videos are high-resolution, hours-long, captured in a single uninterrupted take, depicting a large number of objects and actions with natural scene transitions. They are unlabeled and uncurated, thus realistic for self-supervision and comparable with human learning.
  Second, we introduce a novel self-supervised image pretraining method tailored for learning from continuous videos. Existing methods typically adapt image-based pretraining approaches to incorporate more frames. Instead, we advocate a "tracking to learn to recognize" approach. Our method called DoRA, leads to attention maps that Discover and tRAck objects over time in an end-to-end manner, using transformer cross-attention. We derive multiple views from the tracks and use them in a classical self-supervised distillation loss. Using our novel approach, a single Walking Tours video remarkably becomes a strong competitor to ImageNet for several image and video downstream tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoxiang Wang, Pavan Kumar Anasosalu Vasu, Fartash Faghri, Raviteja Vemulapalli, Mehrdad Farajtabar, Sachin Mehta, Mohammad Rastegari, Oncel Tuzel, Hadi Pouransari</p>
<p>Abstract: The landscape of publicly available vision foundation models (VFMs), such as CLIP and Segment Anything Model (SAM), is expanding rapidly. VFMs are endowed with distinct capabilities stemming from their pre-training objectives. For instance, CLIP excels in semantic understanding, while SAM specializes in spatial understanding for segmentation. In this work, we introduce a simple recipe to efficiently merge VFMs into a unified model that absorbs their expertise. Our method integrates techniques of multi-task learning, continual learning, and distillation. Further, it demands significantly less computational cost compared to traditional multi-task training from scratch, and it only needs a small fraction of the pre-training datasets that were initially used to train individual models. By applying our method to SAM and CLIP, we obtain SAM-CLIP: a unified model that combines the capabilities of SAM and CLIP into a single vision transformer. Compared with deploying SAM and CLIP independently, our merged model, SAM-CLIP, reduces storage and compute costs for inference, making it well-suited for edge device applications. We show that SAM-CLIP not only retains the foundational strengths of SAM and CLIP, but also introduces synergistic functionalities, notably in zero-shot semantic segmentation, where SAM-CLIP establishes new state-of-the-art results on 5 benchmarks. It outperforms previous models that are specifically designed for this task by a large margin, including +6.8% and +5.9% mean IoU improvement on Pascal-VOC and COCO-Stuff datasets, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> S. M. Nabil Ashraf, Md. Adyelullahil Mamun, Hasnat Md. Abdullah, Md. Golam Rabiul Alam</p>
<p>Abstract: Chest X-rays are widely used to diagnose thoracic diseases, but the lack of detailed information about these abnormalities makes it challenging to develop accurate automated diagnosis systems, which is crucial for early detection and effective treatment. To address this challenge, we employed deep learning techniques to identify patterns in chest X-rays that correspond to different diseases. We conducted experiments on the "ChestX-ray14" dataset using various pre-trained CNNs, transformers, hybrid(CNN+Transformer) models and classical models. The best individual model was the CoAtNet, which achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 84.2%. By combining the predictions of all trained models using a weighted average ensemble where the weight of each model was determined using differential evolution, we further improved the AUROC to 85.4%, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods in this field. Our findings demonstrate the potential of deep learning techniques, particularly ensemble deep learning, for improving the accuracy of automatic diagnosis of thoracic diseases from chest X-rays.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Yue, Xiaoling Liu, Qing Zhao, Jianqiang Li, Changwei Song, Suqin Liu, Zhikai Yang, Guanghui Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: Ultrasound imaging plays a critical role in the early detection of breast cancer. Accurate identification and segmentation of lesions are essential steps in clinical practice, requiring methods to assist physicians in lesion segmentation. However, ultrasound lesion segmentation models based on supervised learning require extensive manual labeling, which is both time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this study, we present a novel framework for weakly supervised lesion segmentation in early breast ultrasound images. Our method uses morphological enhancement and class activation map (CAM)-guided localization. Finally, we employ the Segment Anything Model (SAM), a computer vision foundation model, for detailed segmentation. This approach does not require pixel-level annotation, thereby reducing the cost of data annotation. The performance of our method is comparable to supervised learning methods that require manual annotations, achieving a Dice score of 74.39% and outperforming comparative supervised models in terms of Hausdorff distance in the BUSI dataset. These results demonstrate that our framework effectively integrates weakly supervised learning with SAM, providing a promising solution for breast cancer image analysis.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuan Zhang, Tao Huang, Jiaming Liu, Tao Jiang, Kuan Cheng, Shanghang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) has been applied to various tasks successfully, and mainstream methods typically boost the student model via spatial imitation losses. However, the consecutive downsamplings induced in the spatial domain of teacher model is a type of corruption, hindering the student from analyzing what specific information needs to be imitated, which results in accuracy degradation. To better understand the underlying pattern of corrupted feature maps, we shift our attention to the frequency domain. During frequency distillation, we encounter a new challenge: the low-frequency bands convey general but minimal context, while the high are more informative but also introduce noise. Not each pixel within the frequency bands contributes equally to the performance. To address the above problem: (1) We propose the Frequency Prompt plugged into the teacher model, absorbing the semantic frequency context during finetuning. (2) During the distillation period, a pixel-wise frequency mask is generated via Frequency Prompt, to localize those pixel of interests (PoIs) in various frequency bands. Additionally, we employ a position-aware relational frequency loss for dense prediction tasks, delivering a high-order spatial enhancement to the student model. We dub our Frequency Knowledge Distillation method as FreeKD, which determines the optimal localization and extent for the frequency distillation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FreeKD not only outperforms spatial-based distillation methods consistently on dense prediction tasks (e.g., FreeKD brings 3.8 AP gains for RepPoints-R50 on COCO2017 and 4.55 mIoU gains for PSPNet-R18 on Cityscapes), but also conveys more robustness to the student. Notably, we also validate the generalization of our approach on large-scale vision models (e.g., DINO and SAM).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guangming Cao, Xuehui Yu, Wenwen Yu, Xumeng Han, Xue Yang, Guorong Li, Jianbin Jiao, Zhenjun Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Single-point annotation in oriented object detection of remote sensing scenarios is gaining increasing attention due to its cost-effectiveness. However, due to the granularity ambiguity of points, there is a significant performance gap between previous methods and those with fully supervision. In this study, we introduce P2RBox, which employs point prompt to generate rotated box (RBox) annotation for oriented object detection. P2RBox employs the SAM model to generate high-quality mask proposals. These proposals are then refined using the semantic and spatial information from annotation points. The best masks are converted into oriented boxes based on the feature directions suggested by the model. P2RBox incorporates two advanced guidance cues: Boundary Sensitive Mask guidance, which leverages semantic information, and Centrality guidance, which utilizes spatial information to reduce granularity ambiguity. This combination enhances detection capabilities significantly. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this method, enhancements based on the baseline were observed by integrating three different detectors. Furthermore, compared to the state-of-the-art point-annotated generative method PointOBB, P2RBox outperforms by about 29% mAP (62.43% vs 33.31%) on DOTA-v1.0 dataset, which provides possibilities for the practical application of point annotations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anil Batra, Davide Moltisanti, Laura Sevilla-Lara, Marcus Rohrbach, Frank Keller</p>
<p>Abstract: Procedural videos, exemplified by recipe demonstrations, are instrumental in conveying step-by-step instructions. However, understanding such videos is challenging as it involves the precise localization of steps and the generation of textual instructions. Manually annotating steps and writing instructions is costly, which limits the size of current datasets and hinders effective learning. Leveraging large but noisy video-transcript datasets for pre-training can boost performance but demands significant computational resources. Furthermore, transcripts contain irrelevant content and differ in style from human-written instructions. To mitigate these issues, we propose a novel technique, Sieve-&-Swap, to automatically generate high quality training data for the recipe domain: (i) Sieve filters irrelevant transcripts and (ii) Swap acquires high quality text by replacing transcripts with human-written instruction from a text-only recipe dataset. The resulting dataset is three orders of magnitude smaller than current web-scale datasets but enables efficient training of large-scale models. Alongside Sieve-&-Swap, we propose Procedure Transformer (ProcX), a model for end-to-end step localization and instruction generation for procedural videos. When pre-trained on our curated dataset, this model achieves state-of-the-art performance on YouCook2 and Tasty while using a fraction of the training data. Our code and dataset will be publicly released.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kunchang Li, Yali Wang, Yinan He, Yizhuo Li, Yi Wang, Yi Liu, Zun Wang, Jilan Xu, Guo Chen, Ping Luo, Limin Wang, Yu Qiao</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid development of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), a number of diagnostic benchmarks have recently emerged to evaluate the comprehension capabilities of these models. However, most benchmarks predominantly assess spatial understanding in the static image tasks, while overlooking temporal understanding in the dynamic video tasks. To alleviate this issue, we introduce a comprehensive Multi-modal Video understanding Benchmark, namely MVBench, which covers 20 challenging video tasks that cannot be effectively solved with a single frame. Specifically, we first introduce a novel static-to-dynamic method to define these temporal-related tasks. By transforming various static tasks into dynamic ones, we enable the systematic generation of video tasks that require a broad spectrum of temporal skills, ranging from perception to cognition. Then, guided by the task definition, we automatically convert public video annotations into multiple-choice QA to evaluate each task. On one hand, such a distinct paradigm allows us to build MVBench efficiently, without much manual intervention. On the other hand, it guarantees evaluation fairness with ground-truth video annotations, avoiding the biased scoring of LLMs. Moreover, we further develop a robust video MLLM baseline, i.e., VideoChat2, by progressive multi-modal training with diverse instruction-tuning data. The extensive results on our MVBench reveal that, the existing MLLMs are far from satisfactory in temporal understanding, while our VideoChat2 largely surpasses these leading models by over 15% on MVBench.

<p>Abstract: Unsupervised learning of keypoints and landmarks has seen significant progress with the help of modern neural network architectures, but performance is yet to match the supervised counterpart, making their practicability questionable. We leverage the emergent knowledge within text-to-image diffusion models, towards more robust unsupervised keypoints. Our core idea is to find text embeddings that would cause the generative model to consistently attend to compact regions in images (i.e. keypoints). To do so, we simply optimize the text embedding such that the cross-attention maps within the denoising network are localized as Gaussians with small standard deviations. We validate our performance on multiple datasets: the CelebA, CUB-200-2011, Tai-Chi-HD, DeepFashion, and Human3.6m datasets. We achieve significantly improved accuracy, sometimes even outperforming supervised ones, particularly for data that is non-aligned and less curated.

<p>Abstract: Bird's-eye View (BeV) representations have emerged as the de-facto shared space in driving applications, offering a unified space for sensor data fusion and supporting various downstream tasks. However, conventional models use grids with fixed resolution and range and face computational inefficiencies due to the uniform allocation of resources across all cells. To address this, we propose PointBeV, a novel sparse BeV segmentation model operating on sparse BeV cells instead of dense grids. This approach offers precise control over memory usage, enabling the use of long temporal contexts and accommodating memory-constrained platforms. PointBeV employs an efficient two-pass strategy for training, enabling focused computation on regions of interest. At inference time, it can be used with various memory/performance trade-offs and flexibly adjusts to new specific use cases. PointBeV achieves state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes dataset for vehicle, pedestrian, and lane segmentation, showcasing superior performance in static and temporal settings despite being trained solely with sparse signals. We will release our code along with two new efficient modules used in the architecture: Sparse Feature Pulling, designed for the effective extraction of features from images to BeV, and Submanifold Attention, which enables efficient temporal modeling.

<p>Abstract: We present a method that uses a text-to-image model to generate consistent content across multiple image scales, enabling extreme semantic zooms into a scene, e.g., ranging from a wide-angle landscape view of a forest to a macro shot of an insect sitting on one of the tree branches. We achieve this through a joint multi-scale diffusion sampling approach that encourages consistency across different scales while preserving the integrity of each individual sampling process. Since each generated scale is guided by a different text prompt, our method enables deeper levels of zoom than traditional super-resolution methods that may struggle to create new contextual structure at vastly different scales. We compare our method qualitatively with alternative techniques in image super-resolution and outpainting, and show that our method is most effective at generating consistent multi-scale content.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maomao Li, Yu Li, Tianyu Yang, Yunfei Liu, Dongxu Yue, Zhihui Lin, Dong Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a video inversion approach for zero-shot video editing, which models the input video with low-rank representation during the inversion process. The existing video editing methods usually apply the typical 2D DDIM inversion or naive spatial-temporal DDIM inversion before editing, which leverages time-varying representation for each frame to derive noisy latent. Unlike most existing approaches, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Expectation-Maximization (STEM) inversion, which formulates the dense video feature under an expectation-maximization manner and iteratively estimates a more compact basis set to represent the whole video. Each frame applies the fixed and global representation for inversion, which is more friendly for temporal consistency during reconstruction and editing. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our STEM inversion can achieve consistent improvement on two state-of-the-art video editing methods.

Our approach is a cascaded diffusion model which consists of a raster diffusion model followed by a vector diffusion model. The raster model generates low-resolution, rasterized fonts with auxiliary control point information, capturing the global style and shape of the font, while the vector model synthesizes vector fonts conditioned on the low-resolution raster fonts from the first stage. To synthesize long and complex curves, our vector diffusion model uses a transformer architecture and a novel vector representation that enables the modeling of diverse vector geometry and the precise prediction of control points. Our experiments show that, in contrast to previous generative models for vector graphics, our new cascaded vector diffusion model generates higher quality vector fonts, with complex structures and diverse styles.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weipeng Guan, Peiyu Chen, Huibin Zhao, Yu Wang, Peng Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Event cameras are bio-inspired, motion-activated sensors that demonstrate substantial potential in handling challenging situations, such as motion blur and high-dynamic range. In this paper, we proposed EVI-SAM to tackle the problem of 6 DoF pose tracking and 3D reconstruction using monocular event camera. A novel event-based hybrid tracking framework is designed to estimate the pose, leveraging the robustness of feature matching and the precision of direct alignment. Specifically, we develop an event-based 2D-2D alignment to construct the photometric constraint, and tightly integrate it with the event-based reprojection constraint. The mapping module recovers the dense and colorful depth of the scene through the image-guided event-based mapping method. Subsequently, the appearance, texture, and surface mesh of the 3D scene can be reconstructed by fusing the dense depth map from multiple viewpoints using truncated signed distance function (TSDF) fusion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first non-learning work to realize event-based dense mapping. Numerical evaluations are performed on both publicly available and self-collected datasets, which qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate the superior performance of our method. Our EVI-SAM effectively balances accuracy and robustness while maintaining computational efficiency, showcasing superior pose tracking and dense mapping performance in challenging scenarios.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenjia Li, Jinrang Jia, Yifeng Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: In the field of autonomous driving, monocular 3D detection is a critical task which estimates 3D properties (depth, dimension, and orientation) of objects in a single RGB image. Previous works have used features in a heuristic way to learn 3D properties, without considering that inappropriate features could have adverse effects. In this paper, sample selection is introduced that only suitable samples should be trained to regress the 3D properties. To select samples adaptively, we propose a Learnable Sample Selection (LSS) module, which is based on Gumbel-Softmax and a relative-distance sample divider. The LSS module works under a warm-up strategy leading to an improvement in training stability. Additionally, since the LSS module dedicated to 3D property sample selection relies on object-level features, we further develop a data augmentation method named MixUp3D to enrich 3D property samples which conforms to imaging principles without introducing ambiguity. As two orthogonal methods, the LSS module and MixUp3D can be utilized independently or in conjunction. Sufficient experiments have shown that their combined use can lead to synergistic effects, yielding improvements that transcend the mere sum of their individual applications. Leveraging the LSS module and the MixUp3D, without any extra data, our method named MonoLSS ranks 1st in all three categories (Car, Cyclist, and Pedestrian) on KITTI 3D object detection benchmark, and achieves competitive results on both the Waymo dataset and KITTI-nuScenes cross-dataset evaluation. The code is included in the supplementary material and will be released to facilitate related academic and industrial studies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingxiang Cao, Weiying Xie, Jie Lei, Jiaqing Zhang, Daixun Li, Yunsong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning has driven significant progress in object detection using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery. Existing methods, while achieving promising results, often struggle to effectively integrate local and global information, particularly direction-aware features. This paper proposes SAR-Net, a novel framework specifically designed for global fusion of direction-aware information in SAR object detection. SAR-Net leverages two key innovations: the Unity Compensation Mechanism (UCM) and the Direction-aware Attention Module (DAM). UCM facilitates the establishment of complementary relationships among features across different scales, enabling efficient global information fusion and transmission. Additionally, DAM, through bidirectional attention polymerization, captures direction-aware information, effectively eliminating background interference. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SAR-Net, achieving state-of-the-art results on aircraft (SAR-AIRcraft-1.0) and ship datasets (SSDD, HRSID), confirming its generalization capability and robustness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qishen Chen, Jianzhi Liu, Xinyu Lyu, Lianli Gao, Heng Tao Shen, Jingkuan Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Scene Graph Generation (SGG) endeavors to predict the relationships between subjects and objects in a given image. Nevertheless, the long-tail distribution of relations often leads to biased prediction on coarse labels, presenting a substantial hurdle in SGG. To address this issue, researchers focus on unbiased SGG and introduce data transfer methods to transfer coarse-grained predicates into fine-grained ones across the entire dataset. However, these methods encounter two primary challenges: 1) They overlook the inherent context constraints imposed by subject-object pairs, leading to erroneous relations transfer. 2) Additional retraining process are required after the data transfer, which incurs substantial computational costs. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the first plug-and-play one-stage data transfer pipeline in SGG, termed Adaptive Label Finetuning (ALF), which eliminates the need for extra retraining sessions and meanwhile significantly enhance models' relation recognition capability across various SGG benchmark approaches. Specifically, ALF consists of two components: Adaptive Label Construction (ALC) and Adaptive Iterative Learning (AIL). By imposing Predicate-Context Constraints within relation space, ALC adaptively re-ranks and selects candidate relations in reference to model's predictive logits utilizing the Restriction-Based Judgment techniques, achieving robust relation transfer. Supervised with labels transferred by ALC, AIL iteratively finetunes the SGG models in an auto-regressive manner, which mitigates the substantial computational costs arising from the retraining process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ALF achieves a 16% improvement in mR@100 compared to the typical SGG method Motif, with only a 6% increase in calculation costs compared to the state-of-the-art method IETrans.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ioanna Ntinou, Enrique Sanchez, Georgios Tzimiropoulos</p>
<p>Abstract: Action Localization is a challenging problem that combines detection and recognition tasks, which are often addressed separately. State-of-the-art methods rely on off-the-shelf bounding box detections pre-computed at high resolution, and propose transformer models that focus on the classification task alone. Such two-stage solutions are prohibitive for real-time deployment. On the other hand, single-stage methods target both tasks by devoting part of the network (generally the backbone) to sharing the majority of the workload, compromising performance for speed. These methods build on adding a DETR head with learnable queries that after cross- and self-attention can be sent to corresponding MLPs for detecting a person's bounding box and action. However, DETR-like architectures are challenging to train and can incur in big complexity.
  In this paper, we observe that \textbf{a straight bipartite matching loss can be applied to the output tokens of a vision transformer}. This results in a backbone + MLP architecture that can do both tasks without the need of an extra encoder-decoder head and learnable queries. We show that a single MViTv2-S architecture trained with bipartite matching to perform both tasks surpasses the same MViTv2-S when trained with RoI align on pre-computed bounding boxes. With a careful design of token pooling and the proposed training pipeline, our Bipartite-Matching Vision Transformer model, \textbf{BMViT}, achieves +3 mAP on AVA2.2. w.r.t. the two-stage MViTv2-S counterpart.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuai Liu, Boyang Li, Zhiyu Fang, Kai Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, significant progress has been made in the research of 3D object detection. However, most prior studies have focused on the utilization of center-based or anchor-based label assignment schemes. Alternative label assignment strategies remain unexplored in 3D object detection. We find that the center-based label assignment often fails to generate sufficient positive samples for training, while the anchor-based label assignment tends to encounter an imbalanced issue when handling objects of varying scales. To solve these issues, we introduce a dynamic cross label assignment (DCLA) scheme, which dynamically assigns positive samples for each object from a cross-shaped region, thus providing sufficient and balanced positive samples for training. Furthermore, to address the challenge of accurately regressing objects with varying scales, we put forth a rotation-weighted Intersection over Union (RWIoU) metric to replace the widely used L1 metric in regression loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate the generality and effectiveness of our DCLA and RWIoU-based regression loss. The Code will be available at https://github.com/Say2L/DCDet.git.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhao Wang, Aoxue Li, Lingting Zhu, Yong Guo, Qi Dou, Zhenguo Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Customized text-to-video generation aims to generate high-quality videos guided by text prompts and subject references. Current approaches for personalizing text-to-video generation suffer from tackling multiple subjects, which is a more challenging and practical scenario. In this work, our aim is to promote multi-subject guided text-to-video customization. We propose CustomVideo, a novel framework that can generate identity-preserving videos with the guidance of multiple subjects. To be specific, firstly, we encourage the co-occurrence of multiple subjects via composing them in a single image. Further, upon a basic text-to-video diffusion model, we design a simple yet effective attention control strategy to disentangle different subjects in the latent space of diffusion model. Moreover, to help the model focus on the specific area of the object, we segment the object from given reference images and provide a corresponding object mask for attention learning. Also, we collect a multi-subject text-to-video generation dataset as a comprehensive benchmark, with 63 individual subjects from 13 different categories and 68 meaningful pairs. Extensive qualitative, quantitative, and user study results demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to previous state-of-the-art approaches.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shubham Parashar, Zhiqiu Lin, Tian Liu, Xiangjue Dong, Yanan Li, Deva Ramanan, James Caverlee, Shu Kong</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel in zero-shot recognition but their performance varies greatly across different visual concepts. For example, although CLIP achieves impressive accuracy on ImageNet (60-80%), its performance drops below 10% for more than ten concepts like night snake, presumably due to their limited presence in the pretraining data. However, measuring the frequency of concepts in VLMs' large-scale datasets is challenging. We address this by using large language models (LLMs) to count the number of pretraining texts that contain synonyms of these concepts. Our analysis confirms that popular datasets, such as LAION, exhibit a long-tailed concept distribution, yielding biased performance in VLMs. We also find that downstream applications of VLMs, including visual chatbots (e.g., GPT-4V) and text-to-image models (e.g., Stable Diffusion), often fail to recognize or generate images of rare concepts identified by our method. To mitigate the imbalanced performance of zero-shot VLMs, we propose REtrieval-Augmented Learning (REAL). First, instead of prompting VLMs using the original class names, REAL uses their most frequent synonyms found in pretraining texts. This simple change already outperforms costly human-engineered and LLM-enriched prompts over nine benchmark datasets. Second, REAL trains a linear classifier on a small yet balanced set of pretraining data retrieved using concept synonyms. REAL surpasses the previous zero-shot SOTA, using 400x less storage and 10,000x less training time!</p>

<p>Abstract: To endow models with greater understanding of physics and motion, it is useful to enable them to perceive how solid surfaces move and deform in real scenes. This can be formalized as Tracking-Any-Point (TAP), which requires the algorithm to track any point on solid surfaces in a video, potentially densely in space and time. Large-scale groundtruth training data for TAP is only available in simulation, which currently has a limited variety of objects and motion. In this work, we demonstrate how large-scale, unlabeled, uncurated real-world data can improve a TAP model with minimal architectural changes, using a selfsupervised student-teacher setup. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on the TAP-Vid benchmark surpassing previous results by a wide margin: for example, TAP-Vid-DAVIS performance improves from 61.3% to 67.4%, and TAP-Vid-Kinetics from 57.2% to 62.5%.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoxiang Wang, Haozhe Si, Huajie Shao, Han Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-world applications of machine learning models often confront data distribution shifts, wherein discrepancies exist between the training and test data distributions. In the common multi-domain multi-class setup, as the number of classes and domains scales up, it becomes infeasible to gather training data for every domain-class combination. This challenge naturally leads the quest for models with Compositional Generalization (CG) ability, where models can generalize to unseen domain-class combinations. To delve into the CG challenge, we develop CG-Bench, a suite of CG benchmarks derived from existing real-world image datasets, and observe that the prevalent pretraining-finetuning paradigm on foundational models, such as CLIP and DINOv2, struggles with the challenge. To address this challenge, we propose Compositional Feature Alignment (CFA), a simple two-stage finetuning technique that i) learns two orthogonal linear heads on a pretrained encoder with respect to class and domain labels, and ii) fine-tunes the encoder with the newly learned head frozen. We theoretically and empirically justify that CFA encourages compositional feature learning of pretrained models. We further conduct extensive experiments on CG-Bench for CLIP and DINOv2, two powerful pretrained vision foundation models. Experiment results show that CFA outperforms common finetuning techniques in compositional generalization, corroborating CFA's efficacy in compositional feature learning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated their broad effectiveness thanks to extensive training in aligning visual instructions to responses. However, such training of conclusive alignment leads models to ignore essential visual reasoning, further resulting in failures in meticulous visual problems and unfaithful responses. Drawing inspiration from human cognition in solving visual problems (e.g., marking, zoom in), this paper introduces Chain of Manipulations, a mechanism that enables VLMs to solve problems step-by-step with evidence. After training, models can solve various visual problems by eliciting intrinsic manipulations (e.g., grounding, zoom in) with results (e.g., boxes, image) actively without involving external tools, while also allowing users to trace error causes. We study the roadmap to implement this mechanism, including (1) a flexible design of manipulations upon extensive analysis, (2) an efficient automated data generation pipeline, (3) a compatible VLM architecture capable of multi-turn multi-image, and (4) a model training process for versatile capabilities. With the design, we also manually annotate 6K high-quality samples for the challenging graphical mathematical problems. Our trained model, \textbf{CogCoM}, equipped with this mechanism with 17B parameters achieves state-of-the-art performance across 9 benchmarks from 4 categories, demonstrating the effectiveness while preserving the interpretability.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shashank Kotyan, Po-Yuan Mao, Pin-Yu Chen, Danilo Vasconcellos Vargas</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks can be exploited using natural adversarial samples, which do not impact human perception. Current approaches often rely on deep neural networks' white-box nature to generate these adversarial samples or synthetically alter the distribution of adversarial samples compared to the training distribution. In contrast, we propose EvoSeed, a novel evolutionary strategy-based algorithmic framework for generating photo-realistic natural adversarial samples. Our EvoSeed framework uses auxiliary Conditional Diffusion and Classifier models to operate in a black-box setting. We employ CMA-ES to optimize the search for an initial seed vector, which, when processed by the Conditional Diffusion Model, results in the natural adversarial sample misclassified by the Classifier Model. Experiments show that generated adversarial images are of high image quality, raising concerns about generating harmful content bypassing safety classifiers. Our research opens new avenues to understanding the limitations of current safety mechanisms and the risk of plausible attacks against classifier systems using image generation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tan-Hanh Pham, Kim-Doang Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: Precision devices play an important role in enhancing production quality and productivity in agricultural systems. Therefore, the optimization of these devices is essential in precision agriculture. Recently, with the advancements of deep learning, there have been several studies aiming to harness its capabilities for improving spray system performance. However, the effectiveness of these methods heavily depends on the size of the training dataset, which is expensive and time-consuming to collect. To address the challenge of insufficient training samples, we developed an image generator named DropletGAN to generate images of droplets. The DropletGAN model is trained by using a small dataset captured by a high-speed camera and capable of generating images with progressively increasing resolution. The results demonstrate that the model can generate high-quality images with the size of 1024x1024. The generated images from the DropletGAN are evaluated using the Fr\'echet inception distance (FID) with an FID score of 11.29. Furthermore, this research leverages recent advancements in computer vision and deep learning to develop a light droplet detector using the synthetic dataset. As a result, the detection model achieves a 16.06% increase in mean average precision (mAP) when utilizing the synthetic dataset. To the best of our knowledge, this work stands as the first to employ a generative model for augmenting droplet detection. Its significance lies not only in optimizing nozzle design for constructing efficient spray systems but also in addressing the common challenge of insufficient data in various precision agriculture tasks. This work offers a critical contribution to conserving resources while striving for optimal and sustainable agricultural practices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenying Liu, Conrad Albrecht, Yi Wang, Xiao Xiang Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Compared to supervised deep learning, self-supervision provides remote sensing a tool to reduce the amount of exact, human-crafted geospatial annotations. While image-level information for unsupervised pretraining efficiently works for various classification downstream tasks, the performance on pixel-level semantic segmentation lags behind in terms of model accuracy. On the contrary, many easily available label sources (e.g., automatic labeling tools and land cover land use products) exist, which can provide a large amount of noisy labels for segmentation model training. In this work, we propose to exploit noisy semantic segmentation maps for model pretraining. Our experiments provide insights on robustness per network layer. The transfer learning settings test the cases when the pretrained encoders are fine-tuned for different label classes and decoders. The results from two datasets indicate the effectiveness of task-specific supervised pretraining with noisy labels. Our findings pave new avenues to improved model accuracy and novel pretraining strategies for efficient remote sensing image segmentation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rishubh Parihar, Abhijnya Bhat, Saswat Mallick, Abhipsa Basu, Jogendra Nath Kundu, R. Venkatesh Babu</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion Models (DMs) have emerged as powerful generative models with unprecedented image generation capability. These models are widely used for data augmentation and creative applications. However, DMs reflect the biases present in the training datasets. This is especially concerning in the context of faces, where the DM prefers one demographic subgroup vs others (eg. female vs male). In this work, we present a method for debiasing DMs without relying on additional data or model retraining. Specifically, we propose Distribution Guidance, which enforces the generated images to follow the prescribed attribute distribution. To realize this, we build on the key insight that the latent features of denoising UNet hold rich demographic semantics, and the same can be leveraged to guide debiased generation. We train Attribute Distribution Predictor (ADP) - a small mlp that maps the latent features to the distribution of attributes. ADP is trained with pseudo labels generated from existing attribute classifiers. The proposed Distribution Guidance with ADP enables us to do fair generation. Our method reduces bias across single/multiple attributes and outperforms the baseline by a significant margin for unconditional and text-conditional diffusion models. Further, we present a downstream task of training a fair attribute classifier by rebalancing the training set with our generated data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Julian Spravil, Sebastian Houben, Sven Behnke</p>
<p>Abstract: In computer vision, a larger effective receptive field (ERF) is associated with better performance. While attention natively supports global context, its quadratic complexity limits its applicability to tasks that benefit from high-resolution input. In this work, we extend Hyena, a convolution-based attention replacement, from causal sequences to bidirectional data and two-dimensional image space. We scale Hyena's convolution kernels beyond the feature map size, up to 191$\times$191, to maximize ERF while maintaining sub-quadratic complexity in the number of pixels. We integrate our two-dimensional Hyena, HyenaPixel, and bidirectional Hyena into the MetaFormer framework. For image categorization, HyenaPixel and bidirectional Hyena achieve a competitive ImageNet-1k top-1 accuracy of 84.9% and 85.2%, respectively, with no additional training data, while outperforming other convolutional and large-kernel networks. Combining HyenaPixel with attention further improves accuracy. We attribute the success of bidirectional Hyena to learning the data-dependent geometric arrangement of pixels without a fixed neighborhood definition. Experimental results on downstream tasks suggest that HyenaPixel with large filters and a fixed neighborhood leads to better localization performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Following the successes in the fields of vision and language, self-supervised pretraining via masked autoencoding of 3D point set data, or Masked Point Modeling (MPM), has achieved state-of-the-art accuracy in various downstream tasks. However, current MPM methods lack a property essential for 3D point set analysis, namely, invariance against rotation of 3D objects/scenes. Existing MPM methods are thus not necessarily suitable for real-world applications where 3D point sets may have inconsistent orientations. This paper develops, for the first time, a rotation-invariant self-supervised pretraining framework for practical 3D point set analysis. The proposed algorithm, called MaskLRF, learns rotation-invariant and highly generalizable latent features via masked autoencoding of 3D points within Local Reference Frames (LRFs), which are not affected by rotation of 3D point sets. MaskLRF enhances the quality of latent features by integrating feature refinement using relative pose encoding and feature reconstruction using low-level but rich 3D geometry. The efficacy of MaskLRF is validated via extensive experiments on diverse downstream tasks including classification, segmentation, registration, and domain adaptation. I confirm that MaskLRF achieves new state-of-the-art accuracies in analyzing 3D point sets having inconsistent orientations. Code will be available at: https://github.com/takahikof/MaskLRF</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benedikt Blumenstiel, Viktoria Moor, Romeo Kienzler, Thomas Brunschwiler</p>
<p>Abstract: Image retrieval enables an efficient search through vast amounts of satellite imagery and returns similar images to a query. Deep learning models can identify images across various semantic concepts without the need for annotations. This work proposes to use Geospatial Foundation Models, like Prithvi, for remote sensing image retrieval with multiple benefits: i) the models encode multi-spectral satellite data and ii) generalize without further fine-tuning. We introduce two datasets to the retrieval task and observe a strong performance: Prithvi processes six bands and achieves a mean Average Precision of 97.62% on BigEarthNet-43 and 44.51% on ForestNet-12, outperforming other RGB-based models. Further, we evaluate three compression methods with binarized embeddings balancing retrieval speed and accuracy. They match the retrieval speed of much shorter hash codes while maintaining the same accuracy as floating-point embeddings but with a 32-fold compression.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hagyeong Lee, Minkyu Kim, Jun-Hyuk Kim, Seungeon Kim, Dokwan Oh, Jaeho Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in text-guided image compression have shown great potential to enhance the perceptual quality of reconstructed images. These methods, however, tend to have significantly degraded pixel-wise fidelity, limiting their practicality. To fill this gap, we develop a new text-guided image compression algorithm that achieves both high perceptual and pixel-wise fidelity. In particular, we propose a compression framework that leverages text information mainly by text-adaptive encoding and training with joint image-text loss. By doing so, we avoid decoding based on text-guided generative models -- known for high generative diversity -- and effectively utilize the semantic information of text at a global level. Experimental results on various datasets show that our method can achieve high pixel-level and perceptual quality, with either human- or machine-generated captions. In particular, our method outperforms all baselines in terms of LPIPS, with some room for even more improvements when we use more carefully generated captions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaqing Zhang, Mingxiang Cao, Xue Yang, Weiying Xie, Jie Lei, Daixun Li, Wenbo Huang, Yunsong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal image fusion and object detection are crucial for autonomous driving. While current methods have advanced the fusion of texture details and semantic information, their complex training processes hinder broader applications. Addressing this challenge, we introduce E2E-MFD, a novel end-to-end algorithm for multimodal fusion detection. E2E-MFD streamlines the process, achieving high performance with a single training phase. It employs synchronous joint optimization across components to avoid suboptimal solutions tied to individual tasks. Furthermore, it implements a comprehensive optimization strategy in the gradient matrix for shared parameters, ensuring convergence to an optimal fusion detection configuration. Our extensive testing on multiple public datasets reveals E2E-MFD's superior capabilities, showcasing not only visually appealing image fusion but also impressive detection outcomes, such as a 3.9% and 2.0% mAP50 increase on horizontal object detection dataset M3FD and oriented object detection dataset DroneVehicle, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

<p>Abstract: Ship detection from satellite imagery using Deep Learning (DL) is an indispensable solution for maritime surveillance. However, applying DL models trained on one dataset to others having differences in spatial resolution and radiometric features requires many adjustments. To overcome this issue, this paper focused on the DL models trained on datasets that consist of different optical images and a combination of radar and optical data. When dealing with a limited number of training images, the performance of DL models via this approach was satisfactory. They could improve 5-20% of average precision, depending on the optical images tested. Likewise, DL models trained on the combined optical and radar dataset could be applied to both optical and radar images. Our experiments showed that the models trained on an optical dataset could be used for radar images, while those trained on a radar dataset offered very poor scores when applied to optical images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaqi Yue, Jiancheng Zhao, Chunhui Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Generalized zero-shot learning (GZSL) focuses on recognizing seen and unseen classes against domain shift problem (DSP) where data of unseen classes may be misclassified as seen classes. However, existing GZSL is still limited to seen domains. In the current work, we pioneer cross-domain GZSL (CDGZSL) which addresses GZSL towards unseen domains. Different from existing GZSL methods which alleviate DSP by generating features of unseen classes with semantics, CDGZSL needs to construct a common feature space across domains and acquire the corresponding intrinsic semantics shared among domains to transfer from seen to unseen domains. Considering the information asymmetry problem caused by redundant class semantics annotated with large language models (LLMs), we present Meta Domain Alignment Semantic Refinement (MDASR). Technically, MDASR consists of two parts: Inter-class Similarity Alignment (ISA), which eliminates the non-intrinsic semantics not shared across all domains under the guidance of inter-class feature relationships, and Unseen-class Meta Generation (UMG), which preserves intrinsic semantics to maintain connectivity between seen and unseen classes by simulating feature generation. MDASR effectively aligns the redundant semantic space with the common feature space, mitigating the information asymmetry in CDGZSL. The effectiveness of MDASR is demonstrated on the Office-Home and Mini-DomainNet, and we have shared the LLM-based semantics for these datasets as the benchmark.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15378">Long-CLIP: Unlocking the Long-Text Capability of CLIP</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Beichen Zhang, Pan Zhang, Xiaoyi Dong, Yuhang Zang, Jiaqi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has been the cornerstone for zero-shot classification, text-image retrieval, and text-image generation by aligning image and text modalities. Despite its widespread adoption, a significant limitation of CLIP lies in the inadequate length of text input. The length of the text token is restricted to 77, and an empirical study shows the actual effective length is even less than 20. This prevents CLIP from handling detailed descriptions, limiting its applications for image retrieval and text-to-image generation with extensive prerequisites. To this end, we propose Long-CLIP as a plug-and-play alternative to CLIP that supports long-text input, retains or even surpasses its zero-shot generalizability, and aligns the CLIP latent space, making it readily replace CLIP without any further adaptation in downstream frameworks. Nevertheless, achieving this goal is far from straightforward, as simplistic fine-tuning can result in a significant degradation of CLIP's performance. Moreover, substituting the text encoder with a language model supporting longer contexts necessitates pretraining with vast amounts of data, incurring significant expenses. Accordingly, Long-CLIP introduces an efficient fine-tuning solution on CLIP with two novel strategies designed to maintain the original capabilities, including (1) a knowledge-preserved stretching of positional embedding and (2) a primary component matching of CLIP features. With leveraging just one million extra long text-image pairs, Long-CLIP has shown the superiority to CLIP for about 20% in long caption text-image retrieval and 6% in traditional text-image retrieval tasks, e.g., COCO and Flickr30k. Furthermore, Long-CLIP offers enhanced capabilities for generating images from detailed text descriptions by replacing CLIP in a plug-and-play manner.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuzhang Shang, Mu Cai, Bingxin Xu, Yong Jae Lee, Yan Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown significant visual reasoning capabilities by connecting a visual encoder and a large language model. LMMs typically take in a fixed and large amount of visual tokens, such as the penultimate layer features in the CLIP visual encoder, as the prefix content. Recent LMMs incorporate more complex visual inputs, such as high-resolution images and videos, which further increases the number of visual tokens significantly. However, due to the inherent design of the Transformer architecture, the computational costs of these models tend to increase quadratically with the number of input tokens. To tackle this problem, we explore a token reduction mechanism that identifies significant spatial redundancy among visual tokens. In response, we propose PruMerge, a novel adaptive visual token reduction strategy that significantly reduces the number of visual tokens without compromising the performance of LMMs. Specifically, to metric the importance of each token, we exploit the sparsity observed in the visual encoder, characterized by the sparse distribution of attention scores between the class token and visual tokens. This sparsity enables us to dynamically select the most crucial visual tokens to retain. Subsequently, we cluster the selected (unpruned) tokens based on their key similarity and merge them with the unpruned tokens, effectively supplementing and enhancing their informational content. Empirically, when applied to LLaVA-1.5, our approach can compress the visual tokens by 14 times on average, and achieve comparable performance across diverse visual question-answering and reasoning tasks.

<p>Abstract: Surgery digitalization is the process of creating a virtual replica of real-world surgery, also referred to as a surgical digital twin (SDT). It has significant applications in various fields such as education and training, surgical planning, and automation of surgical tasks. In addition, SDTs are an ideal foundation for machine learning methods, enabling the automatic generation of training data. In this paper, we present a proof of concept (PoC) for surgery digitalization that is applied to an ex-vivo spinal surgery. The proposed digitalization focuses on the acquisition and modelling of the geometry and appearance of the entire surgical scene. We employ five RGB-D cameras for dynamic 3D reconstruction of the surgeon, a high-end camera for 3D reconstruction of the anatomy, an infrared stereo camera for surgical instrument tracking, and a laser scanner for 3D reconstruction of the operating room and data fusion. We justify the proposed methodology, discuss the challenges faced and further extensions of our prototype. While our PoC partially relies on manual data curation, its high quality and great potential motivate the development of automated methods for the creation of SDTs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saurav Jha, Dong Gong, Lina Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to help deep neural networks to learn new knowledge while retaining what has been learned. Recently, pre-trained vision-language models such as CLIP, with powerful generalizability, have been gaining traction as practical CL candidates. However, the domain mismatch between the pre-training and the downstream CL tasks calls for finetuning of the CLIP on the latter. The deterministic nature of the existing finetuning methods makes them overlook the many possible interactions across the modalities and deems them unsafe for high-risk CL tasks requiring reliable uncertainty estimation. To address these, our work proposes Continual LeArning with Probabilistic finetuning (CLAP). CLAP develops probabilistic modeling over task-specific modules with visual-guided text features, providing more calibrated finetuning in CL. It further alleviates forgetting by exploiting the rich pre-trained knowledge of CLIP for weight initialization and distribution regularization of task-specific modules. Cooperating with the diverse range of existing prompting methods, CLAP can surpass the predominant deterministic finetuning approaches for CL with CLIP. We conclude with out-of-the-box applications of superior uncertainty estimation abilities of CLAP for novel data detection and exemplar selection within CL setups.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bowen Zhang, Yiji Cheng, Jiaolong Yang, Chunyu Wang, Feng Zhao, Yansong Tang, Dong Chen, Baining Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a radiance representation that is both structured and fully explicit and thus greatly facilitates 3D generative modeling. Existing radiance representations either require an implicit feature decoder, which significantly degrades the modeling power of the representation, or are spatially unstructured, making them difficult to integrate with mainstream 3D diffusion methods. We derive GaussianCube by first using a novel densification-constrained Gaussian fitting algorithm, which yields high-accuracy fitting using a fixed number of free Gaussians, and then rearranging these Gaussians into a predefined voxel grid via Optimal Transport. Since GaussianCube is a structured grid representation, it allows us to use standard 3D U-Net as our backbone in diffusion modeling without elaborate designs. More importantly, the high-accuracy fitting of the Gaussians allows us to achieve a high-quality representation with orders of magnitude fewer parameters than previous structured representations for comparable quality, ranging from one to two orders of magnitude. The compactness of GaussianCube greatly eases the difficulty of 3D generative modeling. Extensive experiments conducted on unconditional and class-conditioned object generation, digital avatar creation, and text-to-3D synthesis all show that our model achieves state-of-the-art generation results both qualitatively and quantitatively, underscoring the potential of GaussianCube as a highly accurate and versatile radiance representation for 3D generative modeling.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Duosheng Chen, Shihao Zhou, Jinshan Pan, Jinglei Shi, Lishen Qu, Jufeng Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Exploring motion information is important for the motion deblurring task. Recent the window-based transformer approaches have achieved decent performance in image deblurring. Note that the motion causing blurry results is usually composed of translation and rotation movements and the window-shift operation in the Cartesian coordinate system by the window-based transformer approaches only directly explores translation motion in orthogonal directions. Thus, these methods have the limitation of modeling the rotation part. To alleviate this problem, we introduce the polar coordinate-based transformer, which has the angles and distance to explore rotation motion and translation information together. In this paper, we propose a Radial Strip Transformer (RST), which is a transformer-based architecture that restores the blur images in a polar coordinate system instead of a Cartesian one. RST contains a dynamic radial embedding module (DRE) to extract the shallow feature by a radial deformable convolution. We design a polar mask layer to generate the offsets for the deformable convolution, which can reshape the convolution kernel along the radius to better capture the rotation motion information. Furthermore, we proposed a radial strip attention solver (RSAS) as deep feature extraction, where the relationship of windows is organized by azimuth and radius. This attention module contains radial strip windows to reweight image features in the polar coordinate, which preserves more useful information in rotation and translation motion together for better recovering the sharp images. Experimental results on six synthesis and real-world datasets prove that our method performs favorably against other SOTA methods for the image deblurring task.</p>

<p>Abstract: Pixel-wise regression tasks (e.g., monocular depth estimation (MDE) and optical flow estimation (OFE)) have been widely involved in our daily life in applications like autonomous driving, augmented reality and video composition. Although certain applications are security-critical or bear societal significance, the adversarial robustness of such models are not sufficiently studied, especially in the black-box scenario. In this work, we introduce the first unified black-box adversarial patch attack framework against pixel-wise regression tasks, aiming to identify the vulnerabilities of these models under query-based black-box attacks. We propose a novel square-based adversarial patch optimization framework and employ probabilistic square sampling and score-based gradient estimation techniques to generate the patch effectively and efficiently, overcoming the scalability problem of previous black-box patch attacks. Our attack prototype, named BadPart, is evaluated on both MDE and OFE tasks, utilizing a total of 7 models. BadPart surpasses 3 baseline methods in terms of both attack performance and efficiency. We also apply BadPart on the Google online service for portrait depth estimation, causing 43.5% relative distance error with 50K queries. State-of-the-art (SOTA) countermeasures cannot defend our attack effectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenrui Li, Xiaopeng Hong, Ruiqin Xiong, Xiaopeng Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: Temporal video grounding (TVG) is a critical task in video content understanding, requiring precise alignment between video content and natural language instructions. Despite significant advancements, existing methods face challenges in managing confidence bias towards salient objects and capturing long-term dependencies in video sequences. To address these issues, we introduce SpikeMba: a multi-modal spiking saliency mamba for temporal video grounding. Our approach integrates Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) with state space models (SSMs) to leverage their unique advantages in handling different aspects of the task. Specifically, we use SNNs to develop a spiking saliency detector that generates the proposal set. The detector emits spike signals when the input signal exceeds a predefined threshold, resulting in a dynamic and binary saliency proposal set. To enhance the model's capability to retain and infer contextual information, we introduce relevant slots which learnable tensors that encode prior knowledge. These slots work with the contextual moment reasoner to maintain a balance between preserving contextual information and exploring semantic relevance dynamically. The SSMs facilitate selective information propagation, addressing the challenge of long-term dependency in video content. By combining SNNs for proposal generation and SSMs for effective contextual reasoning, SpikeMba addresses confidence bias and long-term dependencies, thereby significantly enhancing fine-grained multimodal relationship capture. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SpikeMba, which consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across mainstream benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyu Yang, Zijie Pan, Chun Gu, Li Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D generation are predominantly propelled by improvements in 3D-aware image diffusion models which are pretrained on Internet-scale image data and fine-tuned on massive 3D data, offering the capability of producing highly consistent multi-view images. However, due to the scarcity of synchronized multi-view video data, it is impractical to adapt this paradigm to 4D generation directly. Despite that, the available video and 3D data are adequate for training video and multi-view diffusion models separately that can provide satisfactory dynamic and geometric priors respectively. To take advantage of both, this paper present Diffusion$^2$, a novel framework for dynamic 3D content creation that reconciles the knowledge about geometric consistency and temporal smoothness from these models to directly sample dense multi-view multi-frame images which can be employed to optimize continuous 4D representation. Specifically, we design a simple yet effective denoising strategy via score composition of pretrained video and multi-view diffusion models based on the probability structure of the target image array. Owing to the high parallelism of the proposed image generation process and the efficiency of the modern 4D reconstruction pipeline, our framework can generate 4D content within few minutes. Additionally, our method circumvents the reliance on 4D data, thereby having the potential to benefit from the scaling of the foundation video and multi-view diffusion models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed framework and its ability to flexibly handle various types of prompts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Saxon, Fatima Jahara, Mahsa Khoshnoodi, Yujie Lu, Aditya Sharma, William Yang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: With advances in the quality of text-to-image (T2I) models has come interest in benchmarking their prompt faithfulness-the semantic coherence of generated images to the prompts they were conditioned on. A variety of T2I faithfulness metrics have been proposed, leveraging advances in cross-modal embeddings and vision-language models (VLMs). However, these metrics are not rigorously compared and benchmarked, instead presented with correlation to human Likert scores over a set of easy-to-discriminate images against seemingly weak baselines.
  We introduce T2IScoreScore (TS2), a curated set of semantic error graphs containing a prompt and a set increasingly erroneous images. These allow us to rigorously judge whether a given prompt faithfulness metric can correctly order images with respect to their objective error count and significantly discriminate between different error nodes, using meta-metric scores derived from established statistical tests. Surprisingly, we find that the state-of-the-art VLM-based metrics (e.g., TIFA, DSG, LLMScore, VIEScore) we tested fail to significantly outperform simple (and supposedly worse) feature-based metrics like CLIPScore, particularly on a hard subset of naturally-occurring T2I model errors. TS2 will enable the development of better T2I prompt faithfulness metrics through more rigorous comparison of their conformity to expected orderings and separations under objective criteria.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingyi Pan, Zipeng Wang, Lin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction is a pivotal task in the field of autonomous driving. Recent approaches have made great advances in 3D semantic occupancy predictions on a single modality. However, multi-modal semantic occupancy prediction approaches have encountered difficulties in dealing with the modality heterogeneity, modality misalignment, and insufficient modality interactions that arise during the fusion of different modalities data, which may result in the loss of important geometric and semantic information. This letter presents a novel multi-modal, i.e., LiDAR-camera 3D semantic occupancy prediction framework, dubbed Co-Occ, which couples explicit LiDAR-camera feature fusion with implicit volume rendering regularization. The key insight is that volume rendering in the feature space can proficiently bridge the gap between 3D LiDAR sweeps and 2D images while serving as a physical regularization to enhance LiDAR-camera fused volumetric representation. Specifically, we first propose a Geometric- and Semantic-aware Fusion (GSFusion) module to explicitly enhance LiDAR features by incorporating neighboring camera features through a K-nearest neighbors (KNN) search. Then, we employ volume rendering to project the fused feature back to the image planes for reconstructing color and depth maps. These maps are then supervised by input images from the camera and depth estimations derived from LiDAR, respectively. Extensive experiments on the popular nuScenes and SemanticKITTI benchmarks verify the effectiveness of our Co-Occ for 3D semantic occupancy prediction.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiacheng Zhang, Jie Wu, Yuxi Ren, Xin Xia, Huafeng Kuang, Pan Xie, Jiashi Li, Xuefeng Xiao, Min Zheng, Lean Fu, Guanbin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have revolutionized the field of image generation, leading to the proliferation of high-quality models and diverse downstream applications. However, despite these significant advancements, the current competitive solutions still suffer from several limitations, including inferior visual quality, a lack of aesthetic appeal, and inefficient inference, without a comprehensive solution in sight. To address these challenges, we present UniFL, a unified framework that leverages feedback learning to enhance diffusion models comprehensively. UniFL stands out as a universal, effective, and generalizable solution applicable to various diffusion models, such as SD1.5 and SDXL. Notably, UniFL incorporates three key components: perceptual feedback learning, which enhances visual quality; decoupled feedback learning, which improves aesthetic appeal; and adversarial feedback learning, which optimizes inference speed. In-depth experiments and extensive user studies validate the superior performance of our proposed method in enhancing both the quality of generated models and their acceleration. For instance, UniFL surpasses ImageReward by 17% user preference in terms of generation quality and outperforms LCM and SDXL Turbo by 57% and 20% in 4-step inference. Moreover, we have verified the efficacy of our approach in downstream tasks, including Lora, ControlNet, and AnimateDiff.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tong Wu, Jia-Mu Sun, Yu-Kun Lai, Yuewen Ma, Leif Kobbelt, Lin Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Reconstructing and editing 3D objects and scenes both play crucial roles in computer graphics and computer vision. Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) can achieve realistic reconstruction and editing results but suffer from inefficiency in rendering. Gaussian splatting significantly accelerates rendering by rasterizing Gaussian ellipsoids. However, Gaussian splatting utilizes a single Spherical Harmonic (SH) function to model both texture and lighting, limiting independent editing capabilities of these components. Recently, attempts have been made to decouple texture and lighting with the Gaussian splatting representation but may fail to produce plausible geometry and decomposition results on reflective scenes. Additionally, the forward shading technique they employ introduces noticeable blending artifacts during relighting, as the geometry attributes of Gaussians are optimized under the original illumination and may not be suitable for novel lighting conditions. To address these issues, we introduce DeferredGS, a method for decoupling and editing the Gaussian splatting representation using deferred shading. To achieve successful decoupling, we model the illumination with a learnable environment map and define additional attributes such as texture parameters and normal direction on Gaussians, where the normal is distilled from a jointly trained signed distance function. More importantly, we apply deferred shading, resulting in more realistic relighting effects compared to previous methods. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the superior performance of DeferredGS in novel view synthesis and editing tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sanggeon Yun, Ryozo Masukawa, SungHeon Jeong, Mohsen Imani</p>
<p>Abstract: Customizable image retrieval from large datasets remains a critical challenge, particularly when preserving spatial relationships within images. Traditional hashing methods, primarily based on deep learning, often fail to capture spatial information adequately and lack transparency. In this paper, we introduce NeuroHash, a novel neuro-symbolic framework leveraging Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) to enable highly customizable, spatially-aware image retrieval. NeuroHash combines pre-trained deep neural network models with HDC-based symbolic models, allowing for flexible manipulation of hash values to support conditional image retrieval. Our method includes a self-supervised context-aware HDC encoder and novel loss terms for optimizing lower-dimensional bipolar hashing using multilinear hyperplanes. We evaluate NeuroHash on two benchmark datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art hashing methods, as measured by mAP@5K scores and our newly introduced metric, mAP@5Kr, which assesses spatial alignment. The results highlight NeuroHash's ability to achieve competitive performance while offering significant advantages in flexibility and customization, paving the way for more advanced and versatile image retrieval systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francesco Pro, Nikolaos Dionelis, Luca Maiano, Bertrand Le Saux, Irene Amerini</p>
<p>Abstract: Nowadays the accurate geo-localization of ground-view images has an important role across domains as diverse as journalism, forensics analysis, transports, and Earth Observation. This work addresses the problem of matching a query ground-view image with the corresponding satellite image without GPS data. This is done by comparing the features from a ground-view image and a satellite one, innovatively leveraging the corresponding latter's segmentation mask through a three-stream Siamese-like network. The proposed method, Semantic Align Net (SAN), focuses on limited Field-of-View (FoV) and ground panorama images (images with a FoV of 360{\deg}). The novelty lies in the fusion of satellite images in combination with their semantic segmentation masks, aimed at ensuring that the model can extract useful features and focus on the significant parts of the images. This work shows how SAN through semantic analysis of images improves the performance on the unlabelled CVUSA dataset for all the tested FoVs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxi Ren, Xin Xia, Yanzuo Lu, Jiacheng Zhang, Jie Wu, Pan Xie, Xing Wang, Xuefeng Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, a series of diffusion-aware distillation algorithms have emerged to alleviate the computational overhead associated with the multi-step inference process of Diffusion Models (DMs). Current distillation techniques often dichotomize into two distinct aspects: i) ODE Trajectory Preservation; and ii) ODE Trajectory Reformulation. However, these approaches suffer from severe performance degradation or domain shifts. To address these limitations, we propose Hyper-SD, a novel framework that synergistically amalgamates the advantages of ODE Trajectory Preservation and Reformulation, while maintaining near-lossless performance during step compression. Firstly, we introduce Trajectory Segmented Consistency Distillation to progressively perform consistent distillation within pre-defined time-step segments, which facilitates the preservation of the original ODE trajectory from a higher-order perspective. Secondly, we incorporate human feedback learning to boost the performance of the model in a low-step regime and mitigate the performance loss incurred by the distillation process. Thirdly, we integrate score distillation to further improve the low-step generation capability of the model and offer the first attempt to leverage a unified LoRA to support the inference process at all steps. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate that Hyper-SD achieves SOTA performance from 1 to 8 inference steps for both SDXL and SD1.5. For example, Hyper-SDXL surpasses SDXL-Lightning by +0.68 in CLIP Score and +0.51 in Aes Score in the 1-step inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiao Xiang Zhu, Qingyu Li, Yilei Shi, Yuanyuan Wang, Adam Stewart, Jonathan Prexl</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding how buildings are distributed globally is crucial to revealing the human footprint on our home planet. This built environment affects local climate, land surface albedo, resource distribution, and many other key factors that influence well-being and human health. Despite this, quantitative and comprehensive data on the distribution and properties of buildings worldwide is lacking. To this end, by using a big data analytics approach and nearly 800,000 satellite images, we generated the highest resolution and highest accuracy building map ever created: the GlobalBuildingMap (GBM). A joint analysis of building maps and solar potentials indicates that rooftop solar energy can supply the global energy consumption need at a reasonable cost. Specifically, if solar panels were placed on the roofs of all buildings, they could supply 1.1-3.3 times -- depending on the efficiency of the solar device -- the global energy consumption in 2020, which is the year with the highest consumption on record. We also identified a clear geospatial correlation between building areas and key socioeconomic variables, which indicates our global building map can serve as an important input to modeling global socioeconomic needs and drivers.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal LLMs are the natural evolution of LLMs, and enlarge their capabilities so as to work beyond the pure textual modality. As research is being carried out to design novel architectures and vision-and-language adapters, in this paper we concentrate on endowing such models with the capability of answering questions that require external knowledge. Our approach, termed Wiki-LLaVA, aims at integrating an external knowledge source of multimodal documents, which is accessed through a hierarchical retrieval pipeline. Relevant passages, using this approach, are retrieved from the external knowledge source and employed as additional context for the LLM, augmenting the effectiveness and precision of generated dialogues. We conduct extensive experiments on datasets tailored for visual question answering with external data and demonstrate the appropriateness of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ian Huang, Guandao Yang, Leonidas Guibas</p>
<p>Abstract: Graphics design is important for various applications, including movie production and game design. To create a high-quality scene, designers usually need to spend hours in software like Blender, in which they might need to interleave and repeat operations, such as connecting material nodes, hundreds of times. Moreover, slightly different design goals may require completely different sequences, making automation difficult. In this paper, we propose a system that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs), like GPT-4V, to intelligently search the design action space to arrive at an answer that can satisfy a user's intent. Specifically, we design a vision-based edit generator and state evaluator to work together to find the correct sequence of actions to achieve the goal. Inspired by the role of visual imagination in the human design process, we supplement the visual reasoning capabilities of VLMs with "imagined" reference images from image-generation models, providing visual grounding of abstract language descriptions. In this paper, we provide empirical evidence suggesting our system can produce simple but tedious Blender editing sequences for tasks such as editing procedural materials from text and/or reference images, as well as adjusting lighting configurations for product renderings in complex scenes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Krithika Iyer, Jadie Adams, Shireen Y. Elhabian</p>
<p>Abstract: Statistical shape modeling (SSM) is a powerful computational framework for quantifying and analyzing the geometric variability of anatomical structures, facilitating advancements in medical research, diagnostics, and treatment planning. Traditional methods for shape modeling from imaging data demand significant manual and computational resources. Additionally, these methods necessitate repeating the entire modeling pipeline to derive shape descriptors (e.g., surface-based point correspondences) for new data. While deep learning approaches have shown promise in streamlining the construction of SSMs on new data, they still rely on traditional techniques to supervise the training of the deep networks. Moreover, the predominant linearity assumption of traditional approaches restricts their efficacy, a limitation also inherited by deep learning models trained using optimized/established correspondences. Consequently, representing complex anatomies becomes challenging. To address these limitations, we introduce SCorP, a novel framework capable of predicting surface-based correspondences directly from unsegmented images. By leveraging the shape prior learned directly from surface meshes in an unsupervised manner, the proposed model eliminates the need for an optimized shape model for training supervision. The strong shape prior acts as a teacher and regularizes the feature learning of the student network to guide it in learning image-based features that are predictive of surface correspondences. The proposed model streamlines the training and inference phases by removing the supervision for the correspondence prediction task while alleviating the linearity assumption.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19015">Simple-RF: Regularizing Sparse Input Radiance Fields with Simpler Solutions</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Nagabhushan Somraj, Adithyan Karanayil, Sai Harsha Mupparaju, Rajiv Soundararajan</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) show impressive performance in photo-realistic free-view rendering of scenes. Recent improvements on the NeRF such as TensoRF and ZipNeRF employ explicit models for faster optimization and rendering, as compared to the NeRF that employs an implicit representation. However, both implicit and explicit radiance fields require dense sampling of images in the given scene. Their performance degrades significantly when only a sparse set of views is available. Researchers find that supervising the depth estimated by a radiance field helps train it effectively with fewer views. The depth supervision is obtained either using classical approaches or neural networks pre-trained on a large dataset. While the former may provide only sparse supervision, the latter may suffer from generalization issues. As opposed to the earlier approaches, we seek to learn the depth supervision by designing augmented models and training them along with the main radiance field. Further, we aim to design a framework of regularizations that can work across different implicit and explicit radiance fields. We observe that certain features of these radiance field models overfit to the observed images in the sparse-input scenario. Our key finding is that reducing the capability of the radiance fields with respect to positional encoding, the number of decomposed tensor components or the size of the hash table, constrains the model to learn simpler solutions, which estimate better depth in certain regions. By designing augmented models based on such reduced capabilities, we obtain better depth supervision for the main radiance field. We achieve state-of-the-art view-synthesis performance with sparse input views on popular datasets containing forward-facing and 360$^\circ$ scenes by employing the above regularizations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) plays a pivotal role in cardiology for diagnostic and interventional procedures. However, using it effectively requires extensive training due to the intricate nature of image acquisition and interpretation. To enhance the efficiency of novice sonographers and reduce variability in scan acquisitions, we propose a novel ultrasound (US) navigation assistance method based on contrastive learning as goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL). We augment the previous framework using a novel contrastive patient batching method (CPB) and a data-augmented contrastive loss, both of which we demonstrate are essential to ensure generalization to anatomical variations across patients. The proposed framework enables navigation to both standard diagnostic as well as intricate interventional views with a single model. Our method was developed with a large dataset of 789 patients and obtained an average error of 6.56 mm in position and 9.36 degrees in angle on a testing dataset of 140 patients, which is competitive or superior to models trained on individual views. Furthermore, we quantitatively validate our method's ability to navigate to interventional views such as the Left Atrial Appendage (LAA) view used in LAA closure. Our approach holds promise in providing valuable guidance during transesophageal ultrasound examinations, contributing to the advancement of skill acquisition for cardiac ultrasound practitioners.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wen-Hsuan Chu, Lei Ke, Katerina Fragkiadaki</p>
<p>Abstract: View-predictive generative models provide strong priors for lifting object-centric images and videos into 3D and 4D through rendering and score distillation objectives. A question then remains: what about lifting complete multi-object dynamic scenes? There are two challenges in this direction: First, rendering error gradients are often insufficient to recover fast object motion, and second, view predictive generative models work much better for objects than whole scenes, so, score distillation objectives cannot currently be applied at the scene level directly. We present DreamScene4D, the first approach to generate 3D dynamic scenes of multiple objects from monocular videos via 360-degree novel view synthesis. Our key insight is a "decompose-recompose" approach that factorizes the video scene into the background and object tracks, while also factorizing object motion into 3 components: object-centric deformation, object-to-world-frame transformation, and camera motion. Such decomposition permits rendering error gradients and object view-predictive models to recover object 3D completions and deformations while bounding box tracks guide the large object movements in the scene. We show extensive results on challenging DAVIS, Kubric, and self-captured videos with quantitative comparisons and a user preference study. Besides 4D scene generation, DreamScene4D obtains accurate 2D persistent point track by projecting the inferred 3D trajectories to 2D. We will release our code and hope our work will stimulate more research on fine-grained 4D understanding from videos.</p>

<p>Abstract: Controllable text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models generate images conditioned on both text prompts and semantic inputs of other modalities like edge maps. Nevertheless, current controllable T2I methods commonly face challenges related to efficiency and faithfulness, especially when conditioning on multiple inputs from either the same or diverse modalities. In this paper, we propose a novel Flexible and Efficient method, FlexEControl, for controllable T2I generation. At the core of FlexEControl is a unique weight decomposition strategy, which allows for streamlined integration of various input types. This approach not only enhances the faithfulness of the generated image to the control, but also significantly reduces the computational overhead typically associated with multimodal conditioning. Our approach achieves a reduction of 41% in trainable parameters and 30% in memory usage compared with Uni-ControlNet. Moreover, it doubles data efficiency and can flexibly generate images under the guidance of multiple input conditions of various modalities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Meixu Chen, Kai Wang, Michael Dohopolski, Howard Morgan, David Sher, Jing Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Early identification of head and neck cancer (HNC) patients who would experience significant anatomical change during radiotherapy (RT) is important to optimize patient clinical benefit and treatment resources. This study aims to assess the feasibility of using a vision-transformer (ViT) based neural network to predict RT-induced anatomic change in HNC patients. We retrospectively included 121 HNC patients treated with definitive RT/CRT. We collected the planning CT (pCT), planned dose, CBCTs acquired at the initial treatment (CBCT01) and fraction 21 (CBCT21), and primary tumor volume (GTVp) and involved nodal volume (GTVn) delineated on both pCT and CBCTs for model construction and evaluation. A UNet-style ViT network was designed to learn spatial correspondence and contextual information from embedded CT, dose, CBCT01, GTVp, and GTVn image patches. The model estimated the deformation vector field between CBCT01 and CBCT21 as the prediction of anatomic change, and deformed CBCT01 was used as the prediction of CBCT21. We also generated binary masks of GTVp, GTVn, and patient body for volumetric change evaluation. The predicted image from the proposed method yielded the best similarity to the real image (CBCT21) over pCT, CBCT01, and predicted CBCTs from other comparison models. The average MSE and SSIM between the normalized predicted CBCT to CBCT21 are 0.009 and 0.933, while the average dice coefficient between body mask, GTVp mask, and GTVn mask are 0.972, 0.792, and 0.821 respectively. The proposed method showed promising performance for predicting radiotherapy-induced anatomic change, which has the potential to assist in the decision-making of HNC Adaptive RT.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Khanh Nguyen, Dimosthenis Karatzas</p>
<p>Abstract: An important handicap of document analysis research is that documents tend to be copyrighted or contain private information, which prohibits their open publication and the creation of centralised, large-scale document datasets. Instead, documents are scattered in private data silos, making extensive training over heterogeneous data a tedious task. In this work, we explore the use of a federated learning (FL) scheme as a way to train a shared model on decentralised private document data. We focus on the problem of Document VQA, a task particularly suited to this approach, as the type of reasoning capabilities required from the model can be quite different in diverse domains. Enabling training over heterogeneous document datasets can thus substantially enrich DocVQA models. We assemble existing DocVQA datasets from diverse domains to reflect the data heterogeneity in real-world applications. We explore the self-pretraining technique in this multi-modal setting, where the same data is used for both pretraining and finetuning, making it relevant for privacy preservation. We further propose combining self-pretraining with a Federated DocVQA training method using centralized adaptive optimization that outperforms the FedAvg baseline. With extensive experiments, we also present a multi-faceted analysis on training DocVQA models with FL, which provides insights for future research on this task. We show that our pretraining strategies can effectively learn and scale up under federated training with diverse DocVQA datasets and tuning hyperparameters is essential for practical document tasks under federation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haodong Chen, Yongle Huang, Haojian Huang, Xiangsheng Ge, Dian Shao</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing prominence of e-commerce has underscored the importance of Virtual Try-On (VTON). However, previous studies predominantly focus on the 2D realm and rely heavily on extensive data for training. Research on 3D VTON primarily centers on garment-body shape compatibility, a topic extensively covered in 2D VTON. Thanks to advances in 3D scene editing, a 2D diffusion model has now been adapted for 3D editing via multi-viewpoint editing. In this work, we propose GaussianVTON, an innovative 3D VTON pipeline integrating Gaussian Splatting (GS) editing with 2D VTON. To facilitate a seamless transition from 2D to 3D VTON, we propose, for the first time, the use of only images as editing prompts for 3D editing. To further address issues, e.g., face blurring, garment inaccuracy, and degraded viewpoint quality during editing, we devise a three-stage refinement strategy to gradually mitigate potential issues. Furthermore, we introduce a new editing strategy termed Edit Recall Reconstruction (ERR) to tackle the limitations of previous editing strategies in leading to complex geometric changes. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of GaussianVTON, offering a novel perspective on 3D VTON while also establishing a novel starting point for image-prompting 3D scene editing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyu Deng, Zijing Xu, Yule Duan, Xiao Wu, Wenjie Shu, Liang-Jian Deng</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks for image super-resolution (ISR) have shown significant advantages over traditional approaches like the interpolation. However, they are often criticized as 'black boxes' compared to traditional approaches with solid mathematical foundations. In this paper, we attempt to interpret the behavior of deep neural networks in ISR using theories from the field of signal processing. First, we report an intriguing phenomenon, referred to as `the sinc phenomenon.' It occurs when an impulse input is fed to a neural network. Then, building on this observation, we propose a method named Hybrid Response Analysis (HyRA) to analyze the behavior of neural networks in ISR tasks. Specifically, HyRA decomposes a neural network into a parallel connection of a linear system and a non-linear system and demonstrates that the linear system functions as a low-pass filter while the non-linear system injects high-frequency information. Finally, to quantify the injected high-frequency information, we introduce a metric for image-to-image tasks called Frequency Spectrum Distribution Similarity (FSDS). FSDS reflects the distribution similarity of different frequency components and can capture nuances that traditional metrics may overlook.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuoying Li, Bohua Wan, Cong Mu, Ruzhang Zhao, Shushan Qiu, Chao Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain adaptation is pivotal for enabling deep learning models to generalize across diverse domains, a task complicated by variations in presentation and cognitive nuances. In this paper, we introduce AD-Aligning, a novel approach that combines adversarial training with source-target domain alignment to enhance generalization capabilities. By pretraining with Coral loss and standard loss, AD-Aligning aligns target domain statistics with those of the pretrained encoder, preserving robustness while accommodating domain shifts. Through extensive experiments on diverse datasets and domain shift scenarios, including noise-induced shifts and cognitive domain adaptation tasks, we demonstrate AD-Aligning's superior performance compared to existing methods such as Deep Coral and ADDA. Our findings highlight AD-Aligning's ability to emulate the nuanced cognitive processes inherent in human perception, making it a promising solution for real-world applications requiring adaptable and robust domain adaptation strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yachan Guo, Yi Xiao, Danna Xue, Jose Luis Gomez Zurita, Antonio M. L\'opez</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer knowledge learned from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. While UDA methods for synthetic to real-world domains (synth-to-real) show remarkable performance in tasks such as semantic segmentation and object detection, very few were proposed for the instance segmentation task. In this paper, we introduce UDA4Inst, a model of synth-to-real UDA for instance segmentation in autonomous driving. We propose a novel cross-domain bidirectional data mixing method at the instance level to fully leverage the data from both source and target domains. Rare-class balancing and category module training are also employed to further improve the performance. It is worth noting that we are the first to demonstrate results on two new synth-to-real instance segmentation benchmarks, with 39.0 mAP on UrbanSyn->Cityscapes and 35.7 mAP on Synscapes->Cityscapes. UDA4Inst also achieves the state-of-the-art result on SYNTHIA->Cityscapes with 31.3 mAP, +15.6 higher than the latest approach. Our code will be released.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haonan An, Guang Hua, Zhiping Lin, Yuguang Fang</p>
<p>Abstract: Box-free model watermarking is an emerging technique to safeguard the intellectual property of deep learning models, particularly those for low-level image processing tasks. Existing works have verified and improved its effectiveness in several aspects. However, in this paper, we reveal that box-free model watermarking is prone to removal attacks, even under the real-world threat model such that the protected model and the watermark extractor are in black boxes. Under this setting, we carry out three studies. 1) We develop an extractor-gradient-guided (EGG) remover and show its effectiveness when the extractor uses ReLU activation only. 2) More generally, for an unknown extractor, we leverage adversarial attacks and design the EGG remover based on the estimated gradients. 3) Under the most stringent condition that the extractor is inaccessible, we design a transferable remover based on a set of private proxy models. In all cases, the proposed removers can successfully remove embedded watermarks while preserving the quality of the processed images, and we also demonstrate that the EGG remover can even replace the watermarks. Extensive experimental results verify the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed attacks, revealing the vulnerabilities of the existing box-free methods and calling for further research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fengjie Wang, Chengming Liu, Lei Shi, Pang Haibo</p>
<p>Abstract: Previous unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) methods often struggle with significant intra-class diversity; i.e., a class in a dataset contains multiple subclasses, which we categorize as Feature-Rich Anomaly Detection Datasets (FRADs). This challenge is evident in applications such as unified setting and unmanned supermarket scenarios. To address this challenge, we developed MiniMaxAD, a lightweight autoencoder designed to efficiently compress and memorize extensive information from normal images. Our model employs a technique that enhances feature diversity, thereby increasing the effective capacity limit of the network. It also utilizes large kernel convolution to extract highly abstract patterns, which contribute to efficient and compact feature embedding. Moreover, we introduce an Adaptive Contraction Loss (ADCLoss), specifically tailored to FRADs, to address the limitations of the global cosine distance loss. In our methodology, any dataset can be unified under the framework of feature-rich anomaly detection, in a way that the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. MiniMaxAD underwent comprehensive testing across six challenging UAD benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art results in four and highly competitive outcomes in the remaining two. Notably, our model not only achieved state-of-the-art performance in unmanned supermarket tasks but also exhibited an inference speed 37 times faster than the previous best method, demonstrating its effectiveness in complex UAD tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junzhang Liu, Zhecan Wang, Hammad Ayyubi, Haoxuan You, Chris Thomas, Rui Sun, Shih-Fu Chang, Kai-Wei Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the widespread adoption of Vision-Language Understanding (VLU) benchmarks such as VQA v2, OKVQA, A-OKVQA, GQA, VCR, SWAG, and VisualCOMET, our analysis reveals a pervasive issue affecting their integrity: these benchmarks contain samples where answers rely on assumptions unsupported by the provided context. Training models on such data foster biased learning and hallucinations as models tend to make similar unwarranted assumptions. To address this issue, we collect contextual data for each sample whenever available and train a context selection module to facilitate evidence-based model predictions. Strong improvements across multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Further, we develop a general-purpose Context-AwaRe Abstention (CARA) detector to identify samples lacking sufficient context and enhance model accuracy by abstaining from responding if the required context is absent. CARA exhibits generalization to new benchmarks it wasn't trained on, underscoring its utility for future VLU benchmarks in detecting or cleaning samples with inadequate context. Finally, we curate a Context Ambiguity and Sufficiency Evaluation (CASE) set to benchmark the performance of insufficient context detectors. Overall, our work represents a significant advancement in ensuring that vision-language models generate trustworthy and evidence-based outputs in complex real-world scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Danli Shi, Weiyi Zhang, Xiaolan Chen, Yexin Liu, Jiancheng Yang, Siyu Huang, Yih Chung Tham, Yingfeng Zheng, Mingguang He</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is vital in ophthalmology, tackling tasks like diagnosis, classification, and visual question answering (VQA). However, existing AI models in this domain often require extensive annotation and are task-specific, limiting their clinical utility. While recent developments have brought about foundation models for ophthalmology, they are limited by the need to train separate weights for each imaging modality, preventing a comprehensive representation of multi-modal features. This highlights the need for versatile foundation models capable of handling various tasks and modalities in ophthalmology. To address this gap, we present EyeFound, a multimodal foundation model for ophthalmic images. Unlike existing models, EyeFound learns generalizable representations from unlabeled multimodal retinal images, enabling efficient model adaptation across multiple applications. Trained on 2.78 million images from 227 hospitals across 11 ophthalmic modalities, EyeFound facilitates generalist representations and diverse multimodal downstream tasks, even for detecting challenging rare diseases. It outperforms previous work RETFound in diagnosing eye diseases, predicting systemic disease incidents, and zero-shot multimodal VQA. EyeFound provides a generalizable solution to improve model performance and lessen the annotation burden on experts, facilitating widespread clinical AI applications for retinal imaging.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Suorong Yang, Peijia Li, Xin Xiong, Furao Shen, Jian Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Data augmentation (DA) is widely employed to improve the generalization performance of deep models. However, most existing DA methods use augmentation operations with random magnitudes throughout training. While this fosters diversity, it can also inevitably introduce uncontrolled variability in augmented data, which may cause misalignment with the evolving training status of the target models. Both theoretical and empirical findings suggest that this misalignment increases the risks of underfitting and overfitting. To address these limitations, we propose AdaAugment, an innovative and tuning-free Adaptive Augmentation method that utilizes reinforcement learning to dynamically adjust augmentation magnitudes for individual training samples based on real-time feedback from the target network. Specifically, AdaAugment features a dual-model architecture consisting of a policy network and a target network, which are jointly optimized to effectively adapt augmentation magnitudes. The policy network optimizes the variability within the augmented data, while the target network utilizes the adaptively augmented samples for training. Extensive experiments across benchmark datasets and deep architectures demonstrate that AdaAugment consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art DA methods in effectiveness while maintaining remarkable efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rong Liu, Rui Xu, Yue Hu, Meida Chen, Andrew Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently advanced radiance field reconstruction by offering superior capabilities for novel view synthesis and real-time rendering speed. However, its strategy of blending optimization and adaptive density control might lead to sub-optimal results; it can sometimes yield noisy geometry and blurry artifacts due to prioritizing optimizing large Gaussians at the cost of adequately densifying smaller ones. To address this, we introduce AtomGS, consisting of Atomized Proliferation and Geometry-Guided Optimization. The Atomized Proliferation constrains ellipsoid Gaussians of various sizes into more uniform-sized Atom Gaussians. The strategy enhances the representation of areas with fine features by placing greater emphasis on densification in accordance with scene details. In addition, we proposed a Geometry-Guided Optimization approach that incorporates an Edge-Aware Normal Loss. This optimization method effectively smooths flat surfaces while preserving intricate details. Our evaluation shows that AtomGS outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in rendering quality. Additionally, it achieves competitive accuracy in geometry reconstruction and offers a significant improvement in training speed over other SDF-based methods. More interactive demos can be found in our website (https://rongliu-leo.github.io/AtomGS/).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuyu Jia, Qing Zhou, Wei Huang, Junyu Gao, Qi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Few-shot learning aims to generalize the recognizer from seen categories to an entirely novel scenario. With only a few support samples, several advanced methods initially introduce class names as prior knowledge for identifying novel classes. However, obstacles still impede achieving a comprehensive understanding of how to harness the mutual advantages of visual and textual knowledge. In this paper, we propose a coherent Bidirectional Knowledge Permeation strategy called BiKop, which is grounded in a human intuition: A class name description offers a general representation, whereas an image captures the specificity of individuals. BiKop primarily establishes a hierarchical joint general-specific representation through bidirectional knowledge permeation. On the other hand, considering the bias of joint representation towards the base set, we disentangle base-class-relevant semantics during training, thereby alleviating the suppression of potential novel-class-relevant information. Experiments on four challenging benchmarks demonstrate the remarkable superiority of BiKop. Our code will be publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrew Gracyk, Xiaohui Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Optimal transport (OT) offers a versatile framework to compare complex data distributions in a geometrically meaningful way. Traditional methods for computing the Wasserstein distance and geodesic between probability measures require mesh-specific domain discretization and suffer from the curse-of-dimensionality. We present GeONet, a mesh-invariant deep neural operator network that learns the non-linear mapping from the input pair of initial and terminal distributions to the Wasserstein geodesic connecting the two endpoint distributions. In the offline training stage, GeONet learns the saddle point optimality conditions for the dynamic formulation of the OT problem in the primal and dual spaces that are characterized by a coupled PDE system. The subsequent inference stage is instantaneous and can be deployed for real-time predictions in the online learning setting. We demonstrate that GeONet achieves comparable testing accuracy to the standard OT solvers on simulation examples and the MNIST dataset with considerably reduced inference-stage computational cost by orders of magnitude.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a novel online evaluation protocol for Test Time Adaptation (TTA) methods, which penalizes slower methods by providing them with fewer samples for adaptation. TTA methods leverage unlabeled data at test time to adapt to distribution shifts. Although many effective methods have been proposed, their impressive performance usually comes at the cost of significantly increased computation budgets. Current evaluation protocols overlook the effect of this extra computation cost, affecting their real-world applicability. To address this issue, we propose a more realistic evaluation protocol for TTA methods, where data is received in an online fashion from a constant-speed data stream, thereby accounting for the method's adaptation speed. We apply our proposed protocol to benchmark several TTA methods on multiple datasets and scenarios. Extensive experiments show that, when accounting for inference speed, simple and fast approaches can outperform more sophisticated but slower methods. For example, SHOT from 2020, outperforms the state-of-the-art method SAR from 2023 in this setting. Our results reveal the importance of developing practical TTA methods that are both accurate and efficient.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marc Windsheimer, Fabian Brand, Andr\'e Kaup</p>
<p>Abstract: Most learning-based image compression methods lack efficiency for high image quality due to their non-invertible design. The decoding function of the frequently applied compressive autoencoder architecture is only an approximated inverse of the encoding transform. This issue can be resolved by using invertible latent variable models, which allow a perfect reconstruction if no quantization is performed. Furthermore, many traditional image and video coders apply dynamic block partitioning to vary the compression of certain image regions depending on their content. Inspired by this approach, hierarchical latent spaces have been applied to learning-based compression networks. In this paper, we present a novel concept, which adapts the hierarchical latent space for augmented normalizing flows, an invertible latent variable model. Our best performing model achieved average rate savings of more than 7% over comparable single-scale models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Frederic Wang, Han Qi, Alfredo De Goyeneche, Reinhard Heckel, Michael Lustig, Efrat Shimron</p>
<p>Abstract: Although deep learning (DL) methods are powerful for solving inverse problems, their reliance on high-quality training data is a major hurdle. This is significant in high-dimensional (dynamic/volumetric) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), where acquisition of high-resolution fully sampled k-space data is impractical. We introduce a novel mathematical framework, dubbed k-band, that enables training DL models using only partial, limited-resolution k-space data. Specifically, we introduce training with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) over k-space subsets. In each training iteration, rather than using the fully sampled k-space for computing gradients, we use only a small k-space portion. This concept is compatible with different sampling strategies; here we demonstrate the method for k-space "bands", which have limited resolution in one dimension and can hence be acquired rapidly. We prove analytically that our method stochastically approximates the gradients computed in a fully-supervised setup, when two simple conditions are met: (i) the limited-resolution axis is chosen randomly-uniformly for every new scan, hence k-space is fully covered across the entire training set, and (ii) the loss function is weighed with a mask, derived here analytically, which facilitates accurate reconstruction of high-resolution details. Numerical experiments with raw MRI data indicate that k-band outperforms two other methods trained on limited-resolution data and performs comparably to state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods trained on high-resolution data. k-band hence obtains SoTA performance, with the advantage of training using only limited-resolution data. This work hence introduces a practical, easy-to-implement, self-supervised training framework, which involves fast acquisition and self-supervised reconstruction and offers theoretical guarantees.</p>

<p>Abstract: We explore diffusion models of AI, which consist of a forward noise-injecting process and a reverse de-noising process, to understand how they encode information about the Ground Truth (GT) samples in the score-function. Our observations indicate that the most essential information is stored primarily during the early stages of the forward process. Consequently, we propose the U-turn diffusion model, which modifies the traditional approach by shortening the duration of both the forward process and the subsequent reverse dynamics, starting from the final configuration of the forward process. To determine the optimal moment for the U-turn, ensuring that synthetic samples generated at the end of the reverse process are independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) according to the probability distribution implicitly represented by the GT samples, we utilize various analytical tools, including auto-correlation analysis and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Gaussianity test. Our experiments with the ImageNet demonstrate that the U-turn diffusion model achieves state-of-the-art Fr\'echet Inception Distance scores with fewer Neural Function Evaluations. Notably, we achieve a 1.35-fold speed-up in inference without the need for retraining.</p>

<p>Abstract: The efficient construction of anatomical models is one of the major challenges of patient-specific in-silico models of the human heart. Current methods frequently rely on linear statistical models, allowing no advanced topological changes, or requiring medical image segmentation followed by a meshing pipeline, which strongly depends on image resolution, quality, and modality. These approaches are therefore limited in their transferability to other imaging domains. In this work, the cardiac shape is reconstructed by means of three-dimensional deep signed distance functions with Lipschitz regularity. For this purpose, the shapes of cardiac MRI reconstructions are learned to model the spatial relation of multiple chambers. We demonstrate that this approach is also capable of reconstructing anatomical models from partial data, such as point clouds from a single ventricle, or modalities different from the trained MRI, such as the electroanatomical mapping (EAM).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stephanie Wenxin Liu, Michael Fischer, Paul D. Yoo, Tobias Ritschel</p>
<p>Abstract: Bounding volumes are an established concept in computer graphics and vision tasks but have seen little change since their early inception. In this work, we study the use of neural networks as bounding volumes. Our key observation is that bounding, which so far has primarily been considered a problem of computational geometry, can be redefined as a problem of learning to classify space into free or occupied. This learning-based approach is particularly advantageous in high-dimensional spaces, such as animated scenes with complex queries, where neural networks are known to excel. However, unlocking neural bounding requires a twist: allowing -- but also limiting -- false positives, while ensuring that the number of false negatives is strictly zero. We enable such tight and conservative results using a dynamically-weighted asymmetric loss function. Our results show that our neural bounding produces up to an order of magnitude fewer false positives than traditional methods. In addition, we propose an extension of our bounding method using early exits that accelerates query speeds by 25%. We also demonstrate that our approach is applicable to non-deep learning models that train within seconds. Our project page is at: https://wenxin-liu.github.io/neural_bounding/.</p>

However, computing Shapley values encounters exponential complexity as the number of features increases. Various approaches, including ApproSemivalue, KernelSHAP, and FastSHAP, have been explored to expedite the computation. In our analysis of existing approaches, we observe that stochastic estimators can be unified as a linear transformation of randomly summed values from feature subsets. Based on this, we investigate the possibility of designing simple amortized estimators and propose a straightforward and efficient one, SimSHAP, by eliminating redundant techniques. Extensive experiments conducted on tabular and image datasets validate the effectiveness of our SimSHAP, which significantly accelerates the computation of accurate Shapley values.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sotiris Anagnostidis, Gregor Bachmann, Imanol Schlag, Thomas Hofmann</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, the state-of-the-art in deep learning has been dominated by very large models that have been pre-trained on vast amounts of data. The paradigm is very simple: investing more computational resources (optimally) leads to better performance, and even predictably so; neural scaling laws have been derived that accurately forecast the performance of a network for a desired level of compute. This leads to the notion of a `compute-optimal' model, i.e. a model that allocates a given level of compute during training optimally to maximize performance. In this work, we extend the concept of optimality by allowing for an `adaptive' model, i.e. a model that can change its shape during training. By doing so, we can design adaptive models that optimally traverse between the underlying scaling laws and outpace their `static' counterparts, leading to a significant reduction in the required compute to reach a given target performance. We show that our approach generalizes across modalities and different shape parameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matthieu Terris, Thomas Moreau, Nelly Pustelnik, Julian Tachella</p>
<p>Abstract: Plug-and-play algorithms constitute a popular framework for solving inverse imaging problems that rely on the implicit definition of an image prior via a denoiser. These algorithms can leverage powerful pre-trained denoisers to solve a wide range of imaging tasks, circumventing the necessity to train models on a per-task basis. Unfortunately, plug-and-play methods often show unstable behaviors, hampering their promise of versatility and leading to suboptimal quality of reconstructed images. In this work, we show that enforcing equivariance to certain groups of transformations (rotations, reflections, and/or translations) on the denoiser strongly improves the stability of the algorithm as well as its reconstruction quality. We provide a theoretical analysis that illustrates the role of equivariance on better performance and stability. We present a simple algorithm that enforces equivariance on any existing denoiser by simply applying a random transformation to the input of the denoiser and the inverse transformation to the output at each iteration of the algorithm. Experiments on multiple imaging modalities and denoising networks show that the equivariant plug-and-play algorithm improves both the reconstruction performance and the stability compared to their non-equivariant counterparts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vladyslav Gapyak, Corinna Rentschler, Thomas M\"arz, Andreas Weinmann</p>
<p>Abstract: Objective: Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) is an emerging medical imaging modality which has gained increasing interest in recent years. Among the benefits of MPI are its high temporal resolution, and that the technique does not expose the specimen to any kind of ionizing radiation. It is based on the non-linear response of magnetic nanoparticles to an applied magnetic field. From the electric signal measured in receive coils, the particle concentration has to be reconstructed. Due to the ill-posedness of the reconstruction problem, various regularization methods have been proposed for reconstruction ranging from early stopping methods, via classical Tikhonov regularization and iterative methods to modern machine learning approaches. In this work, we contribute to the latter class: we propose a plug-and-play approach based on a generic zero-shot denoiser with an $\ell^1$-prior.
  Approach: We validate the reconstruction parameters of the method on a hybrid dataset and compare it with the baseline Tikhonov, DIP and the previous PP-MPI, which is a plug-and-play method with denoiser trained on MPI-friendly data.
  Main results: We offer a quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the zero-shot plug-and-play approach on the 3D Open MPI dataset. Moreover, we show the quality of the approach with different levels of preprocessing of the data.
  Significance: The proposed method employs a zero-shot denoiser which has not been trained for the MPI task and therefore saves the cost for training. Moreover, it offers a method that can be potentially applied in future MPI contexts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ping Guo, Fei Liu, Xi Lin, Qingchuan Zhao, Qingfu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of machine learning, adversarial attacks present a significant challenge to model robustness and security. Decision-based attacks, which only require feedback on the decision of a model rather than detailed probabilities or scores, are particularly insidious and difficult to defend against. This work introduces L-AutoDA (Large Language Model-based Automated Decision-based Adversarial Attacks), a novel approach leveraging the generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the design of these attacks. By iteratively interacting with LLMs in an evolutionary framework, L-AutoDA automatically designs competitive attack algorithms efficiently without much human effort. We demonstrate the efficacy of L-AutoDA on CIFAR-10 dataset, showing significant improvements over baseline methods in both success rate and computational efficiency. Our findings underscore the potential of language models as tools for adversarial attack generation and highlight new avenues for the development of robust AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jary Pomponi, Alessio Devoto, Simone Scardapane</p>
<p>Abstract: Humans are capable of acquiring new knowledge and transferring learned knowledge into different domains, incurring a small forgetting. The same ability, called Continual Learning, is challenging to achieve when operating with neural networks due to the forgetting affecting past learned tasks when learning new ones. This forgetting can be mitigated by replaying stored samples from past tasks, but a large memory size may be needed for long sequences of tasks; moreover, this could lead to overfitting on saved samples. In this paper, we propose a novel regularisation approach and a novel incremental classifier called, respectively, Margin Dampening and Cascaded Scaling Classifier. The first combines a soft constraint and a knowledge distillation approach to preserve past learned knowledge while allowing the model to learn new patterns effectively. The latter is a gated incremental classifier, helping the model modify past predictions without directly interfering with them. This is achieved by modifying the output of the model with auxiliary scaling functions. We empirically show that our approach performs well on multiple benchmarks against well-established baselines, and we also study each component of our proposal and how the combinations of such components affect the final results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> William Chen, Oier Mees, Aviral Kumar, Sergey Levine</p>
<p>Abstract: Humans can quickly learn new behaviors by leveraging background world knowledge. In contrast, agents trained with reinforcement learning (RL) typically learn behaviors from scratch. We thus propose a novel approach that uses the vast amounts of general and indexable world knowledge encoded in vision-language models (VLMs) pre-trained on Internet-scale data for embodied RL. We initialize policies with VLMs by using them as promptable representations: embeddings that encode semantic features of visual observations based on the VLM's internal knowledge and reasoning capabilities, as elicited through prompts that provide task context and auxiliary information. We evaluate our approach on visually-complex, long horizon RL tasks in Minecraft and robot navigation in Habitat. We find that our policies trained on embeddings from off-the-shelf, general-purpose VLMs outperform equivalent policies trained on generic, non-promptable image embeddings. We also find our approach outperforms instruction-following methods and performs comparably to domain-specific embeddings. Finally, we show that our approach can use chain-of-thought prompting to produce representations of common-sense semantic reasoning, improving policy performance in novel scenes by 1.5 times.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gabriele Campanella, Eugene Fluder, Jennifer Zeng, Chad Vanderbilt, Thomas J. Fuchs</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has great potential to improve health outcomes by training systems on vast digitized clinical datasets. Computational Pathology, with its massive amounts of microscopy image data and impact on diagnostics and biomarkers, is at the forefront of this development. Gigapixel pathology slides pose a unique challenge due to their enormous size and are usually divided into tens of thousands of smaller tiles for analysis. This results in a discontinuity in the machine learning process by separating the training of tile-level encoders from slide-level aggregators and the need to adopt weakly supervised learning strategies. Training models from entire pathology slides end-to-end has been largely unexplored due to its computational challenges. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel approach to jointly train both a tile encoder and a slide-aggregator fully in memory and end-to-end at high-resolution, bridging the gap between input and slide-level supervision. While more computationally expensive, detailed quantitative validation shows promise for large-scale pre-training and fine-tuning of pathology foundation models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Histopathology is a gold standard for cancer diagnosis under a microscopic examination. However, histological tissue processing procedures result in artifacts, which are ultimately transferred to the digitized version of glass slides, known as whole slide images (WSIs). Artifacts are diagnostically irrelevant areas and may result in wrong deep learning (DL) algorithms predictions. Therefore, detecting and excluding artifacts in the computational pathology (CPATH) system is essential for reliable automated diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a mixture of experts (MoE) scheme for detecting five notable artifacts, including damaged tissue, blur, folded tissue, air bubbles, and histologically irrelevant blood from WSIs. First, we train independent binary DL models as experts to capture particular artifact morphology. Then, we ensemble their predictions using a fusion mechanism. We apply probabilistic thresholding over the final probability distribution to improve the sensitivity of the MoE. We developed DL pipelines using two MoEs and two multiclass models of state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs). DCNNs-based MoE and ViTs-based MoE schemes outperformed simpler multiclass models and were tested on datasets from different hospitals and cancer types, where MoE using DCNNs yielded the best results. The proposed MoE yields 86.15% F1 and 97.93% sensitivity scores on unseen data, retaining less computational cost for inference than MoE using ViTs. This best performance of MoEs comes with relatively higher computational trade-offs than multiclass models. The proposed artifact detection pipeline will not only ensure reliable CPATH predictions but may also provide quality control.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10089">Approximation and bounding techniques for the Fisher-Rao distances between parametric statistical models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Frank Nielsen</p>
<p>Abstract: The Fisher-Rao distance between two probability distributions of a statistical model is defined as the Riemannian geodesic distance induced by the Fisher information metric. In order to calculate the Fisher-Rao distance in closed-form, we need (1) to elicit a formula for the Fisher-Rao geodesics, and (2) to integrate the Fisher length element along those geodesics. We consider several numerically robust approximation and bounding techniques for the Fisher-Rao distances: First, we report generic upper bounds on Fisher-Rao distances based on closed-form 1D Fisher-Rao distances of submodels. Second, we describe several generic approximation schemes depending on whether the Fisher-Rao geodesics or pregeodesics are available in closed-form or not. In particular, we obtain a generic method to guarantee an arbitrarily small additive error on the approximation provided that Fisher-Rao pregeodesics and tight lower and upper bounds are available. Third, we consider the case of Fisher metrics being Hessian metrics, and report generic tight upper bounds on the Fisher-Rao distances using techniques of information geometry. Uniparametric and biparametric statistical models always have Fisher Hessian metrics, and in general a simple test allows to check whether the Fisher information matrix yields a Hessian metric or not. Fourth, we consider elliptical distribution families and show how to apply the above techniques to these models. We also propose two new distances based either on the Fisher-Rao lengths of curves serving as proxies of Fisher-Rao geodesics, or based on the Birkhoff/Hilbert projective cone distance. Last, we consider an alternative group-theoretic approach for statistical transformation models based on the notion of maximal invariant which yields insights on the structures of the Fisher-Rao distance formula which may be used fruitfully in applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hamza Kheddar, Yassine Himeur, Abbes Amira, Rachik Soualah</p>
<p>Abstract: Nowadays, there has been a growing trend in the fields of high-energy physics (HEP) in its both parts experimental and phenomenological studies, to incorporate machine learning (ML) and its specialized branch, deep learning (DL). This review paper provides a thorough illustration of these applications using different DL approaches. The first part of the paper examines the basics of various particle physics types and sets up guidelines for assessing particle physics alongside the available learning models. Next, a detailed classification is provided for representing the jet images that are reconstructed in high energy collisions mainly with proton-proton collisions at well defined beam energies, covering various datasets, preprocessing techniques, and feature extraction and selection methods. The presented techniques can be applied to future hadron-hadron colliders (HLC) such as high luminosity LHC (HL-HLC) and future circular collider-hadron-hadron (FCC-hh). Next, the authors explore a number of AI models analysis designed specifically for images in HEP. We additionally undertake a closer look at the classification associated with images in hadron collisions, with an emphasis on Jets. In this review, we look into various state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques in ML and DL, examining their implications for HEP demands. More precisely, this discussion tackles various applications in extensive detail, such as Jet tagging, Jet tracking, particle classification, and more. The review concludes with an analysis of the current state of HEP, using DL methodologies. It covers the challenges and potential areas for future research that will be illustrated for each application.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jixiang Luo, Yan Wang, Hongwei Qin</p>
<p>Abstract: Learned Image Compression (LIC) has achieved dramatic progress regarding objective and subjective metrics. MSE-based models aim to improve objective metrics while generative models are leveraged to improve visual quality measured by subjective metrics. However, they all suffer from blurring or deformation at low bit rates, especially at below $0.2bpp$. Besides, deformation on human faces and text is unacceptable for visual quality assessment, and the problem becomes more prominent on small faces and text. To solve this problem, we combine the advantage of MSE-based models and generative models by utilizing region of interest (ROI). We propose Hierarchical-ROI (H-ROI), to split images into several foreground regions and one background region to improve the reconstruction of regions containing faces, text, and complex textures. Further, we propose adaptive quantization by non-linear mapping within the channel dimension to constrain the bit rate while maintaining the visual quality. Exhaustive experiments demonstrate that our methods achieve better visual quality on small faces and text with lower bit rates, e.g., $0.7X$ bits of HiFiC and $0.5X$ bits of BPG.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19888">MambaMixer: Efficient Selective State Space Models with Dual Token and Channel Selection</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali Behrouz, Michele Santacatterina, Ramin Zabih</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have mainly relied on Transformers due to their data dependency and ability to learn at scale. The attention module in these architectures, however, exhibits quadratic time and space in input size, limiting their scalability for long-sequence modeling. State Space Models (SSMs), and more specifically Selective SSMs (S6), with efficient hardware-aware implementation, have shown promising potential for long causal sequence modeling. They, however, use separate blocks for each channel and fail to filter irrelevant channels and capture inter-channel dependencies. Natural attempt to mix information across channels using MLP, attention, or SSMs results in further instability in the training of SSMs for large networks and/or nearly double the number of parameters. We present the MambaMixer block, a new SSM-based architecture with data-dependent weights that uses a dual selection mechanism across tokens and channels-called Selective Token and Channel Mixer. To mitigate doubling the number of parameters, we present a new non-causal heuristic of the S6 block using quasi-separable kernels with a hardware-friendly implementation. We further present an efficient variant of MambaMixer, called QSMixer, that mixes information along both sequence and embedding dimensions. As a proof of concept, we design Vision MambaMixer (ViM2) and Vision QSMixer (ViQS) architectures. To enhance their ability to capture spatial information in images, we present Switch of Scans (SoS) that dynamically uses a set of useful image scans to traverse image patches. We evaluate the performance of our methods in image classification, segmentation, and object detection. Our results underline the importance of selectively mixing across both tokens and channels and show the competitive (resp. superior) performance of our methods with well-established vision models (resp. SSM-based models).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Toru Lin, Yu Zhang, Qiyang Li, Haozhi Qi, Brent Yi, Sergey Levine, Jitendra Malik</p>
<p>Abstract: Aiming to replicate human-like dexterity, perceptual experiences, and motion patterns, we explore learning from human demonstrations using a bimanual system with multifingered hands and visuotactile data. Two significant challenges exist: the lack of an affordable and accessible teleoperation system suitable for a dual-arm setup with multifingered hands, and the scarcity of multifingered hand hardware equipped with touch sensing. To tackle the first challenge, we develop HATO, a low-cost hands-arms teleoperation system that leverages off-the-shelf electronics, complemented with a software suite that enables efficient data collection; the comprehensive software suite also supports multimodal data processing, scalable policy learning, and smooth policy deployment. To tackle the latter challenge, we introduce a novel hardware adaptation by repurposing two prosthetic hands equipped with touch sensors for research. Using visuotactile data collected from our system, we learn skills to complete long-horizon, high-precision tasks which are difficult to achieve without multifingered dexterity and touch feedback. Furthermore, we empirically investigate the effects of dataset size, sensing modality, and visual input preprocessing on policy learning. Our results mark a promising step forward in bimanual multifingered manipulation from visuotactile data. Videos, code, and datasets can be found at https://toruowo.github.io/hato/ .</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guanyiman Fu, Fengchao Xiong, Jianfeng Lu, Jun Zhou, Yuntao Qian</p>
<p>Abstract: Denoising is a crucial preprocessing procedure for hyperspectral images (HSIs) due to the noise originating from intra-imaging mechanisms and environmental factors. Utilizing domain knowledge of HSIs, such as spectral correlation, spatial self-similarity, and spatial-spectral correlation, is essential for deep learning-based denoising. Existing methods are often constrained by running time, space complexity, and computational complexity, employing strategies that explore these kinds of domain knowledge separately. While these strategies can avoid some redundant information, they inevitably overlook broader and more in-depth long-range spatial-spectral information that positively impacts image restoration. This paper proposes a Spatial-Spectral Selective State Space Model-based U-shaped network, Spatial-Spectral U-Mamba (SSUMamba), for hyperspectral image denoising. The SSUMamba can exploit complete global spatial-spectral correlation within a module thanks to the linear space complexity in State Space Model (SSM) computations. We introduce a Spatial-Spectral Alternating Zigzag Scan (SSAZS) strategy for HSIs, which helps exploit the continuous information flow in multiple directions of 3-D characteristics within HSIs. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms comparison methods. The source code is available at https://github.com/lronkitty/SSUMamba.</p>

<p>Abstract: Foundation models in computational pathology promise to unlock the development of new clinical decision support systems and models for precision medicine. However, there is a mismatch between most clinical analysis, which is defined at the level of one or more whole slide images, and foundation models to date, which process the thousands of image tiles contained in a whole slide image separately. The requirement to train a network to aggregate information across a large number of tiles in multiple whole slide images limits these models' impact. In this work, we present a slide-level foundation model for H&E-stained histopathology, PRISM, that builds on Virchow tile embeddings and leverages clinical report text for pre-training. Using the tile embeddings, PRISM produces slide-level embeddings with the ability to generate clinical reports, resulting in several modes of use. Using text prompts, PRISM achieves zero-shot cancer detection and sub-typing performance approaching and surpassing that of a supervised aggregator model. Using the slide embeddings with linear classifiers, PRISM surpasses supervised aggregator models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fine-tuning of the PRISM slide encoder yields label-efficient training for biomarker prediction, a task that typically suffers from low availability of training data; an aggregator initialized with PRISM and trained on as little as 10% of the training data can outperform a supervised baseline that uses all of the data.</p>

<p>Abstract: The lack of large and diverse training data on Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) in breast cancer detection has been one of the concerns that impedes the adoption of the system. Recently, pre-training with large-scale image text datasets via Vision-Language models (VLM) (\eg CLIP) partially addresses the issue of robustness and data efficiency in computer vision (CV). This paper proposes Mammo-CLIP, the first VLM pre-trained on a substantial amount of screening mammogram-report pairs, addressing the challenges of dataset diversity and size. Our experiments on two public datasets demonstrate strong performance in classifying and localizing various mammographic attributes crucial for breast cancer detection, showcasing data efficiency and robustness similar to CLIP in CV. We also propose Mammo-FActOR, a novel feature attribution method, to provide spatial interpretation of representation with sentence-level granularity within mammography reports.
