<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianzhe Xue, Yunting Xu, Dongcheng Yuan, Caoyi Zha, Hongyang Du, Haibo Zhou, Dusit Niyato</p>
<p>Abstract: Traffic flow estimation (TFE) is crucial for intelligent transportation systems. Traditional TFE methods rely on extensive road sensor networks and typically incur significant costs. Sparse mobile crowdsensing enables a cost-effective alternative by utilizing sparsely distributed probe vehicle data (PVD) provided by connected vehicles. However, as pointed out by the central limit theorem, the sparsification of PVD leads to the degradation of TFE accuracy. In response, this paper introduces a novel and cost-effective TFE framework that leverages sparse PVD and improves accuracy by applying the spatial-temporal generative artificial intelligence (GAI) framework. Within this framework, the conditional encoder mines spatial-temporal correlations in the initial TFE results derived from averaging vehicle speeds of each region, and the generative decoder generates high-quality and accurate TFE outputs. Additionally, the design of the spatial-temporal neural network is discussed, which is the backbone of the conditional encoder for effectively capturing spatial-temporal correlations. The effectiveness of the proposed TFE approach is demonstrated through evaluations based on real-world connected vehicle data. The experimental results affirm the feasibility of our sparse PVD-based TFE framework and highlight the significant role of the spatial-temporal GAI framework in enhancing the accuracy of TFE.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Herbert Woisetschl\"ager, Simon Mertel, Christoph Kr\"onke, Ruben Mayer, Hans-Arno Jacobsen</p>
<p>Abstract: The European Union Artificial Intelligence Act mandates clear stakeholder responsibilities in developing and deploying machine learning applications to avoid substantial fines, prioritizing private and secure data processing with data remaining at its origin. Federated Learning (FL) enables the training of generative AI Models across data siloes, sharing only model parameters while improving data security. Since FL is a cooperative learning paradigm, clients and servers naturally share legal responsibility in the FL pipeline. Our work contributes to clarifying the roles of both parties, explains strategies for shifting responsibilities to the server operator, and points out open technical challenges that we must solve to improve FL's practical applicability under the EU AI Act.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinxing Zhou, Dan Guo, Yuxin Mao, Yiran Zhong, Xiaojun Chang, Meng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Audio-Visual Video Parsing (AVVP) task aims to detect and temporally locate events within audio and visual modalities. Multiple events can overlap in the timeline, making identification challenging. While traditional methods usually focus on improving the early audio-visual encoders to embed more effective features, the decoding phase -- crucial for final event classification, often receives less attention. We aim to advance the decoding phase and improve its interpretability. Specifically, we introduce a new decoding paradigm, \underline{l}abel s\underline{e}m\underline{a}ntic-based \underline{p}rojection (LEAP), that employs labels texts of event categories, each bearing distinct and explicit semantics, for parsing potentially overlapping events.LEAP works by iteratively projecting encoded latent features of audio/visual segments onto semantically independent label embeddings. This process, enriched by modeling cross-modal (audio/visual-label) interactions, gradually disentangles event semantics within video segments to refine relevant label embeddings, guaranteeing a more discriminative and interpretable decoding process. To facilitate the LEAP paradigm, we propose a semantic-aware optimization strategy, which includes a novel audio-visual semantic similarity loss function. This function leverages the Intersection over Union of audio and visual events (EIoU) as a novel metric to calibrate audio-visual similarities at the feature level, accommodating the varied event densities across modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method, achieving new state-of-the-art performance for AVVP and also enhancing the relevant audio-visual event localization task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pu Feng, Junkang Liang, Size Wang, Xin Yu, Rongye Shi, Wenjun Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: In multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), the Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) framework is pivotal but struggles due to a gap: global state guidance in training versus reliance on local observations in execution, lacking global signals. Inspired by human societal consensus mechanisms, we introduce the Hierarchical Consensus-based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HC-MARL) framework to address this limitation. HC-MARL employs contrastive learning to foster a global consensus among agents, enabling cooperative behavior without direct communication. This approach enables agents to form a global consensus from local observations, using it as an additional piece of information to guide collaborative actions during execution. To cater to the dynamic requirements of various tasks, consensus is divided into multiple layers, encompassing both short-term and long-term considerations. Short-term observations prompt the creation of an immediate, low-layer consensus, while long-term observations contribute to the formation of a strategic, high-layer consensus. This process is further refined through an adaptive attention mechanism that dynamically adjusts the influence of each consensus layer. This mechanism optimizes the balance between immediate reactions and strategic planning, tailoring it to the specific demands of the task at hand. Extensive experiments and real-world applications in multi-robot systems showcase our framework's superior performance, marking significant advancements over baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sopam Dasgupta, Joaqu\'in Arias, Elmer Salazar, Gopal Gupta</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning models are increasingly used in areas such as loan approvals and hiring, yet they often function as black boxes, obscuring their decision-making processes. Transparency is crucial, and individuals need explanations to understand decisions, especially for the ones not desired by the user. Ethical and legal considerations require informing individuals of changes in input attribute values (features) that could lead to a desired outcome for the user. Our work aims to generate counterfactual explanations by considering causal dependencies between features. We present the CoGS (Counterfactual Generation with s(CASP)) framework that utilizes the goal-directed Answer Set Programming system s(CASP) to generate counterfactuals from rule-based machine learning models, specifically the FOLD-SE algorithm. CoGS computes realistic and causally consistent changes to attribute values taking causal dependencies between them into account. It finds a path from an undesired outcome to a desired one using counterfactuals. We present details of the CoGS framework along with its evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lei Zhang, Xuezheng Peng, Shuyi Yang, Feiyang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The shift from professionally generated content (PGC) to user-generated content (UGC) has revolutionized various media formats, from text to video. With the rapid advancements in generative AI, a similar shift is set to transform the game industry, particularly in the realm of role-playing games (RPGs). This paper introduces a new framework for a text-to-game engine that utilizes foundation models to convert simple textual inputs into complex, interactive RPG experiences. The engine dynamically renders the game story in a multi-modal format and adjusts the game character, environment, and mechanics in real-time in response to player actions. Using this framework, we developed the "Zagii" game engine, which has successfully supported hundreds of RPG games across a diverse range of genres and facilitated tens of thousands of online user gameplay instances. This validates the effectiveness of our frame-work. Our work showcases the potential for a more open and democratized gaming paradigm, highlighting the transformative impact of generative AI on the game life cycle.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yue Bai, Zichen Zhang, Jiasen Lu, Yun Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs necessitates significant computing resources, and existing publicly available LLMs are typically pre-trained on diverse, privately curated datasets spanning various tasks. For instance, LLaMA, Vicuna, and LLaVA are three LLM variants trained with LLaMA base models using very different training recipes, tasks, and data modalities. The training cost and complexity for such LLM variants grow rapidly. In this study, we propose to use a soup strategy to assemble these LLM variants into a single well-generalized multimodal LLM (SoupLM) in a cost-efficient manner. Assembling these LLM variants efficiently brings knowledge and specialities trained from different domains and data modalities into an integrated one (e.g., chatbot speciality from user-shared conversations for Vicuna, and visual capacity from vision-language data for LLaVA), therefore, to avoid computing costs of repetitive training on several different domains. We propose series of soup strategies to systematically benchmark performance gains across various configurations, and probe the soup behavior across base models in the interpolation space.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juren Li, Fanzhe Fu, Ran Wei, Yifei Sun, Zeyu Lai, Ning Song, Xin Chen, Yang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Pathogenic chromosome abnormalities are very common among the general population. While numerical chromosome abnormalities can be quickly and precisely detected, structural chromosome abnormalities are far more complex and typically require considerable efforts by human experts for identification. This paper focuses on investigating the modeling of chromosome features and the identification of chromosomes with structural abnormalities. Most existing data-driven methods concentrate on a single chromosome and consider each chromosome independently, overlooking the crucial aspect of homologous chromosomes. In normal cases, homologous chromosomes share identical structures, with the exception that one of them is abnormal. Therefore, we propose an adaptive method to align homologous chromosomes and diagnose structural abnormalities through homologous similarity. Inspired by the process of human expert diagnosis, we incorporate information from multiple pairs of homologous chromosomes simultaneously, aiming to reduce noise disturbance and improve prediction performance. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our model compared to baselines.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08227">DALL-M: Context-Aware Clinical Data Augmentation with LLMs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Chihcheng Hsieh, Catarina Moreira, Isabel Blanco Nobre, Sandra Costa Sousa, Chun Ouyang, Margot Brereton, Joaquim Jorge, Jacinto C. Nascimento</p>
<p>Abstract: X-ray images are vital in medical diagnostics, but their effectiveness is limited without clinical context. Radiologists often find chest X-rays insufficient for diagnosing underlying diseases, necessitating comprehensive clinical features and data integration. We present a novel technique to enhance the clinical context through augmentation techniques with clinical tabular data, thereby improving its applicability and reliability in AI medical diagnostics. To address this, we introduce a pioneering approach to clinical data augmentation that employs large language models (LLMs) to generate patient contextual synthetic data. This methodology is crucial for training more robust deep learning models in healthcare. It preserves the integrity of real patient data while enriching the dataset with contextually relevant synthetic features, significantly enhancing model performance. DALL-M uses a three-phase feature generation process: (i) clinical context storage, (ii) expert query generation, and (iii) context-aware feature augmentation. DALL-M generates new, clinically relevant features by synthesizing chest X-ray images and reports. Applied to 799 cases using nine features from the MIMIC-IV dataset, it created an augmented set of 91 features. This is the first work to generate contextual values for existing and new features based on patients' X-ray reports, gender, and age and to produce new contextual knowledge during data augmentation. Empirical validation with machine learning models, including Decision Trees, Random Forests, XGBoost, and TabNET, showed significant performance improvements. Incorporating augmented features increased the F1 score by 16.5% and Precision and Recall by approximately 25%. DALL-M addresses a critical gap in clinical data augmentation, offering a robust framework for generating contextually enriched datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: This work explores how to fine-tune large language models using prompt engineering techniques with contextual information for generating an accurate text description of the full story, ready to be forwarded to off-the-shelve speech synthesis tools. We propose to use existing computer vision and optical character recognition techniques to build a grounded context from the comic strip image content, such as panels, characters, text, reading order and the association of bubbles and characters. Then we infer character identification and generate comic book script with context-aware panel description including character's appearance, posture, mood, dialogues etc. We believe that such enriched content description can be easily used to produce audiobook and eBook with various voices for characters, captions and playing sound effects.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Clea Rebillard, Julio Hurtado, Andrii Krutsylo, Lucia Passaro, Vincenzo Lomonaco</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning continually from a stream of non-i.i.d. data is an open challenge in deep learning, even more so when working in resource-constrained environments such as embedded devices. Visual models that are continually updated through supervised learning are often prone to overfitting, catastrophic forgetting, and biased representations. On the other hand, large language models contain knowledge about multiple concepts and their relations, which can foster a more robust, informed and coherent learning process. This work proposes Continual Visual Mapping (CVM), an approach that continually ground vision representations to a knowledge space extracted from a fixed Language model. Specifically, CVM continually trains a small and efficient visual model to map its representations into a conceptual space established by a fixed Large Language Model. Due to their smaller nature, CVM can be used when directly adapting large visual pre-trained models is unfeasible due to computational or data constraints. CVM overcome state-of-the-art continual learning methods on five benchmarks and offers a promising avenue for addressing generalization capabilities in continual learning, even in computationally constrained devices.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08289">Predicting Heart Failure with Attention Learning Techniques Utilizing Cardiovascular Data</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ershadul Haque, Manoranjan Paul, Faranak Tohidi</p>
<p>Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) encompass a group of disorders affecting the heart and blood vessels, including conditions such as coronary artery disease, heart failure, stroke, and hypertension. In cardiovascular diseases, heart failure is one of the main causes of death and also long-term suffering in patients worldwide. Prediction is one of the risk factors that is highly valuable for treatment and intervention to minimize heart failure. In this work, an attention learning-based heart failure prediction approach is proposed on EHR(electronic health record) cardiovascular data such as ejection fraction and serum creatinine. Moreover, different optimizers with various learning rate approaches are applied to fine-tune the proposed approach. Serum creatinine and ejection fraction are the two most important features to predict the patient's heart failure. The computational result shows that the RMSProp optimizer with 0.001 learning rate has a better prediction based on serum creatinine. On the other hand, the combination of SGD optimizer with 0.01 learning rate exhibits optimum performance based on ejection fraction features. Overall, the proposed attention learning-based approach performs very efficiently in predicting heart failure compared to the existing state-of-the-art such as LSTM approach.</p>

<p>Abstract: Argumentation is a formalism allowing to reason with contradictory information by modeling arguments and their interactions. There are now an increasing number of gradual semantics and impact measures that have emerged to facilitate the interpretation of their outcomes. An impact measure assesses, for each argument, the impact of other arguments on its score. In this paper, we refine an existing impact measure from Delobelle and Villata and introduce a new impact measure rooted in Shapley values. We introduce several principles to evaluate those two impact measures w.r.t. some well-known gradual semantics. This comprehensive analysis provides deeper insights into their functionality and desirability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Georgina Cosma, Mohit Kumar Singh, Patrick Waterson, Gyuchan Thomas Jun, Jonathan Back</p>
<p>Abstract: In healthcare, thousands of safety incidents occur every year, but learning from these incidents is not effectively aggregated. Analysing incident reports using AI could uncover critical insights to prevent harm by identifying recurring patterns and contributing factors. To aggregate and extract valuable information, natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques can be employed to summarise and mine unstructured data, potentially surfacing systemic issues and priority areas for improvement. This paper presents I-SIRch:CS, a framework designed to facilitate the aggregation and analysis of safety incident reports while ensuring traceability throughout the process. The framework integrates concept annotation using the Safety Intelligence Research (SIRch) taxonomy with clustering, summarisation, and analysis capabilities. Utilising a dataset of 188 anonymised maternity investigation reports annotated with 27 SIRch human factors concepts, I-SIRch:CS groups the annotated sentences into clusters using sentence embeddings and k-means clustering, maintaining traceability via file and sentence IDs. Summaries are generated for each cluster using offline state-of-the-art abstractive summarisation models (BART, DistilBART, T5), which are evaluated and compared using metrics assessing summary quality attributes. The generated summaries are linked back to the original file and sentence IDs, ensuring traceability and allowing for verification of the summarised information. Results demonstrate BART's strengths in creating informative and concise summaries.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Georgina Cosma, Mohit Kumar Singh, Patrick Waterson, Gyuchan Thomas Jun, Jonathan Back</p>
<p>Abstract: This study applies Natural Language Processing techniques, including Latent Dirichlet Allocation, to analyse anonymised maternity incident investigation reports from the Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch. The reports underwent preprocessing, annotation using the Safety Intelligence Research taxonomy, and topic modelling to uncover prevalent topics and detect differences in maternity care across ethnic groups. A combination of offline and online methods was utilised to ensure data protection whilst enabling advanced analysis, with offline processing for sensitive data and online processing for non-sensitive data using the `Claude 3 Opus' language model. Interactive topic analysis and semantic network visualisation were employed to extract and display thematic topics and visualise semantic relationships among keywords. The analysis revealed disparities in care among different ethnic groups, with distinct focus areas for the Black, Asian, and White British ethnic groups. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of topic modelling and NLP techniques in analysing maternity incident investigation reports and highlighting disparities in care. The findings emphasise the crucial role of advanced data analysis in improving maternity care quality and equity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liang Zeng, Liangjun Zhong, Liang Zhao, Tianwen Wei, Liu Yang, Jujie He, Cheng Cheng, Rui Hu, Yang Liu, Shuicheng Yan, Han Fang, Yahui Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the underlying factors that potentially enhance the mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). We argue that the data scaling law for math reasoning capabilities in modern LLMs is far from being saturated, highlighting how the model's quality improves with increases in data quantity. To support this claim, we introduce the Skywork-Math model series, supervised fine-tuned (SFT) on common 7B LLMs using our proposed 2.5M-instance Skywork-MathQA dataset. Skywork-Math 7B has achieved impressive accuracies of 51.2% on the competition-level MATH benchmark and 83.9% on the GSM8K benchmark using only SFT data, outperforming an early version of GPT-4 on MATH. The superior performance of Skywork-Math models contributes to our novel two-stage data synthesis and model SFT pipelines, which include three different augmentation methods and a diverse seed problem set, ensuring both the quantity and quality of Skywork-MathQA dataset across varying difficulty levels. Most importantly, we provide several practical takeaways to enhance math reasoning abilities in LLMs for both research and industry applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Geoff Keeling, Winnie Street</p>
<p>Abstract: Credences are mental states corresponding to degrees of confidence in propositions. Attribution of credences to Large Language Models (LLMs) is commonplace in the empirical literature on LLM evaluation. Yet the theoretical basis for LLM credence attribution is unclear. We defend three claims. First, our semantic claim is that LLM credence attributions are (at least in general) correctly interpreted literally, as expressing truth-apt beliefs on the part of scientists that purport to describe facts about LLM credences. Second, our metaphysical claim is that the existence of LLM credences is at least plausible, although current evidence is inconclusive. Third, our epistemic claim is that LLM credence attributions made in the empirical literature on LLM evaluation are subject to non-trivial sceptical concerns. It is a distinct possibility that even if LLMs have credences, LLM credence attributions are generally false because the experimental techniques used to assess LLM credences are not truth-tracking.</p>

<p>Abstract: Clinicians spend a significant amount of time reviewing medical images and transcribing their findings regarding patient diagnosis, referral and treatment in text form. Vision-language models (VLMs), which automatically interpret images and summarize their findings as text, have enormous potential to alleviate clinical workloads and increase patient access to high-quality medical care. While foundational models have stirred considerable interest in the medical community, it is unclear whether their general capabilities translate to real-world clinical utility. In this work, we show that foundation VLMs markedly underperform compared to practicing ophthalmologists on specialist tasks crucial to the care of patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). To address this, we initially identified the essential capabilities required for image-based clinical decision-making, and then developed a curriculum to selectively train VLMs in these skills. The resulting model, RetinaVLM, can be instructed to write reports that significantly outperform those written by leading foundation medical VLMs in disease staging (F1 score of 0.63 vs. 0.11) and patient referral (0.67 vs. 0.39), and approaches the diagnostic performance of junior ophthalmologists (who achieve 0.77 and 0.78 on the respective tasks). Furthermore, in a reader study involving two senior ophthalmologists with up to 32 years of experience, RetinaVLM's reports were found to be similarly correct (78.6% vs. 82.1%) and complete (both 78.6%) as reports written by junior ophthalmologists with up to 10 years of experience. These results demonstrate that our curriculum-based approach provides a blueprint for specializing generalist foundation medical VLMs to handle real-world clinical tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Iris Dumeur (CESBIO), Silvia Valero (CESBIO), Jordi Inglada (CESBIO)</p>
<p>Abstract: Although recently several foundation models for satellite remote sensing imagery have been proposed, they fail to address major challenges of real/operational applications. Indeed, embeddings that don't take into account the spectral, spatial and temporal dimensions of the data as well as the irregular or unaligned temporal sampling are of little use for most real world uses.As a consequence,  we propose an ALIgned Sits Encoder (ALISE), a novel approach that leverages the spatial, spectral, and temporal dimensions of irregular and unaligned SITS while producing aligned latent representations. Unlike SSL models currently available for SITS, ALISE incorporates a flexible query mechanism to project the SITS into a common and learned temporal projection space. Additionally, thanks to a multi-view framework, we explore integration of instance discrimination along a masked autoencoding task to SITS. The quality of the produced representation is assessed through three downstream tasks: crop segmentation (PASTIS), land cover segmentation (MultiSenGE), and a novel crop change detection dataset. Furthermore, the change detection task is performed without supervision. The results suggest that the use of aligned representations is more effective than previous SSL methods for linear probing segmentation tasks.</p>

We introduce LYNX, a SOTA hallucination detection LLM that is capable of advanced reasoning on challenging real-world hallucination scenarios. To evaluate LYNX, we present HaluBench, a comprehensive hallucination evaluation benchmark, consisting of 15k samples sourced from various real-world domains. Our experiment results show that LYNX outperforms GPT-4o, Claude-3-Sonnet, and closed and open-source LLM-as-a-judge models on HaluBench. We release LYNX, HaluBench and our evaluation code for public access.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiang Yin, Nico Potyka, Francesca Toni</p>
<p>Abstract: There is a growing interest in understanding arguments' strength in Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Frameworks (QBAFs). Most existing studies focus on attribution-based methods that explain an argument's strength by assigning importance scores to other arguments but fail to explain how to change the current strength to a desired one. To solve this issue, we introduce counterfactual explanations for QBAFs. We discuss problem variants and propose an iterative algorithm named Counterfactual Explanations for Quantitative bipolar Argumentation frameworks (CE-QArg). CE-QArg can identify valid and cost-effective counterfactual explanations based on two core modules, polarity and priority, which help determine the updating direction and magnitude for each argument, respectively. We discuss some formal properties of our counterfactual explanations and empirically evaluate CE-QArg on randomly generated QBAFs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyi Xiong, Zhiyuan Wang, Xuhong Li, Jiang Bian, Zeke Xie, Shahid Mumtaz, Laura E. Barnes</p>
<p>Abstract: This article explores the convergence of connectionist and symbolic artificial intelligence (AI), from historical debates to contemporary advancements. Traditionally considered distinct paradigms, connectionist AI focuses on neural networks, while symbolic AI emphasizes symbolic representation and logic. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), exemplified by ChatGPT and GPT-4, highlight the potential of connectionist architectures in handling human language as a form of symbols. The study argues that LLM-empowered Autonomous Agents (LAAs) embody this paradigm convergence. By utilizing LLMs for text-based knowledge modeling and representation, LAAs integrate neuro-symbolic AI principles, showcasing enhanced reasoning and decision-making capabilities. Comparing LAAs with Knowledge Graphs within the neuro-symbolic AI theme highlights the unique strengths of LAAs in mimicking human-like reasoning processes, scaling effectively with large datasets, and leveraging in-context samples without explicit re-training. The research underscores promising avenues in neuro-vector-symbolic integration, instructional encoding, and implicit reasoning, aimed at further enhancing LAA capabilities. By exploring the progression of neuro-symbolic AI and proposing future research trajectories, this work advances the understanding and development of AI technologies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuchen Xia, Jize Zhang, Nasser Jazdi, Michael Weyrich</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to integrating large language model (LLM) agents into automated production systems, aimed at enhancing task automation and flexibility. We organize production operations within a hierarchical framework based on the automation pyramid. Atomic operation functionalities are modeled as microservices, which are executed through interface invocation within a dedicated digital twin system. This allows for a scalable and flexible foundation for orchestrating production processes. In this digital twin system, low-level, hardware-specific data is semantically enriched and made interpretable for LLMs for production planning and control tasks. Large language model agents are systematically prompted to interpret these production-specific data and knowledge. Upon receiving a user request or identifying a triggering event, the LLM agents generate a process plan. This plan is then decomposed into a series of atomic operations, executed as microservices within the real-world automation system. We implement this overall approach on an automated modular production facility at our laboratory, demonstrating how the LLMs can handle production planning and control tasks through a concrete case study. This results in an intuitive production facility with higher levels of task automation and flexibility. Finally, we reveal the several limitations in realizing the full potential of the large language models in autonomous systems and point out promising benefits.

<p>Abstract: A profound gap persists between artificial intelligence (AI) and clinical practice in medicine, primarily due to the lack of rigorous and cost-effective evaluation methodologies. State-of-the-art and state-of-the-practice AI model evaluations are limited to laboratory studies on medical datasets or direct clinical trials with no or solely patient-centered controls. Moreover, the crucial role of clinicians in collaborating with AI, pivotal for determining its impact on clinical practice, is often overlooked. For the first time, we emphasize the critical necessity for rigorous and cost-effective evaluation methodologies for AI models in clinical practice, featuring patient/clinician-centered (dual-centered) AI randomized controlled trials (DC-AI RCTs) and virtual clinician-based in-silico trials (VC-MedAI) as an effective proxy for DC-AI RCTs. Leveraging 7500 diagnosis records from two-phase inaugural DC-AI RCTs across 14 medical centers with 125 clinicians, our results demonstrate the necessity of DC-AI RCTs and the effectiveness of VC-MedAI. Notably, VC-MedAI performs comparably to human clinicians, replicating insights and conclusions from prospective DC-AI RCTs. We envision DC-AI RCTs and VC-MedAI as pivotal advancements, presenting innovative and transformative evaluation methodologies for AI models in clinical practice, offering a preclinical-like setting mirroring conventional medicine, and reshaping development paradigms in a cost-effective and fast-iterative manner.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Doncheng Yuan, Jianzhe Xue, Jinshan Su, Wenchao Xu, Haibo Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Traffic flow estimation (TFE) is crucial for urban intelligent traffic systems. While traditional on-road detectors are hindered by limited coverage and high costs, cloud computing and data mining of vehicular network data, such as driving speeds and GPS coordinates, present a promising and cost-effective alternative. Furthermore, minimizing data collection can significantly reduce overhead. However, limited data can lead to inaccuracies and instability in TFE. To address this, we introduce the spatial-temporal Mamba (ST-Mamba), a deep learning model combining a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a Mamba framework. ST-Mamba is designed to enhance TFE accuracy and stability by effectively capturing the spatial-temporal patterns within traffic flow. Our model aims to achieve results comparable to those from extensive data sets while only utilizing minimal data. Simulations using real-world datasets have validated our model's ability to deliver precise and stable TFE across an urban landscape based on limited data, establishing a cost-efficient solution for TFE.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08563">Vox Populi, Vox AI? Using Language Models to Estimate German Public Opinion</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Leah von der Heyde, Anna-Carolina Haensch, Alexander Wenz</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent development of large language models (LLMs) has spurred discussions about whether LLM-generated "synthetic samples" could complement or replace traditional surveys, considering their training data potentially reflects attitudes and behaviors prevalent in the population. A number of mostly US-based studies have prompted LLMs to mimic survey respondents, with some of them finding that the responses closely match the survey data. However, several contextual factors related to the relationship between the respective target population and LLM training data might affect the generalizability of such findings. In this study, we investigate the extent to which LLMs can estimate public opinion in Germany, using the example of vote choice. We generate a synthetic sample of personas matching the individual characteristics of the 2017 German Longitudinal Election Study respondents. We ask the LLM GPT-3.5 to predict each respondent's vote choice and compare these predictions to the survey-based estimates on the aggregate and subgroup levels. We find that GPT-3.5 does not predict citizens' vote choice accurately, exhibiting a bias towards the Green and Left parties. While the LLM captures the tendencies of "typical" voter subgroups, such as partisans, it misses the multifaceted factors swaying individual voter choices. By examining the LLM-based prediction of voting behavior in a new context, our study contributes to the growing body of research about the conditions under which LLMs can be leveraged for studying public opinion. The findings point to disparities in opinion representation in LLMs and underscore the limitations in applying them for public opinion estimation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Meng Hua, Yuan Cheng, Hengshu Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly extended their capabilities, evolving from basic text generation to complex, human-like interactions. In light of the possibilities that LLMs could assume significant workplace responsibilities, it becomes imminently necessary to explore LLMs' capacities as professional assistants. This study focuses on the aspect of career interests by applying the Occupation Network's Interest Profiler short form to LLMs as if they were human participants and investigates their hypothetical career interests and competence, examining how these vary with language changes and model advancements. We analyzed the answers using a general linear mixed model approach and found distinct career interest inclinations among LLMs, particularly towards the social and artistic domains. Interestingly, these preferences did not align with the occupations where LLMs exhibited higher competence. This novel approach of using psychometric instruments and sophisticated statistical tools on LLMs unveils fresh perspectives on their integration into professional environments, highlighting human-like tendencies and promoting a reevaluation of LLMs' self-perception and competency alignment in the workforce.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alex Oesterling, Claudio Mayrink Verdun, Carol Xuan Long, Alex Glynn, Lucas Monteiro Paes, Sajani Vithana, Martina Cardone, Flavio P. Calmon</p>
<p>Abstract: Image search and retrieval tasks can perpetuate harmful stereotypes, erase cultural identities, and amplify social disparities. Current approaches to mitigate these representational harms balance the number of retrieved items across population groups defined by a small number of (often binary) attributes. However, most existing methods overlook intersectional groups determined by combinations of group attributes, such as gender, race, and ethnicity. We introduce Multi-Group Proportional Representation (MPR), a novel metric that measures representation across intersectional groups. We develop practical methods for estimating MPR, provide theoretical guarantees, and propose optimization algorithms to ensure MPR in retrieval. We demonstrate that existing methods optimizing for equal and proportional representation metrics may fail to promote MPR. Crucially, our work shows that optimizing MPR yields more proportional representation across multiple intersectional groups specified by a rich function class, often with minimal compromise in retrieval accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhen Qin, Daoyuan Chen, Wenhao Zhang, Liuyi Yao, Yilun Huang, Bolin Ding, Yaliang Li, Shuiguang Deng</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has been witnessed in recent years. Based on the powerful LLMs, multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs) extend the modality from text to a broader spectrum of domains, attracting widespread attention due to the broader range of application scenarios. As LLMs and MLLMs rely on vast amounts of model parameters and data to achieve emergent capabilities, the importance of data is receiving increasingly widespread attention and recognition. Tracing and analyzing recent data-oriented works for MLLMs, we find that the development of models and data is not two separate paths but rather interconnected. On the one hand, vaster and higher-quality data contribute to better performance of MLLMs, on the other hand, MLLMs can facilitate the development of data. The co-development of multi-modal data and MLLMs requires a clear view of 1) at which development stage of MLLMs can specific data-centric approaches be employed to enhance which capabilities, and 2) by utilizing which capabilities and acting as which roles can models contribute to multi-modal data. To promote the data-model co-development for MLLM community, we systematically review existing works related to MLLMs from the data-model co-development perspective.

<p>Abstract: We present a review of popular simulation engines and frameworks used in reinforcement learning (RL) research, aiming to guide researchers in selecting tools for creating simulated physical environments for RL and training setups. It evaluates nine frameworks (Brax, Chrono, Gazebo, MuJoCo, ODE, PhysX, PyBullet, Webots, and Unity) based on their popularity, feature range, quality, usability, and RL capabilities. We highlight the challenges in selecting and utilizing physics engines for RL research, including the need for detailed comparisons and an understanding of each framework's capabilities. Key findings indicate MuJoCo as the leading framework due to its performance and flexibility, despite usability challenges. Unity is noted for its ease of use but lacks scalability and simulation fidelity. The study calls for further development to improve simulation engines' usability and performance and stresses the importance of transparency and reproducibility in RL research. This review contributes to the RL community by offering insights into the selection process for simulation engines, facilitating informed decision-making.</p>

<p>Abstract: Optimizing warehouse layouts is crucial due to its significant impact on efficiency and productivity. We present an AI-driven framework for automated warehouse layout generation. This framework employs constrained beam search to derive optimal layouts within given spatial parameters, adhering to all functional requirements. The feasibility of the generated layouts is verified based on criteria such as item accessibility, required minimum clearances, and aisle connectivity. A scoring function is then used to evaluate the feasible layouts considering the number of storage locations, access points, and accessibility costs. We demonstrate our method's ability to produce feasible, optimal layouts for a variety of warehouse dimensions and shapes, diverse door placements, and interconnections. This approach, currently being prepared for deployment, will enable human designers to rapidly explore and confirm options, facilitating the selection of the most appropriate layout for their use-case.</p>

<p>Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a compelling approach for training Large Language Models (LLMs) to adhere to human preferences. However, the performance of DPO is sensitive to the fine-tuning of its trade-off parameter $\beta$, as well as to the quality of the preference data. We analyze the impact of $\beta$ and data quality on DPO, uncovering that optimal $\beta$ values vary with the informativeness of pairwise data. Addressing the limitations of static $\beta$ values, we introduce a novel framework that dynamically calibrates $\beta$ at the batch level, informed by data quality considerations. Additionally, our method incorporates $\beta$-guided data filtering to safeguard against the influence of outliers. Through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that our dynamic $\beta$ adjustment technique significantly improves DPO's performance across a range of models and datasets, offering a more robust and adaptable training paradigm for aligning LLMs with human feedback.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leah Chong, Jude Rayan, Steven Dow, Ioanna Lykourentzou, Faez Ahmed</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image generative models have increasingly been used to assist designers during concept generation in various creative domains, such as graphic design, user interface design, and fashion design. However, their applications in engineering design remain limited due to the models' challenges in generating images of feasible designs concepts. To address this issue, this paper introduces a method that improves the design feasibility by prompting the generation with feasible CAD images. In this work, the usefulness of this method is investigated through a case study with a bike design task using an off-the-shelf text-to-image model, Stable Diffusion 2.1. A diverse set of bike designs are produced in seven different generation settings with varying CAD image prompting weights, and these designs are evaluated on their perceived feasibility and novelty. Results demonstrate that the CAD image prompting successfully helps text-to-image models like Stable Diffusion 2.1 create visibly more feasible design images. While a general tradeoff is observed between feasibility and novelty, when the prompting weight is kept low around 0.35, the design feasibility is significantly improved while its novelty remains on par with those generated by text prompts alone. The insights from this case study offer some guidelines for selecting the appropriate CAD image prompting weight for different stages of the engineering design process. When utilized effectively, our CAD image prompting method opens doors to a wider range of applications of text-to-image models in engineering design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alex Oesterling, Usha Bhalla, Suresh Venkatasubramanian, Himabindu Lakkaraju</p>
<p>Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools are increasingly employed in diverse real-world applications, there has been significant interest in regulating these tools. To this end, several regulatory frameworks have been introduced by different countries worldwide. For example, the European Union recently passed the AI Act, the White House issued an Executive Order on safe, secure, and trustworthy AI, and the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy issued the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights (AI BoR). Many of these frameworks emphasize the need for auditing and improving the trustworthiness of AI tools, underscoring the importance of safety, privacy, explainability, fairness, and human fallback options. Although these regulatory frameworks highlight the necessity of enforcement, practitioners often lack detailed guidance on implementing them. Furthermore, the extensive research on operationalizing each of these aspects is frequently buried in technical papers that are difficult for practitioners to parse. In this write-up, we address this shortcoming by providing an accessible overview of existing literature related to operationalizing regulatory principles. We provide easy-to-understand summaries of state-of-the-art literature and highlight various gaps that exist between regulatory guidelines and existing AI research, including the trade-offs that emerge during operationalization. We hope that this work not only serves as a starting point for practitioners interested in learning more about operationalizing the regulatory guidelines outlined in the Blueprint for an AI BoR but also provides researchers with a list of critical open problems and gaps between regulations and state-of-the-art AI research. Finally, we note that this is a working paper and we invite feedback in line with the purpose of this document as described in the introduction.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents CaseGPT, an innovative approach that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology to enhance case-based reasoning in the healthcare and legal sectors. The system addresses the challenges of traditional database queries by enabling fuzzy searches based on imprecise descriptions, thereby improving data searchability and usability. CaseGPT not only retrieves relevant case data but also generates insightful suggestions and recommendations based on patterns discerned from existing case data. This functionality proves especially valuable for tasks such as medical diagnostics, legal precedent research, and case strategy formulation. The paper includes an in-depth discussion of the system's methodology, its performance in both medical and legal domains, and its potential for future applications. Our experiments demonstrate that CaseGPT significantly outperforms traditional keyword-based and simple LLM-based systems in terms of precision, recall, and efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tuan Nguyen, Dung Thuy Nguyen, Khoa D Doan, Kok-Seng Wong</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the promise of Federated Learning (FL) for privacy-preserving model training on distributed data, it remains susceptible to backdoor attacks. These attacks manipulate models by embedding triggers (specific input patterns) in the training data, forcing misclassification as predefined classes during deployment. Traditional single-trigger attacks and recent work on cooperative multiple-trigger attacks, where clients collaborate, highlight limitations in attack realism due to coordination requirements. We investigate a more alarming scenario: non-cooperative multiple-trigger attacks. Here, independent adversaries introduce distinct triggers targeting unique classes. These parallel attacks exploit FL's decentralized nature, making detection difficult. Our experiments demonstrate the alarming vulnerability of FL to such attacks, where individual backdoors can be successfully learned without impacting the main task. This research emphasizes the critical need for robust defenses against diverse backdoor attacks in the evolving FL landscape. While our focus is on empirical analysis, we believe it can guide backdoor research toward more realistic settings, highlighting the crucial role of FL in building robust defenses against diverse backdoor threats.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Oladipo A. Madamidola, Felix Ngobigha, Adnane Ez-zizi</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning has been successfully applied in developing malware detection systems, with a primary focus on accuracy, and increasing attention to reducing computational overhead and improving model interpretability. However, an important question remains underexplored: How well can machine learning-based models detect entirely new forms of malware not present in the training data? In this study, we present a machine learning-based system for detecting obfuscated malware that is not only highly accurate, lightweight and interpretable, but also capable of successfully adapting to new types of malware attacks. Our system is capable of detecting 15 malware subtypes despite being exclusively trained on one malware subtype, namely the Transponder from the Spyware family. This system was built after training 15 distinct random forest-based models, each on a different malware subtype from the CIC-MalMem-2022 dataset. These models were evaluated against the entire range of malware subtypes, including all unseen malware subtypes. To maintain the system's streamlined nature, training was confined to the top five most important features, which also enhanced interpretability. The Transponder-focused model exhibited high accuracy, exceeding 99.8%, with an average processing speed of 5.7 microseconds per file. We also illustrate how the Shapley additive explanations technique can facilitate the interpretation of the model predictions. Our research contributes to advancing malware detection methodologies, pioneering the feasibility of detecting obfuscated malware by exclusively training a model on a single or a few carefully selected malware subtypes and applying it to detect unseen subtypes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junfei Wang, He Huang, Jingze Feng, Steven Wong, Lihua Xie, Jianfei Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: There is a significant demand for indoor localization technology in smart buildings, and the most promising solution in this field is using RF sensors and fingerprinting-based methods that employ machine learning models trained on crowd-sourced user data gathered from IoT devices. However, this raises security and privacy issues in practice. Some researchers propose to use federated learning to partially overcome privacy problems, but there still remain security concerns, e.g., single-point failure and malicious attacks. In this paper, we propose a framework named DFLoc to achieve precise 3D localization tasks while considering the following two security concerns. Particularly, we design a specialized blockchain to decentralize the framework by distributing the tasks such as model distribution and aggregation which are handled by a central server to all clients in most previous works, to address the issue of the single-point failure for a reliable and accurate indoor localization system. Moreover, we introduce an updated model verification mechanism within the blockchain to alleviate the concern of malicious node attacks. Experimental results substantiate the framework's capacity to deliver accurate 3D location predictions and its superior resistance to the impacts of single-point failure and malicious attacks when compared to conventional centralized federated learning systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jihai Zhang, Wei Wang, Siyan Guo, Li Wang, Fangquan Lin, Cheng Yang, Wotao Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Optimization problems seek to find the best solution to an objective under a set of constraints, and have been widely investigated in real-world applications. Modeling and solving optimization problems in a specific domain typically require a combination of domain knowledge, mathematical skills, and programming ability, making it difficult for general users and even domain professionals. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called OptLLM that augments LLMs with external solvers. Specifically, OptLLM accepts user queries in natural language, convert them into mathematical formulations and programming codes, and calls the solvers to calculate the results for decision-making. In addition, OptLLM supports multi-round dialogues to gradually refine the modeling and solving of optimization problems. To illustrate the effectiveness of OptLLM, we provide tutorials on three typical optimization applications and conduct experiments on both prompt-based GPT models and a fine-tuned Qwen model using a large-scale selfdeveloped optimization dataset. Experimental results show that OptLLM works with various LLMs, and the fine-tuned model achieves an accuracy boost compared to the promptbased models. Some features of OptLLM framework have been available for trial since June 2023 (https://opt.alibabacloud.com/chat or https://opt.aliyun.com/chat).</p>

<p>Abstract: This study investigates the impact of dynamic user profile embedding on personalized context-aware experiences in social networks. A comparative analysis of multilingual and English transformer models was performed on a dataset of over twenty million data points. The analysis included a wide range of metrics and performance indicators to compare dynamic profile embeddings versus non-embeddings (effectively static profile embeddings). A comparative study using degradation functions was conducted. Extensive testing and research confirmed that dynamic embedding successfully tracks users' changing tastes and preferences, providing more accurate recommendations and higher user engagement. These results are important for social media platforms aiming to improve user experience through relevant features and sophisticated recommendation engines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuzhou Yang, Yangming Zhou, Qichao Ying, Zhenxing Qian, Xinpeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Pioneer researches recognize evidences as crucial elements in fake news detection apart from patterns. Existing evidence-aware methods either require laborious pre-processing procedures to assure relevant and high-quality evidence data, or incorporate the entire spectrum of available evidences in all news cases, regardless of the quality and quantity of the retrieved data. In this paper, we propose an approach named \textbf{SEE} that retrieves useful information from web-searched annotation-free evidences with an early-termination mechanism. The proposed SEE is constructed by three main phases: \textbf{S}earching online materials using the news as a query and directly using their titles as evidences without any annotating or filtering procedure, sequentially \textbf{E}xamining the news alongside with each piece of evidence via attention mechanisms to produce new hidden states with retrieved information, and allowing \textbf{E}arly-termination within the examining loop by assessing whether there is adequate confidence for producing a correct prediction. We have conducted extensive experiments on datasets with unprocessed evidences, i.e., Weibo21, GossipCop, and pre-processed evidences, namely Snopes and PolitiFact. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simon Ferreira, Charles K. Assaad</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding causal relationships in dynamic systems is essential for numerous scientific fields, including epidemiology, economics, and biology. While causal inference methods have been extensively studied, they often rely on fully specified causal graphs, which may not always be available or practical in complex dynamic systems. Partially specified causal graphs, such as summary causal graphs (SCGs), provide a simplified representation of causal relationships, omitting temporal information and focusing on high-level causal structures. This simplification introduces new challenges concerning the types of queries of interest: macro queries, which involve relationships between clusters represented as vertices in the graph, and micro queries, which pertain to relationships between variables that are not directly visible through the vertices of the graph. In this paper, we first clearly distinguish between macro conditional independencies and micro conditional independencies and between macro total effects and micro total effects. Then, we demonstrate the soundness and completeness of the d-separation to identify macro conditional independencies in SCGs. Furthermore, we establish that the do-calculus is sound and complete for identifying macro total effects in SCGs. Conversely, we also show through various examples that these results do not hold when considering micro conditional independencies and micro total effects.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaitlyn Zhou, Jena D. Hwang, Xiang Ren, Nouha Dziri, Dan Jurafsky, Maarten Sap</p>
<p>Abstract: The reconfiguration of human-LM interactions from simple sentence completions to complex, multi-domain, humanlike engagements necessitates new methodologies to understand how humans choose to rely on LMs. In our work, we contend that reliance is influenced by numerous factors within the interactional context of a generation, a departure from prior work that used verbalized confidence (e.g., "I'm certain the answer is...") as the key determinant of reliance. Here, we introduce Rel-A.I., an in situ, system-level evaluation approach to measure human reliance on LM-generated epistemic markers (e.g., "I think it's..", "Undoubtedly it's..."). Using this methodology, we measure reliance rates in three emergent human-LM interaction settings: long-term interactions, anthropomorphic generations, and variable subject matter. Our findings reveal that reliance is not solely based on verbalized confidence but is significantly affected by other features of the interaction context. Prior interactions, anthropomorphic cues, and subject domain all contribute to reliance variability. An expression such as, "I'm pretty sure it's...", can vary up to 20% in reliance frequency depending on its interactional context. Our work underscores the importance of context in understanding human reliance and offers future designers and researchers with a methodology to conduct such measurements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weisong Sun, Yun Miao, Yuekang Li, Hongyu Zhang, Chunrong Fang, Yi Liu, Gelei Deng, Yang Liu, Zhenyu Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: To support software developers in understanding and maintaining programs, various automatic (source) code summarization techniques have been proposed to generate a concise natural language summary (i.e., comment) for a given code snippet. Recently, the emergence of large language models (LLMs) has led to a great boost in the performance of code-related tasks. In this paper, we undertake a systematic and comprehensive study on code summarization in the era of LLMs, which covers multiple aspects involved in the workflow of LLM-based code summarization. Specifically, we begin by examining prevalent automated evaluation methods for assessing the quality of summaries generated by LLMs and find that the results of the GPT-4 evaluation method are most closely aligned with human evaluation. Then, we explore the effectiveness of five prompting techniques (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, critique, and expert) in adapting LLMs to code summarization tasks. Contrary to expectations, advanced prompting techniques may not outperform simple zero-shot prompting. Next, we investigate the impact of LLMs' model settings (including top\_p and temperature parameters) on the quality of generated summaries. We find the impact of the two parameters on summary quality varies by the base LLM and programming language, but their impacts are similar. Moreover, we canvass LLMs' abilities to summarize code snippets in distinct types of programming languages. The results reveal that LLMs perform suboptimally when summarizing code written in logic programming languages compared to other language types. Finally, we unexpectedly find that CodeLlama-Instruct with 7B parameters can outperform advanced GPT-4 in generating summaries describing code implementation details and asserting code properties. We hope that our findings can provide a comprehensive understanding of code summarization in the era of LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rosie Zhao, Depen Morwani, David Brandfonbrener, Nikhil Vyas, Sham Kakade</p>
<p>Abstract: Training language models becomes increasingly expensive with scale, prompting numerous attempts to improve optimization efficiency. Despite these efforts, the Adam optimizer remains the most widely used, due to a prevailing view that it is the most effective approach. We aim to compare several optimization algorithms, including SGD, Adafactor, Adam, and Lion, in the context of autoregressive language modeling across a range of model sizes, hyperparameters, and architecture variants. Our findings indicate that, except for SGD, these algorithms all perform comparably both in their optimal performance and also in terms of how they fare across a wide range of hyperparameter choices. Our results suggest to practitioners that the choice of optimizer can be guided by practical considerations like memory constraints and ease of implementation, as no single algorithm emerged as a clear winner in terms of performance or stability to hyperparameter misspecification.
  Given our findings, we further dissect these approaches, examining two simplified versions of Adam: a) signed momentum (Signum) which we see recovers both the performance and hyperparameter stability of Adam and b) Adalayer, a layerwise variant of Adam which we introduce to study Adam's preconditioning. Examining Adalayer leads us to the conclusion that the largest impact of Adam's preconditioning is restricted to the last layer and LayerNorm parameters, and, perhaps surprisingly, the remaining layers can be trained with SGD.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tisa Islam Erana, Mark A. Finlayson</p>
<p>Abstract: Patent landscaping is the process of identifying all patents related to a particular technological area, and is important for assessing various aspects of the intellectual property context. Traditionally, constructing patent landscapes is intensely laborious and expensive, and the rapid expansion of patenting activity in recent decades has driven an increasing need for efficient and effective automated patent landscaping approaches. In particular, it is critical that we be able to construct patent landscapes using a minimal number of labeled examples, as labeling patents for a narrow technology area requires highly specialized (and hence expensive) technical knowledge. We present an automated neural patent landscaping system that demonstrates significantly improved performance on difficult examples (0.69 $F_1$ on 'hard' examples, versus 0.6 for previously reported systems), and also significant improvements with much less training data (overall 0.75 $F_1$ on as few as 24 examples). Furthermore, in evaluating such automated landscaping systems, acquiring good data is challenge; we demonstrate a higher-quality training data generation procedure by merging Abood and Feltenberger's (2018) "seed/anti-seed" approach with active learning to collect difficult labeled examples near the decision boundary. Using this procedure we created a new dataset of labeled AI patents for training and testing. As in prior work we compare our approach with a number of baseline systems, and we release our code and data for others to build upon.</p>

<p>Abstract: Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is characterized as a rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disease that presents individuals with limited treatment options in the realm of medical interventions and therapies. The disease showcases a diverse range of onset patterns and progression trajectories, emphasizing the critical importance of early detection of functional decline to enable tailored care strategies and timely therapeutic interventions. The present investigation, spearheaded by the iDPP@CLEF 2024 challenge, focuses on utilizing sensor-derived data obtained through an app. This data is used to construct various machine learning models specifically designed to forecast the advancement of the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) score, leveraging the dataset provided by the organizers. In our analysis, multiple predictive models were evaluated to determine their efficacy in handling ALS sensor data. The temporal aspect of the sensor data was compressed and amalgamated using statistical methods, thereby augmenting the interpretability and applicability of the gathered information for predictive modeling objectives. The models that demonstrated optimal performance were a naive baseline and ElasticNet regression. The naive model achieved a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.20 and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.49, slightly outperforming the ElasticNet model, which recorded an MAE of 0.22 and an RMSE of 0.50. Our comparative analysis suggests that while the naive approach yielded marginally better predictive accuracy, the ElasticNet model provides a robust framework for understanding feature contributions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sai Srivatsa Ravindranath, Zhe Feng, Di Wang, Manzil Zaheer, Aranyak Mehta, David C. Parkes</p>
<p>Abstract: Revenue-optimal auction design is a challenging problem with significant theoretical and practical implications. Sequential auction mechanisms, known for their simplicity and strong strategyproofness guarantees, are often limited by theoretical results that are largely existential, except for certain restrictive settings. Although traditional reinforcement learning methods such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) are applicable in this domain, they struggle with computational demands and convergence issues when dealing with large and continuous action spaces. In light of this and recognizing that we can model transitions differentiable for our settings, we propose using a new reinforcement learning framework tailored for sequential combinatorial auctions that leverages first-order gradients. Our extensive evaluations show that our approach achieves significant improvement in revenue over both analytical baselines and standard reinforcement learning algorithms. Furthermore, we scale our approach to scenarios involving up to 50 agents and 50 items, demonstrating its applicability in complex, real-world auction settings. As such, this work advances the computational tools available for auction design and contributes to bridging the gap between theoretical results and practical implementations in sequential auction design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xijie Huang, Zechun Liu, Shih-Yang Liu, Kwang-Ting Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), as a representative Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)method, significantly enhances the training efficiency by updating only a small portion of the weights in Large Language Models (LLMs). Recently, weight-only quantization techniques have also been applied to LoRA methods to reduce the memory footprint of fine-tuning. However, applying weight-activation quantization to the LoRA pipeline is under-explored, and we observe substantial performance degradation primarily due to the presence of activation outliers. In this work, we propose RoLoRA, the first LoRA-based scheme for effective weight-activation quantization. RoLoRA utilizes rotation for outlier elimination and proposes rotation-aware fine-tuning to preserve the outlier-free characteristics in rotated LLMs. Experimental results show RoLoRA consistently improves low-bit LoRA convergence and post-training quantization robustness in weight-activation settings. We evaluate RoLoRA across LLaMA2-7B/13B, LLaMA3-8B models, achieving up to 29.5% absolute accuracy gain of 4-bit weight-activation quantized LLaMA2- 13B on commonsense reasoning tasks compared to LoRA baseline. We further demonstrate its effectiveness on Large Multimodal Models (LLaVA-1.5-7B). Codes are available at https://github.com/HuangOwen/RoLoRA</p>

<p>Abstract: The growing number of connected vehicles offers an opportunity to leverage internet of vehicles (IoV) data for traffic state estimation (TSE) which plays a crucial role in intelligent transportation systems (ITS). By utilizing only a portion of IoV data instead of the entire dataset, the significant overheads associated with collecting and processing large amounts of data can be avoided. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that utilizes sparse IoV data to achieve cost-effective TSE. Particularly, we propose a novel spatial-temporal attention model called the convolutional retentive network (CRNet) to improve the TSE accuracy by mining spatial-temporal traffic state correlations. The model employs the convolutional neural network (CNN) for spatial correlation aggregation and the retentive network (RetNet) based on the attention mechanism to extract temporal correlations. Extensive simulations on a real-world IoV dataset validate the advantage of the proposed TSE approach in achieving accurate TSE using sparse IoV data, demonstrating its cost effectiveness and practicality for real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yezi Liu, Yanning Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Training graph neural networks (GNNs) on large-scale graphs can be challenging due to the high computational expense caused by the massive number of nodes and high-dimensional nodal features. Existing graph condensation studies tackle this problem only by reducing the number of nodes in the graph. However, the resulting condensed graph data can still be cumbersome. Specifically, although the nodes of the Citeseer dataset are reduced to 0.9% (30 nodes) in training, the number of features is 3,703, severely exceeding the training sample magnitude. Faced with this challenge, we study the problem of joint condensation for both features and nodes in large-scale graphs. This task is challenging mainly due to 1) the intertwined nature of the node features and the graph structure calls for the feature condensation solver to be structure-aware; and 2) the difficulty of keeping useful information in the condensed graph. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework TinyGraph, to condense features and nodes simultaneously in graphs. Specifically, we cast the problem as matching the gradients of GNN weights trained on the condensed graph and the gradients obtained from training over the original graph, where the feature condensation is achieved by a trainable function. The condensed graph obtained by minimizing the matching loss along the training trajectory can henceforth retain critical information in the original graph. Extensive experiments were carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TinyGraph. For example, a GNN trained with TinyGraph retains 98.5% and 97.5% of the original test accuracy on the Cora and Citeseer datasets, respectively, while significantly reducing the number of nodes by 97.4% and 98.2%, and the number of features by 90.0% on both datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Isaac Sheidlower, Reuben Aronson, Elaine Schaertl Short</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models are a promising path toward general-purpose and user-friendly robots. The prevalent approach involves training a generalist policy that, like a reinforcement learning policy, uses observations to output actions. Although this approach has seen much success, several concerns arise when considering deployment and end-user interaction with these systems. In particular, the lack of modularity between tasks means that when model weights are updated (e.g., when a user provides feedback), the behavior in other, unrelated tasks may be affected. This can negatively impact the system's interpretability and usability. We present an alternative approach to the design of robot foundation models, Diffusion for Policy Parameters (DPP), which generates stand-alone, task-specific policies. Since these policies are detached from the foundation model, they are updated only when a user wants, either through feedback or personalization, allowing them to gain a high degree of familiarity with that policy. We demonstrate a proof-of-concept of DPP in simulation then discuss its limitations and the future of interpretable foundation models.</p>

<p>Abstract: The Wizard of Oz (WoZ) method is a widely adopted research approach where a human Wizard ``role-plays'' a not readily available technology and interacts with participants to elicit user behaviors and probe the design space. With the growing ability for modern large language models (LLMs) to role-play, one can apply LLMs as Wizards in WoZ experiments with better scalability and lower cost than the traditional approach. However, methodological guidance on responsibly applying LLMs in WoZ experiments and a systematic evaluation of LLMs' role-playing ability are lacking. Through two LLM-powered WoZ studies, we take the first step towards identifying an experiment lifecycle for researchers to safely integrate LLMs into WoZ experiments and interpret data generated from settings that involve Wizards role-played by LLMs. We also contribute a heuristic-based evaluation framework that allows the estimation of LLMs' role-playing ability in WoZ experiments and reveals LLMs' behavior patterns at scale.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Donghyun Kim, Aws Khalil, Haewoon Nam, Jaerock Kwon</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AV) and Advanced Driver Assistant Systems (ADAS) prioritize safety over comfort. The intertwining factors of safety and comfort emerge as pivotal elements in ensuring the effectiveness of Autonomous Driving (AD). Users often experience discomfort when AV or ADAS drive the vehicle on their behalf. Providing a personalized human-like AD experience, tailored to match users' unique driving styles while adhering to safety prerequisites, presents a significant opportunity to boost the acceptance of AVs. This paper proposes a novel approach, Neural Driving Style Transfer (NDST), inspired by Neural Style Transfer (NST), to address this issue. NDST integrates a Personalized Block (PB) into the conventional Baseline Driving Model (BDM), allowing for the transfer of a user's unique driving style while adhering to safety parameters. The PB serves as a self-configuring system, learning and adapting to an individual's driving behavior without requiring modifications to the BDM. This approach enables the personalization of AV models, aligning the driving style more closely with user preferences while ensuring baseline safety critical actuation. Two contrasting driving styles (Style A and Style B) were used to validate the proposed NDST methodology, demonstrating its efficacy in transferring personal driving styles to the AV system. Our work highlights the potential of NDST to enhance user comfort in AVs by providing a personalized and familiar driving experience. The findings affirm the feasibility of integrating NDST into existing AV frameworks to bridge the gap between safety and individualized driving styles, promoting wider acceptance and improved user experiences.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hang Zhang, Xiang Chen, Renjiu Hu, Dongdong Liu, Gaolei Li, Rongguang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Many existing learning-based deformable image registration methods impose constraints on deformation fields to ensure they are globally smooth and continuous. However, this assumption does not hold in cardiac image registration, where different anatomical regions exhibit asymmetric motions during respiration and movements due to sliding organs within the chest. Consequently, such global constraints fail to accommodate local discontinuities across organ boundaries, potentially resulting in erroneous and unrealistic displacement fields. In this paper, we address this issue with MemWarp, a learning framework that leverages a memory network to store prototypical information tailored to different anatomical regions. MemWarp is different from earlier approaches in two main aspects: firstly, by decoupling feature extraction from similarity matching in moving and fixed images, it facilitates more effective utilization of feature maps; secondly, despite its capability to preserve discontinuities, it eliminates the need for segmentation masks during model inference. In experiments on a publicly available cardiac dataset, our method achieves considerable improvements in registration accuracy and producing realistic deformations, outperforming state-of-the-art methods with a remarkable 7.1\% Dice score improvement over the runner-up semi-supervised method.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hossein Entezari Zarch, Abdulla Alshabanah, Chaoyi Jiang, Murali Annavaram</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning recommendation models (DLRMs) are at the heart of the current e-commerce industry. However, the amount of training data used to train these large models is growing exponentially, leading to substantial training hurdles. The training dataset contains two primary types of information: content-based information (features of users and items) and collaborative information (interactions between users and items). One approach to reduce the training dataset is to remove user-item interactions. But that significantly diminishes collaborative information, which is crucial for maintaining accuracy due to its inclusion of interaction histories. This loss profoundly impacts DLRM performance.
  This paper makes an important observation that if one can capture the user-item interaction history to enrich the user and item embeddings, then the interaction history can be compressed without losing model accuracy. Thus, this work, Collaborative Aware Data Compression (CADC), takes a two-step approach to training dataset compression. In the first step, we use matrix factorization of the user-item interaction matrix to create a novel embedding representation for both the users and items. Once the user and item embeddings are enriched by the interaction history information the approach then applies uniform random sampling of the training dataset to drastically reduce the training dataset size while minimizing model accuracy drop.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Suqi Song, Chenxu Zhang, Peng Zhang, Pengkun Li, Fenglong Song, Lei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Urban waterlogging poses a major risk to public safety and infrastructure. Conventional methods using water-level sensors need high-maintenance to hardly achieve full coverage. Recent advances employ surveillance camera imagery and deep learning for detection, yet these struggle amidst scarce data and adverse environmental conditions. In this paper, we establish a challenging Urban Waterlogging Benchmark (UW-Bench) under diverse adverse conditions to advance real-world applications. We propose a Large-Small Model co-adapter paradigm (LSM-adapter), which harnesses the substantial generic segmentation potential of large model and the specific task-directed guidance of small model. Specifically, a Triple-S Prompt Adapter module alongside a Dynamic Prompt Combiner are proposed to generate then merge multiple prompts for mask decoder adaptation. Meanwhile, a Histogram Equalization Adap-ter module is designed to infuse the image specific information for image encoder adaptation. Results and analysis show the challenge and superiority of our developed benchmark and algorithm. Project page: \url{https://github.com/zhang-chenxu/LSM-Adapter}</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jerry Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Long sequences occur in abundance within real-world scenarios, hence properly modelling them opens numerous down-stream use-cases. Deep neural networks, however, have often struggled with these for a variety of reasons. Recent advances, both in system engineering as well as model design, have enabled the scaling up of model that are purported to support extended context length. In particular, the state-space and linear recurrent neural network families of models hypothetically can entend to infinite sequence lenth. However, is this too good to be true? We conduct an evaluation to show that while such claims may be sound theoretically, there remain large practical gaps that are empirically observed. In particular, recurrent models still suffer in the same settings as long-context LLMs with attention. We further show that different inductive biases have inconsistent extrapolation capabilities, highlighting the need to further study such paradigms and investigate why long-context models seemingly fail to behave as one might expect.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianan Wei, Tianfei Zhou, Yi Yang, Wenguan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: This work addresses a new challenge of understanding human nonverbal interaction in social contexts. Nonverbal signals pervade virtually every communicative act. Our gestures, facial expressions, postures, gaze, even physical appearance all convey messages, without anything being said. Despite their critical role in social life, nonverbal signals receive very limited attention as compared to the linguistic counterparts, and existing solutions typically examine nonverbal cues in isolation. Our study marks the first systematic effort to enhance the interpretation of multifaceted nonverbal signals. First, we contribute a novel large-scale dataset, called NVI, which is meticulously annotated to include bounding boxes for humans and corresponding social groups, along with 22 atomic-level nonverbal behaviors under five broad interaction types. Second, we establish a new task NVI-DET for nonverbal interaction detection, which is formalized as identifying triplets in the form <individual, group, interaction> from images. Third, we propose a nonverbal interaction detection hypergraph (NVI-DEHR), a new approach that explicitly models high-order nonverbal interactions using hypergraphs. Central to the model is a dual multi-scale hypergraph that adeptly addresses individual-to-individual and group-to-group correlations across varying scales, facilitating interactional feature learning and eventually improving interaction prediction. Extensive experiments on NVI show that NVI-DEHR improves various baselines significantly in NVI-DET. It also exhibits leading performance on HOI-DET, confirming its versatility in supporting related tasks and strong generalization ability. We hope that our study will offer the community new avenues to explore nonverbal signals in more depth.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> A. Noorizadegan, Y. C. Hon, D. L. Young, C. S. Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Surface reconstruction from point clouds is a fundamental challenge in computer graphics and medical imaging. In this paper, we explore the application of advanced neural network architectures for the accurate and efficient reconstruction of surfaces from data points. We introduce a novel variant of the Highway network (Hw) called Square-Highway (SqrHw) within the context of multilayer perceptrons and investigate its performance alongside plain neural networks and a simplified Hw in various numerical examples. These examples include the reconstruction of simple and complex surfaces, such as spheres, human hands, and intricate models like the Stanford Bunny. We analyze the impact of factors such as the number of hidden layers, interior and exterior points, and data distribution on surface reconstruction quality. Our results show that the proposed SqrHw architecture outperforms other neural network configurations, achieving faster convergence and higher-quality surface reconstructions. Additionally, we demonstrate the SqrHw's ability to predict surfaces over missing data, a valuable feature for challenging applications like medical imaging. Furthermore, our study delves into further details, demonstrating that the proposed method based on highway networks yields more stable weight norms and backpropagation gradients compared to the Plain Network architecture. This research not only advances the field of computer graphics but also holds utility for other purposes such as function interpolation and physics-informed neural networks, which integrate multilayer perceptrons into their algorithms.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reduplication and repetition, though similar in form, serve distinct linguistic purposes. Reduplication is a deliberate morphological process used to express grammatical, semantic, or pragmatic nuances, while repetition is often unintentional and indicative of disfluency. This paper presents the first large-scale study of reduplication and repetition in speech using computational linguistics. We introduce IndicRedRep, a new publicly available dataset containing Hindi, Telugu, and Marathi text annotated with reduplication and repetition at the word level. We evaluate transformer-based models for multi-class reduplication and repetition token classification, utilizing the Reparandum-Interregnum-Repair structure to distinguish between the two phenomena. Our models achieve macro F1 scores of up to 85.62% in Hindi, 83.95% in Telugu, and 84.82% in Marathi for reduplication-repetition classification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aydin Abadi, Vishnu Asutosh Dasu, Sumanta Sarkar</p>
<p>Abstract: Deduplication is a vital preprocessing step that enhances machine learning model performance and saves training time and energy. However, enhancing federated learning through deduplication poses challenges, especially regarding scalability and potential privacy violations if deduplication involves sharing all clients' data. In this paper, we address the problem of deduplication in a federated setup by introducing a pioneering protocol, Efficient Privacy-Preserving Multi-Party Deduplication (EP-MPD). It efficiently removes duplicates from multiple clients' datasets without compromising data privacy. EP-MPD is constructed in a modular fashion, utilizing two novel variants of the Private Set Intersection protocol. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the significant benefits of deduplication in federated learning of large language models. For instance, we observe up to 19.61% improvement in perplexity and up to 27.95% reduction in running time. EP-MPD effectively balances privacy and performance in federated learning, making it a valuable solution for large-scale applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mikhail Kulyabin, Paul A. Constable, Aleksei Zhdanov, Irene O. Lee, David H. Skuse, Dorothy A. Thompson, Andreas Maier</p>
<p>Abstract: The electroretinogram (ERG) is a clinical test that records the retina's electrical response to light. The ERG is a promising way to study different neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD) - a neurodevelopmental condition that impacts language, communication, and reciprocal social interactions. However, in heterogeneous populations, such as ASD, where the ability to collect large datasets is limited, the application of artificial intelligence (AI) is complicated. Synthetic ERG signals generated from real ERG recordings carry similar information as natural ERGs and, therefore, could be used as an extension for natural data to increase datasets so that AI applications can be fully utilized. As proof of principle, this study presents a Generative Adversarial Network capable of generating synthetic ERG signals of children with ASD and typically developing control individuals. We applied a Time Series Transformer and Visual Transformer with Continuous Wavelet Transform to enhance classification results on the extended synthetic signals dataset. This approach may support classification models in related psychiatric conditions where the ERG may help classify disorders.</p>

<p>Abstract: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have revolutionized both the natural language processing research and applications. However, stereotypical biases (e.g., gender and racial discrimination) encoded in PLMs have raised negative ethical implications for PLMs, which critically limits their broader applications. To address the aforementioned unfairness issues, we present fairBERTs, a general framework for learning fair fine-tuned BERT series models by erasing the protected sensitive information via semantic and fairness-aware perturbations generated by a generative adversarial network. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on two real-world tasks, we demonstrate the great superiority of fairBERTs in mitigating unfairness while maintaining the model utility. We also verify the feasibility of transferring adversarial components in fairBERTs to other conventionally trained BERT-like models for yielding fairness improvements. Our findings may shed light on further research on building fairer fine-tuned PLMs.</p>

Concentrating on high-confidence configurations simplifies the search space and delivers superior performance compared to current optimization methods. The ARCO framework surpasses existing leading frameworks, achieving a throughput increase of up to 37.95% while reducing the optimization time by up to 42.2% across various DNNs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Parallel Continual Learning (PCL) tasks investigate the training methods for continual learning with multi-source input, where data from different tasks are learned as they arrive. PCL offers high training efficiency and is well-suited for complex multi-source data systems, such as autonomous vehicles equipped with multiple sensors. However, at any time, multiple tasks need to be trained simultaneously, leading to severe training instability in PCL. This instability manifests during both forward and backward propagation, where features are entangled and gradients are conflict. This paper introduces Stable Parallel Continual Learning (SPCL), a novel approach that enhances the training stability of PCL for both forward and backward propagation. For the forward propagation, we apply Doubly-block Toeplit (DBT) Matrix based orthogonality constraints to network parameters to ensure stable and consistent propagation. For the backward propagation, we employ orthogonal decomposition for gradient management stabilizes backpropagation and mitigates gradient conflicts across tasks. By optimizing gradients by ensuring orthogonality and minimizing the condition number, SPCL effectively stabilizing the gradient descent in complex optimization tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that SPCL outperforms state-of-the-art methjods and achieve better training stability.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, the advent of spatial transcriptomics (ST) technology has unlocked unprecedented opportunities for delving into the complexities of gene expression patterns within intricate biological systems. Despite its transformative potential, the prohibitive cost of ST technology remains a significant barrier to its widespread adoption in large-scale studies. An alternative, more cost-effective strategy involves employing artificial intelligence to predict gene expression levels using readily accessible whole-slide images (WSIs) stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H\&E). However, existing methods have yet to fully capitalize on multimodal information provided by H&E images and ST data with spatial location. In this paper, we propose \textbf{mclSTExp}, a multimodal contrastive learning with Transformer and Densenet-121 encoder for Spatial Transcriptomics Expression prediction. We conceptualize each spot as a "word", integrating its intrinsic features with spatial context through the self-attention mechanism of a Transformer encoder. This integration is further enriched by incorporating image features via contrastive learning, thereby enhancing the predictive capability of our model. Our extensive evaluation of \textbf{mclSTExp} on two breast cancer datasets and a skin squamous cell carcinoma dataset demonstrates its superior performance in predicting spatial gene expression. Moreover, mclSTExp has shown promise in interpreting cancer-specific overexpressed genes, elucidating immune-related genes, and identifying specialized spatial domains annotated by pathologists.

<p>Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) combines the generative abilities of large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge sources to provide more accurate and up-to-date responses. Recent RAG advancements focus on improving retrieval outcomes through iterative LLM refinement or self-critique capabilities acquired through additional instruction tuning of LLMs. In this work, we introduce Speculative RAG - a framework that leverages a larger generalist LM to efficiently verify multiple RAG drafts produced in parallel by a smaller, distilled specialist LM. Each draft is generated from a distinct subset of retrieved documents, offering diverse perspectives on the evidence while reducing input token counts per draft. This approach enhances comprehension of each subset and mitigates potential position bias over long context. Our method accelerates RAG by delegating drafting to the smaller specialist LM, with the larger generalist LM performing a single verification pass over the drafts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Speculative RAG achieves state-of-the-art performance with reduced latency on TriviaQA, MuSiQue, PubHealth, and ARC-Challenge benchmarks. It notably enhances accuracy by up to 12.97% while reducing latency by 51% compared to conventional RAG systems on PubHealth.</p>

Utilizing a self-supervised learning approach, stEnTrans establishes proxy tasks on gene expression profile without requiring additional data, mining intrinsic features of the tissues as supervisory information. We evaluate stEnTrans on six datasets and the results indicate superior performance in enhancing spots resolution and predicting gene expression in unmeasured areas compared to other deep learning and traditional interpolation methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyi Zhang, Songyan Teng, Hong Jia, Simon D'Alfonso</p>
<p>Abstract: As mental health issues for young adults present a pressing public health concern, daily digital mood monitoring for early detection has become an important prospect. An active research area, digital phenotyping, involves collecting and analysing data from personal digital devices such as smartphones (usage and sensors) and wearables to infer behaviours and mental health. Whilst this data is standardly analysed using statistical and machine learning approaches, the emergence of large language models (LLMs) offers a new approach to make sense of smartphone sensing data. Despite their effectiveness across various domains, LLMs remain relatively unexplored in digital mental health, particularly in integrating mobile sensor data. Our study aims to bridge this gap by employing LLMs to predict affect outcomes based on smartphone sensing data from university students. We demonstrate the efficacy of zero-shot and few-shot embedding LLMs in inferring general wellbeing. Our findings reveal that LLMs can make promising predictions of affect measures using solely smartphone sensing data.

<p>Abstract: Communication network engineering in enterprise environments is traditionally a complex, time-consuming, and error-prone manual process. Most research on network engineering automation has concentrated on configuration synthesis, often overlooking changes in the physical network topology. This paper introduces GeNet, a multimodal co-pilot for enterprise network engineers. GeNet is a novel framework that leverages a large language model (LLM) to streamline network design workflows. It uses visual and textual modalities to interpret and update network topologies and device configurations based on user intents. GeNet was evaluated on enterprise network scenarios adapted from Cisco certification exercises. Our results demonstrate GeNet's ability to interpret network topology images accurately, potentially reducing network engineers' efforts and accelerating network design processes in enterprise environments. Furthermore, we show the importance of precise topology understanding when handling intents that require modifications to the network's topology.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benjamin Fuhrer, Chen Tessler, Gal Dalal</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural networks (NN) achieve remarkable results in various tasks, but lack key characteristics: interpretability, support for categorical features, and lightweight implementations suitable for edge devices. While ongoing efforts aim to address these challenges, Gradient Boosting Trees (GBT) inherently meet these requirements. As a result, GBTs have become the go-to method for supervised learning tasks in many real-world applications and competitions. However, their application in online learning scenarios, notably in reinforcement learning (RL), has been limited. In this work, we bridge this gap by introducing Gradient-Boosting RL (GBRL), a framework that extends the advantages of GBT to the RL domain. Using the GBRL framework, we implement various actor-critic algorithms and compare their performance with their NN counterparts. Inspired by shared backbones in NN we introduce a tree-sharing approach for policy and value functions with distinct learning rates, enhancing learning efficiency over millions of interactions. GBRL achieves competitive performance across a diverse array of tasks, excelling in domains with structured or categorical features. Additionally, we present a high-performance, GPU-accelerated implementation that integrates seamlessly with widely-used RL libraries (available at https://github.com/NVlabs/gbrl). GBRL expands the toolkit for RL practitioners, demonstrating the viability and promise of GBT within the RL paradigm, particularly in domains characterized by structured or categorical features.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nhat Nguyen, Duong Nguyen, Gianluca Rizzo, Hung Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: Decentralized planning is a key element of cooperative multi-agent systems for information gathering tasks. However, despite the high frequency of agent failures in realistic large deployment scenarios, current approaches perform poorly in the presence of failures, by not converging at all, and/or by making very inefficient use of resources (e.g. energy). In this work, we propose Attritable MCTS (A-MCTS), a decentralized MCTS algorithm capable of timely and efficient adaptation to changes in the set of active agents. It is based on the use of a global reward function for the estimation of each agent's local contribution, and regret matching for coordination. We evaluate its effectiveness in realistic data-harvesting problems under different scenarios. We show both theoretically and experimentally that A-MCTS enables efficient adaptation even under high failure rates. Results suggest that, in the presence of frequent failures, our solution improves substantially over the best existing approaches in terms of global utility and scalability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seonwhee Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Models based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) and transformers have steadily been improved. They also have been applied in various computer vision downstream tasks. However, in object detection tasks, accurately localizing and classifying almost infinite categories of foods in images remains challenging. To address these problems, we first segmented the food as the region-of-interest (ROI) by using the segment-anything model (SAM) and masked the rest of the region except ROI as black pixels. This process simplified the problems into a single classification for which annotation and training were much simpler than object detection. The images in which only the ROI was preserved were fed as inputs to fine-tune various off-the-shelf models that encoded their own inductive biases. Among them, Data-efficient image Transformers (DeiTs) had the best classification performance. Nonetheless, when foods' shapes and textures were similar, the contextual features of the ROI-only images were not enough for accurate classification. Therefore, we introduced a novel type of combined architecture, RveRNet, which consisted of ROI, extra-ROI, and integration modules that allowed it to account for both the ROI's and global contexts. The RveRNet's F1 score was 10% better than other individual models when classifying ambiguous food images. If the RveRNet's modules were DeiT with the knowledge distillation from the CNN, performed the best. We investigated how architectures can be made robust against input noise caused by permutation and translocation. The results indicated that there was a trade-off between how much the CNN teacher's knowledge could be distilled to DeiT and DeiT's innate strength.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anand Babu</p>
<p>Abstract: Assessing different material properties to predict specific attributes, such as band gap, resistivity, young modulus, work function, and refractive index, is a fundamental requirement for materials science-based applications. However, the process is time-consuming and often requires extensive literature reviews and numerous experiments. Our study addresses these challenges by leveraging machine learning to analyze material properties with greater precision and efficiency. By automating the data extraction process and using the extracted information to train machine learning models, our developed model, SciQu, optimizes material properties. As a proof of concept, we predicted the refractive index of materials using data extracted from numerous research articles with SciQu, considering input descriptors such as space group, volume, and bandgap with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) 0.068 and R2 0.94. Thus, SciQu not only predicts the properties of materials but also plays a key role in self-driving laboratories by optimizing the synthesis parameters to achieve precise shape, size, and phase of the materials subjected to the input parameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaotong Li, Fan Zhang, Haiwen Diao, Yueze Wang, Xinlong Wang, Ling-Yu Duan</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) increasingly emphasize complex understanding of various visual elements, including multiple objects, text information, and spatial relations. Their development for comprehensive visual perception hinges on the availability of high-quality image-text datasets that offer diverse visual elements and throughout image descriptions. However, the scarcity of such hyper-detailed datasets currently hinders progress within the MLLM community. The bottleneck stems from the limited perceptual capabilities of current caption engines, which fall short in providing complete and accurate annotations. To facilitate the cutting-edge research of MLLMs on comprehensive vision perception, we thereby propose Perceptual Fusion, using a low-budget but highly effective caption engine for complete and accurate image descriptions. Specifically, Perceptual Fusion integrates diverse perception experts as image priors to provide explicit information on visual elements and adopts an efficient MLLM as a centric pivot to mimic advanced MLLMs' perception abilities. We carefully select 1M highly representative images from uncurated LAION dataset and generate dense descriptions using our engine, dubbed DenseFusion-1M. Extensive experiments validate that our engine outperforms its counterparts, where the resulting dataset significantly improves the perception and cognition abilities of existing MLLMs across diverse vision-language benchmarks, especially with high-resolution images as inputs.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zijian Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: As an important part of Music Information Retrieval (MIR), Symbolic Music Understanding (SMU) has gained substantial attention, as it can assist musicians and amateurs in learning and creating music. Recently, pre-trained language models have been widely adopted in SMU because the symbolic music shares a huge similarity with natural language, and the pre-trained manner also helps make full use of limited music data. However, the issue of bias, such as sexism, ageism, and racism, has been observed in pre-trained language models, which is attributed to the imbalanced distribution of training data. It also has a significant influence on the performance of downstream tasks, which also happens in SMU. To address this challenge, we propose Adversarial-MidiBERT, a symbolic music understanding model based on Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). We introduce an unbiased pre-training method based on adversarial learning to minimize the participation of tokens that lead to biases during training. Furthermore, we propose a mask fine-tuning method to narrow the data gap between pre-training and fine-tuning, which can help the model converge faster and perform better. We evaluate our method on four music understanding tasks, and our approach demonstrates excellent performance in all of them. The code for our model is publicly available at https://github.com/RS2002/Adversarial-MidiBERT.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jill Baumann, Oliver Kramer</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces an approach that integrates self-adaptive Evolution Strategies (ES) with Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the explainability of complex optimization processes. By employing a self-adaptive ES equipped with a restart mechanism, we effectively navigate the challenging landscapes of benchmark functions, capturing detailed logs of the optimization journey, including fitness evolution, step-size adjustments, and restart events due to stagnation. An LLM is then utilized to process these logs, generating concise, user-friendly summaries that highlight key aspects such as convergence behavior, optimal fitness achievements, and encounters with local optima. Our case study on the Rastrigin function demonstrates how our approach makes the complexities of ES optimization transparent and accessible. Our findings highlight the potential of using LLMs to bridge the gap between advanced optimization algorithms and their interpretability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Antonio Hern\'andez Mart\'inez, Iv\'an Garc\'ia Daza, Carlos Fern\'andez L\'opez, David Fern\'andez Llorca</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate vision-based speed estimation is much more cost-effective than traditional methods based on radar or LiDAR. However, it is also challenging due to the limitations of perspective projection on a discrete sensor, as well as the high sensitivity to calibration, lighting and weather conditions. Interestingly, deep learning approaches (which dominate the field of computer vision) are very limited in this context due to the lack of available data. Indeed, obtaining video sequences of real road traffic with accurate speed values associated with each vehicle is very complex and costly, and the number of available datasets is very limited. Recently, some approaches are focusing on the use of synthetic data. However, it is still unclear how models trained on synthetic data can be effectively applied to real world conditions. In this work, we propose the use of digital-twins using CARLA simulator to generate a large dataset representative of a specific real-world camera. The synthetic dataset contains a large variability of vehicle types, colours, speeds, lighting and weather conditions. A 3D CNN model is trained on the digital twin and tested on the real sequences. Unlike previous approaches that generate multi-camera sequences, we found that the gap between the the real and the virtual conditions is a key factor in obtaining low speed estimation errors. Even with a preliminary approach, the mean absolute error obtained remains below 3km/h.</p>

In this work, we explore the potential of improving the capabilities of language models without new data, merely using automated feedback to the validity of their predictions in arithmetic reasoning (self-training). We find that models can substantially improve in both single-round (offline) and online self-training. In the offline setting, supervised methods are able to deliver gains comparable to preference optimization, but in online self-training, preference optimization shows to largely outperform supervised training thanks to superior stability and robustness on unseen types of problems.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a machine learning-aided fault detection and isolation method applied to the case study of quench identification at the European X-Ray Free-Electron Laser. The plant utilizes 800 superconducting radio-frequency cavities in order to accelerate electron bunches to high energies of up to 17.5 GeV. Various faulty events can disrupt the nominal functioning of the accelerator, including quenches that can lead to a loss of the superconductivity of the cavities and the interruption of their operation. In this context, our solution consists in analyzing signals reflecting the dynamics of the cavities in a two-stage approach. (I) Fault detection that uses analytical redundancy to process the data and generate a residual. The evaluation of the residual through the generalized likelihood ratio allows detecting the faulty behaviors. (II) Fault isolation which involves the distinction of the quenches from the other faults. To this end, we proceed with a data-driven model of the k-medoids algorithm that explores different similarity measures, namely, the Euclidean and the dynamic time warping. Finally, we evaluate the new method and compare it to the currently deployed quench detection system, the results show the improved performance achieved by our method.</p>

<p>Abstract: LLM app stores have seen rapid growth, leading to the proliferation of numerous custom LLM apps. However, this expansion raises security concerns. In this study, we propose a three-layer concern framework to identify the potential security risks of LLM apps, i.e., LLM apps with abusive potential, LLM apps with malicious intent, and LLM apps with exploitable vulnerabilities. Over five months, we collected 786,036 LLM apps from six major app stores: GPT Store, FlowGPT, Poe, Coze, Cici, and Character.AI. Our research integrates static and dynamic analysis, the development of a large-scale toxic word dictionary (i.e., ToxicDict) comprising over 31,783 entries, and automated monitoring tools to identify and mitigate threats. We uncovered that 15,146 apps had misleading descriptions, 1,366 collected sensitive personal information against their privacy policies, and 15,996 generated harmful content such as hate speech, self-harm, extremism, etc. Additionally, we evaluated the potential for LLM apps to facilitate malicious activities, finding that 616 apps could be used for malware generation, phishing, etc. Our findings highlight the urgent need for robust regulatory frameworks and enhanced enforcement mechanisms.</p>

<p>Abstract: Human video generation is a dynamic and rapidly evolving task that aims to synthesize 2D human body video sequences with generative models given control conditions such as text, audio, and pose. With the potential for wide-ranging applications in film, gaming, and virtual communication, the ability to generate natural and realistic human video is critical. Recent advancements in generative models have laid a solid foundation for the growing interest in this area. Despite the significant progress, the task of human video generation remains challenging due to the consistency of characters, the complexity of human motion, and difficulties in their relationship with the environment. This survey provides a comprehensive review of the current state of human video generation, marking, to the best of our knowledge, the first extensive literature review in this domain. We start with an introduction to the fundamentals of human video generation and the evolution of generative models that have facilitated the field's growth. We then examine the main methods employed for three key sub-tasks within human video generation: text-driven, audio-driven, and pose-driven motion generation. These areas are explored concerning the conditions that guide the generation process. Furthermore, we offer a collection of the most commonly utilized datasets and the evaluation metrics that are crucial in assessing the quality and realism of generated videos. The survey concludes with a discussion of the current challenges in the field and suggests possible directions for future research. The goal of this survey is to offer the research community a clear and holistic view of the advancements in human video generation, highlighting the milestones achieved and the challenges that lie ahead.</p>

<p>Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong instruction-following ability to be helpful, they are further supposed to be controlled and guided by rules in real-world scenarios to be safe, and accurate in responses. This demands the possession of rule-following capability of LLMs. However, few works have made a clear evaluation of the rule-following capability of LLMs. Previous studies that try to evaluate the rule-following capability of LLMs fail to distinguish the rule-following scenarios from the instruction-following scenarios. Therefore, this paper first makes a clarification of the concept of rule-following, and curates a comprehensive benchmark, RuleBench, to evaluate a diversified range of rule-following abilities. Our experimental results on a variety of LLMs show that they are still limited in following rules. Our further analysis provides insights into the improvements for LLMs toward a better rule-following intelligent agent.

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence, demonstrating remarkable computational power and linguistic capabilities. However, these models are inherently prone to various biases stemming from their training data. These include selection, linguistic, and confirmation biases, along with common stereotypes related to gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, socioeconomic status, disability, and age. This study explores the presence of these biases within the responses given by the most recent LLMs, analyzing the impact on their fairness and reliability. We also investigate how known prompt engineering techniques can be exploited to effectively reveal hidden biases of LLMs, testing their adversarial robustness against jailbreak prompts specially crafted for bias elicitation. Extensive experiments are conducted using the most widespread LLMs at different scales, confirming that LLMs can still be manipulated to produce biased or inappropriate responses, despite their advanced capabilities and sophisticated alignment processes. Our findings underscore the importance of enhancing mitigation techniques to address these safety issues, toward a more sustainable and inclusive artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce a novel classification framework for time-series imputation using deep learning, with a particular focus on clinical data. By identifying conceptual gaps in the literature and existing reviews, we devise a taxonomy grounded on the inductive bias of neural imputation frameworks, resulting in a classification of existing deep imputation strategies based on their suitability for specific imputation scenarios and data-specific properties. Our review further examines the existing methodologies employed to benchmark deep imputation models, evaluating their effectiveness in capturing the missingness scenarios found in clinical data and emphasising the importance of reconciling mathematical abstraction with clinical insights. Our classification aims to serve as a guide for researchers to facilitate the selection of appropriate deep learning imputation techniques tailored to their specific clinical data. Our novel perspective also highlights the significance of bridging the gap between computational methodologies and medical insights to achieve clinically sound imputation models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Unsupervised goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) is a promising paradigm for developing diverse robotic skills without external supervision. However, existing unsupervised GCRL methods often struggle to cover a wide range of states in complex environments due to their limited exploration and sparse or noisy rewards for GCRL. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel unsupervised GCRL method that leverages TemporaL Distance-aware Representations (TLDR). TLDR selects faraway goals to initiate exploration and computes intrinsic exploration rewards and goal-reaching rewards, based on temporal distance. Specifically, our exploration policy seeks states with large temporal distances (i.e. covering a large state space), while the goal-conditioned policy learns to minimize the temporal distance to the goal (i.e. reaching the goal). Our experimental results in six simulated robotic locomotion environments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous unsupervised GCRL methods in achieving a wide variety of states.</p>

The proposed model synchronizes tumor mass characteristics from CoT, mutually reinforcing feature extraction, facilitating the precise capture of detailed tumor mass structures, including location, size, and boundaries. Several experimental results present the outstanding segmentation performance of the proposed method in comparison to current state-of-the-art approaches, achieving Dice score of 82.0%, 81.5%, 89.0% for Enhancing Tumor, Tumor Core and Whole Tumor, respectively, on BraTS2019.</p>

Expanding upon this premise, our paper introduces an open-source benchmark for multi-modal generative models tailored for Verilog synthesis from visual-linguistic inputs, addressing both singular and complex modules. Additionally, we introduce an open-source visual and natural language Verilog query language framework to facilitate efficient and user-friendly multi-modal queries. To evaluate the performance of the proposed multi-modal hardware generative AI in Verilog generation tasks, we compare it with a popular method that relies solely on natural language. Our results demonstrate a significant accuracy improvement in the multi-modal generated Verilog compared to queries based solely on natural language. We hope to reveal a new approach to hardware design in the large-hardware-design-model era, thereby fostering a more diversified and productive approach to hardware design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel F. Perez-Ramirez, Carlos P\'erez-Penichet, Nicolas Tsiftes, Dejan Kostic, Magnus Boman, Thiemo Voigt</p>
<p>Abstract: Battery-free sensor tags are devices that leverage backscatter techniques to communicate with standard IoT devices, thereby augmenting a network's sensing capabilities in a scalable way. For communicating, a sensor tag relies on an unmodulated carrier provided by a neighboring IoT device, with a schedule coordinating this provisioning across the network. Carrier scheduling--computing schedules to interrogate all sensor tags while minimizing energy, spectrum utilization, and latency--is an NP-Hard optimization problem. Recent work introduces learning-based schedulers that achieve resource savings over a carefully-crafted heuristic, generalizing to networks of up to 60 nodes. However, we find that their advantage diminishes in networks with hundreds of nodes, and degrades further in larger setups. This paper introduces RobustGANTT, a GNN-based scheduler that improves generalization (without re-training) to networks up to 1000 nodes (100x training topology sizes). RobustGANTT not only achieves better and more consistent generalization, but also computes schedules requiring up to 2x less resources than existing systems. Our scheduler exhibits average runtimes of hundreds of milliseconds, allowing it to react fast to changing network conditions. Our work not only improves resource utilization in large-scale backscatter networks, but also offers valuable insights in learning-based scheduling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxing Tian, Yiyan Qi, Aiwen Jiang, Qi Huang, Jian Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Continuous-Time Dynamic Graph (CTDG) precisely models evolving real-world relationships, drawing heightened interest in dynamic graph learning across academia and industry. However, existing CTDG models encounter challenges stemming from noise and limited historical data. Graph Data Augmentation (GDA) emerges as a critical solution, yet current approaches primarily focus on static graphs and struggle to effectively address the dynamics inherent in CTDGs. Moreover, these methods often demand substantial domain expertise for parameter tuning and lack theoretical guarantees for augmentation efficacy. To address these issues, we propose Conda, a novel latent diffusion-based GDA method tailored for CTDGs. Conda features a sandwich-like architecture, incorporating a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) and a conditional diffusion model, aimed at generating enhanced historical neighbor embeddings for target nodes. Unlike conventional diffusion models trained on entire graphs via pre-training, Conda requires historical neighbor sequence embeddings of target nodes for training, thus facilitating more targeted augmentation. We integrate Conda into the CTDG model and adopt an alternating training strategy to optimize performance. Extensive experimentation across six widely used real-world datasets showcases the consistent performance improvement of our approach, particularly in scenarios with limited historical data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dawei Dai, YuTang Li, YingGe Liu, Mingming Jia, Zhang YuanHui, Guoyin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Currently, image-text-driven multi-modal deep learning models have demonstrated their outstanding potential in many fields. In practice, tasks centered around facial images have broad application prospects. This paper presents \textbf{FaceCaption-15M}, a large-scale, diverse, and high-quality dataset of facial images accompanied by their natural language descriptions (facial image-to-text). This dataset aims to facilitate a study on face-centered tasks. FaceCaption-15M comprises over 15 million pairs of facial images and their corresponding natural language descriptions of facial features, making it the largest facial image-caption dataset to date. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of image quality, text naturalness, text complexity, and text-image relevance to demonstrate the superiority of FaceCaption-15M. To validate the effectiveness of FaceCaption-15M, we first trained a facial language-image pre-training model (FLIP, similar to CLIP) to align facial image with its corresponding captions in feature space. Subsequently, using both image and text encoders and fine-tuning only the linear layer, our FLIP-based models achieved state-of-the-art results on two challenging face-centered tasks. The purpose is to promote research in the field of face-related tasks through the availability of the proposed FaceCaption-15M dataset.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bowen Jiang, Yilin Wu, Wenxuan Zhou, Chris Paxton, David Held</p>
<p>Abstract: Although end-to-end robot learning has shown some success for robot manipulation, the learned policies are often not sufficiently robust to variations in object pose or geometry. To improve the policy generalization, we introduce spatially-grounded parameterized motion primitives in our method HACMan++. Specifically, we propose an action representation consisting of three components: what primitive type (such as grasp or push) to execute, where the primitive will be grounded (e.g. where the gripper will make contact with the world), and how the primitive motion is executed, such as parameters specifying the push direction or grasp orientation. These three components define a novel discrete-continuous action space for reinforcement learning. Our framework enables robot agents to learn to chain diverse motion primitives together and select appropriate primitive parameters to complete long-horizon manipulation tasks. By grounding the primitives on a spatial location in the environment, our method is able to effectively generalize across object shape and pose variations. Our approach significantly outperforms existing methods, particularly in complex scenarios demanding both high-level sequential reasoning and object generalization. With zero-shot sim-to-real transfer, our policy succeeds in challenging real-world manipulation tasks, with generalization to unseen objects.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jay Shah, Ganesh Bikshandi, Ying Zhang, Vijay Thakkar, Pradeep Ramani, Tri Dao</p>
<p>Abstract: Attention, as a core layer of the ubiquitous Transformer architecture, is the bottleneck for large language models and long-context applications. FlashAttention elaborated an approach to speed up attention on GPUs through minimizing memory reads/writes. However, it has yet to take advantage of new capabilities present in recent hardware, with FlashAttention-2 achieving only 35% utilization on the H100 GPU. We develop three main techniques to speed up attention on Hopper GPUs: exploiting asynchrony of the Tensor Cores and TMA to (1) overlap overall computation and data movement via warp-specialization and (2) interleave block-wise matmul and softmax operations, and (3) block quantization and incoherent processing that leverages hardware support for FP8 low-precision. We demonstrate that our method, FlashAttention-3, achieves speedup on H100 GPUs by 1.5-2.0$\times$ with FP16 reaching up to 740 TFLOPs/s (75% utilization), and with FP8 reaching close to 1.2 PFLOPs/s. We validate that FP8 FlashAttention-3 achieves 2.6$\times$ lower numerical error than a baseline FP8 attention.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juhani Kivim\"aki, Jakub Bia{\l}ek, Jukka K. Nurminen, Wojtek Kuberski</p>
<p>Abstract: After a machine learning model has been deployed into production, its predictive performance needs to be monitored. Ideally, such monitoring can be carried out by comparing the model's predictions against ground truth labels. For this to be possible, the ground truth labels must be available relatively soon after inference. However, there are many use cases where ground truth labels are available only after a significant delay, or in the worst case, not at all. In such cases, directly monitoring the model's predictive performance is impossible.
  Recently, novel methods for estimating the predictive performance of a model when ground truth is unavailable have been developed. Many of these methods leverage model confidence or other uncertainty estimates and are experimentally compared against a naive baseline method, namely Average Confidence (AC), which estimates model accuracy as the average of confidence scores for a given set of predictions. However, until now the theoretical properties of the AC method have not been properly explored. In this paper, we try to fill this gap by reviewing the AC method and show that under certain general assumptions, it is an unbiased and consistent estimator of model accuracy with many desirable properties. We also compare this baseline estimator against some more complex estimators empirically and show that in many cases the AC method is able to beat the others, although the comparative quality of the different estimators is heavily case-dependent.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chethan Radhakrishna, Karthikesh Varma Chintalapati, Sri Chandana Hudukula Ram Kumar, Raviteja Sutrave, Hendrik Mattern, Oliver Speck, Andreas N\"urnberger, Soumick Chatterjee</p>
<p>Abstract: Identification of vessel structures of different sizes in biomedical images is crucial in the diagnosis of many neurodegenerative diseases. However, the sparsity of good-quality annotations of such images makes the task of vessel segmentation challenging. Deep learning offers an efficient way to segment vessels of different sizes by learning their high-level feature representations and the spatial continuity of such features across dimensions. Semi-supervised patch-based approaches have been effective in identifying small vessels of one to two voxels in diameter. This study focuses on improving the segmentation quality by considering the spatial correlation of the features using the Maximum Intensity Projection~(MIP) as an additional loss criterion. Two methods are proposed with the incorporation of MIPs of label segmentation on the single~(z-axis) and multiple perceivable axes of the 3D volume. The proposed MIP-based methods produce segmentations with improved vessel continuity, which is evident in visual examinations of ROIs. Patch-based training is improved by introducing an additional loss term, MIP loss, to penalise the predicted discontinuity of vessels. A training set of 14 volumes is selected from the StudyForrest dataset comprising of 18 7-Tesla 3D Time-of-Flight~(ToF) Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) images. The generalisation performance of the method is evaluated using the other unseen volumes in the dataset. It is observed that the proposed method with multi-axes MIP loss produces better quality segmentations with a median Dice of $80.245 \pm 0.129$. Also, the method with single-axis MIP loss produces segmentations with a median Dice of $79.749 \pm 0.109$. Furthermore, a visual comparison of the ROIs in the predicted segmentation reveals a significant improvement in the continuity of the vessels when MIP loss is incorporated into training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaxin Wu, Yizhou Yu, Hong-Yu Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise for natural language generation in healthcare, but risk hallucinating factually incorrect information. Deploying LLMs for medical question answering necessitates reliable uncertainty estimation (UE) methods to detect hallucinations. In this work, we benchmark popular UE methods with different model sizes on medical question-answering datasets. Our results show that current approaches generally perform poorly in this domain, highlighting the challenge of UE for medical applications. We also observe that larger models tend to yield better results, suggesting a correlation between model size and the reliability of UE. To address these challenges, we propose Two-phase Verification, a probability-free Uncertainty Estimation approach. First, an LLM generates a step-by-step explanation alongside its initial answer, followed by formulating verification questions to check the factual claims in the explanation. The model then answers these questions twice: first independently, and then referencing the explanation. Inconsistencies between the two sets of answers measure the uncertainty in the original response. We evaluate our approach on three biomedical question-answering datasets using Llama 2 Chat models and compare it against the benchmarked baseline methods. The results show that our Two-phase Verification method achieves the best overall accuracy and stability across various datasets and model sizes, and its performance scales as the model size increases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiu Feng, Mehmet Hamza Erol, Joon Son Chung, Arda Senocak</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers have rapidly overtaken CNN-based architectures as the new standard in audio classification. Transformer-based models, such as the Audio Spectrogram Transformers (AST), also inherit the fixed-size input paradigm from CNNs. However, this leads to performance degradation for ASTs in the inference when input lengths vary from the training. This paper introduces an approach that enables the use of variable-length audio inputs with AST models during both training and inference. By employing sequence packing, our method ElasticAST, accommodates any audio length during training, thereby offering flexibility across all lengths and resolutions at the inference. This flexibility allows ElasticAST to maintain evaluation capabilities at various lengths or resolutions and achieve similar performance to standard ASTs trained at specific lengths or resolutions. Moreover, experiments demonstrate ElasticAST's better performance when trained and evaluated on native-length audio datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiqiang Xie, Yujia Zheng, Lizi Ottens, Kun Zhang, Christos Kozyrakis, Jonathan Mace</p>
<p>Abstract: Runtime failure and performance degradation is commonplace in modern cloud systems. For cloud providers, automatically determining the root cause of incidents is paramount to ensuring high reliability and availability as prompt fault localization can enable faster diagnosis and triage for timely resolution. A compelling solution explored in recent work is causal reasoning using causal graphs to capture relationships between varied cloud system performance metrics. To be effective, however, systems developers must correctly define the causal graph of their system, which is a time-consuming, brittle, and challenging task that increases in difficulty for large and dynamic systems and requires domain expertise. Alternatively, automated data-driven approaches have limited efficacy for cloud systems due to the inherent rarity of incidents. In this work, we present Atlas, a novel approach to automatically synthesizing causal graphs for cloud systems. Atlas leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate causal graphs using system documentation, telemetry, and deployment feedback. Atlas is complementary to data-driven causal discovery techniques, and we further enhance Atlas with a data-driven validation step. We evaluate Atlas across a range of fault localization scenarios and demonstrate that Atlas is capable of generating causal graphs in a scalable and generalizable manner, with performance that far surpasses that of data-driven algorithms and is commensurate to the ground-truth baseline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammed Elbtity, Peyton Chandarana, Ramtin Zand</p>
<p>Abstract: Tensor processing units (TPUs) are one of the most well-known machine learning (ML) accelerators utilized at large scale in data centers as well as in tiny ML applications. TPUs offer several improvements and advantages over conventional ML accelerators, like graphical processing units (GPUs), being designed specifically to perform the multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations required in the matrix-matrix and matrix-vector multiplies extensively present throughout the execution of deep neural networks (DNNs). Such improvements include maximizing data reuse and minimizing data transfer by leveraging the temporal dataflow paradigms provided by the systolic array architecture. While this design provides a significant performance benefit, the current implementations are restricted to a single dataflow consisting of either input, output, or weight stationary architectures. This can limit the achievable performance of DNN inference and reduce the utilization of compute units. Therefore, the work herein consists of developing a reconfigurable dataflow TPU, called the Flex-TPU, which can dynamically change the dataflow per layer during run-time. Our experiments thoroughly test the viability of the Flex-TPU comparing it to conventional TPU designs across multiple well-known ML workloads. The results show that our Flex-TPU design achieves a significant performance increase of up to 2.75x compared to conventional TPU, with only minor area and power overheads.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper explores the synergistic potential of neuromorphic and edge computing to create a versatile machine learning (ML) system tailored for processing data captured by dynamic vision sensors. We construct and train hybrid models, blending spiking neural networks (SNNs) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) using PyTorch and Lava frameworks. Our hybrid architecture integrates an SNN for temporal feature extraction and an ANN for classification. We delve into the challenges of deploying such hybrid structures on hardware. Specifically, we deploy individual components on Intel's Neuromorphic Processor Loihi (for SNN) and Jetson Nano (for ANN). We also propose an accumulator circuit to transfer data from the spiking to the non-spiking domain. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive performance analyses of hybrid SNN-ANN models on a heterogeneous system of neuromorphic and edge AI hardware, evaluating accuracy, latency, power, and energy consumption. Our findings demonstrate that the hybrid spiking networks surpass the baseline ANN model across all metrics and outperform the baseline SNN model in accuracy and latency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Significant focus has been placed on integrating large language models (LLMs) with various tools in developing general-purpose agents. This poses a challenge to LLMs' tool-use capabilities. However, there are evident gaps between existing tool-use evaluations and real-world scenarios. Current evaluations often use AI-generated queries, single-step tasks, dummy tools, and text-only interactions, failing to reveal the agents' real-world problem-solving abilities effectively. To address this, we propose GTA, a benchmark for General Tool Agents, featuring three main aspects: (i) Real user queries: human-written queries with simple real-world objectives but implicit tool-use, requiring the LLM to reason the suitable tools and plan the solution steps. (ii) Real deployed tools: an evaluation platform equipped with tools across perception, operation, logic, and creativity categories to evaluate the agents' actual task execution performance. (iii) Real multimodal inputs: authentic image files, such as spatial scenes, web page screenshots, tables, code snippets, and printed/handwritten materials, used as the query contexts to align with real-world scenarios closely. We design 229 real-world tasks and executable tool chains to evaluate mainstream LLMs. Our findings show that real-world user queries are challenging for existing LLMs, with GPT-4 completing less than 50% of the tasks and most LLMs achieving below 25%. This evaluation reveals the bottlenecks in the tool-use capabilities of current LLMs in real-world scenarios, which provides future direction for advancing general-purpose tool agents.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdollah Zakeri, Hamid Hassanpour, Mohammad Hossein Khosravi, Amir Masoud Nourollah</p>
<p>Abstract: Lip-based biometric authentication (LBBA) has attracted many researchers during the last decade. The lip is specifically interesting for biometric researchers because it is a twin biometric with the potential to function both as a physiological and a behavioral trait. Although much valuable research was conducted on LBBA, none of them considered the different emotions of the client during the video acquisition step of LBBA, which can potentially affect the client's facial expressions and speech tempo. We proposed a novel network structure called WhisperNetV2, which extends our previously proposed network called WhisperNet. Our proposed network leverages a deep Siamese structure with triplet loss having three identical SlowFast networks as embedding networks. The SlowFast network is an excellent candidate for our task since the fast pathway extracts motion-related features (behavioral lip movements) with a high frame rate and low channel capacity. The slow pathway extracts visual features (physiological lip appearance) with a low frame rate and high channel capacity. Using an open-set protocol, we trained our network using the CREMA-D dataset and acquired an Equal Error Rate (EER) of 0.005 on the test set. Considering that the acquired EER is less than most similar LBBA methods, our method can be considered as a state-of-the-art LBBA method.</p>

<p>Abstract: Public urban spaces like streetscapes and plazas serve residents and accommodate social life in all its vibrant variations. Recent advances in Robotics and Embodied AI make public urban spaces no longer exclusive to humans. Food delivery bots and electric wheelchairs have started sharing sidewalks with pedestrians, while diverse robot dogs and humanoids have recently emerged in the street. Ensuring the generalizability and safety of these forthcoming mobile machines is crucial when navigating through the bustling streets in urban spaces. In this work, we present MetaUrban, a compositional simulation platform for Embodied AI research in urban spaces. MetaUrban can construct an infinite number of interactive urban scenes from compositional elements, covering a vast array of ground plans, object placements, pedestrians, vulnerable road users, and other mobile agents' appearances and dynamics. We design point navigation and social navigation tasks as the pilot study using MetaUrban for embodied AI research and establish various baselines of Reinforcement Learning and Imitation Learning. Experiments demonstrate that the compositional nature of the simulated environments can substantially improve the generalizability and safety of the trained mobile agents. MetaUrban will be made publicly available to provide more research opportunities and foster safe and trustworthy embodied AI in urban spaces.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joseph Miller, Bilal Chughtai, William Saunders</p>
<p>Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability work attempts to reverse engineer the learned algorithms present inside neural networks. One focus of this work has been to discover 'circuits' -- subgraphs of the full model that explain behaviour on specific tasks. But how do we measure the performance of such circuits? Prior work has attempted to measure circuit 'faithfulness' -- the degree to which the circuit replicates the performance of the full model. In this work, we survey many considerations for designing experiments that measure circuit faithfulness by ablating portions of the model's computation. Concerningly, we find existing methods are highly sensitive to seemingly insignificant changes in the ablation methodology. We conclude that existing circuit faithfulness scores reflect both the methodological choices of researchers as well as the actual components of the circuit - the task a circuit is required to perform depends on the ablation used to test it. The ultimate goal of mechanistic interpretability work is to understand neural networks, so we emphasize the need for more clarity in the precise claims being made about circuits. We open source a library at https://github.com/UFO-101/auto-circuit that includes highly efficient implementations of a wide range of ablation methodologies and circuit discovery algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rohan Sinha, Amine Elhafsi, Christopher Agia, Matthew Foutter, Edward Schmerling, Marco Pavone</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models, e.g., large language models (LLMs), trained on internet-scale data possess zero-shot generalization capabilities that make them a promising technology towards detecting and mitigating out-of-distribution failure modes of robotic systems. Fully realizing this promise, however, poses two challenges: (i) mitigating the considerable computational expense of these models such that they may be applied online, and (ii) incorporating their judgement regarding potential anomalies into a safe control framework. In this work, we present a two-stage reasoning framework: First is a fast binary anomaly classifier that analyzes observations in an LLM embedding space, which may then trigger a slower fallback selection stage that utilizes the reasoning capabilities of generative LLMs. These stages correspond to branch points in a model predictive control strategy that maintains the joint feasibility of continuing along various fallback plans to account for the slow reasoner's latency as soon as an anomaly is detected, thus ensuring safety. We show that our fast anomaly classifier outperforms autoregressive reasoning with state-of-the-art GPT models, even when instantiated with relatively small language models. This enables our runtime monitor to improve the trustworthiness of dynamic robotic systems, such as quadrotors or autonomous vehicles, under resource and time constraints.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mihir Prabhudesai, Russell Mendonca, Zheyang Qin, Katerina Fragkiadaki, Deepak Pathak</p>
<p>Abstract: We have made significant progress towards building foundational video diffusion models. As these models are trained using large-scale unsupervised data, it has become crucial to adapt these models to specific downstream tasks. Adapting these models via supervised fine-tuning requires collecting target datasets of videos, which is challenging and tedious. In this work, we utilize pre-trained reward models that are learned via preferences on top of powerful vision discriminative models to adapt video diffusion models. These models contain dense gradient information with respect to generated RGB pixels, which is critical to efficient learning in complex search spaces, such as videos. We show that backpropagating gradients from these reward models to a video diffusion model can allow for compute and sample efficient alignment of the video diffusion model. We show results across a variety of reward models and video diffusion models, demonstrating that our approach can learn much more efficiently in terms of reward queries and computation than prior gradient-free approaches.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mehwish Alam, Frank van Harmelen, Maribel Acosta</p>
<p>Abstract: Embedding based Knowledge Graph (KG) Completion has gained much attention over the past few years. Most of the current algorithms consider a KG as a multidirectional labeled graph and lack the ability to capture the semantics underlying the schematic information. In a separate development, a vast amount of information has been captured within the Large Language Models (LLMs) which has revolutionized the field of Artificial Intelligence. KGs could benefit from these LLMs and vice versa. This vision paper discusses the existing algorithms for KG completion based on the variations for generating KG embeddings. It starts with discussing various KG completion algorithms such as transductive and inductive link prediction and entity type prediction algorithms. It then moves on to the algorithms utilizing type information within the KGs, LLMs, and finally to algorithms capturing the semantics represented in different description logic axioms. We conclude the paper with a critical reflection on the current state of work in the community and give recommendations for future directions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Randall Balestriero, Romain Cosentino, Sarath Shekkizhar</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) drive current AI breakthroughs despite very little being known about their internal representations. In this work, we propose to shed the light on LLMs inner mechanisms through the lens of geometry. In particular, we develop in closed form $(i)$ the intrinsic dimension in which the Multi-Head Attention embeddings are constrained to exist and $(ii)$ the partition and per-region affine mappings of the feedforward (MLP) network of LLMs' layers. Our theoretical findings further enable the design of novel principled solutions applicable to state-of-the-art LLMs. First, we show that, through our geometric understanding, we can bypass LLMs' RLHF protection by controlling the embedding's intrinsic dimension through informed prompt manipulation. Second, we derive interpretable geometrical features that can be extracted from any (pre-trained) LLM, providing a rich abstract representation of their inputs. We observe that these features are sufficient to help solve toxicity detection, and even allow the identification of various types of toxicity. Our results demonstrate how, even in large-scale regimes, exact theoretical results can answer practical questions in LLMs. Code: https://github.com/RandallBalestriero/SplineLLM</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sowmya S. Sundaram, Benjamin Solomon, Avani Khatri, Anisha Laumas, Purvesh Khatri, Mark A. Musen</p>
<p>Abstract: Metadata play a crucial role in ensuring the findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability of datasets. This paper investigates the potential of large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4, to improve adherence to metadata standards. We conducted experiments on 200 random data records describing human samples relating to lung cancer from the NCBI BioSample repository, evaluating GPT-4's ability to suggest edits for adherence to metadata standards. We computed the adherence accuracy of field name-field value pairs through a peer review process, and we observed a marginal average improvement in adherence to the standard data dictionary from 79% to 80% (p<0.5). We then prompted GPT-4 with domain information in the form of the textual descriptions of CEDAR templates and recorded a significant improvement to 97% from 79% (p<0.01). These results indicate that, while LLMs may not be able to correct legacy metadata to ensure satisfactory adherence to standards when unaided, they do show promise for use in automated metadata curation when integrated with a structured knowledge base</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alyzia-Maria Konsta, Alberto Lluch Lafuente, Christoph Matheja</p>
<p>Abstract: Partially observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) are a standard model for agents making decisions in uncertain environments. Most work on POMDPs focuses on synthesizing strategies based on the available capabilities. However, system designers can often control an agent's observation capabilities, e.g. by placing or selecting sensors. This raises the question of how one should select an agent's sensors cost-effectively such that it achieves the desired goals. In this paper, we study the novel optimal observability problem OOP: Given a POMDP M, how should one change M's observation capabilities within a fixed budget such that its (minimal) expected reward remains below a given threshold? We show that the problem is undecidable in general and decidable when considering positional strategies only. We present two algorithms for a decidable fragment of the OOP: one based on optimal strategies of M's underlying Markov decision process and one based on parameter synthesis with SMT. We report promising results for variants of typical examples from the POMDP literature.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kang-il Lee, Minbeom Kim, Seunghyun Yoon, Minsung Kim, Dongryeol Lee, Hyukhun Koh, Kyomin Jung</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance across various multimodal tasks. However, they suffer from a problem known as language prior, where responses are generated based solely on textual patterns while disregarding image information. Addressing the issue of language prior is crucial, as it can lead to undesirable biases or hallucinations when dealing with images that are out of training distribution. Despite its importance, current methods for accurately measuring language priors in LVLMs are poorly studied. Although existing benchmarks based on counterfactual or out-of-distribution images can partially be used to measure language priors, they fail to disentangle language priors from other confounding factors. To this end, we propose a new benchmark called VLind-Bench, which is the first benchmark specifically designed to measure the language priors, or blindness, of LVLMs. It not only includes tests on counterfactual images to assess language priors but also involves a series of tests to evaluate more basic capabilities such as commonsense knowledge, visual perception, and commonsense biases. For each instance in our benchmark, we ensure that all these basic tests are passed before evaluating the language priors, thereby minimizing the influence of other factors on the assessment. The evaluation and analysis of recent LVLMs in our benchmark reveal that almost all models exhibit a significant reliance on language priors, presenting a strong challenge in the field.</p>

In this paper, we address the selection of homogeneous tools by predicting both their performance and the associated cost required to accomplish a given task.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siyu Yuan, Kaitao Song, Jiangjie Chen, Xu Tan, Dongsheng Li, Deqing Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: The rise of powerful large language models (LLMs) has spurred a new trend in building LLM-based autonomous agents for solving complex tasks, especially multi-agent systems. Despite the remarkable progress, we notice that existing works are heavily dependent on human-designed frameworks, which greatly limits the functional scope and scalability of agent systems. How to automatically extend the specialized agent to multi-agent systems to improve task-solving capability still remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we introduce EvoAgent, a generic method to automatically extend expert agents to multi-agent systems via the evolutionary algorithm, thereby improving the effectiveness of LLM-based agents in solving tasks. Specifically, we consider the existing agent frameworks as the initial individual and then apply a series of evolutionary operators (e.g., mutation, crossover, selection, etc.) to generate multiple agents with diverse agent settings. EvoAgent can be generalized to any LLM-based agent framework, and can automatically extend the existing agent framework to multi-agent systems without any extra human designs. Experimental results across various tasks have shown that EvoAgent can automatically generate multiple expert agents and significantly enhance the task-solving capabilities of LLM-based agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Miguel L\'azaro-Gredilla, Li Yang Ku, Kevin P. Murphy, Dileep George</p>
<p>Abstract: Multiple types of inference are available for probabilistic graphical models, e.g., marginal, maximum-a-posteriori, and even marginal maximum-a-posteriori. Which one do researchers mean when they talk about "planning as inference"? There is no consistency in the literature, different types are used, and their ability to do planning is further entangled with specific approximations or additional constraints. In this work we use the variational framework to show that all commonly used types of inference correspond to different weightings of the entropy terms in the variational problem, and that planning corresponds _exactly_ to a _different_ set of weights. This means that all the tricks of variational inference are readily applicable to planning. We develop an analogue of loopy belief propagation that allows us to perform approximate planning in factored state Markov decisions processes without incurring intractability due to the exponentially large state space. The variational perspective shows that the previous types of inference for planning are only adequate in environments with low stochasticity, and allows us to characterize each type by its own merits, disentangling the type of inference from the additional approximations that its practical use requires. We validate these results empirically on synthetic MDPs and tasks posed in the International Planning Competition.</p>

<p>Abstract: Novice researchers often face difficulties in understanding a multitude of academic papers and grasping the fundamentals of a new research field. To solve such problems, the knowledge graph supporting research survey is gradually being developed. Existing keyword-based knowledge graphs make it difficult for researchers to deeply understand abstract concepts. Meanwhile, novice researchers may find it difficult to use ChatGPT effectively for research surveys due to their limited understanding of the research field. Without the ability to ask proficient questions that align with key concepts, obtaining desired and accurate answers from this large language model (LLM) could be inefficient. This study aims to help novice researchers by providing a fish-bone diagram that includes causal relationships, offering an overview of the research topic. The diagram is constructed using the issue ontology from academic papers, and it offers a broad, highly generalized perspective of the research field, based on relevance and logical factors. Furthermore, we evaluate the strengths and improvable points of the fish-bone diagram derived from this study's development pattern, emphasizing its potential as a viable tool for supporting research survey.</p>

Surprisingly, four state-of-the-art VLMs are, on average, only 56.20% accurate on our benchmark, with \newsonnet being the best (73.77% accuracy). On BlindTest, VLMs struggle with tasks that requires precise spatial information and counting (from 0 to 10), sometimes providing an impression of a person with myopia seeing fine details as blurry and making educated guesses.

<p>Abstract: We introduce a novel and extensible benchmark for large language models (LLMs) through grid-based games such as Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect Four, and Gomoku. The open-source game simulation code, available on GitHub, allows LLMs to compete and generates detailed data files in JSON, CSV, TXT, and PNG formats for leaderboard rankings and further analysis. We present the results of games among leading LLMs, including Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Claude 3 Sonnet by Anthropic, Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 1.5 Flash by Google, GPT-4 Turbo and GPT-4o by OpenAI, and Llama3-70B by Meta. We also encourage submissions of results from other LLMs. In total, we simulated 2,310 matches (5 sessions for each pair among 7 LLMs and a random player) across three types of games, using three distinct prompt types: list, illustration, and image. The results revealed significant variations in LLM performance across different games and prompt types, with analysis covering win and disqualification rates, missed opportunity analysis, and invalid move analysis. The details of the leaderboard and result matrix data are available as open-access data on GitHub. This study enhances our understanding of LLMs' capabilities in playing games they were not specifically trained for, helping to assess their rule comprehension and strategic thinking. On the path to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), this study lays the groundwork for future exploration into their utility in complex decision-making scenarios, illuminating their strategic thinking abilities and offering directions for further inquiry into the limits of LLMs within game-based frameworks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision Transformer (ViT) has recently gained significant attention in solving computer vision (CV) problems due to its capability of extracting informative features and modeling long-range dependencies through the attention mechanism. Whereas recent works have explored the trustworthiness of ViT, including its robustness and explainability, the issue of fairness has not yet been adequately addressed. We establish that the existing fairness-aware algorithms designed for CNNs do not perform well on ViT, which highlights the need to develop our novel framework via Debiased Self-Attention (DSA). DSA is a fairness-through-blindness approach that enforces ViT to eliminate spurious features correlated with the sensitive label for bias mitigation and simultaneously retain real features for target prediction. Notably, DSA leverages adversarial examples to locate and mask the spurious features in the input image patches with an additional attention weights alignment regularizer in the training objective to encourage learning real features for target prediction. Importantly, our DSA framework leads to improved fairness guarantees over prior works on multiple prediction tasks without compromising target prediction performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bernard Keenan, Kacper Sokol</p>
<p>Abstract: Over the past decade explainable artificial intelligence has evolved from a predominantly technical discipline into a field that is deeply intertwined with social sciences. Insights such as human preference for contrastive -- more precisely, counterfactual -- explanations have played a major role in this transition, inspiring and guiding the research in computer science. Other observations, while equally important, have nevertheless received much less consideration. The desire of human explainees to communicate with artificial intelligence explainers through a dialogue-like interaction has been mostly neglected by the community. This poses many challenges for the effectiveness and widespread adoption of such technologies as delivering a single explanation optimised according to some predefined objectives may fail to engender understanding in its recipients and satisfy their unique needs given the diversity of human knowledge and intention. Using insights elaborated by Niklas Luhmann and, more recently, Elena Esposito we apply social systems theory to highlight challenges in explainable artificial intelligence and offer a path forward, striving to reinvigorate the technical research in the direction of interactive and iterative explainers. Specifically, this paper demonstrates the potential of systems theoretical approaches to communication in elucidating and addressing the problems and limitations of human-centred explainable artificial intelligence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Conghao Xiong, Yi Lin, Hao Chen, Hao Zheng, Dong Wei, Yefeng Zheng, Joseph J. Y. Sung, Irwin King</p>
<p>Abstract: Transferring knowledge from a source domain to a target domain can be crucial for whole slide image classification, since the number of samples in a dataset is often limited due to high annotation costs. However, domain shift and task discrepancy between datasets can hinder effective knowledge transfer. In this paper, we propose a Target-Aware Knowledge Transfer framework, employing a teacher-student paradigm. Our framework enables the teacher model to learn common knowledge from the source and target domains by actively incorporating unlabelled target images into the training of the teacher model. The teacher bag features are subsequently adapted to supervise the training of the student model on the target domain. Despite incorporating the target features during training, the teacher model tends to overlook them under the inherent domain shift and task discrepancy. To alleviate this, we introduce a target-aware feature alignment module to establish a transferable latent relationship between the source and target features by solving the optimal transport problem. Experimental results show that models employing knowledge transfer outperform those trained from scratch, and our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among other knowledge transfer methods on various datasets, including TCGA-RCC, TCGA-NSCLC, and Camelyon16.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mu Cai, Zeyi Huang, Yuheng Li, Utkarsh Ojha, Haohan Wang, Yong Jae Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made significant advancements in natural language understanding. However, through that enormous semantic representation that the LLM has learnt, is it somehow possible for it to understand images as well? This work investigates this question. To enable the LLM to process images, we convert them into a representation given by Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG). To study what the LLM can do with this XML-based textual description of images, we test the LLM on three broad computer vision tasks: (i) visual reasoning and question answering, (ii) image classification under distribution shift, few-shot learning, and (iii) generating new images using visual prompting.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bin Wang, Zhengyuan Liu, Xin Huang, Fangkai Jiao, Yang Ding, AiTi Aw, Nancy F. Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: We present SeaEval, a benchmark for multilingual foundation models. In addition to characterizing how these models understand and reason with natural language, we also investigate how well they comprehend cultural practices, nuances, and values. Alongside standard accuracy metrics, we investigate the brittleness of foundation models in the dimensions of semantics and multilinguality. Our analyses span both open-sourced and closed models, leading to empirical results across classic NLP tasks, reasoning, and cultural comprehension. Key findings indicate (1) Most models exhibit varied behavior when given paraphrased instructions. (2) Many models still suffer from exposure bias (e.g., positional bias, majority label bias). (3) For questions rooted in factual, scientific, and commonsense knowledge, consistent responses are expected across multilingual queries that are semantically equivalent. Yet, most models surprisingly demonstrate inconsistent performance on these queries. (4) Multilingually-trained models have not attained "balanced multilingual" capabilities. Our endeavors underscore the need for more generalizable semantic representations and enhanced multilingual contextualization. SeaEval can serve as a launchpad for more thorough investigations and evaluations for multilingual and multicultural scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaowei Gao, Xinke Jiang, Dingyi Zhuang, Huanfa Chen, Shenhao Wang, Stephen Law, James Haworth</p>
<p>Abstract: Traffic accidents present substantial challenges to human safety and socio-economic development in urban areas. Developing a reliable and responsible traffic accident prediction model is crucial to addressing growing public safety concerns and enhancing the safety of urban mobility systems. Traditional methods face limitations at fine spatiotemporal scales due to the sporadic nature of highrisk accidents and the predominance of non-accident characteristics. Furthermore, while most current models show promising occurrence prediction, they overlook the uncertainties arising from the inherent nature of accidents, and then fail to adequately map the hierarchical ranking of accident risk values for more precise insights. To address these issues, we introduce the Spatiotemporal Zero-Inflated Tweedie Graph Neural Network STZITDGNN -- the first uncertainty-aware probabilistic graph deep learning model in roadlevel traffic accident prediction for multisteps. This model integrates the interpretability of the statistical Tweedie family model and the expressive power of graph neural networks. Its decoder innovatively employs a compound Tweedie model,a Poisson distribution to model the frequency of accident occurrences and a Gamma distribution to assess injury severity, supplemented by a zeroinflated component to effectively identify exessive nonincident instances. Empirical tests using realworld traffic data from London, UK, demonstrate that the STZITDGNN surpasses other baseline models across multiple benchmarks and metrics, including accident risk value prediction, uncertainty minimisation, non-accident road identification and accident occurrence accuracy. Our study demonstrates that STZTIDGNN can effectively inform targeted road monitoring, thereby improving urban road safety strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zixiang Chen, Yihe Deng, Yuanzhi Li, Quanquan Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-modal learning has become increasingly popular due to its ability to leverage information from different data sources (e.g., text and images) to improve the model performance. Recently, CLIP has emerged as an effective approach that employs vision-language contrastive pretraining to learn joint image and text representations and exhibits remarkable performance in zero-shot learning and text-guided natural image generation. Despite the huge practical success of CLIP, its theoretical understanding remains elusive. In this paper, we formally study transferrable representation learning underlying CLIP and demonstrate how features from different modalities get aligned. We also analyze its zero-shot transfer performance on the downstream tasks. Inspired by our analysis, we propose a new CLIP-type approach, which achieves better performance than CLIP and other state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicholas Kroeger, Dan Ley, Satyapriya Krishna, Chirag Agarwal, Himabindu Lakkaraju</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in complex tasks like machine translation, commonsense reasoning, and language understanding. One of the primary reasons for the adaptability of LLMs in such diverse tasks is their in-context learning (ICL) capability, which allows them to perform well on new tasks by simply using a few task samples in the prompt. Despite their effectiveness in enhancing the performance of LLMs on diverse language and tabular tasks, these methods have not been thoroughly explored for their potential to generate post hoc explanations. In this work, we carry out one of the first explorations to analyze the effectiveness of LLMs in explaining other complex predictive models using ICL. To this end, we propose a novel framework, In-Context Explainers, comprising of three novel approaches that exploit the ICL capabilities of LLMs to explain the predictions made by other predictive models. We conduct extensive analysis with these approaches on real-world tabular and text datasets and demonstrate that LLMs are capable of explaining other predictive models similar to state-of-the-art post hoc explainers, opening up promising avenues for future research into LLM-based post hoc explanations of complex predictive models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christian Tomani, David Vilar, Markus Freitag, Colin Cherry, Subhajit Naskar, Mara Finkelstein, Xavier Garcia, Daniel Cremers</p>
<p>Abstract: Maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) decoding is the most widely used decoding strategy for neural machine translation (NMT) models. The underlying assumption is that model probability correlates well with human judgment, with better translations getting assigned a higher score by the model. However, research has shown that this assumption does not always hold, and generation quality can be improved by decoding to optimize a utility function backed by a metric or quality-estimation signal, as is done by Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) or quality-aware decoding. The main disadvantage of these approaches is that they require an additional model to calculate the utility function during decoding, significantly increasing the computational cost. In this paper, we propose to make the NMT models themselves quality-aware by training them to estimate the quality of their own output. Using this approach for MBR decoding we can drastically reduce the size of the candidate list, resulting in a speed-up of two-orders of magnitude. When applying our method to MAP decoding we obtain quality gains similar or even superior to quality reranking approaches, but with the efficiency of single pass decoding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinlu Zhang, Chenxin Tian, Xianjun Yang, Lichang Chen, Zekun Li, Linda Ruth Petzold</p>
<p>Abstract: Instruction-finetuning (IFT) has become crucial in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with diverse human needs and has shown great potential in medical applications. However, previous studies mainly fine-tune LLMs on biomedical datasets with limited diversity, which often rely on benchmarks or narrow task scopes, and hence significantly limit the effectiveness on their medical instruction-following ability and generalizability. To bridge this gap, we propose creating a diverse, machine-generated medical IFT dataset, MedInstruct-52k, using GPT-4 and ChatGPT with a high-quality expert-curated seed set. We then fine-tune LLaMA-series models on the dataset to develop AlpaCare. Despite using a smaller domain-specific dataset than previous medical LLMs, AlpaCare not only demonstrates superior performance on medical applications, with up to 38.1% absolute gain over best baselines in medical free-form instruction evaluations, but also achieves 6.7% absolute gains averaged over multiple general domain benchmarks. Human evaluation further shows that AlpaCare consistently outperforms best baselines in terms of both correctness and helpfulness.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ming Li, Ariunaa Enkhtur, Beverley Anne Yamamoto, Fei Cheng, Lilan Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Purpose:Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) models, such as ChatGPT, may inherit or amplify societal biases due to their training on extensive datasets. With the increasing usage of GAI by students, faculty, and staff in higher education institutions (HEIs), it is urgent to examine the ethical issues and potential biases associated with these technologies. Design/Approach/Methods:This scoping review aims to elucidate how biases related to GAI in HEIs have been researched and discussed in recent academic publications. We categorized the potential societal biases that GAI might cause in the field of higher education. Our review includes articles written in English, Chinese, and Japanese across four main databases, focusing on GAI usage in higher education and bias. Findings:Our findings reveal that while there is meaningful scholarly discussion around bias and discrimination concerning LLMs in the AI field, most articles addressing higher education approach the issue superficially. Few articles identify specific types of bias under different circumstances, and there is a notable lack of empirical research. Most papers in our review focus primarily on educational and research fields related to medicine and engineering, with some addressing English education. However, there is almost no discussion regarding the humanities and social sciences. Additionally, a significant portion of the current discourse is in English and primarily addresses English-speaking contexts. Originality/Value:To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to summarize the potential societal biases in higher education. This review highlights the need for more in-depth studies and empirical work to understand the specific biases that GAI might introduce or amplify in educational settings, guiding the development of more ethical AI applications in higher education.</p>

<p>Abstract: We consider regret minimization in repeated games with a very large number of actions. Such games are inherent in the setting of AI Safety via Debate \cite{irving2018ai}, and more generally games whose actions are language-based. Existing algorithms for online game playing require per-iteration computation polynomial in the number of actions, which can be prohibitive for large games.
  We thus consider oracle-based algorithms, as oracles naturally model access to AI agents. With oracle access, we characterize when internal and external regret can be minimized efficiently. We give a novel efficient algorithm for simultaneous external and internal regret minimization whose regret depends logarithmically on the number of actions. We conclude with experiments in the setting of AI Safety via Debate that shows the benefit of insights from our algorithmic analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haotian Wang, Xiyuan Du, Weijiang Yu, Qianglong Chen, Kun Zhu, Zheng Chu, Lian Yan, Yi Guan</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-agent debate system (MAD) imitating the process of human discussion in pursuit of truth, aims to align the correct cognition of different agents for the optimal solution. It is challenging to make various agents perform right and highly consistent cognition due to their limited and different knowledge backgrounds (i.e., cognitive islands), which hinders the search for the optimal solution. To address the challenge, we propose a novel \underline{M}ulti-\underline{A}gent \underline{D}ebate with \underline{K}nowledge-\underline{E}nhanced framework (\textbf{MADKE}) to promote the system to find the solution. First, we involve a shared retrieval knowledge pool in the debate process to solve the problem of limited and different knowledge backgrounds. Then, we propose an adaptive knowledge selection method to guarantee the accuracy and personalization of knowledge. This method allows agents to choose whether to use external knowledge in each conversation round according to their own needs. Our experimental results on six datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results compared to existing single-agent and multi-agent methods. Further analysis reveals that the introduction of retrieval knowledge can help the agent to break cognitive islands in the debate process and effectively improve the consistency and correctness of the model. Moreover, MADKE using Qwen1.5-72B-Chat surpasses GPT-4 by +1.26\% on average in six datasets, which validates that our method can help open-source LLMs achieve or even surpass the performance of GPT-4.

<p>Abstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) has shown great competence in image and audio generation tasks.

Diffusion-EXR corrupts the sequence of review embeddings by incrementally introducing varied levels of Gaussian noise to the sequence of word embeddings and learns to reconstruct the original word representations in the reverse process. The nature of DDPM enables our lightweight Transformer backbone to perform excellently in the recommendation review generation task. Extensive experimental results have demonstrated that Diffusion-EXR can achieve state-of-the-art review generation for recommendation on two publicly available benchmark datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Experimental particle physics uses machine learning for many tasks, where one application is to classify signal and background events. This classification can be used to bin an analysis region to enhance the expected significance for a mass resonance search. In natural language processing, one of the leading neural network architectures is the transformer. In this work, an event classifier transformer is proposed to bin an analysis region, in which the network is trained with special techniques. The techniques developed here can enhance the significance and reduce the correlation between the network's output and the reconstructed mass. It is found that this trained network can perform better than boosted decision trees and feed-forward networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongye Jin, Xiaotian Han, Jingfeng Yang, Zhimeng Jiang, Zirui Liu, Chia-Yuan Chang, Huiyuan Chen, Xia Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: It is well known that LLMs cannot generalize well to long contexts whose lengths are larger than the training sequence length. This poses challenges when employing LLMs for processing long input sequences during inference. In this work, we argue that LLMs themselves have inherent capabilities to handle long contexts without fine-tuning. To achieve this goal, we propose SelfExtend to extend the context window of LLMs by constructing bi-level attention information: the grouped attention and the neighbor attention. The grouped attention captures the dependencies among tokens that are far apart, while neighbor attention captures dependencies among adjacent tokens within a specified range. The two-level attentions are computed based on the original model's self-attention mechanism during inference. With minor code modification, our SelfExtend can effortlessly extend existing LLMs' context window without any fine-tuning. We conduct comprehensive experiments on multiple benchmarks and the results show that our SelfExtend can effectively extend existing LLMs' context window length.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xujin Li, Wei Wei, Shuang Qiu, Huiguang He</p>
<p>Abstract: The Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP)-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is an efficient technology for target retrieval using electroencephalography (EEG) signals. The performance improvement of traditional decoding methods relies on a substantial amount of training data from new test subjects, which increases preparation time for BCI systems. Several studies introduce data from existing subjects to reduce the dependence of performance improvement on data from new subjects, but their optimization strategy based on adversarial learning with extensive data increases training time during the preparation procedure. Moreover, most previous methods only focus on the single-view information of EEG signals, but ignore the information from other views which may further improve performance. To enhance decoding performance while reducing preparation time, we propose a Temporal-Spectral fusion transformer with Subject-specific Adapter (TSformer-SA). Specifically, a cross-view interaction module is proposed to facilitate information transfer and extract common representations across two-view features extracted from EEG temporal signals and spectrogram images. Then, an attention-based fusion module fuses the features of two views to obtain comprehensive discriminative features for classification. Furthermore, a multi-view consistency loss is proposed to maximize the feature similarity between two views of the same EEG signal. Finally, we propose a subject-specific adapter to rapidly transfer the knowledge of the model trained on data from existing subjects to decode data from new subjects. Experimental results show that TSformer-SA significantly outperforms comparison methods and achieves outstanding performance with limited training data from new subjects. This facilitates efficient decoding and rapid deployment of BCI systems in practical use.</p>

<p>Abstract: Stochastic approximation is a class of algorithms that update a vector iteratively, incrementally, and stochastically, including, e.g., stochastic gradient descent and temporal difference learning. One fundamental challenge in analyzing a stochastic approximation algorithm is to establish its stability, i.e., to show that the stochastic vector iterates are bounded almost surely. In this paper, we extend the celebrated Borkar-Meyn theorem for stability from the Martingale difference noise setting to the Markovian noise setting, which greatly improves its applicability in reinforcement learning, especially in those off-policy reinforcement learning algorithms with linear function approximation and eligibility traces. Central to our analysis is the diminishing asymptotic rate of change of a few functions, which is implied by both a form of strong law of large numbers and a commonly used V4 Lyapunov drift condition and trivially holds if the Markov chain is finite and irreducible.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis aims to identify the emotions expressed by individuals through visual, language, and acoustic cues. However, most of the existing research efforts assume that all modalities are available during both training and testing, making their algorithms susceptible to the missing modality scenario. In this paper, we propose a novel knowledge-transfer network to translate between different modalities to reconstruct the missing audio modalities. Moreover, we develop a cross-modality attention mechanism to retain the maximal information of the reconstructed and observed modalities for sentiment prediction. Extensive experiments on three publicly available datasets demonstrate significant improvements over baselines and achieve comparable results to the previous methods with complete multi-modality supervision.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruixin Song, Gabriel Spadon, Ronald Pelot, Stan Matwin, Amilcar Soares</p>
<p>Abstract: Aquatic non-indigenous species (NIS) pose significant threats to biodiversity, disrupting ecosystems and inflicting substantial economic damages across agriculture, forestry, and fisheries. Due to the fast growth of global trade and transportation networks, NIS has been introduced and spread unintentionally in new environments. This study develops a new physics-informed model to forecast maritime shipping traffic between port regions worldwide. The predicted information provided by these models, in turn, is used as input for risk assessment of NIS spread through transportation networks to evaluate the capability of our solution. Inspired by the gravity model for international trades, our model considers various factors that influence the likelihood and impact of vessel activities, such as shipping flux density, distance between ports, trade flow, and centrality measures of transportation hubs. Accordingly, this paper introduces transformers to gravity models to rebuild the short- and long-term dependencies that make the risk analysis feasible. Thus, we introduce a physics-inspired framework that achieves an 89% binary accuracy for existing and non-existing trajectories and an 84.8% accuracy for the number of vessels flowing between key port areas, representing more than 10% improvement over the traditional deep-gravity model. Along these lines, this research contributes to a better understanding of NIS risk assessment. It allows policymakers, conservationists, and stakeholders to prioritize management actions by identifying high-risk invasion pathways. Besides, our model is versatile and can include new data sources, making it suitable for assessing international vessel traffic flow in a changing global landscape.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David S. Berman, Marc S. Klinger, Alexander G. Stapleton</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper we present a novel approach to interpretable AI inspired by Quantum Field Theory (QFT) which we call the NCoder. The NCoder is a modified autoencoder neural network whose latent layer is prescribed to be a subset of $n$-point correlation functions. Regarding images as draws from a lattice field theory, this architecture mimics the task of perturbatively constructing the effective action of the theory order by order in an expansion using Feynman diagrams. Alternatively, the NCoder may be regarded as simulating the procedure of statistical inference whereby high dimensional data is first summarized in terms of several lower dimensional summary statistics (here the $n$-point correlation functions), and subsequent out-of-sample data is generated by inferring the data generating distribution from these statistics. In this way the NCoder suggests a fascinating correspondence between perturbative renormalizability and the sufficiency of models. We demonstrate the efficacy of the NCoder by applying it to the generation of MNIST images, and find that generated images can be correctly classified using only information from the first three $n$-point functions of the image distribution.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaiqi Chen, Eugene Lim, Kelvin Lin, Yiyang Chen, Harold Soh</p>
<p>Abstract: Imitation learning empowers artificial agents to mimic behavior by learning from demonstrations. Recently, diffusion models, which have the ability to model high-dimensional and multimodal distributions, have shown impressive performance on imitation learning tasks. These models learn to shape a policy by diffusing actions (or states) from standard Gaussian noise. However, the target policy to be learned is often significantly different from Gaussian and this mismatch can result in poor performance when using a small number of diffusion steps (to improve inference speed) and under limited data. The key idea in this work is that initiating from a more informative source than Gaussian enables diffusion methods to mitigate the above limitations. We contribute both theoretical results, a new method, and empirical findings that show the benefits of using an informative source policy. Our method, which we call BRIDGER, leverages the stochastic interpolants framework to bridge arbitrary policies, thus enabling a flexible approach towards imitation learning. It generalizes prior work in that standard Gaussians can still be applied, but other source policies can be used if available. In experiments on challenging simulation benchmarks and on real robots, BRIDGER outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion policies. We provide further analysis on design considerations when applying BRIDGER. Code for BRIDGER is available at https://github.com/clear-nus/bridger.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Flavio Petruzzellis, Alberto Testolin, Alessandro Sperduti</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of Natural Language Processing thanks to their ability to reuse knowledge acquired on massive text corpora on a wide variety of downstream tasks, with minimal (if any) tuning steps. At the same time, it has been repeatedly shown that LLMs lack systematic generalization, which allows to extrapolate the learned statistical regularities outside the training distribution. In this work, we offer a systematic benchmarking of GPT-4, one of the most advanced LLMs available, on three algorithmic tasks characterized by the possibility to control the problem difficulty with two parameters. We compare the performance of GPT-4 with that of its predecessor (GPT-3.5) and with a variant of the Transformer-Encoder architecture recently introduced to solve similar tasks, the Neural Data Router. We find that the deployment of advanced prompting techniques allows GPT-4 to reach superior accuracy on all tasks, demonstrating that state-of-the-art LLMs constitute a very strong baseline also in challenging tasks that require systematic generalization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Milin Zhang, Mohammad Abdi, Shahriar Rifat, Francesco Restuccia</p>
<p>Abstract: Distributed deep neural networks (DNNs) have emerged as a key technique to reduce communication overhead without sacrificing performance in edge computing systems. Recently, entropy coding has been introduced to further reduce the communication overhead. The key idea is to train the distributed DNN jointly with an entropy model, which is used as side information during inference time to adaptively encode latent representations into bit streams with variable length. To the best of our knowledge, the resilience of entropy models is yet to be investigated. As such, in this paper we formulate and investigate the resilience of entropy models to intentional interference (e.g., adversarial attacks) and unintentional interference (e.g., weather changes and motion blur). Through an extensive experimental campaign with 3 different DNN architectures, 2 entropy models and 4 rate-distortion trade-off factors, we demonstrate that the entropy attacks can increase the communication overhead by up to 95%. By separating compression features in frequency and spatial domain, we propose a new defense mechanism that can reduce the transmission overhead of the attacked input by about 9% compared to unperturbed data, with only about 2% accuracy loss. Importantly, the proposed defense mechanism is a standalone approach which can be applied in conjunction with approaches such as adversarial training to further improve robustness. Code will be shared for reproducibility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Changyu Chen, Xiting Wang, Ting-En Lin, Ang Lv, Yuchuan Wu, Xin Gao, Ji-Rong Wen, Rui Yan, Yongbin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: In reasoning tasks, even a minor error can cascade into inaccurate results, leading to suboptimal performance of large language models in such domains. Earlier fine-tuning approaches sought to mitigate this by leveraging more precise supervisory signals from human labeling, larger models, or self-sampling, although at a high cost. Conversely, we develop a method that avoids external resources, relying instead on introducing perturbations to the input. Our training approach randomly masks certain tokens within the chain of thought, a technique we found to be particularly effective for reasoning tasks. When applied to fine-tuning with GSM8K on Llama-2-7B, this method achieved a 5\% improvement in GSM8K accuracy and a 10\% improvement in GSM-IC accuracy over standard supervised fine-tuning with a few codes modified. Furthermore, it is complementary to existing methods. When integrated with related explicit data augmentation methods, it leads to improvements across five datasets of various augmentation methods, as well as two different base models. We further investigate the mechanisms behind this improvement through case studies and quantitative analysis, suggesting that our approach may provide superior support for the model in capturing long-distance dependencies, especially those related to questions. This enhancement could deepen understanding of the premises in questions and prior steps. Our code is available at Github.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Oliver Schulte, Pascal Poupart</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) and causal modelling naturally complement each other. The goal of causal modelling is to predict the effects of interventions in an environment, while the goal of reinforcement learning is to select interventions that maximize the rewards the agent receives from the environment. Reinforcement learning includes the two most powerful sources of information for estimating causal relationships: temporal ordering and the ability to act on an environment. This paper examines which reinforcement learning settings we can expect to benefit from causal modelling, and how. In online learning, the agent has the ability to interact directly with their environment, and learn from exploring it. Our main argument is that in online learning, conditional probabilities are causal, and therefore offline RL is the setting where causal learning has the most potential to make a difference. Essentially, the reason is that when an agent learns from their {\em own} experience, there are no unobserved confounders that influence both the agent's own exploratory actions and the rewards they receive. Our paper formalizes this argument. For offline RL, where an agent may and typically does learn from the experience of {\em others}, we describe previous and new methods for leveraging a causal model, including support for counterfactual queries.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kashyap Chitta, Daniel Dauner, Andreas Geiger</p>
<p>Abstract: SLEDGE is the first generative simulator for vehicle motion planning trained on real-world driving logs. Its core component is a learned model that is able to generate agent bounding boxes and lane graphs. The model's outputs serve as an initial state for rule-based traffic simulation. The unique properties of the entities to be generated for SLEDGE, such as their connectivity and variable count per scene, render the naive application of most modern generative models to this task non-trivial. Therefore, together with a systematic study of existing lane graph representations, we introduce a novel raster-to-vector autoencoder. It encodes agents and the lane graph into distinct channels in a rasterized latent map. This facilitates both lane-conditioned agent generation and combined generation of lanes and agents with a Diffusion Transformer. Using generated entities in SLEDGE enables greater control over the simulation, e.g. upsampling turns or increasing traffic density. Further, SLEDGE can support 500m long routes, a capability not found in existing data-driven simulators like nuPlan. It presents new challenges for planning algorithms, evidenced by failure rates of over 40% for PDM, the winner of the 2023 nuPlan challenge, when tested on hard routes and dense traffic generated by our model. Compared to nuPlan, SLEDGE requires 500$\times$ less storage to set up (<4 GB), making it a more accessible option and helping with democratizing future research in this field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Zhang, Dongyuan Lu, Jitao Sang</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning models often make predictions based on biased features such as gender, race, and other social attributes, posing significant fairness risks, especially in societal applications, such as hiring, banking, and criminal justice. Traditional approaches to addressing this issue involve retraining or fine-tuning neural networks with fairness-aware optimization objectives. However, these methods can be impractical due to significant computational resources, complex industrial tests, and the associated CO2 footprint. Additionally, regular users often fail to fine-tune models because they lack access to model parameters In this paper, we introduce the Inference-Time Rule Eraser (Eraser), a novel method designed to address fairness concerns by removing biased decision-making rules from deployed models during inference without altering model weights. We begin by establishing a theoretical foundation for modifying model outputs to eliminate biased rules through Bayesian analysis. Next, we present a specific implementation of Eraser that involves two stages: (1) distilling the biased rules from the deployed model into an additional patch model, and (2) removing these biased rules from the output of the deployed model during inference. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, showcasing its superior performance in addressing fairness concerns in AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zahra Zamanzadeh Darban, Yiyuan Yang, Geoffrey I. Webb, Charu C. Aggarwal, Qingsong Wen, Mahsa Salehi</p>
<p>Abstract: In time series anomaly detection (TSAD), the scarcity of labeled data poses a challenge to the development of accurate models. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) offers a solution by leveraging labeled data from a related domain to detect anomalies in an unlabeled target domain. However, existing UDA methods assume consistent anomalous classes across domains. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Domain Adaptation Contrastive learning model for Anomaly Detection in multivariate time series (DACAD), combining UDA with contrastive learning. DACAD utilizes an anomaly injection mechanism that enhances generalization across unseen anomalous classes, improving adaptability and robustness. Additionally, our model employs supervised contrastive loss for the source domain and self-supervised contrastive triplet loss for the target domain, ensuring comprehensive feature representation learning and domain-invariant feature extraction. Finally, an effective Centre-based Entropy Classifier (CEC) accurately learns normal boundaries in the source domain. Extensive evaluations on multiple real-world datasets and a synthetic dataset highlight DACAD's superior performance in transferring knowledge across domains and mitigating the challenge of limited labeled data in TSAD.</p>

<p>Abstract: The advent of immersive Virtual Reality applications has transformed various domains, yet their integration with advanced artificial intelligence technologies like Visual Language Models remains underexplored. This study introduces a pioneering approach utilizing VLMs within VR environments to enhance user interaction and task efficiency. Leveraging the Unity engine and a custom-developed VLM, our system facilitates real-time, intuitive user interactions through natural language processing, without relying on visual text instructions. The incorporation of speech-to-text and text-to-speech technologies allows for seamless communication between the user and the VLM, enabling the system to guide users through complex tasks effectively. Preliminary experimental results indicate that utilizing VLMs not only reduces task completion times but also improves user comfort and task engagement compared to traditional VR interaction methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ce Ge, Zhijian Ma, Daoyuan Chen, Yaliang Li, Bolin Ding</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models exhibit exceptional generalization capabilities, primarily attributed to the utilization of diversely sourced data. However, conventional practices in integrating this diverse data heavily rely on heuristic schemes, lacking theoretical guidance. This research tackles these limitations by investigating strategies based on low-cost proxies for data mixtures, with the aim of streamlining data curation to enhance training efficiency. Specifically, we propose a unified scaling law, termed $\textbf{BiMix}$, which accurately models the bivariate scaling behaviors of both data quantity and mixing proportions. We conduct systematic experiments and provide empirical evidence for the predictive power and fundamental principles of $\textbf{BiMix}$. Notably, our findings reveal that entropy-driven training-free data mixtures can achieve comparable or even better performance than more resource-intensive methods. We hope that our quantitative insights can shed light on further judicious research and development in cost-effective language modeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Janis Zenkner, Lukas Dierkes, Tobias Sesterhenn, Chrisitan Bartelt</p>
<p>Abstract: LambdaBeam is a state-of-the-art execution-guided algorithm for program synthesis that incorporates higher-order functions, lambda functions, and iterative loops into the Domain-Specific Language (DSL). LambdaBeam generates every program from the start. Yet, many program blocks or subprograms occur frequently in a given domain, e.g., loops to traverse a list. Thus, repeating programs can be used to enhance the synthesis algorithm. However, LambdaBeam fails to leverage this potential. For this purpose, we introduce AbstractBeam: A novel program synthesis framework that employs Library Learning to identify such program repetitions, integrates them into the DSL, and thus utilizes their potential to boost LambdaBeam's synthesis algorithm. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that AbstractBeam significantly improves LambdaBeam's performance in the LambdaBeam integer list manipulation domain. Additionally, AbstractBeam's program generation is more efficient compared to LambdaBeam's synthesis. Finally, our findings indicate that Library Learning is effective in domains not specifically crafted to highlight its benefits.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present MOFA-Video, an advanced controllable image animation method that generates video from the given image using various additional controllable signals (such as human landmarks reference, manual trajectories, and another even provided video) or their combinations. This is different from previous methods which only can work on a specific motion domain or show weak control abilities with diffusion prior. To achieve our goal, we design several domain-aware motion field adapters (\ie, MOFA-Adapters) to control the generated motions in the video generation pipeline. For MOFA-Adapters, we consider the temporal motion consistency of the video and generate the dense motion flow from the given sparse control conditions first, and then, the multi-scale features of the given image are wrapped as a guided feature for stable video diffusion generation. We naively train two motion adapters for the manual trajectories and the human landmarks individually since they both contain sparse information about the control. After training, the MOFA-Adapters in different domains can also work together for more controllable video generation. Project Page: https://myniuuu.github.io/MOFA_Video/</p>

Imposing stability of the SSM blocks is a standard practice in the literature, and it is known to help performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marianna Nezhurina, Lucia Cipolina-Kun, Mehdi Cherti, Jenia Jitsev</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are often described as being instances of foundation models - that is, models that transfer strongly across various tasks and conditions in few-show or zero-shot manner, while exhibiting scaling laws that predict function improvement when increasing the pre-training scale. These claims of excelling in different functions and tasks rely on measurements taken across various sets of standardized benchmarks showing high scores for such models. We demonstrate here a dramatic breakdown of function and reasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art models trained at the largest available scales which claim strong function, using a simple, short, conventional common sense problem (AIW problem) formulated in concise natural language, easily solvable by humans. The breakdown is dramatic, as models show strong fluctuations across even slight problem variations that should not affect problem solving, also expressing strong overconfidence in the wrong solutions, often backed up by plausible sounding explanation-like confabulations. Various standard interventions in an attempt to get the right solution, like various type of enhanced prompting, or urging the models to reconsider the wrong solutions again by multi step re-evaluation, fail. We take these initial observations to the scientific and technological community to stimulate urgent re-assessment of the claimed capabilities of current generation of LLMs. Such re-assessment also requires common action to create standardized benchmarks that would allow proper detection of such basic reasoning deficits that obviously manage to remain undiscovered by current state-of-the-art evaluation procedures and benchmarks.

<p>Abstract: Domain specific digital twins, representing a digital replica of various segments of the smart grid, are foreseen as able to model, simulate, and control the respective segments. At the same time, knowledge-based digital twins, coupled with AI, may also empower humans to understand aspects of the system through natural language interaction in view of planning and policy making. This paper is the first to assess and report on the potential of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) question answers related to household electrical energy measurement aspects leveraging a knowledge-based energy digital twin. Relying on the recently published electricity consumption knowledge graph that actually represents a knowledge-based digital twin, we study the capabilities of ChatGPT, Gemini and Llama in answering electricity related questions. Furthermore, we compare the answers with the ones generated through a RAG techniques that leverages an existing electricity knowledge-based digital twin. Our findings illustrate that the RAG approach not only reduces the incidence of incorrect information typically generated by LLMs but also significantly improves the quality of the output by grounding responses in verifiable data. This paper details our methodology, presents a comparative analysis of responses with and without RAG, and discusses the implications of our findings for future applications of AI in specialized sectors like energy data analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hua Yang, Duohai Li, Shiman Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers excel in Natural Language Processing (NLP) due to their prowess in capturing long-term dependencies but suffer from exponential resource consumption with increasing sequence lengths. To address these challenges, we propose MCSD model, an efficient language model with linear scaling and fast inference speed. MCSD model leverages diverse feature fusion, primarily through the multi-channel slope and decay (MCSD) block, to robustly represent features. This block comprises slope and decay sections that extract features across diverse temporal receptive fields, facilitating capture of both local and global information. In addition, MCSD block conducts element-wise fusion of diverse features to further enhance the delicate feature extraction capability. For inference, we formulate the inference process into a recurrent representation, slashing space complexity to $O(1)$ and time complexity to $O(N)$ respectively. Our experiments show that MCSD attains higher throughput and lower GPU memory consumption compared to Transformers, while maintaining comparable performance to larger-scale language learning models on benchmark tests. These attributes position MCSD as a promising base for edge deployment and embodied intelligence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pinzhen Chen, Simon Yu, Zhicheng Guo, Barry Haddow</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models, particularly multilingual ones, are designed, claimed, and expected to cater to native speakers of varied languages. We hypothesise that the current practices of fine-tuning and evaluating these models may not perfectly align with this objective owing to a heavy reliance on translation, which can introduce translation artefacts and defects. It remains unknown whether the nature of the instruction data has an impact on the model output; conversely, it is questionable whether translated test sets can capture such nuances. Due to the often coupled practices of using translated data in both stages, such imperfections could have been overlooked. This work investigates these issues using controlled native or translated data during instruction tuning and evaluation stages. Experiments on eight base models and eight different benchmarks show that native or generation benchmarks reveal a notable difference between native and translated instruction data especially when model performance is high, whereas other types of test sets cannot. The comparison between round-trip and single-pass translations reflects the importance of knowledge from language-native resources. Finally, we demonstrate that regularization is beneficial to bridging this gap on structured but not generative tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLM) excel at a variety of natural language processing tasks, yet they struggle to generate personalized content for individuals, particularly in real-world scenarios like scientific writing. Addressing this challenge, we introduce STEP-BACK PROFILING to personalize LLMs by distilling user history into concise profiles, including essential traits and preferences of users. To conduct the experiments, we construct a Personalized Scientific Writing (PSW) dataset to study multi-user personalization. PSW requires the models to write scientific papers given specialized author groups with diverse academic backgrounds. As for the results, we demonstrate the effectiveness of capturing user characteristics via STEP-BACK PROFILING for collaborative writing. Moreover, our approach outperforms the baselines by up to 3.6 points on the general personalization benchmark (LaMP), including 7 personalization LLM tasks.

<p>Abstract: Investigations into Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) for Korean restaurant reviews are notably lacking in the existing literature. Our research proposes an intuitive and effective framework for ABSA in low-resource languages such as Korean. It optimizes prediction labels by integrating translated benchmark and unlabeled Korean data. Using a model fine-tuned on translated data, we pseudo-labeled the actual Korean NLI set. Subsequently, we applied LaBSE and MSP-based filtering to this pseudo-NLI set as implicit feature, enhancing Aspect Category Detection and Polarity determination through additional training. Incorporating dual filtering, this model bridged dataset gaps, achieving positive results in Korean ABSA with minimal resources. Through additional data injection pipelines, our approach aims to utilize high-resource data and construct effective models within communities, whether corporate or individual, in low-resource language countries. Compared to English ABSA, our framework showed an approximately 3% difference in F1 scores and accuracy. We release the dataset and our code for Korean ABSA, at this link.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Omer Goldman, Alon Jacovi, Aviv Slobodkin, Aviya Maimon, Ido Dagan, Reut Tsarfaty</p>
<p>Abstract: Improvements in language models' capabilities have pushed their applications towards longer contexts, making long-context evaluation and development an active research area. However, many disparate use-cases are grouped together under the umbrella term of "long-context", defined simply by the total length of the model's input, including - for example - Needle-in-a-Haystack tasks, book summarization, and information aggregation. Given their varied difficulty, in this position paper we argue that conflating different tasks by their context length is unproductive. As a community, we require a more precise vocabulary to understand what makes long-context tasks similar or different. We propose to unpack the taxonomy of long-context based on the properties that make them more difficult with longer contexts. We propose two orthogonal axes of difficulty: (I) Diffusion: How hard is it to find the necessary information in the context? (II) Scope: How much necessary information is there to find? We survey the literature on long-context, provide justification for this taxonomy as an informative descriptor, and situate the literature with respect to it. We conclude that the most difficult and interesting settings, whose necessary information is very long and highly diffused within the input, is severely under-explored. By using a descriptive vocabulary and discussing the relevant properties of difficulty in long-context, we can implement more informed research in this area. We call for a careful design of tasks and benchmarks with distinctly long context, taking into account the characteristics that make it qualitatively different from shorter context.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xianda Chen, PakHin Tiu, Yihuai Zhang, Xinhu Zheng, Meixin Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) offer a promising solution to the challenges of mixed traffic with both CAVs and Human-Driven Vehicles (HDVs). A significant hurdle in such scenarios is traffic oscillation, or the "stop-and-go" pattern, during car-following situations. While HDVs rely on limited information, CAVs can leverage data from other CAVs for better decision-making. This allows CAVs to anticipate and mitigate the spread of deceleration waves that worsen traffic flow. We propose a novel "CAV-AHDV-CAV" car-following framework that treats the sequence of HDVs between two CAVs as a single entity, eliminating noise from individual driver behaviors. This deep reinforcement learning approach analyzes vehicle equilibrium states and employs a state fusion strategy. Trained and tested on diverse datasets (HighD, NGSIM, SPMD, Waymo, Lyft) encompassing over 70,000 car-following instances, our model outperforms baselines in collision avoidance, maintaining equilibrium with both preceding and leading vehicles and achieving the lowest standard deviation of time headway. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in developing robust CAV control strategies for mixed traffic. Our model has the potential to mitigate traffic oscillation, improve traffic flow efficiency, and enhance overall safety.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingfang Yuan, Kefan Chen, Mehdi Rizvi, Lynne Baillie, Wei Pang</p>
<p>Abstract: The growing interest in fair AI development is evident. The ''Leave No One Behind'' initiative urges us to address multiple and intersecting forms of inequality in accessing services, resources, and opportunities, emphasising the significance of fairness in AI. This is particularly relevant as an increasing number of AI tools are applied to decision-making processes, such as resource allocation and service scheme development, across various sectors such as health, energy, and housing. Therefore, exploring joint inequalities in these sectors is significant and valuable for thoroughly understanding overall inequality and unfairness. This research introduces an innovative approach to quantify cross-sectoral intersecting discrepancies among user-defined groups using latent class analysis. These discrepancies can be used to approximate inequality and provide valuable insights to fairness issues. We validate our approach using both proprietary and public datasets, including EVENS and Census 2021 (England & Wales) datasets, to examine cross-sectoral intersecting discrepancies among different ethnic groups. We also verify the reliability of the quantified discrepancy by conducting a correlation analysis with a government public metric. Our findings reveal significant discrepancies between minority ethnic groups, highlighting the need for targeted interventions in real-world AI applications. Additionally, we demonstrate how the proposed approach can be used to provide insights into the fairness of machine learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihao Wang, Haoxuan Liu, Jiaxing Yu, Tao Zhang, Yan Liu, Kejun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Amid the rising intersection of generative AI and human artistic processes, this study probes the critical yet less-explored terrain of alignment in human-centric automatic song composition. We propose a novel task of Colloquial Description-to-Song Generation, which focuses on aligning the generated content with colloquial human expressions. This task is aimed at bridging the gap between colloquial language understanding and auditory expression within an AI model, with the ultimate goal of creating songs that accurately satisfy human auditory expectations and structurally align with musical norms. Current datasets are limited due to their narrow descriptive scope, semantic gaps and inaccuracies. To overcome data scarcity in this domain, we present the Caichong Music Dataset (CaiMD). CaiMD is manually annotated by both professional musicians and amateurs, offering diverse perspectives and a comprehensive understanding of colloquial descriptions. Unlike existing datasets pre-set with expert annotations or auto-generated ones with inherent biases, CaiMD caters more sufficiently to our purpose of aligning AI-generated music with widespread user-desired results. Moreover, we propose an innovative single-stage framework called MuDiT/MuSiT for enabling effective human-machine alignment in song creation. This framework not only achieves cross-modal comprehension between colloquial language and auditory music perceptions but also ensures generated songs align with user-desired results. MuDiT/MuSiT employs one DiT/SiT model for end-to-end generation of musical components like melody, harmony, rhythm, vocals, and instrumentation. The approach ensures harmonious sonic cohesiveness amongst all generated musical components, facilitating better resonance with human auditory expectations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Evgenii Genov, Julian Ruddick, Christoph Bergmeir, Majid Vafaeipour, Thierry Coosemans, Salvador Garcia, Maarten Messagie</p>
<p>Abstract: This research addresses the challenge of integrating forecasting and optimization in energy management systems, focusing on the impacts of switching costs, forecast accuracy, and stability. It proposes a novel framework for analyzing online optimization problems with switching costs and enabled by deterministic and probabilistic forecasts. Through empirical evaluation and theoretical analysis, the research reveals the balance between forecast accuracy, stability, and switching costs in shaping policy performance. Conducted in the context of battery scheduling within energy management applications, it introduces a metric for evaluating probabilistic forecast stability and examines the effects of forecast accuracy and stability on optimization outcomes using the real-world case of the Citylearn 2022 competition. Findings indicate that switching costs significantly influence the trade-off between forecast accuracy and stability, highlighting the importance of integrated systems that enable collaboration between forecasting and operational units for improved decision-making. The study shows that committing to a policy for longer periods can be advantageous over frequent updates. Results also show a correlation between forecast stability and policy performance, suggesting that stable forecasts can mitigate switching costs. The proposed framework provides valuable insights for energy sector decision-makers and forecast practitioners when designing the operation of an energy management system.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Georgios P. Georgiou</p>
<p>Abstract: While extensive research has focused on ChatGPT in recent years, very few studies have systematically quantified and compared linguistic features between human-written and Artificial Intelligence (AI)-generated language. This study aims to investigate how various linguistic components are represented in both types of texts, assessing the ability of AI to emulate human writing. Using human-authored essays as a benchmark, we prompted ChatGPT to generate essays of equivalent length. These texts were analyzed using Open Brain AI, an online computational tool, to extract measures of phonological, morphological, syntactic, and lexical constituents. Despite AI-generated texts appearing to mimic human speech, the results revealed significant differences across multiple linguistic features such as consonants, word stress, nouns, verbs, pronouns, direct objects, prepositional modifiers, and use of difficult words among others. These findings underscore the importance of integrating automated tools for efficient language assessment, reducing time and effort in data analysis. Moreover, they emphasize the necessity for enhanced training methodologies to improve the capacity of AI for producing more human-like text.</p>

<p>Abstract: Instruction following is one of the fundamental capabilities of large language models (LLMs). As the ability of LLMs is constantly improving, they have been increasingly applied to deal with complex human instructions in real-world scenarios. Therefore, how to evaluate the ability of complex instruction-following of LLMs has become a critical research problem. Existing benchmarks mainly focus on modeling different types of constraints in human instructions while neglecting the composition of different constraints, which is an indispensable constituent in complex instructions. To this end, we propose ComplexBench, a benchmark for comprehensively evaluating the ability of LLMs to follow complex instructions composed of multiple constraints. We propose a hierarchical taxonomy for complex instructions, including 4 constraint types, 19 constraint dimensions, and 4 composition types, and manually collect a high-quality dataset accordingly. To make the evaluation reliable, we augment LLM-based evaluators with rules to effectively verify whether generated texts can satisfy each constraint and composition. Furthermore, we obtain the final evaluation score based on the dependency structure determined by different composition types. ComplexBench identifies significant deficiencies in existing LLMs when dealing with complex instructions with multiple constraints composition.</p>

<p>Abstract: This report introduces FunAudioLLM, a model family designed to enhance natural voice interactions between humans and large language models (LLMs). At its core are two innovative models: SenseVoice, which handles multilingual speech recognition, emotion recognition, and audio event detection; and CosyVoice, which facilitates natural speech generation with control over multiple languages, timbre, speaking style, and speaker identity. SenseVoice-Small delivers exceptionally low-latency ASR for 5 languages, and SenseVoice-Large supports high-precision ASR for over 50 languages, while CosyVoice excels in multi-lingual voice generation, zero-shot in-context learning, cross-lingual voice cloning, and instruction-following capabilities. The models related to SenseVoice and CosyVoice have been open-sourced on Modelscope and Huggingface, along with the corresponding training, inference, and fine-tuning codes released on GitHub. By integrating these models with LLMs, FunAudioLLM enables applications such as speech-to-speech translation, emotional voice chat, interactive podcasts, and expressive audiobook narration, thereby pushing the boundaries of voice interaction technology.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanli Li, Zhongliang Guo, Nan Yang, Huaming Chen, Dong Yuan, Weiping Ding</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers innovative solutions for privacy-preserving collaborative machine learning (ML). Despite its promising potential, FL is vulnerable to various attacks due to its distributed nature, affecting the entire life cycle of FL services. These threats can harm the model's utility or compromise participants' privacy, either directly or indirectly. In response, numerous defense frameworks have been proposed, demonstrating effectiveness in specific settings and scenarios. To provide a clear understanding of the current research landscape, this paper reviews the most representative and state-of-the-art threats and defense frameworks throughout the FL service life cycle. We start by identifying FL threats that harm utility and privacy, including those with potential or direct impacts. Then, we dive into the defense frameworks, analyze the relationship between threats and defenses, and compare the trade-offs among different defense strategies. Finally, we summarize current research bottlenecks and offer insights into future research directions to conclude this survey. We hope this survey sheds light on trustworthy FL research and contributes to the FL community.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Victoria R. Li, Yida Chen, Naomi Saphra</p>
<p>Abstract: While the biases of language models in production are extensively documented, the biases of their guardrails have been neglected. This paper studies how contextual information about the user influences the likelihood of an LLM to refuse to execute a request. By generating user biographies that offer ideological and demographic information, we find a number of biases in guardrail sensitivity on GPT-3.5. Younger, female, and Asian-American personas are more likely to trigger a refusal guardrail when requesting censored or illegal information. Guardrails are also sycophantic, refusing to comply with requests for a political position the user is likely to disagree with. We find that certain identity groups and seemingly innocuous information, e.g., sports fandom, can elicit changes in guardrail sensitivity similar to direct statements of political ideology. For each demographic category and even for American football team fandom, we find that ChatGPT appears to infer a likely political ideology and modify guardrail behavior accordingly.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matthew E. H. Petering, Mohammad Khamechian</p>
<p>Abstract: Scheduling university courses is extra challenging when classroom capacities are reduced because of social distancing requirements that are implemented in response to a pandemic such as COVID-19. In this work, we propose an expanded taxonomy of course delivery modes, present an integer program, and develop a course scheduling algorithm to enable all course sections -- even the largest -- to have a significant classroom learning component during a pandemic. Our approach is fair by ensuring that a certain fraction of the instruction in every course section occurs in the classroom. Unlike previous studies, we do not allow rotating attendance and instead require simultaneous attendance in which all students in a section meet in 1-5 rooms at the same time but less often than in a normal semester. These mass meetings, which create opportunities for in-person midterm exams and group activities, are scheduled at high precision across all days of the semester rather than a single, repeating week. A fast heuristic algorithm makes the schedule in an hour. Results: We consider the 1834 in-person course sections, 172 classrooms, and 96 days in the fall 2022 semester at [UniversityXYZ]. If average classroom capacity is reduced by 75% due to a pandemic, our approach still allows at least 25% of the instruction in every section, and more than 49% of all instruction across the entire campus, to be in the classroom. Our method also produces excellent results for regular classroom assignment. Managerial implications: An algorithm based on the principles of fairness and simultaneous attendance can significantly improve university course schedules during a pandemic and in normal times. High-precision schedules that prepare a campus for various pandemic possibilities can be created with minimal administrative effort and activated at a moment's notice before or during a semester if an outbreak occurs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vanessa Borst, Timo Dittus, Konstantin M\"uller, Samuel Kounev</p>
<p>Abstract: The aging population poses numerous challenges to healthcare, including the increase in chronic wounds in the elderly. The current approach to wound assessment by therapists based on photographic documentation is subjective, highlighting the need for computer-aided wound recognition from smartphone photos. This offers objective and convenient therapy monitoring, while being accessible to patients from their home at any time. However, despite research in mobile image segmentation, there is a lack of focus on mobile wound segmentation. To address this gap, we conduct initial research on three lightweight architectures to investigate their suitability for smartphone-based wound segmentation. Using public datasets and UNet as a baseline, our results are promising, with both ENet and TopFormer, as well as the larger UNeXt variant, showing comparable performance to UNet. Furthermore, we deploy the models into a smartphone app for visual assessment of live segmentation, where results demonstrate the effectiveness of TopFormer in distinguishing wounds from wound-coloured objects. While our study highlights the potential of transformer models for mobile wound segmentation, future work should aim to further improve the mask contours.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhifang Zhang, Beibei Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) can learn high-quality representations from a large-scale training dataset of image-text pairs. Prompt learning is a popular approach to fine-tuning VLM to adapt them to downstream tasks. Despite the satisfying performance, a major limitation of prompt learning is the demand for labelled data. In real-world scenarios, we may only obtain candidate labels (where the true label is included) instead of the true labels due to data privacy or sensitivity issues. In this paper, we provide the first study on prompt learning with candidate labels for VLMs. We empirically demonstrate that prompt learning is more advantageous than other fine-tuning methods, for handling candidate labels. Nonetheless, its performance drops when the label ambiguity increases. In order to improve its robustness, we propose a simple yet effective framework that better leverages the prior knowledge of VLMs to guide the learning process with candidate labels. Specifically, our framework disambiguates candidate labels by aligning the model output with the mixed class posterior jointly predicted by both the learnable and the handcrafted prompt. Besides, our framework can be equipped with various off-the-shelf training objectives for learning with candidate labels to further improve their performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.</p>

<p>Abstract: Singing voice conversion (SVC) aims to convert a singer's voice in a given music piece to another singer while keeping the original content. We propose an end-to-end feature disentanglement-based model, which we named SaMoye, to enable zero-shot many-to-many singing voice conversion. SaMoye disentangles the features of the singing voice into content features, timbre features, and pitch features respectively. The content features are enhanced using a GPT-based model to perform cross-prediction with the phoneme of the lyrics. SaMoye can generate the music with converted voice by replacing the timbre features with the target singer. We also establish an unparalleled large-scale dataset to guarantee zero-shot performance. The dataset consists of 1500k pure singing vocal clips containing at least 10,000 singers.</p>

<p>Abstract: This technical report describes the Time Series Optimized Transformer for Observability (Toto), a new state of the art foundation model for time series forecasting developed by Datadog. In addition to advancing the state of the art on generalized time series benchmarks in domains such as electricity and weather, this model is the first general-purpose time series forecasting foundation model to be specifically tuned for observability metrics.
  Toto was trained on a dataset of one trillion time series data points, the largest among all currently published time series foundation models. Alongside publicly available time series datasets, 75% of the data used to train Toto consists of fully anonymous numerical metric data points from the Datadog platform.
  In our experiments, Toto outperforms existing time series foundation models on observability data. It does this while also excelling at general-purpose forecasting tasks, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on multiple open benchmark datasets.</p>
