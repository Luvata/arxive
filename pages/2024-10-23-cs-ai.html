<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicholas Potteiger, Ankita Samaddar, Hunter Bergstrom, Xenofon Koutsoukos</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern network defense can benefit from the use of autonomous systems, offloading tedious and time-consuming work to agents with standard and learning-enabled components. These agents, operating on critical network infrastructure, need to be robust and trustworthy to ensure defense against adaptive cyber-attackers and, simultaneously, provide explanations for their actions and network activity. However, learning-enabled components typically use models, such as deep neural networks, that are not transparent in their high-level decision-making leading to assurance challenges. Additionally, cyber-defense agents must execute complex long-term defense tasks in a reactive manner that involve coordination of multiple interdependent subtasks. Behavior trees are known to be successful in modelling interpretable, reactive, and modular agent policies with learning-enabled components. In this paper, we develop an approach to design autonomous cyber defense agents using behavior trees with learning-enabled components, which we refer to as Evolving Behavior Trees (EBTs). We learn the structure of an EBT with a novel abstract cyber environment and optimize learning-enabled components for deployment. The learning-enabled components are optimized for adapting to various cyber-attacks and deploying security mechanisms. The learned EBT structure is evaluated in a simulated cyber environment, where it effectively mitigates threats and enhances network visibility. For deployment, we develop a software architecture for evaluating EBT-based agents in computer network defense scenarios. Our results demonstrate that the EBT-based agent is robust to adaptive cyber-attacks and provides high-level explanations for interpreting its decisions and actions.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16397">Towards a Reliable Offline Personal AI Assistant for Long Duration Spaceflight</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Oliver Bensch, Leonie Bensch, Tommy Nilsson, Florian Saling, Wafa M. Sadri, Carsten Hartmann, Tobias Hecking, J. Nathan Kutz</p>
<p>Abstract: As humanity prepares for new missions to the Moon and Mars, astronauts will need to operate with greater autonomy, given the communication delays that make real-time support from Earth difficult. For instance, messages between Mars and Earth can take up to 24 minutes, making quick responses impossible. This limitation poses a challenge for astronauts who must rely on in-situ tools to access the large volume of data from spacecraft sensors, rovers, and satellites, data that is often fragmented and difficult to use. To bridge this gap, systems like the Mars Exploration Telemetry-Driven Information System (METIS) are being developed. METIS is an AI assistant designed to handle routine tasks, monitor spacecraft systems, and detect anomalies, all while reducing the reliance on mission control. Current Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) Models, while powerful, struggle in safety-critical environments. They can generate plausible but incorrect responses, a phenomenon known as "hallucination," which could endanger astronauts. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes enhancing systems like METIS by integrating GPTs, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Knowledge Graphs (KGs), and Augmented Reality (AR). The idea is to allow astronauts to interact with their data more intuitively, using natural language queries and visualizing real-time information through AR. KGs will be used to easily access live telemetry and multimodal data, ensuring that astronauts have the right information at the right time. By combining AI, KGs, and AR, this new system will empower astronauts to work more autonomously, safely, and efficiently during future space missions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengjiao Zhang, Jia Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: While NLP models significantly impact our lives, there are rising concerns about privacy invasion. Although federated learning enhances privacy, attackers may recover private training data by exploiting model parameters and gradients. Therefore, protecting against such embedding attacks remains an open challenge. To address this, we propose Subword Embedding from Bytes (SEB) and encode subwords to byte sequences using deep neural networks, making input text recovery harder. Importantly, our method requires a smaller memory with $256$ bytes of vocabulary while keeping efficiency with the same input length. Thus, our solution outperforms conventional approaches by preserving privacy without sacrificing efficiency or accuracy. Our experiments show SEB can effectively protect against embedding-based attacks from recovering original sentences in federated learning. Meanwhile, we verify that SEB obtains comparable and even better results over standard subword embedding methods in machine translation, sentiment analysis, and language modeling with even lower time and space complexity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tian Yu Liu, Stefano Soatto</p>
<p>Abstract: The semantic similarity between sample expressions measures the distance between their latent 'meaning'. Such meanings are themselves typically represented by textual expressions, often insufficient to differentiate concepts at fine granularity. We propose a novel approach whereby the semantic similarity among textual expressions is based not on other expressions they can be rephrased as, but rather based on the imagery they evoke. While this is not possible with humans, generative models allow us to easily visualize and compare generated images, or their distribution, evoked by a textual prompt. Therefore, we characterize the semantic similarity between two textual expressions simply as the distance between image distributions they induce, or 'conjure.' We show that by choosing the Jensen-Shannon divergence between the reverse-time diffusion stochastic differential equations (SDEs) induced by each textual expression, this can be directly computed via Monte-Carlo sampling. Our method contributes a novel perspective on semantic similarity that not only aligns with human-annotated scores, but also opens up new avenues for the evaluation of text-conditioned generative models while offering better interpretability of their learnt representations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saif Punjwani, Larry Heck</p>
<p>Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality, multimodal training data severely hinders the creation of lifelike avatar animations for conversational AI in virtual environments. Existing datasets often lack the intricate synchronization between speech, facial expressions, and body movements that characterize natural human communication. To address this critical gap, we introduce Allo-AVA, a large-scale dataset specifically designed for text and audio-driven avatar gesture animation in an allocentric (third person point-of-view) context. Allo-AVA consists of $\sim$1,250 hours of diverse video content, complete with audio, transcripts, and extracted keypoints. Allo-AVA uniquely maps these keypoints to precise timestamps, enabling accurate replication of human movements (body and facial gestures) in synchronization with speech. This comprehensive resource enables the development and evaluation of more natural, context-aware avatar animation models, potentially transforming applications ranging from virtual reality to digital assistants.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16529">Distributed Online Life-Long Learning (DOL3) for Multi-agent Trust and Reputation Assessment in E-commerce</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hariprasauth Ramamoorthy, Shubhankar Gupta, Suresh Sundaram</p>
<p>Abstract: Trust and Reputation Assessment of service providers in citizen-focused environments like e-commerce is vital to maintain the integrity of the interactions among agents. The goals and objectives of both the service provider and service consumer agents are relevant to the goals of the respective citizens (end users). The provider agents often pursue selfish goals that can make the service quality highly volatile, contributing towards the non-stationary nature of the environment. The number of active service providers tends to change over time resulting in an open environment. This necessitates a rapid and continual assessment of the Trust and Reputation. A large number of service providers in the environment require a distributed multi-agent Trust and Reputation assessment. This paper addresses the problem of multi-agent Trust and Reputation Assessment in a non-stationary environment involving transactions between providers and consumers. In this setting, the observer agents carry out the assessment and communicate their assessed trust scores with each other over a network. We propose a novel Distributed Online Life-Long Learning (DOL3) algorithm that involves real-time rapid learning of trust and reputation scores of providers. Each observer carries out an adaptive learning and weighted fusion process combining their own assessment along with that of their neighbour in the communication network. Simulation studies reveal that the state-of-the-art methods, which usually involve training a model to assess an agent's trust and reputation, do not work well in such an environment. The simulation results show that the proposed DOL3 algorithm outperforms these methods and effectively handles the volatility in such environments. From the statistical evaluation, it is evident that DOL3 performs better compared to other models in 90% of the cases.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16533">Large Body Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Saif Punjwani, Larry Heck</p>
<p>Abstract: As virtual agents become increasingly prevalent in human-computer interaction, generating realistic and contextually appropriate gestures in real-time remains a significant challenge. While neural rendering techniques have made substantial progress with static scripts, their applicability to human-computer interactions remains limited. To address this, we introduce Large Body Language Models (LBLMs) and present LBLM-AVA, a novel LBLM architecture that combines a Transformer-XL large language model with a parallelized diffusion model to generate human-like gestures from multimodal inputs (text, audio, and video). LBLM-AVA incorporates several key components enhancing its gesture generation capabilities, such as multimodal-to-pose embeddings, enhanced sequence-to-sequence mapping with redefined attention mechanisms, a temporal smoothing module for gesture sequence coherence, and an attention-based refinement module for enhanced realism. The model is trained on our large-scale proprietary open-source dataset Allo-AVA. LBLM-AVA achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating lifelike and contextually appropriate gestures with a 30% reduction in Fr\'echet Gesture Distance (FGD), and a 25% improvement in Fr\'echet Inception Distance compared to existing approaches.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16537">QIXAI: A Quantum-Inspired Framework for Enhancing Classical and Quantum Model Transparency and Understanding</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> John M. Willis</p>
<p>Abstract: The impressive performance of deep learning models, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), is often hindered by their lack of interpretability, rendering them "black boxes." This opacity raises concerns in critical areas like healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems, where trust and accountability are crucial. This paper introduces the QIXAI Framework (Quantum-Inspired Explainable AI), a novel approach for enhancing neural network interpretability through quantum-inspired techniques. By utilizing principles from quantum mechanics, such as Hilbert spaces, superposition, entanglement, and eigenvalue decomposition, the QIXAI framework reveals how different layers of neural networks process and combine features to make decisions.
  We critically assess model-agnostic methods like SHAP and LIME, as well as techniques like Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), highlighting their limitations in providing a comprehensive view of neural network operations. The QIXAI framework overcomes these limitations by offering deeper insights into feature importance, inter-layer dependencies, and information propagation. A CNN for malaria parasite detection is used as a case study to demonstrate how quantum-inspired methods like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Mutual Information (MI) provide interpretable explanations of model behavior. Additionally, we explore the extension of QIXAI to other architectures, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Transformers, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) models, and its application to generative models and time-series analysis. The framework applies to both quantum and classical systems, demonstrating its potential to improve interpretability and transparency across a range of models, advancing the broader goal of developing trustworthy AI systems.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16543">Large language models enabled multiagent ensemble method for efficient EHR data labeling</a></h1>

<p>Abstract: This study introduces a novel multiagent ensemble method powered by LLMs to address a key challenge in ML - data labeling, particularly in large-scale EHR datasets. Manual labeling of such datasets requires domain expertise and is labor-intensive, time-consuming, expensive, and error-prone. To overcome this bottleneck, we developed an ensemble LLMs method and demonstrated its effectiveness in two real-world tasks: (1) labeling a large-scale unlabeled ECG dataset in MIMIC-IV; (2) identifying social determinants of health (SDOH) from the clinical notes of EHR. Trading off benefits and cost, we selected a pool of diverse open source LLMs with satisfactory performance. We treat each LLM's prediction as a vote and apply a mechanism of majority voting with minimal winning threshold for ensemble. We implemented an ensemble LLMs application for EHR data labeling tasks. By using the ensemble LLMs and natural language processing, we labeled MIMIC-IV ECG dataset of 623,566 ECG reports with an estimated accuracy of 98.2%. We applied the ensemble LLMs method to identify SDOH from social history sections of 1,405 EHR clinical notes, also achieving competitive performance. Our experiments show that the ensemble LLMs can outperform individual LLM even the best commercial one, and the method reduces hallucination errors. From the research, we found that (1) the ensemble LLMs method significantly reduces the time and effort required for labeling large-scale EHR data, automating the process with high accuracy and quality; (2) the method generalizes well to other text data labeling tasks, as shown by its application to SDOH identification; (3) the ensemble of a group of diverse LLMs can outperform or match the performance of the best individual LLM; and (4) the ensemble method substantially reduces hallucination errors. This approach provides a scalable and efficient solution to data-labeling challenges.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16574">How Can We Diagnose and Treat Bias in Large Language Models for Clinical Decision-Making?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Kenza Benkirane, Jackie Kay, Maria Perez-Ortiz</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have positioned them as powerful tools for clinical decision-making, with rapidly expanding applications in healthcare. However, concerns about bias remain a significant challenge in the clinical implementation of LLMs, particularly regarding gender and ethnicity. This research investigates the evaluation and mitigation of bias in LLMs applied to complex clinical cases, focusing on gender and ethnicity biases. We introduce a novel Counterfactual Patient Variations (CPV) dataset derived from the JAMA Clinical Challenge. Using this dataset, we built a framework for bias evaluation, employing both Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) and corresponding explanations. We explore prompting with eight LLMs and fine-tuning as debiasing methods. Our findings reveal that addressing social biases in LLMs requires a multidimensional approach as mitigating gender bias can occur while introducing ethnicity biases, and that gender bias in LLM embeddings varies significantly across medical specialities. We demonstrate that evaluating both MCQ response and explanation processes is crucial, as correct responses can be based on biased \textit{reasoning}. We provide a framework for evaluating LLM bias in real-world clinical cases, offer insights into the complex nature of bias in these models, and present strategies for bias mitigation.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16586">Optimizing LLMs with Direct Preferences: A Data Efficiency Perspective</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Pietro Bernardelle, Gianluca Demartini</p>
<p>Abstract: Aligning the output of Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences (e.g., by means of reinforcement learning with human feedback, or RLHF) is essential for ensuring their effectiveness in real-world scenarios. Despite significant advancements in LLM alignment techniques, the impact of different type of preference data on model performance has yet to be systematically explored. In this study, we investigate the scalability, data efficiency, and effectiveness of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) in fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs, aiming to reduce their dependency on extensive amounts of preference data, which is expensive to collect. We (1) systematically compare the performance of models fine-tuned with varying percentages of a combined preference judgement dataset to define the improvement curve of DPO and assess its effectiveness in data-constrained environments; and (2) provide insights for the development of an optimal approach for selective preference data usage. Our study reveals that increasing the amount of data used for training generally enhances and stabilizes model performance. Moreover, the use of a combination of diverse datasets significantly improves model effectiveness. Furthermore, when models are trained separately using different types of prompts, models trained with conversational prompts outperformed those trained with question answering prompts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengdi Zhang, Kai Kiat Goh, Peixin Zhang, Jun Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the success of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various fields, their potential to generate untruthful, biased and harmful responses poses significant risks, particularly in critical applications. This highlights the urgent need for systematic methods to detect and prevent such misbehavior. While existing approaches target specific issues such as harmful responses, this work introduces LLMScan, an innovative LLM monitoring technique based on causality analysis, offering a comprehensive solution. LLMScan systematically monitors the inner workings of an LLM through the lens of causal inference, operating on the premise that the LLM's `brain' behaves differently when misbehaving. By analyzing the causal contributions of the LLM's input tokens and transformer layers, LLMScan effectively detects misbehavior. Extensive experiments across various tasks and models reveal clear distinctions in the causal distributions between normal behavior and misbehavior, enabling the development of accurate, lightweight detectors for a variety of misbehavior detection tasks.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16644">CKSP: Cross-species Knowledge Sharing and Preserving for Universal Animal Activity Recognition</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Axiu Mao, Meilu Zhu, Zhaojin Guo, Zheng He, Tomas Norton, Kai Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning techniques are dominating automated animal activity recognition (AAR) tasks with wearable sensors due to their high performance on large-scale labelled data. However, current deep learning-based AAR models are trained solely on datasets of individual animal species, constraining their applicability in practice and performing poorly when training data are limited. In this study, we propose a one-for-many framework, dubbed Cross-species Knowledge Sharing and Preserving (CKSP), based on sensor data of diverse animal species. Given the coexistence of generic and species-specific behavioural patterns among different species, we design a Shared-Preserved Convolution (SPConv) module. This module assigns an individual low-rank convolutional layer to each species for extracting species-specific features and employs a shared full-rank convolutional layer to learn generic features, enabling the CKSP framework to learn inter-species complementarity and alleviating data limitations via increasing data diversity. Considering the training conflict arising from discrepancies in data distributions among species, we devise a Species-specific Batch Normalization (SBN) module, that involves multiple BN layers to separately fit the distributions of different species. To validate CKSP's effectiveness, experiments are performed on three public datasets from horses, sheep, and cattle, respectively. The results show that our approach remarkably boosts the classification performance compared to the baseline method (one-for-one framework) solely trained on individual-species data, with increments of 6.04%, 2.06%, and 3.66% in accuracy, and 10.33%, 3.67%, and 7.90% in F1-score for the horse, sheep, and cattle datasets, respectively. This proves the promising capabilities of our method in leveraging multi-species data to augment classification performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen Qian, Dongrui Liu, Jie Zhang, Yong Liu, Jing Shao</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring awareness of fairness and privacy in Large Language Models (LLMs) is critical. Interestingly, we discover a counter-intuitive trade-off phenomenon that enhancing an LLM's privacy awareness through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) methods significantly decreases its fairness awareness with thousands of samples. To address this issue, inspired by the information theory, we introduce a training-free method to \textbf{DEA}ctivate the fairness and privacy coupled \textbf{N}eurons (\textbf{DEAN}), which theoretically and empirically decrease the mutual information between fairness and privacy awareness. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DEAN eliminates the trade-off phenomenon and significantly improves LLMs' fairness and privacy awareness simultaneously, \eg improving Qwen-2-7B-Instruct's fairness awareness by 12.2\% and privacy awareness by 14.0\%. More crucially, DEAN remains robust and effective with limited annotated data or even when only malicious fine-tuning data is available, whereas SFT methods may fail to perform properly in such scenarios. We hope this study provides valuable insights into concurrently addressing fairness and privacy concerns in LLMs and can be integrated into comprehensive frameworks to develop more ethical and responsible AI systems.

<p>Abstract: Causal reasoning (CR) is a crucial aspect of intelligence, essential for problem-solving, decision-making, and understanding the world. While large language models (LLMs) can generate rationales for their outputs, their ability to reliably perform causal reasoning remains uncertain, often falling short in tasks requiring a deep understanding of causality. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of research aimed at enhancing LLMs for causal reasoning. We categorize existing methods based on the role of LLMs: either as reasoning engines or as helpers providing knowledge or data to traditional CR methods, followed by a detailed discussion of the methodologies in each category. We then evaluate the performance of LLMs on various causal reasoning tasks, providing key findings and in-depth analysis. Finally, we provide insights from current studies and highlight promising directions for future research. We aim for this work to serve as a comprehensive resource, fostering further advancements in causal reasoning with LLMs. Resources are available at https://github.com/chendl02/Awesome-LLM-causal-reasoning.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16705">Privacy-hardened and hallucination-resistant synthetic data generation with logic-solvers</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Mark A. Burgess, Brendan Hosking, Roc Reguant, Anubhav Kaphle, Mitchell J. O'Brien, Letitia M. F. Sng, Yatish Jain, Denis C. Bauer</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine-generated data is a valuable resource for training Artificial Intelligence algorithms, evaluating rare workflows, and sharing data under stricter data legislations. The challenge is to generate data that is accurate and private. Current statistical and deep learning methods struggle with large data volumes, are prone to hallucinating scenarios incompatible with reality, and seldom quantify privacy meaningfully. Here we introduce Genomator, a logic solving approach (SAT solving), which efficiently produces private and realistic representations of the original data. We demonstrate the method on genomic data, which arguably is the most complex and private information. Synthetic genomes hold great potential for balancing underrepresented populations in medical research and advancing global data exchange. We benchmark Genomator against state-of-the-art methodologies (Markov generation, Restricted Boltzmann Machine, Generative Adversarial Network and Conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machines), demonstrating an 84-93% accuracy improvement and 95-98% higher privacy. Genomator is also 1000-1600 times more efficient, making it the only tested method that scales to whole genomes. We show the universal trade-off between privacy and accuracy, and use Genomator's tuning capability to cater to all applications along the spectrum, from provable private representations of sensitive cohorts, to datasets with indistinguishable pharmacogenomic profiles. Demonstrating the production-scale generation of tuneable synthetic data can increase trust and pave the way into the clinic.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiwei Deng, Tao Li, Yang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Curating a desirable dataset for training has been the core of building highly capable large language models (Touvron et al., 2023; Achiam et al., 2023; Team et al.,2024). Gradient influence scores (Pruthi et al., 2020; Xia et al., 2024) are shown to be correlated with model performance and are commonly used as the criterion for data selection. However, existing methods are built upon either individual sample rankings or inefficient matching process, leading to suboptimal performance or scaling up issues.In this paper, we propose Gradient Trajectory Pursuit (GTP), an algorithm that performs pursuit of gradient trajectories via jointly selecting data points under an L0-norm regularized objective. The proposed algorithm highlights: (1) joint selection instead of independent top-k selection, which automatically de-duplicates samples; (2) higher efficiency with compressive sampling processes, which can be further sped up using a distributed framework. In the experiments, we demonstrate the algorithm in both in-domain and target-domain selection benchmarks and show that it outperforms top-k selection and competitive algorithms consistently, for example, our algorithm chooses as low as 0.5% data to achieve full performance on the targeted instruction tuning tasks</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chetna Singhal, Yashuo Wu, Francesco Malandrino, Sharon Ladron de Guevara Contreras, Marco Levorato, Carla Fabiana Chiasserini</p>
<p>Abstract: Mobile systems will have to support multiple AI-based applications, each leveraging heterogeneous data sources through DNN architectures collaboratively executed within the network. To minimize the cost of the AI inference task subject to requirements on latency, quality, and - crucially - reliability of the inference process, it is vital to optimize (i) the set of sensors/data sources and (ii) the DNN architecture, (iii) the network nodes executing sections of the DNN, and (iv) the resources to use. To this end, we leverage dynamic gated neural networks with branches, and propose a novel algorithmic strategy called Quantile-constrained Inference (QIC), based upon quantile-Constrained policy optimization. QIC makes joint, high-quality, swift decisions on all the above aspects of the system, with the aim to minimize inference energy cost. We remark that this is the first contribution connecting gated dynamic DNNs with infrastructure-level decision making. We evaluate QIC using a dynamic gated DNN with stems and branches for optimal sensor fusion and inference, trained on the RADIATE dataset offering Radar, LiDAR, and Camera data, and real-world wireless measurements. Our results confirm that QIC matches the optimum and outperforms its alternatives by over 80%.</p>

<p>Abstract: This booklet on Active Assisted Living (AAL) technologies has been created as part of the GoodBrother COST Action, which has run from 2020 to 2024. COST Actions are European research programs that promote collaboration across borders, uniting researchers, professionals, and institutions to address key societal challenges. GoodBrother focused on ethical and privacy concerns surrounding video and audio monitoring in care settings. The aim was to ensure that while AAL technologies help older adults and vulnerable individuals, their privacy and data protection rights remain a top priority.
  This booklet is designed to guide you through the role that AAL technologies play in improving the quality of life for older adults, caregivers, and people with disabilities. AAL technologies offer tools for those facing cognitive or physical challenges. They can enhance independence, assist with daily routines, and promote a safer living environment. However, the rise of these technologies also brings important questions about data protection and user autonomy.
  This resource is intended for a wide audience, including end users, caregivers, healthcare professionals, and policymakers. It provides practical guidance on integrating AAL technologies into care settings while safeguarding privacy and ensuring ethical use. The insights offered here aim to empower users and caregivers to make informed choices that enhance both the quality of care and respect for personal autonomy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Panos Fitsilis, Paraskevi Tsoutsa, Vyron Damasiotis, Vasileios Kyriatzis</p>
<p>Abstract: This article analyzes around 200 online articles to identify trends within Industry 5.0 using artificial intelligence techniques. Specifically, it applies algorithms such as LDA, BERTopic, LSA, and K-means, in various configurations, to extract and compare the central themes present in the literature. The results reveal a convergence around a core set of themes while also highlighting that Industry 5.0 spans a wide range of topics. The study concludes that Industry 5.0, as an evolution of Industry 4.0, is a broad concept that lacks a clear definition, making it difficult to focus on and apply effectively. Therefore, for Industry 5.0 to be useful, it needs to be refined and more clearly defined. Furthermore, the findings demonstrate that well-known AI techniques can be effectively utilized for trend identification, particularly when the available literature is extensive and the subject matter lacks precise boundaries. This study showcases the potential of AI in extracting meaningful insights from large and diverse datasets, even in cases where the thematic structure of the domain is not clearly delineated.</p>

<p>Abstract: Navigating complex traffic environments has been significantly enhanced by advancements in intelligent technologies, enabling accurate environment perception and trajectory prediction for automated vehicles. However, existing research often neglects the consideration of the joint reasoning of scenario agents and lacks interpretability in trajectory prediction models, thereby limiting their practical application in real-world scenarios. To this purpose, an explainability-oriented trajectory prediction model is designed in this work, named Explainable Conditional Diffusion based Multimodal Trajectory Prediction Traj-Explainer, to retrieve the influencing factors of prediction and help understand the intrinsic mechanism of prediction. In Traj-Explainer, a modified conditional diffusion is well designed to capture the scenario multimodal trajectory pattern, and meanwhile, a modified Shapley Value model is assembled to rationally learn the importance of the global and scenario features. Numerical experiments are carried out by several trajectory prediction datasets, including Waymo, NGSIM, HighD, and MoCAD datasets. Furthermore, we evaluate the identified input factors which indicates that they are in agreement with the human driving experience, indicating the capability of the proposed model in appropriately learning the prediction.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muzhi Li, Cehao Yang, Chengjin Xu, Zixing Song, Xuhui Jiang, Jian Guo, Ho-fung Leung, Irwin King</p>
<p>Abstract: Inductive knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to predict missing triples with unseen entities. Recent works focus on modeling reasoning paths between the head and tail entity as direct supporting evidence. However, these methods depend heavily on the existence and quality of reasoning paths, which limits their general applicability in different scenarios. In addition, we observe that latent type constraints and neighboring facts inherent in KGs are also vital in inferring missing triples. To effectively utilize all useful information in KGs, we introduce CATS, a novel context-aware inductive KGC solution. With sufficient guidance from proper prompts and supervised fine-tuning, CATS activates the strong semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities of large language models to assess the existence of query triples, which consist of two modules. First, the type-aware reasoning module evaluates whether the candidate entity matches the latent entity type as required by the query relation. Then, the subgraph reasoning module selects relevant reasoning paths and neighboring facts, and evaluates their correlation to the query triple. Experiment results on three widely used datasets demonstrate that CATS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in 16 out of 18 transductive, inductive, and few-shot settings with an average absolute MRR improvement of 7.2%.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16822">Can Large Language Models Act as Ensembler for Multi-GNNs?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanqi Duan, Yao Cheng, Jianxiang Yu, Xiang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful models for learning from graph-structured data. However, GNNs lack the inherent semantic understanding capability of rich textual nodesattributes, limiting their effectiveness in applications. On the other hand, we empirically observe that for existing GNN models, no one can consistently outperforms others across diverse datasets. In this paper, we study whether LLMs can act as an ensembler for multi-GNNs and propose the LensGNN model. The model first aligns multiple GNNs, mapping the representations of different GNNs into the same space. Then, through LoRA fine-tuning, it aligns the space between the GNN and the LLM, injecting graph tokens and textual information into LLMs. This allows LensGNN to integrate multiple GNNs and leverage LLM's strengths, resulting in better performance. Experimental results show that LensGNN outperforms existing models. This research advances text-attributed graph ensemble learning by providing a robust, superior solution for integrating semantic and structural information.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16882">Large Language Model-based Augmentation for Imbalanced Node Classification on Text-Attributed Graphs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Leyao Wang, Yu Wang, Bo Ni, Yuying Zhao, Tyler Derr</p>
<p>Abstract: Node classification on graphs frequently encounters the challenge of class imbalance, leading to biased performance and posing significant risks in real-world applications. Although several data-centric solutions have been proposed, none of them focus on Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs), and therefore overlook the potential of leveraging the rich semantics encoded in textual features for boosting the classification of minority nodes. Given this crucial gap, we investigate the possibility of augmenting graph data in the text space, leveraging the textual generation power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to handle imbalanced node classification on TAGs. Specifically, we propose a novel approach called LA-TAG (LLM-based Augmentation on Text-Attributed Graphs), which prompts LLMs to generate synthetic texts based on existing node texts in the graph. Furthermore, to integrate these synthetic text-attributed nodes into the graph, we introduce a text-based link predictor to connect the synthesized nodes with the existing nodes. Our experiments across multiple datasets and evaluation metrics show that our framework significantly outperforms traditional non-textual-based data augmentation strategies and specific node imbalance solutions. This highlights the promise of using LLMs to resolve imbalance issues on TAGs.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present a novel approach to personalized sleep health management using few-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) distillation, enabling small-scale language models (> 2B parameters) to rival the performance of large language models (LLMs) in specialized health domains. Our method simultaneously distills problem-solving strategies, long-tail expert knowledge, and personalized recommendation capabilities from larger models into more efficient, compact models. Unlike existing systems, our approach offers three key functionalities: generating personalized sleep health recommendations, supporting user-specific follow-up inquiries, and providing responses to domain-specific knowledge questions. We focus on sleep health due to its measurability via wearable devices and its impact on overall well-being. Our experimental setup, involving GPT-4o for data synthesis, Qwen-max for instruction set creation, and Qwen2.5 1.5B for model distillation, demonstrates significant improvements over baseline small-scale models in penalization, reasoning, and knowledge application. Experiments using 100 simulated sleep reports and 1,000 domain-specific questions shows our model achieves comparable performance to larger models while maintaining efficiency for real-world deployment. This research not only advances AI-driven health management but also provides a novel approach to leveraging LLM capabilities in resource-constrained environments, potentially enhancing the accessibility of personalized healthcare solutions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Django Beatty, Kritsada Masanthia, Teepakorn Kaphol, Niphan Sethi</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become integral to recruitment processes, concerns about AI-induced bias have intensified. This study examines biases in candidate interview reports generated by Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5, and Llama 3.1 405B, focusing on characteristics such as gender, race, and age. We evaluate the effectiveness of LLM-based anonymization in reducing these biases. Findings indicate that while anonymization reduces certain biases, particularly gender bias, the degree of effectiveness varies across models and bias types. Notably, Llama 3.1 405B exhibited the lowest overall bias. Moreover, our methodology of comparing anonymized and non-anonymized data reveals a novel approach to assessing inherent biases in LLMs beyond recruitment applications. This study underscores the importance of careful LLM selection and suggests best practices for minimizing bias in AI applications, promoting fairness and inclusivity.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16983">Order Matters: Exploring Order Sensitivity in Multimodal Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhijie Tan, Xu Chu, Weiping Li, Tong Mo</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) utilize multimodal contexts consisting of text, images, or videos to solve various multimodal tasks. However, we find that changing the order of multimodal input can cause the model's performance to fluctuate between advanced performance and random guessing. This phenomenon exists in both single-modality (text-only or image-only) and mixed-modality (image-text-pair) contexts. Furthermore, we demonstrate that popular MLLMs pay special attention to certain multimodal context positions, particularly the beginning and end. Leveraging this special attention, we place key video frames and important image/text content in special positions within the context and submit them to the MLLM for inference. This method results in average performance gains of 14.7% for video-caption matching and 17.8% for visual question answering tasks. Additionally, we propose a new metric, Position-Invariant Accuracy (PIA), to address order bias in MLLM evaluation. Our research findings contribute to a better understanding of Multi-Modal In-Context Learning (MMICL) and provide practical strategies for enhancing MLLM performance without increasing computational costs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tony Haoran Feng (University of Auckland), Paul Denny (University of Auckland), Burkhard C. W\"unsche (University of Auckland), Andrew Luxton-Reilly (University of Auckland), Jacqueline Whalley (Auckland University of Technology)</p>
<p>Abstract: CG (Computer Graphics) is a popular field of CS (Computer Science), but many students find this topic difficult due to it requiring a large number of skills, such as mathematics, programming, geometric reasoning, and creativity. Over the past few years, researchers have investigated ways to harness the power of GenAI (Generative Artificial Intelligence) to improve teaching. In CS, much of the research has focused on introductory computing. A recent study evaluating the performance of an LLM (Large Language Model), GPT-4 (text-only), on CG questions, indicated poor performance and reliance on detailed descriptions of image content, which often required considerable insight from the user to return reasonable results. So far, no studies have investigated the abilities of LMMs (Large Multimodal Models), or multimodal LLMs, to solve CG questions and how these abilities can be used to improve teaching.
  In this study, we construct two datasets of CG questions requiring varying degrees of visual perception skills and geometric reasoning skills, and evaluate the current state-of-the-art LMM, GPT-4o, on the two datasets. We find that although GPT-4o exhibits great potential in solving questions with visual information independently, major limitations still exist to the accuracy and quality of the generated results. We propose several novel approaches for CG educators to incorporate GenAI into CG teaching despite these limitations. We hope that our guidelines further encourage learning and engagement in CG classrooms.</p>

With a series of experimental studies highlighting validation and discovery cases, we show that GEMCODE is effective even under realistic computational constraints. Furthermore, we explore the potential of language models in generating co-crystals.

<p>Abstract: AI systems crucially rely on human ratings, but these ratings are often aggregated, obscuring the inherent diversity of perspectives in real-world phenomenon. This is particularly concerning when evaluating the safety of generative AI, where perceptions and associated harms can vary significantly across socio-cultural contexts. While recent research has studied the impact of demographic differences on annotating text, there is limited understanding of how these subjective variations affect multimodal safety in generative AI. To address this, we conduct a large-scale study employing highly-parallel safety ratings of about 1000 text-to-image (T2I) generations from a demographically diverse rater pool of 630 raters balanced across 30 intersectional groups across age, gender, and ethnicity. Our study shows that (1) there are significant differences across demographic groups (including intersectional groups) on how severe they assess the harm to be, and that these differences vary across different types of safety violations, (2) the diverse rater pool captures annotation patterns that are substantially different from expert raters trained on specific set of safety policies, and (3) the differences we observe in T2I safety are distinct from previously documented group level differences in text-based safety tasks. To further understand these varying perspectives, we conduct a qualitative analysis of the open-ended explanations provided by raters. This analysis reveals core differences into the reasons why different groups perceive harms in T2I generations. Our findings underscore the critical need for incorporating diverse perspectives into safety evaluation of generative AI ensuring these systems are truly inclusive and reflect the values of all users.</p>

In this paper, we introduce a novel approach called Deep Heuristic Search (DHS), which models metaheuristic search as a memory-driven process. DHS employs multiple search layers and memory-based exploration-exploitation mechanisms to navigate large, dynamic search spaces. By utilizing model-free memory representations, DHS enhances the ability to traverse temporal trajectories without relying on probabilistic transition models. The proposed method demonstrates significant improvements in search efficiency and performance across a range of heuristic optimization problems.</p>

<p>Abstract: One of today's most significant and transformative technologies is the rapidly developing field of artificial intelligence (AI). Deined as a computer system that simulates human cognitive processes, AI is present in many aspects of our daily lives, from the self-driving cars on the road to the intelligence (AI) because some AI systems are so complex and opaque. With millions of parameters and layers, these system-deep neural networks in particular-make it difficult for humans to comprehend accountability, prejudice, and justice are raised by the opaqueness of its decision-making process. AI has a lot of potential, but it also comes with a lot of difficulties and moral dilemmas. In the context of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), trust is crucial as it ensures that AI systems behave consistently, fairly, and ethically. In the present article, we explore XAI, reliable XAI, and several practical uses for reliable XAI. Once more, we go over the three main components-transparency, explainability, and trustworthiness of XAI-that we determined are pertinent in this situation. We present an overview of recent scientific studies that employ trustworthy XAI in various application fields. In the end, trustworthiness is crucial for establishing and maintaining trust between humans and AI systems, facilitating the integration of AI systems into various applications and domains for the benefit of society.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yasha Ektefaie, Olivia Viessmann, Siddharth Narayanan, Drew Dresser, J. Mark Kim, Armen Mkrtchyan</p>
<p>Abstract: Protein inverse folding-that is, predicting an amino acid sequence that will fold into the desired 3D structure-is an important problem for structure-based protein design. Machine learning based methods for inverse folding typically use recovery of the original sequence as the optimization objective. However, inverse folding is a one-to-many problem where several sequences can fold to the same structure. Moreover, for many practical applications, it is often desirable to have multiple, diverse sequences that fold into the target structure since it allows for more candidate sequences for downstream optimizations. Here, we demonstrate that although recent inverse folding methods show increased sequence recovery, their "foldable diversity"-i.e. their ability to generate multiple non-similar sequences that fold into the structures consistent with the target-does not increase. To address this, we present RL-DIF, a categorical diffusion model for inverse folding that is pre-trained on sequence recovery and tuned via reinforcement learning on structural consistency. We find that RL-DIF achieves comparable sequence recovery and structural consistency to benchmark models but shows greater foldable diversity: experiments show RL-DIF can achieve an foldable diversity of 29% on CATH 4.2, compared to 23% from models trained on the same dataset. The PyTorch model weights and sampling code are available on GitHub.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chang Ma, Haiteng Zhao, Junlei Zhang, Junxian He, Lingpeng Kong</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated remarkable abilities in reasoning and planning by breaking down complex problems into sequential steps. Despite their success in various domains like mathematical problem-solving and coding, LLMs face challenges in ensuring reliable and optimal planning due to their inherent myopic nature of autoregressive decoding. This paper revisits LLM reasoning from an optimal-control perspective, proposing a novel method, Predictive-Decoding, that leverages Model Predictive Control to enhance planning accuracy. By re-weighting LLM distributions based on foresight trajectories, Predictive-Decoding aims to mitigate early errors and promote non-myopic planning. Our experiments show significant improvements in a wide range of tasks for math, coding, and agents. Furthermore, Predictive-Decoding demonstrates computational efficiency, outperforming search baselines with reduced computational resources. This study provides insights into optimizing LLM planning capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mete Ismayilzada, Debjit Paul, Antoine Bosselut, Lonneke van der Plas</p>
<p>Abstract: Creativity is the ability to produce novel, useful, and surprising ideas, and has been widely studied as a crucial aspect of human cognition. Machine creativity on the other hand has been a long-standing challenge. With the rise of advanced generative AI, there has been renewed interest and debate regarding AI's creative capabilities. Therefore, it is imperative to revisit the state of creativity in AI and identify key progresses and remaining challenges. In this work, we survey leading works studying the creative capabilities of AI systems, focusing on creative problem-solving, linguistic, artistic, and scientific creativity. Our review suggests that while the latest AI models are largely capable of producing linguistically and artistically creative outputs such as poems, images, and musical pieces, they struggle with tasks that require creative problem-solving, abstract thinking and compositionality and their generations suffer from a lack of diversity, originality, long-range incoherence and hallucinations. We also discuss key questions concerning copyright and authorship issues with generative models. Furthermore, we highlight the need for a comprehensive evaluation of creativity that is process-driven and considers several dimensions of creativity. Finally, we propose future research directions to improve the creativity of AI outputs, drawing inspiration from cognitive science and psychology.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Timothy Parker, Umberto Grandi, Emiliano Lorini</p>
<p>Abstract: Responsibility is a key notion in multi-agent systems and in creating safe, reliable and ethical AI. However, most previous work on responsibility has only considered responsibility for single outcomes. In this paper we present a model for responsibility attribution in a multi-agent, multi-value setting. We also expand our model to cover responsibility anticipation, demonstrating how considerations of responsibility can help an agent to select strategies that are in line with its values. In particular we show that non-dominated regret-minimising strategies reliably minimise an agent's expected degree of responsibility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chao Yu, Hong Lu, Jiaxuan Gao, Qixin Tan, Xinting Yang, Yu Wang, Yi Wu, Eugene Vinitsky</p>
<p>Abstract: Designing reward functions is a core component of reinforcement learning but can be challenging for truly complex behavior. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has been used to alleviate this challenge by replacing a hand-coded reward function with a reward function learned from preferences. However, it can be exceedingly inefficient to learn these rewards as they are often learned tabula rasa. We investigate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can reduce this query inefficiency by converting an iterative series of human preferences into code representing the rewards. We propose In-Context Preference Learning (ICPL), a method that uses the grounding of an LLM to accelerate learning reward functions from preferences. ICPL takes the environment context and task description, synthesizes a set of reward functions, and then repeatedly updates the reward functions using human rankings of videos of the resultant policies. Using synthetic preferences, we demonstrate that ICPL is orders of magnitude more efficient than RLHF and is even competitive with methods that use ground-truth reward functions instead of preferences. Finally, we perform a series of human preference-learning trials and observe that ICPL extends beyond synthetic settings and can work effectively with humans-in-the-loop.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yizhou Chi, Yizhang Lin, Sirui Hong, Duyi Pan, Yaying Fei, Guanghao Mei, Bangbang Liu, Tianqi Pang, Jacky Kwok, Ceyao Zhang, Bang Liu, Chenglin Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) approaches encompass traditional methods that optimize fixed pipelines for model selection and ensembling, as well as newer LLM-based frameworks that autonomously build pipelines. While LLM-based agents have shown promise in automating machine learning tasks, they often generate low-diversity and suboptimal code, even after multiple iterations. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Tree-Search Enhanced LLM Agents (SELA), an innovative agent-based system that leverages Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to optimize the AutoML process. By representing pipeline configurations as trees, our framework enables agents to conduct experiments intelligently and iteratively refine their strategies, facilitating a more effective exploration of the machine learning solution space. This novel approach allows SELA to discover optimal pathways based on experimental feedback, improving the overall quality of the solutions. In an extensive evaluation across 20 machine learning datasets, we compare the performance of traditional and agent-based AutoML methods, demonstrating that SELA achieves a win rate of 65% to 80% against each baseline across all datasets. These results underscore the significant potential of agent-based strategies in AutoML, offering a fresh perspective on tackling complex machine learning challenges.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Itamar Pres, Laura Ruis, Ekdeep Singh Lubana, David Krueger</p>
<p>Abstract: Representation engineering methods have recently shown promise for enabling efficient steering of model behavior. However, evaluation pipelines for these methods have primarily relied on subjective demonstrations, instead of quantitative, objective metrics. We aim to take a step towards addressing this issue by advocating for four properties missing from current evaluations: (i) contexts sufficiently similar to downstream tasks should be used for assessing intervention quality; (ii) model likelihoods should be accounted for; (iii) evaluations should allow for standardized comparisons across different target behaviors; and (iv) baseline comparisons should be offered. We introduce an evaluation pipeline grounded in these criteria, offering both a quantitative and visual analysis of how effectively a given method works. We use this pipeline to evaluate two representation engineering methods on how effectively they can steer behaviors such as truthfulness and corrigibility, finding that some interventions are less effective than previously reported.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> V\'it R\r{u}\v{z}i\v{c}ka, Andrew Markham</p>
<p>Abstract: On-board processing of hyperspectral data with machine learning models would enable unprecedented amount of autonomy for a wide range of tasks, for example methane detection or mineral identification. Methane is the second most important greenhouse gas contributor to climate change, and it's automated detection on-board of satellites using machine learning models would allow for early warning system and could enable new capabilities such as automated scheduling inside constellations of satellites. Classical methods for methane detection suffer from high false positive rates and previous deep learning models exhibit prohibitive computational requirements. We propose fast and accurate machine learning architectures which support end-to-end training with data of high spectral dimension. We evaluate our models on two tasks related to hyperspectral data processing - methane leak detection and mineral identification. With our proposed general architectures, we improve the F1 score of the previous methane detection state-of-the-art models by more than 27% on a newly created synthetic dataset and by almost 13% on the previously released large benchmark dataset. We also demonstrate that training models on the synthetic dataset improves performance of models finetuned on the dataset of real events by 6.9% in F1 score in contrast with training from scratch. On a newly created dataset for mineral identification, our models provide 3.5% improvement in the F1 score in contrast to the default versions of the models. With our proposed models we improve the inference speed by 85.19% in contrast to previous classical and deep learning approaches by removing the dependency on classically computed features. Namely, one capture from the EMIT sensor can be processed in only 30 seconds on a realistic proxy hardware used on the ION-SCV 004 satellite.</p>

<p>Abstract: Machine translation (MT) in the medical domain plays a pivotal role in enhancing healthcare quality and disseminating medical knowledge. Despite advancements in English-Thai MT technology, common MT approaches often underperform in the medical field due to their inability to precisely translate medical terminologies. Our research prioritizes not merely improving translation accuracy but also maintaining medical terminology in English within the translated text through code-switched (CS) translation. We developed a method to produce CS medical translation data, fine-tuned a CS translation model with this data, and evaluated its performance against strong baselines, such as Google Neural Machine Translation (NMT) and GPT-3.5/GPT-4. Our model demonstrated competitive performance in automatic metrics and was highly favored in human preference evaluations. Our evaluation result also shows that medical professionals significantly prefer CS translations that maintain critical English terms accurately, even if it slightly compromises fluency.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Duncan Eddy, Michelle Ho, Mykel J. Kochenderfer</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a solution to the problem of optimal ground station selection for low-Earth orbiting (LEO) space missions that enables mission operators to precisely design their ground segment performance and costs. Space mission operators are increasingly turning to Ground-Station-as-a-Service (GSaaS) providers to supply the terrestrial communications segment to reduce costs and increase network size. However, this approach leads to a new challenge of selecting the optimal service providers and station locations for a given mission. We consider the problem of ground station selection as an optimization problem and present a general solution framework that allows mission designers to set their overall optimization objective and constrain key mission performance variables such as total data downlink, total mission cost, recurring operational cost, and maximum communications time-gap. We solve the problem using integer programming (IP). To address computational scaling challenges, we introduce a surrogate optimization approach where the optimal station selection is determined based on solving the problem over a reduced time domain. Two different IP formulations are evaluated using randomized selections of LEO satellites of varying constellation sizes. We consider the networks of the commercial GSaaS providers Atlas Space Operations, Amazon Web Services (AWS) Ground Station, Azure Orbital Ground Station, Kongsberg Satellite Services (KSAT), Leaf Space, and Viasat Real-Time Earth. We compare our results against standard operational practices of integrating with one or two primary ground station providers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daking Rai, Rydia R. Weiland, Kayla Margaret Gabriella Herrera, Tyler H. Shaw, Ziyu Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: Explaining the decisions of AI has become vital for fostering appropriate user trust in these systems. This paper investigates explanations for a structured prediction task called ``text-to-SQL Semantic Parsing'', which translates a natural language question into a structured query language (SQL) program. In this task setting, we designed three levels of model explanation, each exposing a different amount of the model's decision-making details (called ``algorithm transparency''), and investigated how different model explanations could potentially yield different impacts on the user experience. Our study with $\sim$100 participants shows that (1) the low-/high-transparency explanations often lead to less/more user reliance on the model decisions, whereas the medium-transparency explanations strike a good balance. We also show that (2) only the medium-transparency participant group was able to engage further in the interaction and exhibit increasing performance over time, and that (3) they showed the least changes in trust before and after the study.</p>

<p>Abstract: The current paper presents the development and validation of SelfScore, a novel benchmark designed to assess the performance of automated Large Language Model (LLM) agents on help desk and professional consultation tasks. Given the increasing integration of AI in industries, particularly within customer service, SelfScore fills a crucial gap by enabling the comparison of automated agents and human workers. The benchmark evaluates agents on problem complexity and response helpfulness, ensuring transparency and simplicity in its scoring system. The study also develops automated LLM agents to assess SelfScore and explores the benefits of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for domain-specific tasks, demonstrating that automated LLM agents incorporating RAG outperform those without. All automated LLM agents were observed to perform better than the human control group. Given these results, the study raises concerns about the potential displacement of human workers, especially in areas where AI technologies excel. Ultimately, SelfScore provides a foundational tool for understanding the impact of AI in help desk environments while advocating for ethical considerations in the ongoing transition towards automation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> \'Alvaro Barbero Jim\'enez</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models have shown prominent capabilities in generating functional code from natural language descriptions. However, a standardized way to evaluate these capabilities in an objective and unbiased manner is still to be found. In this paper we review the current evaluation methods available to this end, and run a new evaluation of the performance of one state-of-the-art model (GPT4-o-mini) in solving curated coding challenges in 8 programming languages, obtained from Codewars, a software development community. Our analysis shows that the chance of success of the model has a positive correlation with the task difficulty, the popularity of the programming language being used and the time elapsed since the publication of the challenge. A further approximate explanatory analysis in terms of high-level features hints that while 46.6% of the model performance could be attributed to task difficulty, a 37.4% seems to be related to leakage of the challenge solutions into the model training set, while the remaining 16% depends on the programming language. These results suggest that current evaluation methodologies might be overestimating the actual skill of Large Language Models for generating functional code.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zijian Wang, Xingzhou Zhang, Yifan Wang, Xiaohui Peng, Zhiwei Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Non-intrusive Appliance Load Monitoring (NALM) aims to recognize individual appliance usage from the main meter without indoor sensors. However, existing systems struggle to balance dataset construction efficiency and event/state recognition accuracy, especially for low-power appliance recognition. This paper introduces Hawk, an efficient and accurate NALM system that operates in two stages: dataset construction and event recognition. In the data construction stage, we efficiently collect a balanced and diverse dataset, HawkDATA, based on balanced Gray code and enable automatic data annotations via a sampling synchronization strategy called shared perceptible time. During the event recognition stage, our algorithm integrates steady-state differential pre-processing and voting-based post-processing for accurate event recognition from the aggregate current. Experimental results show that HawkDATA takes only 1/71.5 of the collection time to collect 6.34x more appliance state combinations than the baseline. In HawkDATA and a widely used dataset, Hawk achieves an average F1 score of 93.94% for state recognition and 97.07% for event recognition, which is a 47. 98% and 11. 57% increase over SOTA algorithms. Furthermore, selected appliance subsets and the model trained from HawkDATA are deployed in two real-world scenarios with many unknown background appliances. The average F1 scores of event recognition are 96.02% and 94.76%. Hawk's source code and HawkDATA are accessible at https://github.com/WZiJ/SenSys24-Hawk.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenyu Wang, Yi Xu, Dequan Wang, Lingfeng Zhou, Yiqi Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent wave of artificial intelligence, epitomized by large language models (LLMs), has presented opportunities and challenges for methodological innovation in political science, sparking discussions on a potential paradigm shift in the social sciences. However, how can we understand the impact of LLMs on knowledge production and paradigm transformation in the social sciences from a comprehensive perspective that integrates technology and methodology? What are LLMs' specific applications and representative innovative methods in political science research? These questions, particularly from a practical methodological standpoint, remain underexplored. This paper proposes the "Intelligent Computing Social Modeling" (ICSM) method to address these issues by clarifying the critical mechanisms of LLMs. ICSM leverages the strengths of LLMs in idea synthesis and action simulation, advancing intellectual exploration in political science through "simulated social construction" and "simulation validation." By simulating the U.S. presidential election, this study empirically demonstrates the operational pathways and methodological advantages of ICSM. By integrating traditional social science paradigms, ICSM not only enhances the quantitative paradigm's capability to apply big data to assess the impact of factors but also provides qualitative paradigms with evidence for social mechanism discovery at the individual level, offering a powerful tool that balances interpretability and predictability in social science research. The findings suggest that LLMs will drive methodological innovation in political science through integration and improvement rather than direct substitution.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in automatically generating and optimizing (meta)heuristics, making them valuable tools in heuristic optimization tasks. However, LLMs are generally inefficient when it comes to fine-tuning hyper-parameters of the generated algorithms, often requiring excessive queries that lead to high computational and financial costs. This paper presents a novel hybrid approach, LLaMEA-HPO, which integrates the open source LLaMEA (Large Language Model Evolutionary Algorithm) framework with a Hyper-Parameter Optimization (HPO) procedure in the loop. By offloading hyper-parameter tuning to an HPO procedure, the LLaMEA-HPO framework allows the LLM to focus on generating novel algorithmic structures, reducing the number of required LLM queries and improving the overall efficiency of the optimization process.
  We empirically validate the proposed hybrid framework on benchmark problems, including Online Bin Packing, Black-Box Optimization, and the Traveling Salesperson Problem. Our results demonstrate that LLaMEA-HPO achieves superior or comparable performance compared to existing LLM-driven frameworks while significantly reducing computational costs. This work highlights the importance of separating algorithmic innovation and structural code search from parameter tuning in LLM-driven code optimization and offers a scalable approach to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of LLM-based code generation.</p>

<p>Abstract: As Face Recognition (FR) technology becomes increasingly prevalent in finance, the military, public safety, and everyday life, security concerns have grown substantially. Physical adversarial attacks targeting FR systems in real-world settings have attracted considerable research interest due to their practicality and the severe threats they pose. However, a systematic overview focused on physical adversarial attacks against FR systems is still lacking, hindering an in-depth exploration of the challenges and future directions in this field. In this paper, we bridge this gap by comprehensively collecting and analyzing physical adversarial attack methods targeting FR systems. Specifically, we first investigate the key challenges of physical attacks on FR systems. We then categorize existing physical attacks into three categories based on the physical medium used and summarize how the research in each category has evolved to address these challenges. Furthermore, we review current defense strategies and discuss potential future research directions. Our goal is to provide a fresh, comprehensive, and deep understanding of physical adversarial attacks against FR systems, thereby inspiring relevant research in this area.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Pu, Chaozhuo Li, Rui Ha, Zejian Chen, Litian Zhang, Zheng Liu, Lirong Qiu, Xi Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Jailbreak attack can be used to access the vulnerabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by inducing LLMs to generate the harmful content. And the most common method of the attack is to construct semantically ambiguous prompts to confuse and mislead the LLMs. To access the security and reveal the intrinsic relation between the input prompt and the output for LLMs, the distribution of attention weight is introduced to analyze the underlying reasons. By using statistical analysis methods, some novel metrics are defined to better describe the distribution of attention weight, such as the Attention Intensity on Sensitive Words (Attn_SensWords), the Attention-based Contextual Dependency Score (Attn_DepScore) and Attention Dispersion Entropy (Attn_Entropy). By leveraging the distinct characteristics of these metrics, the beam search algorithm and inspired by the military strategy "Feint and Attack", an effective jailbreak attack strategy named as Attention-Based Attack (ABA) is proposed. In the ABA, nested attack prompts are employed to divert the attention distribution of the LLMs. In this manner, more harmless parts of the input can be used to attract the attention of the LLMs. In addition, motivated by ABA, an effective defense strategy called as Attention-Based Defense (ABD) is also put forward. Compared with ABA, the ABD can be used to enhance the robustness of LLMs by calibrating the attention distribution of the input prompt. Some comparative experiments have been given to demonstrate the effectiveness of ABA and ABD. Therefore, both ABA and ABD can be used to access the security of the LLMs. The comparative experiment results also give a logical explanation that the distribution of attention weight can bring great influence on the output for LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> S. M. Yousuf Iqbal Tomal, Abdullah Al Shafin, Afrida Afaf, Debojit Bhattacharjee</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a hybrid quantum-classical machine learning model for classification tasks, integrating a 4-qubit quantum circuit with a classical neural network. The quantum circuit is designed to encode the features of the Iris dataset using angle embedding and entangling gates, thereby capturing complex feature relationships that are difficult for classical models alone. The model, which we term a Quantum Convolutional Neural Network (QCNN), was trained over 20 epochs, achieving a perfect 100% accuracy on the Iris dataset test set on 16 epoch. Our results demonstrate the potential of quantum-enhanced models in supervised learning tasks, particularly in efficiently encoding and processing data using quantum resources. We detail the quantum circuit design, parameterized gate selection, and the integration of the quantum layer with classical neural network components. This work contributes to the growing body of research on hybrid quantum-classical models and their applicability to real-world datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Paxson Swierc, Marcos Tamargo-Arizmendi, Aleksandra \'Ciprijanovi\'c, Brian D. Nord</p>
<p>Abstract: Modeling strong gravitational lenses is prohibitively expensive for modern and next-generation cosmic survey data. Neural posterior estimation (NPE), a simulation-based inference (SBI) approach, has been studied as an avenue for efficient analysis of strong lensing data. However, NPE has not been demonstrated to perform well on out-of-domain target data -- e.g., when trained on simulated data and then applied to real, observational data. In this work, we perform the first study of the efficacy of NPE in combination with unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). The source domain is noiseless, and the target domain has noise mimicking modern cosmology surveys. We find that combining UDA and NPE improves the accuracy of the inference by 1-2 orders of magnitude and significantly improves the posterior coverage over an NPE model without UDA. We anticipate that this combination of approaches will help enable future applications of NPE models to real observational data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Noam Levi</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural scaling laws have garnered significant interest due to their ability to predict model performance as a function of increasing parameters, data, and compute. In this work, we propose a simple statistical ansatz based on memorization to study scaling laws in the context of inference, specifically how performance improves with multiple inference attempts. We explore the coverage, or pass@k metric, which measures the chance of success over repeated attempts and provide a motivation for the observed functional form of the inference scaling behavior of the coverage in large language models (LLMs) on reasoning tasks. We then define an "inference loss", which exhibits a power law decay as the number of trials increases, and connect this result with prompting costs. We further test our construction by conducting experiments on a simple generative model, and find that our predictions are in agreement with the empirical coverage curves in a controlled setting. Our simple framework sets the ground for incorporating inference scaling with other known scaling laws.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Asifuzzaman Jishan, Vikas Singh, Ayan Kumar Ghosh, Md Shahabub Alam, Khan Raqib Mahmud, Bijan Paul</p>
<p>Abstract: This study applies Bayesian models to predict hotel booking cancellations, a key challenge affecting resource allocation, revenue, and customer satisfaction in the hospitality industry. Using a Kaggle dataset with 36,285 observations and 17 features, Bayesian Logistic Regression and Beta-Binomial models were implemented. The logistic model, applied to 12 features and 5,000 randomly selected observations, outperformed the Beta-Binomial model in predictive accuracy. Key predictors included the number of adults, children, stay duration, lead time, car parking space, room type, and special requests. Model evaluation using Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOO-CV) confirmed strong alignment between observed and predicted outcomes, demonstrating the model's robustness. Special requests and parking availability were found to be the strongest predictors of cancellation. This Bayesian approach provides a valuable tool for improving booking management and operational efficiency in the hotel industry.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaoyuan Deng, Amith Ananthram, Kathleen McKeown</p>
<p>Abstract: Live comments, also known as Danmaku, are user-generated messages that are synchronized with video content. These comments overlay directly onto streaming videos, capturing viewer emotions and reactions in real-time. While prior work has leveraged live comments in affective analysis, its use has been limited due to the relative rarity of live comments across different video platforms. To address this, we first construct the Live Comment for Affective Analysis (LCAffect) dataset which contains live comments for English and Chinese videos spanning diverse genres that elicit a wide spectrum of emotions. Then, using this dataset, we use contrastive learning to train a video encoder to produce synthetic live comment features for enhanced multimodal affective content analysis. Through comprehensive experimentation on a wide range of affective analysis tasks (sentiment, emotion recognition, and sarcasm detection) in both English and Chinese, we demonstrate that these synthetic live comment features significantly improve performance over state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Modelling partial differential equations (PDEs) is of crucial importance in science and engineering, and it includes tasks ranging from forecasting to inverse problems, such as data assimilation. However, most previous numerical and machine learning approaches that target forecasting cannot be applied out-of-the-box for data assimilation. Recently, diffusion models have emerged as a powerful tool for conditional generation, being able to flexibly incorporate observations without retraining. In this work, we perform a comparative study of score-based diffusion models for forecasting and assimilation of sparse observations. In particular, we focus on diffusion models that are either trained in a conditional manner, or conditioned after unconditional training. We address the shortcomings of existing models by proposing 1) an autoregressive sampling approach that significantly improves performance in forecasting, 2) a new training strategy for conditional score-based models that achieves stable performance over a range of history lengths, and 3) a hybrid model which employs flexible pre-training conditioning on initial conditions and flexible post-training conditioning to handle data assimilation. We empirically show that these modifications are crucial for successfully tackling the combination of forecasting and data assimilation, a task commonly encountered in real-world scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this article, we seek to elucidate challenges and opportunities for differential privacy within the federal government setting, as seen by a team of differential privacy researchers, privacy lawyers, and data scientists working closely with the U.S. government. After introducing differential privacy, we highlight three significant challenges which currently restrict the use of differential privacy in the U.S. government. We then provide two examples where differential privacy can enhance the capabilities of government agencies. The first example highlights how the quantitative nature of differential privacy allows policy security officers to release multiple versions of analyses with different levels of privacy. The second example, which we believe is a novel realization, indicates that differential privacy can be used to improve staffing efficiency in classified applications. We hope that this article can serve as a nontechnical resource which can help frame future action from the differential privacy community, privacy regulators, security officers, and lawmakers.</p>

<p>Abstract: Machine-assisted theorem proving refers to the process of conducting structured reasoning to automatically generate proofs for mathematical theorems. Recently, there has been a surge of interest in using machine learning models in conjunction with proof assistants to perform this task. In this paper, we introduce Pantograph, a tool that provides a versatile interface to the Lean 4 proof assistant and enables efficient proof search via powerful search algorithms such as Monte Carlo Tree Search. In addition, Pantograph enables high-level reasoning by enabling a more robust handling of Lean 4's inference steps. We provide an overview of Pantograph's architecture and features. We also report on an illustrative use case: using machine learning models and proof sketches to prove Lean 4 theorems. Pantograph's innovative features pave the way for more advanced machine learning models to perform complex proof searches and high-level reasoning, equipping future researchers to design more versatile and powerful theorem provers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiwei Zhang, Fali Wang, Xiaomin Li, Zongyu Wu, Xianfeng Tang, Hui Liu, Qi He, Wenpeng Yin, Suhang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable proficiency in generating text, benefiting from extensive training on vast textual corpora. However, LLMs may also acquire unwanted behaviors from the diverse and sensitive nature of their training data, which can include copyrighted and private content. Machine unlearning has been introduced as a viable solution to remove the influence of such problematic content without the need for costly and time-consuming retraining. This process aims to erase specific knowledge from LLMs while preserving as much model utility as possible. Despite the effectiveness of current unlearning methods, little attention has been given to whether existing unlearning methods for LLMs truly achieve forgetting or merely hide the knowledge, which current unlearning benchmarks fail to detect. This paper reveals that applying quantization to models that have undergone unlearning can restore the "forgotten" information. To thoroughly evaluate this phenomenon, we conduct comprehensive experiments using various quantization techniques across multiple precision levels. We find that for unlearning methods with utility constraints, the unlearned model retains an average of 21\% of the intended forgotten knowledge in full precision, which significantly increases to 83\% after 4-bit quantization. Based on our empirical findings, we provide a theoretical explanation for the observed phenomenon and propose a quantization-robust unlearning strategy to mitigate this intricate issue...</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dong-Ho Lee, Adam Kraft, Long Jin, Nikhil Mehta, Taibai Xu, Lichan Hong, Ed H. Chi, Xinyang Yi</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) offers promising new approaches for recommendation system (RecSys) tasks. While the current state-of-the-art methods rely on fine-tuning LLMs to achieve optimal results, this process is costly and introduces significant engineering complexities. Conversely, methods that bypass fine-tuning and use LLMs directly are less resource-intensive but often fail to fully capture both semantic and collaborative information, resulting in sub-optimal performance compared to their fine-tuned counterparts. In this paper, we propose a Simple Training-free Approach for Recommendation (STAR), a framework that utilizes LLMs and can be applied to various recommendation tasks without the need for fine-tuning. Our approach involves a retrieval stage that uses semantic embeddings from LLMs combined with collaborative user information to retrieve candidate items. We then apply an LLM for pairwise ranking to enhance next-item prediction. Experimental results on the Amazon Review dataset show competitive performance for next item prediction, even with our retrieval stage alone. Our full method achieves Hits@10 performance of +23.8% on Beauty, +37.5% on Toys and Games, and -1.8% on Sports and Outdoors relative to the best supervised models. This framework offers an effective alternative to traditional supervised models, highlighting the potential of LLMs in recommendation systems without extensive training or custom architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingdi Chen, Hanhan Zhou, Yongsheng Mei, Carlee Joe-Wong, Gina Adam, Nathaniel D. Bastian, Tian Lan</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms have achieved great success in solving many challenging tasks while their black-box nature hinders interpretability and real-world applicability, making it difficult for human experts to interpret and understand DRL policies. Existing works on interpretable reinforcement learning have shown promise in extracting decision tree (DT) based policies from DRL policies with most focus on the single-agent settings while prior attempts to introduce DT policies in multi-agent scenarios mainly focus on heuristic designs which do not provide any quantitative guarantees on the expected return. In this paper, we establish an upper bound on the return gap between the oracle expert policy and an optimal decision tree policy. This enables us to recast the DT extraction problem into a novel non-euclidean clustering problem over the local observation and action values space of each agent, with action values as cluster labels and the upper bound on the return gap as clustering loss. Both the algorithm and the upper bound are extended to multi-agent decentralized DT extractions by an iteratively-grow-DT procedure guided by an action-value function conditioned on the current DTs of other agents. Further, we propose the Return-Gap-Minimization Decision Tree (RGMDT) algorithm, which is a surprisingly simple design and is integrated with reinforcement learning through the utilization of a novel Regularized Information Maximization loss. Evaluations on tasks like D4RL show that RGMDT significantly outperforms heuristic DT-based baselines and can achieve nearly optimal returns under given DT complexity constraints (e.g., maximum number of DT nodes).</p>

<p>Abstract: As our understanding of autism and ableism continues to increase, so does our understanding of ableist language towards autistic people. Such language poses a significant challenge in NLP research due to its subtle and context-dependent nature. Yet, detecting anti-autistic ableist language remains underexplored, with existing NLP tools often failing to capture its nuanced expressions. We present AUTALIC, the first benchmark dataset dedicated to the detection of anti-autistic ableist language in context, addressing a significant gap in the field. The dataset comprises 2,400 autism-related sentences collected from Reddit, accompanied by surrounding context, and is annotated by trained experts with backgrounds in neurodiversity. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that current language models, including state-of-the-art LLMs, struggle to reliably identify anti-autistic ableism and align with human judgments, underscoring their limitations in this domain. We publicly release AUTALIC along with the individual annotations which serve as a valuable resource to researchers working on ableism, neurodiversity, and also studying disagreements in annotation tasks. This dataset serves as a crucial step towards developing more inclusive and context-aware NLP systems that better reflect diverse perspectives.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aryaman Arora, Dan Jurafsky, Christopher Potts, Noah D. Goodman</p>
<p>Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is a powerful technique for getting language models to perform complex tasks with no training updates. Prior work has established strong correlations between the number of in-context examples provided and the accuracy of the model's predictions. In this paper, we seek to explain this correlation by showing that ICL approximates a Bayesian learner. This perspective gives rise to a family of novel Bayesian scaling laws for ICL. In experiments with \mbox{GPT-2} models of different sizes, our scaling laws exceed or match existing scaling laws in accuracy while also offering interpretable terms for task priors, learning efficiency, and per-example probabilities. To illustrate the analytic power that such interpretable scaling laws provide, we report on controlled synthetic dataset experiments designed to inform real-world studies of safety alignment. In our experimental protocol, we use SFT to suppress an unwanted existing model capability and then use ICL to try to bring that capability back (many-shot jailbreaking). We then experiment on real-world instruction-tuned LLMs using capabilities benchmarks as well as a new many-shot jailbreaking dataset. In all cases, Bayesian scaling laws accurately predict the conditions under which ICL will cause the suppressed behavior to reemerge, which sheds light on the ineffectiveness of post-training at increasing LLM safety.</p>

<p>Abstract: Few-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has demonstrated strong performance in improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). While theoretical investigations have been conducted to understand CoT, the underlying transformer used in these studies isolates the CoT reasoning process into separated in-context learning steps (Stepwise ICL). In this work, we theoretically show that, compared to Stepwise ICL, the transformer gains better error correction ability and more accurate predictions if the reasoning from earlier steps (Coherent CoT) is integrated. Given that this coherent reasoning changes the behavior of the transformer, we further investigate the sensitivity of the transformer with Coherent CoT when the demonstration examples are corrupted at the inference stage. Our theoretical results indicate that the transformer is more sensitive to errors in intermediate reasoning steps than the final outcome. Building upon this observation, we propose an improvement on CoT by incorporating both correct and incorrect reasoning paths in the demonstration. Our experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p>

<p>Abstract: Involving subject matter experts in prompt engineering can guide LLM outputs toward more helpful, accurate, and tailored content that meets the diverse needs of different domains. However, iterating towards effective prompts can be challenging without adequate interface support for systematic experimentation within specific task contexts.

We conducted an evaluation study with ten subject matter experts in math and validated our design through two collaborative prompt-writing sessions and a learning gain study with 358 learners. Our results elucidate the prompt iteration process and validate the tool's usability, enabling non-AI experts to craft prompts that generate content comparable to human-authored materials while reducing perceived cognitive load by half and shortening the authoring process from several months to just a few hours.</p>

<p>Abstract: AI systems are used in many domains to assist with decision making, and although the potential for AI systems to assist with decision making is much discussed, human-AI collaboration often underperforms. Investigation into why the performance potential is not realized has revealed many factors, including (mis)trust in the AI system and mental models of AI capabilities on subjective tasks. Performance pressure is known to influence human decision making behavior, yet how it interacts with human-AI decision making is understudied. In this work, we show the effects of performance pressure on AI advice reliance when laypeople (Amazon Mechanical Turk crowdworkers) complete a common AI-assisted task (fake review detection) and thus have inherently low performance pressure. We manipulate performance pressure by leveraging people's loss aversion towards potential monetary gains when completing a task. We find that when the stakes are high, people use AI advice more appropriately than when stakes are lower, regardless of the presence of an AI explanation. Furthermore, when the AI system gives incorrect advice, people correctly discount the poor advice more often when the stakes are higher than when they are lower. We conclude by discussing the implications of how performance pressure influences AI-assisted decision making and encourage future research to incorporate performance pressure analysis.</p>

<p>Abstract: Long-horizon contact-rich manipulation has long been a challenging problem, as it requires reasoning over both discrete contact modes and continuous object motion. We introduce Implicit Contact Diffuser (ICD), a diffusion-based model that generates a sequence of neural descriptors that specify a series of contact relationships between the object and the environment. This sequence is then used as guidance for an MPC method to accomplish a given task. The key advantage of this approach is that the latent descriptors provide more task-relevant guidance to MPC, helping to avoid local minima for contact-rich manipulation tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that ICD outperforms baselines on complex, long-horizon, contact-rich manipulation tasks, such as cable routing and notebook folding. Additionally, our experiments also indicate that \methodshort can generalize a target contact relationship to a different environment.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyu Xue, Haohan Wang, Yao Qin, Ramtin Pedarsani</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial training is the most effective method to obtain adversarial robustness for deep neural networks by directly involving adversarial samples in the training procedure. To obtain an accurate and robust model, the weighted-average method is applied to optimize standard loss and adversarial loss simultaneously. In this paper, we argue that the weighted-average method does not provide the best tradeoff for the standard performance and adversarial robustness. We argue that the failure of the weighted-average method is due to the conflict between the gradients derived from standard and adversarial loss, and further demonstrate such a conflict increases with attack budget theoretically and practically. To alleviate this problem, we propose a new trade-off paradigm for adversarial training with a conflict-aware factor for the convex combination of standard and adversarial loss, named \textbf{Conflict-Aware Adversarial Training~(CA-AT)}. Comprehensive experimental results show that CA-AT consistently offers a superior trade-off between standard performance and adversarial robustness under the settings of adversarial training from scratch and parameter-efficient finetuning.</p>

To address these challenges, we propose a novel Dynamic Adaptive Rank Space Exploration (DARSE) framework for efficient and effective sentiment analysis using LLMs. DARSE consists of a coarse-grained greedy algorithm to identify the optimal rank range, a fine-grained exploration algorithm to refine rank selection, and a dynamic rank allocation method to determine the optimal rank combination for each LLM layer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DARSE significantly improves sentiment analysis accuracy, achieving a 15.1% improvement in MSE and a 4.3% improvement in accuracy compared to previous work. Our framework strikes a balance between computational efficiency and model performance, making it a promising approach for sentiment analysis with LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haolin Li, Luana Ruiz</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel in many graph machine learning tasks but face challenges when scaling to large networks. GNN transferability allows training on smaller graphs and applying the model to larger ones, but existing methods often rely on random subsampling, leading to disconnected subgraphs and reduced model expressivity. We propose a novel graph sampling algorithm that leverages feature homophily to preserve graph structure. By minimizing the trace of the data correlation matrix, our method better preserves the graph Laplacian's rank than random sampling while achieving lower complexity than spectral methods. Experiments on citation networks show improved performance in preserving graph rank and GNN transferability compared to random sampling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ian Gemp, Andreas Haupt, Luke Marris, Siqi Liu, Georgios Piliouras</p>
<p>Abstract: Expert imitation, behavioral diversity, and fairness preferences give rise to preferences in sequential decision making domains that do not decompose additively across time. We introduce the class of convex Markov games that allow general convex preferences over occupancy measures. Despite infinite time horizon and strictly higher generality than Markov games, pure strategy Nash equilibria exist under strict convexity. Furthermore, equilibria can be approximated efficiently by performing gradient descent on an upper bound of exploitability. Our experiments imitate human choices in ultimatum games, reveal novel solutions to the repeated prisoner's dilemma, and find fair solutions in a repeated asymmetric coordination game. In the prisoner's dilemma, our algorithm finds a policy profile that deviates from observed human play only slightly, yet achieves higher per-player utility while also being three orders of magnitude less exploitable.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junyu Luo, Yiyang Gu, Xiao Luo, Wei Ju, Zhiping Xiao, Yusheng Zhao, Jingyang Yuan, Ming Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation is a crucial machine learning topic, as it contains numerous applications in the real world, particularly with respect to data privacy. Existing approaches predominantly focus on Euclidean data, such as images and videos, while the exploration of non-Euclidean graph data remains scarce. Recent graph neural network (GNN) approaches can suffer from serious performance decline due to domain shift and label scarcity in source-free adaptation scenarios. In this study, we propose a novel method named Graph Diffusion-based Alignment with Jigsaw (GALA), tailored for source-free graph domain adaptation. To achieve domain alignment, GALA employs a graph diffusion model to reconstruct source-style graphs from target data. Specifically, a score-based graph diffusion model is trained using source graphs to learn the generative source styles. Then, we introduce perturbations to target graphs via a stochastic differential equation instead of sampling from a prior, followed by the reverse process to reconstruct source-style graphs. We feed the source-style graphs into an off-the-shelf GNN and introduce class-specific thresholds with curriculum learning, which can generate accurate and unbiased pseudo-labels for target graphs. Moreover, we develop a simple yet effective graph-mixing strategy named graph jigsaw to combine confident graphs and unconfident graphs, which can enhance generalization capabilities and robustness via consistency learning. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of GALA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tian-Zi Niu, Zhen-Duo Chen, Xin Luo, Xin-Shun Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Conventional approaches for video captioning leverage a variety of offline-extracted features to generate captions. Despite the availability of various offline-feature-extractors that offer diverse information from different perspectives, they have several limitations due to fixed parameters. Concretely, these extractors are solely pre-trained on image/video comprehension tasks, making them less adaptable to video caption datasets. Additionally, most of these extractors only capture features prior to the classifier of the pre-training task, ignoring a significant amount of valuable shallow information. Furthermore, employing multiple offline-features may introduce redundant information. To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end encoder-decoder-based network (EVC-MF) for video captioning, which efficiently utilizes multi-scale visual and textual features to generate video descriptions. Specifically, EVC-MF consists of three modules. Firstly, instead of relying on multiple feature extractors, we directly feed video frames into a transformer-based network to obtain multi-scale visual features and update feature extractor parameters. Secondly, we fuse the multi-scale features and input them into a masked encoder to reduce redundancy and encourage learning useful features. Finally, we utilize an enhanced transformer-based decoder, which can efficiently leverage shallow textual information, to generate video descriptions. To evaluate our proposed model, we conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate that EVC-MF yields competitive performance compared with the state-of-theart methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Previous studies on sequence-based extraction of human movement trajectories have an issue of inadequate trajectory representation. Specifically, a pair of locations may not be lined up in a sequence especially when one location includes the other geographically. In this study, we propose a graph representation that retains information on the geographic hierarchy as well as the temporal order of visited locations, and have constructed a benchmark dataset for graph-structured trajectory extraction. The experiments with our baselines have demonstrated that it is possible to accurately predict visited locations and the order among them, but it remains a challenge to predict the hierarchical relations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Iwan Williams, Tim Bayne</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper addresses the question of whether large language model-powered chatbots are capable of assertion. According to what we call the Thesis of Chatbot Assertion (TCA), chatbots are the kinds of things that can assert, and at least some of the output produced by current-generation chatbots qualifies as assertion. We provide some motivation for TCA, arguing that it ought to be taken seriously and not simply dismissed. We also review recent objections to TCA, arguing that these objections are weighty. We thus confront the following dilemma: how can we do justice to both the considerations for and against TCA? We consider two influential responses to this dilemma - the first appeals to the notion of proxy-assertion; the second appeals to fictionalism - and argue that neither is satisfactory. Instead, reflecting on the ontogenesis of assertion, we argue that we need to make space for a category of proto-assertion. We then apply the category of proto-assertion to chatbots, arguing that treating chatbots as proto-assertors provides a satisfactory resolution to the dilemma of chatbot assertion.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pai Zhu, Jacob W. Bartel, Dhruuv Agarwal, Kurt Partridge, Hyun Jin Park, Quan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose GE2E-KWS -- a generalized end-to-end training and evaluation framework for customized keyword spotting. Specifically, enrollment utterances are separated and grouped by keywords from the training batch and their embedding centroids are compared to all other test utterance embeddings to compute the loss. This simulates runtime enrollment and verification stages, and improves convergence stability and training speed by optimizing matrix operations compared to SOTA triplet loss approaches. To benchmark different models reliably, we propose an evaluation process that mimics the production environment and compute metrics that directly measure keyword matching accuracy. Trained with GE2E loss, our 419KB quantized conformer model beats a 7.5GB ASR encoder by 23.6% relative AUC, and beats a same size triplet loss model by 60.7% AUC. Our KWS models are natively streamable with low memory footprints, and designed to continuously run on-device with no retraining needed for new keywords (zero-shot).</p>

<p>Abstract: Playing two-player games using reinforcement learning and self-play can be challenging due to the complexity of two-player environments and the possible instability in the training process. We propose that a reinforcement learning algorithm can train more efficiently and achieve improved performance in a two-player game if it leverages the knowledge from the single-player version of the same game. This study examines the proposed idea in ten different Atari 2600 environments using the Atari 2600 RAM as the input state. We discuss the advantages of using transfer learning from a single-player training process over training in a two-player setting from scratch, and demonstrate our results in a few measures such as training time and average total reward. We also discuss a method of calculating RAM complexity and its relationship to performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thanh Le-Cong, Bach Le, Toby Murray</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we first show that increases in beam size of even just small-sized LLM (1B-7B parameters) require an extensive GPU resource consumption, leading to up to 80% of recurring crashes due to memory overloads in LLM-based APR. Seemingly simple solutions to reduce memory consumption are (1) to quantize LLM models, i.e., converting the weights of a LLM from high-precision values to lower-precision ones. and (2) to make beam search sequential, i.e., forwarding each beam through the model sequentially and then concatenate them back into a single model output. However, we show that these approaches still do not work via both theoretical analysis and experiments. To address this, we introduce FLAMES, a novel LLM-based APR technique that employs semantic-guided patch generation to enhance repair effectiveness and memory efficiency. Unlike conventional methods that rely on beam search, FLAMES utilizes greedy decoding to enhance memory efficiency while steering the search to more potentially good repair candidates via a semantic-guided best-first search algorithm. At each decoding step, FLAMES uses semantic feedback from test validation such as the number of passing and failing test cases to select the most promising token to explore further. Our empirical evaluation on the Defects4J and HumanEval-Java datasets shows that FLAMES not only substantially reduces memory consumption by up to 83% compared to conventional LLM-based APR, but also accelerates the repair process. Remarkably, FLAMES successfully generated 133 and 103 correct fixes for 333 and 163 bugs in the Defects4J and HumanEval-Java datasets, respectively. This suggests that FLAMES is not only more efficient but also outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, fixing at least 10 and 11 more bugs than SOTA baselines in the Defects4J and HumanEval-Java datasets, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ram Mohan Rao Kadiyala</p>
<p>Abstract: With increasing usage of generative models for text generation and widespread use of machine generated texts in various domains, being able to distinguish between human written and machine generated texts is a significant challenge. While existing models and proprietary systems focus on identifying whether given text is entirely human written or entirely machine generated, only a few systems provide insights at sentence or paragraph level at likelihood of being machine generated at a non reliable accuracy level, working well only for a set of domains and generators. This paper introduces few reliable approaches for the novel task of identifying which part of a given text is machine generated at a word level while comparing results from different approaches and methods. We present a comparison with proprietary systems , performance of our model on unseen domains' and generators' texts. The findings reveal significant improvements in detection accuracy along with comparison on other aspects of detection capabilities. Finally we discuss potential avenues for improvement and implications of our work. The proposed model is also well suited for detecting which parts of a text are machine generated in outputs of Instruct variants of many LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate diagnosis of ophthalmic diseases relies heavily on the interpretation of multimodal ophthalmic images, a process often time-consuming and expertise-dependent. Visual Question Answering (VQA) presents a potential interdisciplinary solution by merging computer vision and natural language processing to comprehend and respond to queries about medical images. This review article explores the recent advancements and future prospects of VQA in ophthalmology from both theoretical and practical perspectives, aiming to provide eye care professionals with a deeper understanding and tools for leveraging the underlying models. Additionally, we discuss the promising trend of large language models (LLM) in enhancing various components of the VQA framework to adapt to multimodal ophthalmic tasks. Despite the promising outlook, ophthalmic VQA still faces several challenges, including the scarcity of annotated multimodal image datasets, the necessity of comprehensive and unified evaluation methods, and the obstacles to achieving effective real-world applications. This article highlights these challenges and clarifies future directions for advancing ophthalmic VQA with LLMs. The development of LLM-based ophthalmic VQA systems calls for collaborative efforts between medical professionals and AI experts to overcome existing obstacles and advance the diagnosis and care of eye diseases.</p>

<p>Abstract: Augmented Reality assistance are increasingly popular for supporting users with tasks like assembly and cooking. However, current practice typically provide reactive responses initialized from user requests, lacking consideration of rich contextual and user-specific information. To address this limitation, we propose a novel AR assistance system, Satori, that models both user states and environmental contexts to deliver proactive guidance. Our system combines the Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) model with a state-of-the-art multi-modal large language model (LLM) to infer contextually appropriate guidance. The design is informed by two formative studies involving twelve experts. A sixteen within-subject study find that Satori achieves performance comparable to an designer-created Wizard-of-Oz (WoZ) system without relying on manual configurations or heuristics, thereby enhancing generalizability, reusability and opening up new possibilities for AR assistance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen Yang, Chenyang Zhao, Quanquan Gu, Dongruo Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Sequential reasoning in agent systems has been significantly advanced by large language models (LLMs), yet existing approaches face limitations. Reflection-driven reasoning relies solely on knowledge in pretrained models, limiting performance in novel scenarios, while experience-assisted reasoning often depends on external experiences and lacks clear principles for selecting representative experiences. We address these limitations by proposing CoPS (Cross-Task Experience Sharing), a generalizable algorithm that enhances sequential reasoning by cross-task experience sharing and selection. In detail, CoPS leverages agents' experiences on previous tasks, selecting distribution-matched experiences via a provable pessimism-based strategy to maximize utility while minimizing risks from distribution shifts. Extensive experimental results on benchmarks like Alfworld, Webshop, and HotPotQA demonstrate that CoPS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with superior sample efficiency suitable for resource-constrained scenarios. Theoretically, we show that the performance of our algorithm depends on both the quality of the pretrained LLM and the matching between the agent's task-dependent trial distribution and that generated by the LLM. Our work bridges the gap between existing sequential reasoning paradigms and validates the effectiveness of leveraging cross-task experiences, shedding light on the potential to improve agents' generalization and adaptability across diverse tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Yu, Yuezun Li, Xin Sun, Junyu Dong</p>
<p>Abstract: Phytoplankton are a crucial component of aquatic ecosystems, and effective monitoring of them can provide valuable insights into ocean environments and ecosystem changes. Traditional phytoplankton monitoring methods are often complex and lack timely analysis. Therefore, deep learning algorithms offer a promising approach for automated phytoplankton monitoring. However, the lack of large-scale, high-quality training samples has become a major bottleneck in advancing phytoplankton tracking. In this paper, we propose a challenging benchmark dataset, Multiple Phytoplankton Tracking (MPT), which covers diverse background information and variations in motion during observation. The dataset includes 27 species of phytoplankton and zooplankton, 14 different backgrounds to simulate diverse and complex underwater environments, and a total of 140 videos. To enable accurate real-time observation of phytoplankton, we introduce a multi-object tracking method, Deviation-Corrected Multi-Scale Feature Fusion Tracker(DSFT), which addresses issues such as focus shifts during tracking and the loss of small target information when computing frame-to-frame similarity. Specifically, we introduce an additional feature extractor to predict the residuals of the standard feature extractor's output, and compute multi-scale frame-to-frame similarity based on features from different layers of the extractor. Extensive experiments on the MPT have demonstrated the validity of the dataset and the superiority of DSFT in tracking phytoplankton, providing an effective solution for phytoplankton monitoring.</p>

We present explicit weight configurations for implementing each such graph algorithm, and we bound the errors of the constructed Transformers by the errors of the underlying algorithms. Our theoretical findings are corroborated by experiments on synthetic data. Additionally, on a real-world molecular regression task, we observe that the linear Transformer is capable of learning a more effective positional encoding than the default one based on Laplacian eigenvectors. Our work is an initial step towards elucidating the inner-workings of the Transformer for graph data.</p>

We pretrain the PLDR-LLMs of varying layer sizes with a small batch size of 32 and $\sim$8B tokens from the RefinedWeb dataset, and show that they achieve competitive performance in zero-shot and few-shot settings compared to scaled dot-product LLMs of similar model size reported in the literature.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joshua Kazdan, Rylan Schaeffer, Apratim Dey, Matthias Gerstgrasser, Rafael Rafailov, David L. Donoho, Sanmi Koyejo</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing presence of AI-generated content on the internet raises a critical question: What happens when generative machine learning models are pretrained on web-scale datasets containing data created by earlier models? Some authors prophesy $\textit{model collapse}$ under a "$\textit{replace}$" scenario: a sequence of models, the first trained with real data and each later one trained only on synthetic data from its preceding model. In this scenario, models successively degrade. Others see collapse as easily avoidable; in an "$\textit{accumulate}$' scenario, a sequence of models is trained, but each training uses all real and synthetic data generated so far. In this work, we deepen and extend the study of these contrasting scenarios. First, collapse versus avoidance of collapse is studied by comparing the replace and accumulate scenarios on each of three prominent generative modeling settings; we find the same contrast emerges in all three settings. Second, we study a compromise scenario; the available data remains the same as in the accumulate scenario -- but unlike $\textit{accumulate}$ and like $\textit{replace}$, each model is trained using a fixed compute budget; we demonstrate that model test loss on real data is larger than in the $\textit{accumulate}$ scenario, but apparently plateaus, unlike the divergence seen with $\textit{replace}$. Third, we study the relative importance of cardinality and proportion of real data for avoiding model collapse. Surprisingly, we find a non-trivial interaction between real and synthetic data, where the value of synthetic data for reducing test loss depends on the absolute quantity of real data. Our insights are particularly important when forecasting whether future frontier generative models will collapse or thrive, and our results open avenues for empirically and mathematically studying the context-dependent value of synthetic data.</p>

<p>Abstract: While automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have achieved remarkable performance with large-scale datasets, their efficacy remains inadequate in low-resource settings, encompassing dialects, accents, minority languages, and long-tail hotwords, domains with significant practical relevance. With the advent of versatile and powerful text-to-speech (TTS) models, capable of generating speech with human-level naturalness, expressiveness, and diverse speaker profiles, leveraging TTS for ASR data augmentation provides a cost-effective and practical approach to enhancing ASR performance. Comprehensive experiments on an unprecedentedly rich variety of low-resource datasets demonstrate consistent and substantial performance improvements, proving that the proposed method of enhancing low-resource ASR through a versatile TTS model is highly effective and has broad application prospects. Furthermore, we delve deeper into key characteristics of synthesized speech data that contribute to ASR improvement, examining factors such as text diversity, speaker diversity, and the volume of synthesized data, with text diversity being studied for the first time in this work. We hope our findings provide helpful guidance and reference for the practical application of TTS-based data augmentation and push the advancement of low-resource ASR one step further.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanjun Chen, Xinming Zhang, Xianghui Wang, Zhiqiang Xu, Xiaoyu Shen, Wei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm is known for its stability and high sample efficiency in deep reinforcement learning. However, the tanh transformation applied to sampled actions in SAC distorts the action distribution, hindering the selection of the most probable actions. This paper presents a novel action sampling method that directly identifies and selects the most probable actions within the transformed distribution, thereby addressing this issue. Extensive experiments on standard continuous control benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method significantly enhances SAC's performance, resulting in faster convergence and higher cumulative rewards compared to the original algorithm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaqi Chen, Yan Yang, Shizhuo Deng, Da Teng, Liyuan Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: Human action recognition (HAR) plays a key role in various applications such as video analysis, surveillance, autonomous driving, robotics, and healthcare. Most HAR algorithms are developed from RGB images, which capture detailed visual information. However, these algorithms raise concerns in privacy-sensitive environments due to the recording of identifiable features. Event cameras offer a promising solution by capturing scene brightness changes sparsely at the pixel level, without capturing full images. Moreover, event cameras have high dynamic ranges that can effectively handle scenarios with complex lighting conditions, such as low light or high contrast environments. However, using event cameras introduces challenges in modeling the spatially sparse and high temporal resolution event data for HAR. To address these issues, we propose the SpikMamba framework, which combines the energy efficiency of spiking neural networks and the long sequence modeling capability of Mamba to efficiently capture global features from spatially sparse and high a temporal resolution event data. Additionally, to improve the locality of modeling, a spiking window-based linear attention mechanism is used. Extensive experiments show that SpikMamba achieves remarkable recognition performance, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art by 1.45%, 7.22%, 0.15%, and 3.92% on the PAF, HARDVS, DVS128, and E-FAction datasets, respectively.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Olga Krestinskaya, Mohammed E. Fouda, Ahmed Eltawil, Khaled N. Salama</p>
<p>Abstract: Designing generalized in-memory computing (IMC) hardware that efficiently supports a variety of workloads requires extensive design space exploration, which is infeasible to perform manually. Optimizing hardware individually for each workload or solely for the largest workload often fails to yield the most efficient generalized solutions. To address this, we propose a joint hardware-workload optimization framework that identifies optimised IMC chip architecture parameters, enabling more efficient, workload-flexible hardware. We show that joint optimization achieves 36%, 36%, 20%, and 69% better energy-latency-area scores for VGG16, ResNet18, AlexNet, and MobileNetV3, respectively, compared to the separate architecture parameters search optimizing for a single largest workload. Additionally, we quantify the performance trade-offs and losses of the resulting generalized IMC hardware compared to workload-specific IMC designs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yinyi Lai, Jiaqi Shang, Zenghui Liu, Zheyu Jiang, Yuyang Li, Longchao Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: As terrestrial resources become increasingly depleted, the demand for deep-sea resource exploration has intensified. However, the extreme conditions in the deep-sea environment pose significant challenges for underwater operations, necessitating the development of robust detection robots. In this paper, we propose an advanced path planning methodology that integrates an improved A* algorithm with the Dynamic Window Approach (DWA). By optimizing the search direction of the traditional A* algorithm and introducing an enhanced evaluation function, our improved A* algorithm accelerates path searching and reduces computational load. Additionally, the path-smoothing process has been refined to improve continuity and smoothness, minimizing sharp turns. This method also integrates global path planning with local dynamic obstacle avoidance via DWA, improving the real-time response of underwater robots in dynamic environments. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method surpasses the traditional A* algorithm in terms of path smoothness, obstacle avoidance, and real-time performance. The robustness of this approach in complex environments with both static and dynamic obstacles highlights its potential in autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) navigation and obstacle avoidance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Julie Alberge (SODA), Vincent Maladi\`ere (SODA), Olivier Grisel (SODA), Judith Ab\'ecassis (SODA), Ga\"el Varoquaux (SODA)</p>
<p>Abstract: When dealing with right-censored data, where some outcomes are missing due to a limited observation period, survival analysis -- known as time-to-event analysis -- focuses on predicting the time until an event of interest occurs. Multiple classes of outcomes lead to a classification variant: predicting the most likely event, a less explored area known as competing risks. Classic competing risks models couple architecture and loss, limiting scalability.To address these issues, we design a strictly proper censoring-adjusted separable scoring rule, allowing optimization on a subset of the data as each observation is evaluated independently. The loss estimates outcome probabilities and enables stochastic optimization for competing risks, which we use for efficient gradient boosting trees. SurvivalBoost not only outperforms 12 state-of-the-art models across several metrics on 4 real-life datasets, both in competing risks and survival settings, but also provides great calibration, the ability to predict across any time horizon, and computation times faster than existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunzhi Zhang, Zizhang Li, Matt Zhou, Shangzhe Wu, Jiajun Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce the Scene Language, a visual scene representation that concisely and precisely describes the structure, semantics, and identity of visual scenes. It represents a scene with three key components: a program that specifies the hierarchical and relational structure of entities in the scene, words in natural language that summarize the semantic class of each entity, and embeddings that capture the visual identity of each entity. This representation can be inferred from pre-trained language models via a training-free inference technique, given text or image inputs. The resulting scene can be rendered into images using traditional, neural, or hybrid graphics renderers. Together, this forms a robust, automated system for high-quality 3D and 4D scene generation. Compared with existing representations like scene graphs, our proposed Scene Language generates complex scenes with higher fidelity, while explicitly modeling the scene structures to enable precise control and editing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Krishna Sayana, Raghavendra Vasudeva, Yuri Vasilevski, Kun Su, Liam Hebert, Hubert Pham, Ambarish Jash, Sukhdeep Sodhi</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent advances in Large Language Model's generation and reasoning capabilities present an opportunity to develop truly conversational recommendation systems. However, effectively integrating recommender system knowledge into LLMs for natural language generation which is tailored towards recommendation tasks remains a challenge. This paper addresses this challenge by making two key contributions.
  First, we introduce a new dataset (REGEN) for natural language generation tasks in conversational recommendations. REGEN (Reviews Enhanced with GEnerative Narratives) extends the Amazon Product Reviews dataset with rich user narratives, including personalized explanations of product preferences, product endorsements for recommended items, and summaries of user purchase history. REGEN is made publicly available to facilitate further research. Furthermore, we establish benchmarks using well-known generative metrics, and perform an automated evaluation of the new dataset using a rater LLM. Second, the paper introduces a fusion architecture (CF model with an LLM) which serves as a baseline for REGEN. And to the best of our knowledge, represents the first attempt to analyze the capabilities of LLMs in understanding recommender signals and generating rich narratives. We demonstrate that LLMs can effectively learn from simple fusion architectures utilizing interaction-based CF embeddings, and this can be further enhanced using the metadata and personalization data associated with items. Our experiments show that combining CF and content embeddings leads to improvements of 4-12% in key language metrics compared to using either type of embedding individually. We also provide an analysis to interpret how CF and content embeddings contribute to this new generative task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiayi Lin, Chenyang Zhang, Haibo Tong, Dongyu Zhang, Qingqing Hong, Bingxuan Hou, Junli Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-Span Question Answering (MSQA) requires models to extract one or multiple answer spans from a given context to answer a question. Prior work mainly focuses on designing specific methods or applying heuristic strategies to encourage models to predict more correct predictions. However, these models are trained on gold answers and fail to consider the incorrect predictions. Through a statistical analysis, we observe that models with stronger abilities do not predict less incorrect predictions compared with other models. In this work, we propose Answering-Classifying-Correcting (ACC) framework, which employs a post-processing strategy to handle incorrect predictions. Specifically, the ACC framework first introduces a classifier to classify the predictions into three types and exclude "wrong predictions", then introduces a corrector to modify "partially correct predictions". Experiments on several MSQA datasets show that ACC framework significantly improves the Exact Match (EM) scores, and further analysis demostrates that ACC framework efficiently reduces the number of incorrect predictions, improving the quality of predictions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weijian Luo, Zemin Huang, Zhengyang Geng, J. Zico Kolter, Guo-jun Qi</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite their strong performances on many generative tasks, diffusion models require a large number of sampling steps in order to generate realistic samples. This has motivated the community to develop effective methods to distill pre-trained diffusion models into more efficient models, but these methods still typically require few-step inference or perform substantially worse than the underlying model. In this paper, we present Score Implicit Matching (SIM) a new approach to distilling pre-trained diffusion models into single-step generator models, while maintaining almost the same sample generation ability as the original model as well as being data-free with no need of training samples for distillation. The method rests upon the fact that, although the traditional score-based loss is intractable to minimize for generator models, under certain conditions we can efficiently compute the gradients for a wide class of score-based divergences between a diffusion model and a generator. SIM shows strong empirical performances for one-step generators: on the CIFAR10 dataset, it achieves an FID of 2.06 for unconditional generation and 1.96 for class-conditional generation. Moreover, by applying SIM to a leading transformer-based diffusion model, we distill a single-step generator for text-to-image (T2I) generation that attains an aesthetic score of 6.42 with no performance decline over the original multi-step counterpart, clearly outperforming the other one-step generators including SDXL-TURBO of 5.33, SDXL-LIGHTNING of 5.34 and HYPER-SDXL of 5.85. We will release this industry-ready one-step transformer-based T2I generator along with this paper.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuheng Lu, Bingshuo Qian, Caixia Yuan, Huixing Jiang, Xiaojie Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities in natural language processing but face catastrophic forgetting when learning new tasks, where adaptation to a new domain leads to a substantial decline in performance on previous tasks. In this paper, we propose Controlled LoRA (CLoRA), a subspace regularization method on LoRA structure. Aiming to reduce the scale of output change while introduce minimal constraint on model capacity, CLoRA imposes constraint on the direction of updating matrix null space. Experimental results on commonly used LLM finetuning tasks reveal that CLoRA significantly outperforms existing LoRA subsequent methods on both in-domain and outdomain evaluations, highlighting the superority of CLoRA as a effective parameter-efficient finetuning method with catastrophic forgetting mitigating. Further investigation for model parameters indicates that CLoRA effectively balances the trade-off between model capacity and degree of forgetting.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generating detailed descriptions from multiple cameras and viewpoints is challenging due to the complex and inconsistent nature of visual data. In this paper, we introduce PerspectiveNet, a lightweight yet efficient model for generating long descriptions across multiple camera views. Our approach utilizes a vision encoder, a compact connector module to convert visual features into a fixed-size tensor, and large language models (LLMs) to harness the strong natural language generation capabilities of LLMs. The connector module is designed with three main goals: mapping visual features onto LLM embeddings, emphasizing key information needed for description generation, and producing a fixed-size feature matrix. Additionally, we augment our solution with a secondary task, the correct frame sequence detection, enabling the model to search for the correct sequence of frames to generate descriptions. Finally, we integrate the connector module, the secondary task, the LLM, and a visual feature extraction model into a single architecture, which is trained for the Traffic Safety Description and Analysis task. This task requires generating detailed, fine-grained descriptions of events from multiple cameras and viewpoints. The resulting model is lightweight, ensuring efficient training and inference, while remaining highly effective.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sindhu Nair, Y. S. Rao, Radha Shankarmani</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent times, extracting valuable information from large text is making significant progress. Especially in the current era of social media, people expect quick bites of information. Automatic text summarization seeks to tackle this by slimming large texts down into more manageable summaries. This important research area can aid in decision-making by digging out salient content from large text. With the progress in deep learning models, significant work in language models has emerged. The encoder-decoder framework in deep learning has become the central approach for automatic text summarization. This work leverages transformer-based BART model for human-like summarization which is an open-ended problem with many challenges. On training and fine-tuning the encoder-decoder model, it is tested with diverse sample articles and the quality of summaries of diverse samples is assessed based on human evaluation parameters. Further, the finetuned model performance is compared with the baseline pretrained model based on evaluation metrics like ROUGE score and BERTScore. Additionally, domain adaptation of the model is required for improved performance of abstractive summarization of dialogues between interlocutors. On investigating, the above popular evaluation metrics are found to be insensitive to factual errors. Further investigation of the summaries generated by finetuned model is done using the contemporary evaluation metrics of factual consistency like WeCheck and SummaC. Empirical results on BBC News articles highlight that the gold standard summaries written by humans are more factually consistent by 17% than the abstractive summaries generated by finetuned model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihong Luo, Yuhan Chen, Siya Qiu, Yiwei Wang, Chen Zhang, Yan Zhou, Xiaochun Cao, Jing Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown superior performance in node classification. However, GNNs perform poorly in the Few-Shot Node Classification (FSNC) task that requires robust generalization to make accurate predictions for unseen classes with limited labels. To tackle the challenge, we propose the integration of Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM)--a technique designed to enhance model generalization by finding a flat minimum of the loss landscape--into GNN training. The standard SAM approach, however, consists of two forward-backward steps in each training iteration, doubling the computational cost compared to the base optimizer (e.g., Adam). To mitigate this drawback, we introduce a novel algorithm, Fast Graph Sharpness-Aware Minimization (FGSAM), that integrates the rapid training of Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) with the superior performance of GNNs. Specifically, we utilize GNNs for parameter perturbation while employing MLPs to minimize the perturbed loss so that we can find a flat minimum with good generalization more efficiently. Moreover, our method reutilizes the gradient from the perturbation phase to incorporate graph topology into the minimization process at almost zero additional cost. To further enhance training efficiency, we develop FGSAM+ that executes exact perturbations periodically. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms the standard SAM with lower computational costs in FSNC tasks. In particular, our FGSAM+ as a SAM variant offers a faster optimization than the base optimizer in most cases. In addition to FSNC, our proposed methods also demonstrate competitive performance in the standard node classification task for heterophilic graphs, highlighting the broad applicability.

<p>Abstract: Pedestrian motion prediction is a key part of the modular-based autonomous driving pipeline, ensuring safe, accurate, and timely awareness of human agents' possible future trajectories. The autonomous vehicle can use this information to prevent any possible accidents and create a comfortable and pleasant driving experience for the passengers and pedestrians. A wealth of research was done on the topic from the authors of robotics, computer vision, intelligent transportation systems, and other fields. However, a relatively unexplored angle is the integration of the state-of-art solutions into existing autonomous driving stacks and evaluating them in real-life conditions rather than sanitized datasets. We analyze selected publications with provided open-source solutions and provide a perspective obtained by integrating them into existing Autonomous Driving framework - Autoware Mini and performing experiments in natural urban conditions in Tartu, Estonia to determine valuability of traditional motion prediction metrics. This perspective should be valuable to any potential autonomous driving or robotics engineer looking for the real-world performance of the existing state-of-art pedestrian motion prediction problem.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lukas Hughes-Noehrer, Leda Channer, Gabriel Strain, Gregory Yates, Richard Body, Caroline Jay</p>
<p>Abstract: Objectives: To investigate clinicians' attitudes towards current automated interpretation of ECG and novel AI technologies and their perception of computer-assisted interpretation. Materials and Methods: We conducted a series of interviews with clinicians in the UK. Our study: (i) explores the potential for AI, specifically future 'human-like' computing approaches, to facilitate ECG interpretation and support clinical decision making, and (ii) elicits their opinions about the importance of explainability and trustworthiness of AI algorithms. Results: We performed inductive thematic analysis on interview transcriptions from 23 clinicians and identified the following themes: (i) a lack of trust in current systems, (ii) positive attitudes towards future AI applications and requirements for these, (iii) the relationship between the accuracy and explainability of algorithms, and (iv) opinions on education, possible deskilling, and the impact of AI on clinical competencies. Discussion: Clinicians do not trust current computerised methods, but welcome future 'AI' technologies. Where clinicians trust future AI interpretation to be accurate, they are less concerned that it is explainable. They also preferred ECG interpretation that demonstrated the results of the algorithm visually. Whilst clinicians do not fear job losses, they are concerned about deskilling and the need to educate the workforce to use AI responsibly. Conclusion: Clinicians are positive about the future application of AI in clinical decision-making. Accuracy is a key factor of uptake and visualisations are preferred over current computerised methods. This is viewed as a potential means of training and upskilling, in contrast to the deskilling that automation might be perceived to bring.</p>

<p>Abstract: Capsule Networks outperform Convolutional Neural Networks in learning the part-whole relationships with viewpoint invariance, and the credit goes to their multidimensional capsules. It was assumed that increasing the number of capsule layers in the capsule networks would enhance the model performance. However, recent studies found that Capsule Networks lack scalability due to vanishing activations in the capsules of deeper layers. This paper thoroughly investigates the vanishing activation problem in deep Capsule Networks. To analyze this issue and understand how increasing capsule dimensions can facilitate deeper networks, various Capsule Network models are constructed and evaluated with different numbers of capsules, capsule dimensions, and intermediate layers for this paper. Unlike traditional model pruning, which reduces the number of model parameters and expedites model training, this study uses pruning to mitigate the vanishing activations in the deeper capsule layers. In addition, the backbone network and capsule layers are pruned with different pruning ratios to reduce the number of inactive capsules and achieve better model accuracy than the unpruned models.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated high reasoning capabilities, drawing attention for their applications as agents in various decision-making processes. One notably promising application of LLM agents is robotic manipulation. Recent research has shown that LLMs can generate text planning or control code for robots, providing substantial flexibility and interaction capabilities. However, these methods still face challenges in terms of flexibility and applicability across different environments, limiting their ability to adapt autonomously. Current approaches typically fall into two categories: those relying on environment-specific policy training, which restricts their transferability, and those generating code actions based on fixed prompts, which leads to diminished performance when confronted with new environments. These limitations significantly constrain the generalizability of agents in robotic manipulation. To address these limitations, we propose a novel method called EnvBridge. This approach involves the retention and transfer of successful robot control codes from source environments to target environments. EnvBridge enhances the agent's adaptability and performance across diverse settings by leveraging insights from multiple environments. Notably, our approach alleviates environmental constraints, offering a more flexible and generalizable solution for robotic manipulation tasks. We validated the effectiveness of our method using robotic manipulation benchmarks: RLBench, MetaWorld, and CALVIN. Our experiments demonstrate that LLM agents can successfully leverage diverse knowledge sources to solve complex tasks. Consequently, our approach significantly enhances the adaptability and robustness of robotic manipulation agents in planning across diverse environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bryan R. Christ, Zack Gottesman, Jonathan Kropko, Thomas Hartvigsen</p>
<p>Abstract: Math reasoning is a highly active area of Large Language Model (LLM) research because it is a hallmark of artificial intelligence. However, few works have explored how math reasoning is encoded within LLM parameters and if it is a skill that can be isolated within a model. Doing so could allow targeted intervention to improve math performance without altering non-math behavior and foster understanding of how models encode math reasoning. We introduce Math Neurosurgery (MathNeuro), a method for isolating math-specific parameters in LLMs using only forward passes. MathNeuro builds on existing work by using weights and activations to calculate parameter importance, but isolates math-specific parameters by removing those important for general language tasks. Pruning parameters MathNeuro identifies deletes a LLM's math reasoning ability without destroying its general language ability. Scaling these parameters by a small constant improves a pretrained or instruction-tuned LLM's performance by 4-17% on GSM8K while leaving non-math behavior unaltered. MathNeuro is also data efficient: most of its effectiveness holds when identifying math-specific parameters using a single sample. MathNeuro highlights the potential for future work to intervene on math-specific parameters.</p>

<p>Abstract: Brain age transformation aims to convert reference brain images into synthesized images that accurately reflect the age-specific features of a target age group. The primary objective of this task is to modify only the age-related attributes of the reference image while preserving all other age-irrelevant attributes. However, achieving this goal poses substantial challenges due to the inherent entanglement of various image attributes within features extracted from a backbone encoder, resulting in simultaneous alterations during the image generation. To address this challenge, we propose a novel architecture that employs disentangled representation learning for identity-preserved brain age transformation called IdenBAT. This approach facilitates the decomposition of image features, ensuring the preservation of individual traits while selectively transforming age-related characteristics to match those of the target age group. Through comprehensive experiments conducted on both 2D and full-size 3D brain datasets, our method adeptly converts input images to target age while retaining individual characteristics accurately. Furthermore, our approach demonstrates superiority over existing state-of-the-art regarding performance fidelity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Itay Nakash, George Kour, Guy Uziel, Ateret Anaby-Tavor</p>
<p>Abstract: Following the advancement of large language models (LLMs), the development of LLM-based autonomous agents has become increasingly prevalent. As a result, the need to understand the security vulnerabilities of these agents has become a critical task. We examine how ReAct agents can be exploited using a straightforward yet effective method we refer to as the foot-in-the-door attack. Our experiments show that indirect prompt injection attacks, prompted by harmless and unrelated requests (such as basic calculations) can significantly increase the likelihood of the agent performing subsequent malicious actions. Our results show that once a ReAct agents thought includes a specific tool or action, the likelihood of executing this tool in the subsequent steps increases significantly, as the agent seldom re-evaluates its actions. Consequently, even random, harmless requests can establish a foot-in-the-door, allowing an attacker to embed malicious instructions into the agents thought process, making it more susceptible to harmful directives. To mitigate this vulnerability, we propose implementing a simple reflection mechanism that prompts the agent to reassess the safety of its actions during execution, which can help reduce the success of such attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Antoine Gorceix, Bastien Le Chenadec, Ahmad Rammal, Nelson Vadori, Manuela Veloso</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we study the ability of large language models to learn specific mathematical rules such as distributivity or simplifying equations. We present an empirical analysis of their ability to generalize these rules, as well as to reuse them in the context of word problems. For this purpose, we provide a rigorous methodology to build synthetic data incorporating such rules, and perform fine-tuning of large language models on such data. Our experiments show that our model can learn and generalize these rules to some extent, as well as suitably reuse them in the context of word problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anne-Maria Laukkanen, Sudarsana Reddy Kadiri, Shrikanth Narayanan, Paavo Alku</p>
<p>Abstract: Objectives: ncreased prevalence of social creak particularly among female speakers has been reported in several studies. The study of social creak has been previously conducted by combining perceptual evaluation of speech with conventional acoustical parameters such as the harmonic-to-noise ratio and cepstral peak prominence. In the current study, machine learning (ML) was used to automatically distinguish speech of low amount of social creak from speech of high amount of social creak.
  Methods: The amount of creak in continuous speech samples produced in Finnish by 90 female speakers was first perceptually assessed by two voice specialists. Based on their assessments, the speech samples were divided into two categories (low $vs$. high amount of creak). Using the speech signals and their creak labels, seven different ML models were trained. Three spectral representations were used as feature for each model.
  Results: The results show that the best performance (accuracy of 71.1\%) was obtained by the following two systems: an Adaboost classifier using the mel-spectrogram feature and a decision tree classifier using the mel-frequency cepstral coefficient feature.
  Conclusions: The study of social creak is becoming increasingly popular in sociolinguistic and vocological research. The conventional human perceptual assessment of the amount of creak is laborious and therefore ML technology could be used to assist researchers studying social creak. The classification systems reported in this study could be considered as baselines in future ML-based studies on social creak.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuyang Hou, Zhangxiao Shen, Anqi Zhao, Jianyuan Liang, Zhipeng Gui, Xuefeng Guan, Rui Li, Huayi Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing demand for spatiotemporal data and modeling tasks in geosciences has made geospatial code generation technology a critical factor in enhancing productivity. Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in code generation tasks, they often encounter issues such as refusal to code or hallucination in geospatial code generation due to a lack of domain-specific knowledge and code corpora. To address these challenges, this paper presents and open-sources the GeoCode-PT and GeoCode-SFT corpora, along with the GeoCode-Eval evaluation dataset. Additionally, by leveraging QLoRA and LoRA for pretraining and fine-tuning, we introduce GeoCode-GPT-7B, the first LLM focused on geospatial code generation, fine-tuned from Code Llama-7B. Furthermore, we establish a comprehensive geospatial code evaluation framework, incorporating option matching, expert validation, and prompt engineering scoring for LLMs, and systematically evaluate GeoCode-GPT-7B using the GeoCode-Eval dataset. Experimental results show that GeoCode-GPT outperforms other models in multiple-choice accuracy by 9.1% to 32.1%, in code summarization ability by 1.7% to 25.4%, and in code generation capability by 1.2% to 25.1%. This paper provides a solution and empirical validation for enhancing LLMs' performance in geospatial code generation, extends the boundaries of domain-specific model applications, and offers valuable insights into unlocking their potential in geospatial code generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hadeel Aboueidah, Abdulrahman Altahhan</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurately predicting the state of charge of Lithium-ion batteries is essential to the performance of battery management systems of electric vehicles. One of the main reasons for the slow global adoption of electric cars is driving range anxiety. The ability of a battery management system to accurately estimate the state of charge can help alleviate this problem. In this paper, a comparison between data-driven state-of-charge estimation methods is conducted. The paper compares different neural network-based models and common regression models for SOC estimation. These models include several ablated transformer networks, a neural network, a lasso regression model, a linear regression model and a decision tree. Results of various experiments conducted on data obtained from natural driving cycles of the BMW i3 battery show that the decision tree outperformed all other models including the more complex transformer network with self-attention and positional encoding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yash Sinha, Murari Mandal, Mohan Kankanhalli</p>
<p>Abstract: The key components of machine learning are data samples for training, model for learning patterns, and loss function for optimizing accuracy. Analogously, unlearning can potentially be achieved through anti-data samples (or anti-samples), unlearning method, and reversed loss function. While prior research has explored unlearning methods and reversed loss functions, the potential of anti-samples remains largely untapped. In this paper, we introduce UnSTAR: Unlearning with Self-Taught Anti-Sample Reasoning for large language models (LLMs). Our contributions are threefold; first, we propose a novel concept of anti-sample-induced unlearning; second, we generate anti-samples by leveraging misleading rationales, which help reverse learned associations and accelerate the unlearning process; and third, we enable fine-grained targeted unlearning, allowing for the selective removal of specific associations without impacting related knowledge - something not achievable by previous works. Results demonstrate that anti-samples offer an efficient, targeted unlearning strategy for LLMs, opening new avenues for privacy-preserving machine learning and model modification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haining Wang, Jason Clark, Hannah McKelvey, Leila Sterman, Zheng Gao, Zuoyu Tian, Sandra K\"ubler, Xiaozhong Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: A vast amount of scholarly work is published daily, yet much of it remains inaccessible to the general public due to dense jargon and complex language. To address this challenge in science communication, we introduce a reinforcement learning framework that fine-tunes a language model to rewrite scholarly abstracts into more comprehensible versions. Guided by a carefully balanced combination of word- and sentence-level accessibility rewards, our language model effectively substitutes technical terms with more accessible alternatives, a task which models supervised fine-tuned or guided by conventional readability measures struggle to accomplish. Our best model adjusts the readability level of scholarly abstracts by approximately six U.S. grade levels -- in other words, from a postgraduate to a high school level. This translates to roughly a 90% relative boost over the supervised fine-tuning baseline, all while maintaining factual accuracy and high-quality language. An in-depth analysis of our approach shows that balanced rewards lead to systematic modifications in the base model, likely contributing to smoother optimization and superior performance. We envision this work as a step toward bridging the gap between scholarly research and the general public, particularly younger readers and those without a college degree.</p>

<p>Abstract: This papers presents the submission of team Ryu to the canceled SIGMORPHON 2024 shared task on subword tokenization. My submission explores whether morphological segmentation methods can be used as a part of subword tokenizers. I adopt two approaches: the statistical segmentation method Morfessor and a transformer based sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) segmentation model in tokenizers. The prediction results show that morphological segmentation could be as effective as commonly used subword tokenizers. Additionally, I investigate how a tokenizer's vocabulary influences the performance of language models. A tokenizer with a balanced token frequency distribution tends to work better. A balanced token vocabulary can be achieved by keeping frequent words as unique tokens.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jesse Phitidis, Alison Q. O'Neil, William N. Whiteley, Beatrice Alex, Joanna M. Wardlaw, Miguel O. Bernabeu, Maria Vald\'es Hern\'andez</p>
<p>Abstract: Cerebrovascular diseases (CVD) can lead to stroke and dementia. Stroke is the second leading cause of death world wide and dementia incidence is increasing by the year. There are several markers of CVD that are visible on brain imaging, including: white matter hyperintensities (WMH), acute and chronic ischaemic stroke lesions (ISL), lacunes, enlarged perivascular spaces (PVS), acute and chronic haemorrhagic lesions, and cerebral microbleeds (CMB). Brain atrophy also occurs in CVD. These markers are important for patient management and intervention, since they indicate elevated risk of future stroke and dementia. We systematically reviewed automated systems designed to support radiologists reporting on these CVD imaging findings. We considered commercially available software and research publications which identify at least two CVD markers. In total, we included 29 commercial products and 13 research publications. Two distinct types of commercial support system were available: those which identify acute stroke lesions (haemorrhagic and ischaemic) from computed tomography (CT) scans, mainly for the purpose of patient triage; and those which measure WMH and atrophy regionally and longitudinally. In research, WMH and ISL were the markers most frequently analysed together, from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans; lacunes and PVS were each targeted only twice and CMB only once. For stroke, commercially available systems largely support the emergency setting, whilst research systems consider also follow-up and routine scans. The systems to quantify WMH and atrophy are focused on neurodegenerative disease support, where these CVD markers are also of significance. There are currently no openly validated systems, commercially, or in research, performing a comprehensive joint analysis of all CVD markers (WMH, ISL, lacunes, PVS, haemorrhagic lesions, CMB, and atrophy).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander G. Padula, Dennis J. N. J. Soemers</p>
<p>Abstract: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is commonly used in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback to align large language models (LLMs) with downstream tasks. This paper investigates the feasibility of using PPO for direct reinforcement learning (RL) from explicitly programmed reward signals, as opposed to indirect learning from human feedback via an intermediary reward model. We focus on tasks expressed through formal languages, such as mathematics and programming, where explicit reward functions can be programmed to automatically assess the quality of generated outputs. We apply this approach to a sentiment alignment task, a simple arithmetic task, and a more complex game synthesis task. The sentiment alignment task replicates prior research and serves to validate our experimental setup. Our results show that pure RL-based training for the two formal language tasks is challenging, with success being limited even for the simple arithmetic task. We propose a novel batch-entropy regularization term to aid exploration, although training is not yet entirely stable. Our findings suggest that direct RL training of LLMs may be more suitable for relatively minor changes, such as alignment, than for learning new tasks altogether, even if an informative reward signal can be expressed programmatically.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Isamu Isozaki, Manil Shrestha, Rick Console, Edward Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Hacking poses a significant threat to cybersecurity, inflicting billions of dollars in damages annually. To mitigate these risks, ethical hacking, or penetration testing, is employed to identify vulnerabilities in systems and networks. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown potential across various domains, including cybersecurity. However, there is currently no comprehensive, open, end-to-end automated penetration testing benchmark to drive progress and evaluate the capabilities of these models in security contexts. This paper introduces a novel open benchmark for LLM-based automated penetration testing, addressing this critical gap. We first evaluate the performance of LLMs, including GPT-4o and Llama 3.1-405B, using the state-of-the-art PentestGPT tool. Our findings reveal that while Llama 3.1 demonstrates an edge over GPT-4o, both models currently fall short of performing fully automated, end-to-end penetration testing. Next, we advance the state-of-the-art and present ablation studies that provide insights into improving the PentestGPT tool. Our research illuminates the challenges LLMs face in each aspect of Pentesting, e.g. enumeration, exploitation, and privilege escalation. This work contributes to the growing body of knowledge on AI-assisted cybersecurity and lays the foundation for future research in automated penetration testing using large language models.</p>

We examine this limitation by testing various LLMs and specialized translation models on English-Thai machine translation and code-switching datasets. Our findings reveal that under more strict computational constraints, such as 4-bit quantization, LLMs fail to translate effectively. In contrast, specialized models, with comparable or lower computational requirements, consistently outperform LLMs. This underscores the importance of specialized models for maintaining performance under resource constraints.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuo Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) has been widely studied in recent years. However, most existing MAPF algorithms assume that an agent occupies only a single grid in a grid-based map. This assumption limits their applicability in many real-world domains where agents have geometric shapes, rather than being point-like. Such agents, which can occupy multiple cells simultaneously, are referred to as ``large'' agents. When considering the shape and size of agents in MAPF, the computational complexity increases significantly as the number of agents grows, primarily due to the increased overhead in conflict detection between geometric agents. In this paper, we propose two types of subproblems for the LA-MAPF (Large-Agent MAPF) problem: \textbf{cluster} (which has no constraints on the order of solution) and \textbf{level} (which imposes constraints on the solution order). We introduce \textbf{Layered LA-MAPF}, a method that decomposes a MAPF instance involving geometric agents into clusters, and then further decomposes each cluster into levels. This approach aims to reduce time complexity when solving LA-MAPF problems. Our results demonstrate the performance of our method as the number of agents increases across various maps, and how it accelerates LA-MAPF methods, such as LA-CBS and LA-LaCAM. Experiments show that our LA-MAPF method with instance decomposition \textbf{halves the time cost (reducing from an average of 40s to 20s) and triples the success rate (from an average of 0.27 to 0.80)} in finding a solution within 60 seconds.

<p>Abstract: We introduce KANICE (Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks with Interactive Convolutional Elements), a novel neural architecture that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) principles. KANICE integrates Interactive Convolutional Blocks (ICBs) and KAN linear layers into a CNN framework. This leverages KANs' universal approximation capabilities and ICBs' adaptive feature learning. KANICE captures complex, non-linear data relationships while enabling dynamic, context-dependent feature extraction based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. We evaluated KANICE on four datasets: MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, EMNIST, and SVHN, comparing it against standard CNNs, CNN-KAN hybrids, and ICB variants. KANICE consistently outperformed baseline models, achieving 99.35% accuracy on MNIST and 90.05% on the SVHN dataset.
  Furthermore, we introduce KANICE-mini, a compact variant designed for efficiency. A comprehensive ablation study demonstrates that KANICE-mini achieves comparable performance to KANICE with significantly fewer parameters. KANICE-mini reached 90.00% accuracy on SVHN with 2,337,828 parameters, compared to KANICE's 25,432,000. This study highlights the potential of KAN-based architectures in balancing performance and computational efficiency in image classification tasks. Our work contributes to research in adaptive neural networks, integrates mathematical theorems into deep learning architectures, and explores the trade-offs between model complexity and performance, advancing computer vision and pattern recognition.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Srujan Deolasee, Siva Kailas, Wenhao Luo, Katia Sycara, Woojun Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Informative path planning (IPP) is an important planning paradigm for various real-world robotic applications such as environment monitoring. IPP involves planning a path that can learn an accurate belief of the quantity of interest, while adhering to planning constraints. Traditional IPP methods typically require high computation time during execution, giving rise to reinforcement learning (RL) based IPP methods. However, the existing RL-based methods do not consider spatio-temporal environments which involve their own challenges due to variations in environment characteristics. In this paper, we propose DyPNIPP, a robust RL-based IPP framework, designed to operate effectively across spatio-temporal environments with varying dynamics. To achieve this, DyPNIPP incorporates domain randomization to train the agent across diverse environments and introduces a dynamics prediction model to capture and adapt the agent actions to specific environment dynamics. Our extensive experiments in a wildfire environment demonstrate that DyPNIPP outperforms existing RL-based IPP algorithms by significantly improving robustness and performing across diverse environment conditions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Dataset distillation has demonstrated strong performance on simple datasets like CIFAR, MNIST, and TinyImageNet but struggles to achieve similar results in more complex scenarios. In this paper, we propose EDF (emphasizes the discriminative features), a dataset distillation method that enhances key discriminative regions in synthetic images using Grad-CAM activation maps. Our approach is inspired by a key observation: in simple datasets, high-activation areas typically occupy most of the image, whereas in complex scenarios, the size of these areas is much smaller. Unlike previous methods that treat all pixels equally when synthesizing images, EDF uses Grad-CAM activation maps to enhance high-activation areas. From a supervision perspective, we downplay supervision signals that have lower losses, as they contain common patterns. Additionally, to help the DD community better explore complex scenarios, we build the Complex Dataset Distillation (Comp-DD) benchmark by meticulously selecting sixteen subsets, eight easy and eight hard, from ImageNet-1K. In particular, EDF consistently outperforms SOTA results in complex scenarios, such as ImageNet-1K subsets. Hopefully, more researchers will be inspired and encouraged to improve the practicality and efficacy of DD. Our code and benchmark will be made public at https://github.com/NUS-HPC-AI-Lab/EDF.</p>

<p>Abstract: Building on the success of large language models (LLMs), recent advancements such as GPT-4o have enabled real-time speech interactions through LLM-based voice assistants, offering a significantly improved user experience compared to traditional text-based interactions. However, the absence of benchmarks designed to evaluate these speech interaction capabilities has hindered progress of LLM-based voice assistants development. Current evaluations focus primarily on automatic speech recognition (ASR) or general knowledge evaluation with clean speeches, neglecting the more intricate, real-world scenarios that involve diverse speaker characteristics, environmental and content factors. To address this, we introduce VoiceBench, the first benchmark designed to provide a multi-faceted evaluation of LLM-based voice assistants. VoiceBench also includes both real and synthetic spoken instructions that incorporate the above three key real-world variations. Extensive experiments reveal the limitations of current LLM-based voice assistant models and offer valuable insights for future research and development in this field.</p>

<p>Abstract: Purpose: Bangladesh's legal system struggles with major challenges like delays, complexity, high costs, and millions of unresolved cases, which deter many from pursuing legal action due to lack of knowledge or financial constraints. This research seeks to develop a specialized Large Language Model (LLM) to assist in the Bangladeshi legal system. Methods: We created UKIL-DB-EN, an English corpus of Bangladeshi legal documents, by collecting and scraping data on various legal acts. We fine-tuned the GPT-2 model on this dataset to develop GPT2-UKIL-EN, an LLM focused on providing legal assistance in English. Results: The model was rigorously evaluated using semantic assessments, including case studies supported by expert opinions. The evaluation provided promising results, demonstrating the potential for the model to assist in legal matters within Bangladesh. Conclusion: Our work represents the first structured effort toward building an AI-based legal assistant for Bangladesh. While the results are encouraging, further refinements are necessary to improve the model's accuracy, credibility, and safety. This is a significant step toward creating a legal AI capable of serving the needs of a population of 180 million.</p>

<p>Abstract: Stock return forecasting is a major component of numerous finance applications. Predicted stock returns can be incorporated into portfolio trading algorithms to make informed buy or sell decisions which can optimize returns. In such portfolio trading applications, the predictive performance of a time series forecasting model is crucial. In this work, we propose the use of the Evolutionary eXploration of Augmenting Memory Models (EXAMM) algorithm to progressively evolve recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for stock return predictions. RNNs are evolved independently for each stocks and portfolio trading decisions are made based on the predicted stock returns. The portfolio used for testing consists of the 30 companies in the Dow-Jones Index (DJI) with each stock have the same weight.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongru Cai, Yongqi Li, Wenjie Wang, Fengbin Zhu, Xiaoyu Shen, Wenjie Li, Tat-Seng Chua</p>
<p>Abstract: Web agents have emerged as a promising direction to automate Web task completion based on user instructions, significantly enhancing user experience. Recently, Web agents have evolved from traditional agents to Large Language Models (LLMs)-based Web agents. Despite their success, existing LLM-based Web agents overlook the importance of personalized data (e.g., user profiles and historical Web behaviors) in assisting the understanding of users' personalized instructions and executing customized actions. To overcome the limitation, we first formulate the task of LLM-empowered personalized Web agents, which integrate personalized data and user instructions to personalize instruction comprehension and action execution. To address the absence of a comprehensive evaluation benchmark, we construct a Personalized Web Agent Benchmark (PersonalWAB), featuring user instructions, personalized user data, Web functions, and two evaluation paradigms across three personalized Web tasks. Moreover, we propose a Personalized User Memory-enhanced Alignment (PUMA) framework to adapt LLMs to the personalized Web agent task. PUMA utilizes a memory bank with a task-specific retrieval strategy to filter relevant historical Web behaviors. Based on the behaviors, PUMA then aligns LLMs for personalized action execution through fine-tuning and direct preference optimization. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of PUMA over existing Web agents on PersonalWAB.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Venkatesh Pattabiraman, Yifeng Cao, Siddhant Haldar, Lerrel Pinto, Raunaq Bhirangi</p>
<p>Abstract: While visuomotor policy learning has advanced robotic manipulation, precisely executing contact-rich tasks remains challenging due to the limitations of vision in reasoning about physical interactions. To address this, recent work has sought to integrate tactile sensing into policy learning. However, many existing approaches rely on optical tactile sensors that are either restricted to recognition tasks or require complex dimensionality reduction steps for policy learning. In this work, we explore learning policies with magnetic skin sensors, which are inherently low-dimensional, highly sensitive, and inexpensive to integrate with robotic platforms. To leverage these sensors effectively, we present the Visuo-Skin (ViSk) framework, a simple approach that uses a transformer-based policy and treats skin sensor data as additional tokens alongside visual information. Evaluated on four complex real-world tasks involving credit card swiping, plug insertion, USB insertion, and bookshelf retrieval, ViSk significantly outperforms both vision-only and optical tactile sensing based policies. Further analysis reveals that combining tactile and visual modalities enhances policy performance and spatial generalization, achieving an average improvement of 27.5% across tasks. https://visuoskin.github.io/</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shota Onohara, Atsuyuki Miyai, Yuki Imajuku, Kazuki Egashira, Jeonghun Baek, Xiang Yue, Graham Neubig, Kiyoharu Aizawa</p>
<p>Abstract: Accelerating research on Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) in non-English languages is crucial for enhancing user experiences across broader populations. In this paper, we introduce JMMMU (Japanese MMMU), the first large-scale Japanese benchmark designed to evaluate LMMs on expert-level tasks based on the Japanese cultural context. To facilitate comprehensive culture-aware evaluation, JMMMU features two complementary subsets: (i) culture-agnostic (CA) subset, where the culture-independent subjects (e.g., Math) are selected and translated into Japanese, enabling one-to-one comparison with its English counterpart MMMU; and (ii) culture-specific (CS) subset, comprising newly crafted subjects that reflect Japanese cultural context. Using the CA subset, we observe performance drop in many LMMs when evaluated in Japanese, which is purely attributable to language variation. Using the CS subset, we reveal their inadequate Japanese cultural understanding. Further, by combining both subsets, we identify that some LMMs perform well on the CA subset but not on the CS subset, exposing a shallow understanding of the Japanese language that lacks depth in cultural understanding. We hope this work will not only help advance LMM performance in Japanese but also serve as a guideline to create high-standard, culturally diverse benchmarks for multilingual LMM development.

<p>Abstract: We present plingo, an extension of the ASP system clingo with various probabilistic reasoning modes. Plingo is centered upon LP^MLN, a probabilistic extension of ASP based on a weight scheme from Markov Logic. This choice is motivated by the fact that the core probabilistic reasoning modes can be mapped onto optimization problems and that LP^MLN may serve as a middle-ground formalism connecting to other probabilistic approaches. As a result, plingo offers three alternative frontends, for LP^MLN, P-log, and ProbLog. The corresponding input languages and reasoning modes are implemented by means of clingo's multi-shot and theory solving capabilities. The core of plingo amounts to a re-implementation of LP^MLN in terms of modern ASP technology, extended by an approximation technique based on a new method for answer set enumeration in the order of optimality. We evaluate plingo's performance empirically by comparing it to other probabilistic systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: With infinitely many high-quality data points, infinite computational power, an infinitely large foundation model with a perfect training algorithm and guaranteed zero generalization error on the pretext task, can the model be used for everything? This question cannot be answered by the existing theory of representation, optimization or generalization, because the issues they mainly investigate are assumed to be nonexistent here. In this paper, we show that category theory provides powerful machinery to answer this question. We have proved three results. The first one limits the power of prompt-based learning, saying that the model can solve a downstream task with prompts if and only if the task is representable. The second one says fine tuning does not have this limit, as a foundation model with the minimum required power (up to symmetry) can theoretically solve downstream tasks for the category defined by pretext task, with fine tuning and enough resources. Our final result can be seen as a new type of generalization theorem, showing that the foundation model can generate unseen objects from the target category (e.g., images) using the structural information from the source category (e.g., texts). Along the way, we provide a categorical framework for supervised and self-supervised learning, which might be of independent interest.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hang Yin, Zihao Wang, Yangqiu Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Reasoning on knowledge graphs is a challenging task because it utilizes observed information to predict the missing one. Particularly, answering complex queries based on first-order logic is one of the crucial tasks to verify learning to reason abilities for generalization and composition. Recently, the prevailing method is query embedding which learns the embedding of a set of entities and treats logic operations as set operations and has shown great empirical success. Though there has been much research following the same formulation, many of its claims lack a formal and systematic inspection. In this paper, we rethink this formulation and justify many of the previous claims by characterizing the scope of queries investigated previously and precisely identifying the gap between its formulation and its goal, as well as providing complexity analysis for the currently investigated queries. Moreover, we develop a new dataset containing ten new types of queries with features that have never been considered and therefore can provide a thorough investigation of complex queries. Finally, we propose a new neural-symbolic method, Fuzzy Inference with Truth value (FIT), where we equip the neural link predictors with fuzzy logic theory to support end-to-end learning using complex queries with provable reasoning capability. Empirical results show that our method outperforms previous methods significantly in the new dataset and also surpasses previous methods in the existing dataset at the same time.</p>

Since the CI graphs capture direct dependence between features, they have been garnering increasing interest within the research community for gaining insights into the systems from various domains, in particular discovering the domain topology. In this work, we propose algorithms for performing knowledge propagation over the CI graphs.

<p>Abstract: Molecular interaction prediction plays a crucial role in forecasting unknown interactions between molecules, such as drug-target interaction (DTI) and drug-drug interaction (DDI), which are essential in the field of drug discovery and therapeutics. Although previous prediction methods have yielded promising results by leveraging the rich semantics and topological structure of biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs), they have primarily focused on enhancing predictive performance without addressing the presence of inevitable noise and inconsistent semantics. This limitation has hindered the advancement of KG-based prediction methods. To address this limitation, we propose BioKDN (Biomedical Knowledge Graph Denoising Network) for robust molecular interaction prediction. BioKDN refines the reliable structure of local subgraphs by denoising noisy links in a learnable manner, providing a general module for extracting task-relevant interactions. To enhance the reliability of the refined structure, BioKDN maintains consistent and robust semantics by smoothing relations around the target interaction. By maximizing the mutual information between reliable structure and smoothed relations, BioKDN emphasizes informative semantics to enable precise predictions. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that BioKDN surpasses state-of-the-art models in DTI and DDI prediction tasks, confirming the effectiveness and robustness of BioKDN in denoising unreliable interactions within contaminated KGs</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Germ\'an Vidal</p>
<p>Abstract: The emergence of tools based on artificial intelligence has also led to the need of producing explanations which are understandable by a human being. In most approaches, the system is considered a black box, making it difficult to generate appropriate explanations. In this work, though, we consider a setting where models are transparent: probabilistic logic programming (PLP), a paradigm that combines logic programming for knowledge representation and probability to model uncertainty. However, given a query, the usual notion of explanation is associated with a set of choices, one for each random variable of the model. Unfortunately, such a set does not explain why the query is true and, in fact, it may contain choices that are actually irrelevant for the considered query. To improve this situation, we present in this paper an approach to explaining explanations which is based on defining a new query-driven inference mechanism for PLP where proofs are labeled with "choice expressions", a compact and easy to manipulate representation for sets of choices. The combination of proof trees and choice expressions allows us to produce comprehensible query justifications with a causal structure.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jos\'e Luiz Nunes, Guilherme F. C. F. Almeida, Marcelo de Araujo, Simone D. J. Barbosa</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have taken centre stage in debates on Artificial Intelligence. Yet there remains a gap in how to assess LLMs' conformity to important human values. In this paper, we investigate whether state-of-the-art LLMs, GPT-4 and Claude 2.1 (Gemini Pro and LLAMA 2 did not generate valid results) are moral hypocrites. We employ two research instruments based on the Moral Foundations Theory: (i) the Moral Foundations Questionnaire (MFQ), which investigates which values are considered morally relevant in abstract moral judgements; and (ii) the Moral Foundations Vignettes (MFVs), which evaluate moral cognition in concrete scenarios related to each moral foundation. We characterise conflicts in values between these different abstractions of moral evaluation as hypocrisy. We found that both models displayed reasonable consistency within each instrument compared to humans, but they displayed contradictory and hypocritical behaviour when we compared the abstract values present in the MFQ to the evaluation of concrete moral violations of the MFV.</p>

<p>Abstract: The electric vehicle (EV) battery supply chain's vulnerability to disruptions necessitates advanced predictive analytics. We present SHIELD (Schema-based Hierarchical Induction for EV supply chain Disruption), a system integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with domain expertise for EV battery supply chain risk assessment. SHIELD combines: (1) LLM-driven schema learning to construct a comprehensive knowledge library, (2) a disruption analysis system utilizing fine-tuned language models for event extraction, multi-dimensional similarity matching for schema matching, and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) with logical constraints for prediction, and (3) an interactive interface for visualizing results and incorporating expert feedback to enhance decision-making. Evaluated on 12,070 paragraphs from 365 sources (2022-2023), SHIELD outperforms baseline GCNs and LLM+prompt methods (e.g., GPT-4o) in disruption prediction. These results demonstrate SHIELD's effectiveness in combining LLM capabilities with domain expertise for enhanced supply chain risk assessment.</p>

In this work, we introduce a novel formalism and structure for such procedural knowledge. Based on this formalism, we present a novel procedural knowledge dataset called LCStep, which we created from LangChain tutorials. To leverage this procedural knowledge to solve new tasks, we propose analogy-augmented generation (AAG), which draws inspiration from the human ability to assimilate past experiences to solve unfamiliar problems. AAG uses a custom procedure memory store to retrieve and adapt specialized domain knowledge to answer new procedural tasks. We demonstrate that AAG outperforms few-shot and RAG baselines on LCStep, RecipeNLG, and CHAMP datasets under a pairwise LLM-based evaluation, corroborated by human evaluation in the case of RecipeNLG.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Henri Arno, Paloma Rabaey, Thomas Demeester</p>
<p>Abstract: One of the central goals of causal machine learning is the accurate estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects from observational data. In recent years, meta-learning has emerged as a flexible, model-agnostic paradigm for estimating conditional average treatment effects (CATE) using any supervised model. This paper examines the performance of meta-learners when the confounding variables are expressed in text. Through synthetic data experiments, we show that learners using pre-trained text representations of confounders, in addition to tabular background variables, achieve improved CATE estimates compared to those relying solely on the tabular variables, particularly when sufficient data is available. However, due to the entangled nature of the text embeddings, these models do not fully match the performance of meta-learners with perfect confounder knowledge. These findings highlight both the potential and the limitations of pre-trained text representations for causal inference and open up interesting avenues for future research.</p>

<p>Abstract: AI agents are increasingly autonomous in their interactions with human users and tools, leading to increased interactional safety risks. We present HAICOSYSTEM, a framework examining AI agent safety within diverse and complex social interactions. HAICOSYSTEM features a modular sandbox environment that simulates multi-turn interactions between human users and AI agents, where the AI agents are equipped with a variety of tools (e.g., patient management platforms) to navigate diverse scenarios (e.g., a user attempting to access other patients' profiles). To examine the safety of AI agents in these interactions, we develop a comprehensive multi-dimensional evaluation framework that uses metrics covering operational, content-related, societal, and legal risks. Through running 1840 simulations based on 92 scenarios across seven domains (e.g., healthcare, finance, education), we demonstrate that HAICOSYSTEM can emulate realistic user-AI interactions and complex tool use by AI agents. Our experiments show that state-of-the-art LLMs, both proprietary and open-sourced, exhibit safety risks in over 50\% cases, with models generally showing higher risks when interacting with simulated malicious users. Our findings highlight the ongoing challenge of building agents that can safely navigate complex interactions, particularly when faced with malicious users. To foster the AI agent safety ecosystem, we release a code platform that allows practitioners to create custom scenarios, simulate interactions, and evaluate the safety and performance of their agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifei Liu, Jicheng Wen, Yang Wang, Shengyu Ye, Li Lyna Zhang, Ting Cao, Cheng Li, Mao Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Scaling model size significantly challenges the deployment and inference of Large Language Models (LLMs). Due to the redundancy in LLM weights, recent research has focused on pushing weight-only quantization to extremely low-bit (even down to 2 bits). It reduces memory requirements, optimizes storage costs, and decreases memory bandwidth needs during inference. However, due to numerical representation limitations, traditional scalar-based weight quantization struggles to achieve such extreme low-bit. Recent research on Vector Quantization (VQ) for LLMs has demonstrated the potential for extremely low-bit model quantization by compressing vectors into indices using lookup tables.
  In this paper, we introduce Vector Post-Training Quantization (VPTQ) for extremely low-bit quantization of LLMs. We use Second-Order Optimization to formulate the LLM VQ problem and guide our quantization algorithm design by solving the optimization. We further refine the weights using Channel-Independent Second-Order Optimization for a granular VQ. In addition, by decomposing the optimization problem, we propose a brief and effective codebook initialization algorithm. We also extend VPTQ to support residual and outlier quantization, which enhances model accuracy and further compresses the model. Our experimental results show that VPTQ reduces model quantization perplexity by $0.01$-$0.34$ on LLaMA-2, $0.38$-$0.68$ on Mistral-7B, $4.41$-$7.34$ on LLaMA-3 over SOTA at 2-bit, with an average accuracy improvement of $0.79$-$1.5\%$ on LLaMA-2, $1\%$ on Mistral-7B, $11$-$22\%$ on LLaMA-3 on QA tasks on average. We only utilize $10.4$-$18.6\%$ of the quantization algorithm execution time, resulting in a $1.6$-$1.8\times$ increase in inference throughput compared to SOTA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaoqing Zhang, Zhuosheng Zhang, Kehai Chen, Xinbei Ma, Muyun Yang, Tiejun Zhao, Min Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has spurred considerable interest in advancing autonomous LLMs-based agents, particularly in intriguing applications within smartphone graphical user interfaces (GUIs). When presented with a task goal, these agents typically emulate human actions within a GUI environment until the task is completed. However, a key challenge lies in devising effective plans to guide action prediction in GUI tasks, though planning have been widely recognized as effective for decomposing complex tasks into a series of steps. Specifically, given the dynamic nature of environmental GUIs following action execution, it is crucial to dynamically adapt plans based on environmental feedback and action history.We show that the widely-used ReAct approach fails due to the excessively long historical dialogues. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach called Dynamic Planning of Thoughts (D-PoT) for LLM-based GUI agents.D-PoT involves the dynamic adjustment of planning based on the environmental feedback and execution history. Experimental results reveal that the proposed D-PoT significantly surpassed the strong GPT-4V baseline by +12.7% (34.66% $\rightarrow$ 47.36%) in accuracy. The analysis highlights the generality of dynamic planning in different backbone LLMs, as well as the benefits in mitigating hallucinations and adapting to unseen tasks.

<p>Abstract: There is an increasing body of work using Large Language Models (LLMs) as agents for orchestrating workflows and making decisions in domains that require planning and multi-step reasoning. As a result, it is imperative to evaluate LLMs on core skills required for planning. In this work, we present ACPBench, a benchmark for evaluating the reasoning tasks in the field of planning. The benchmark consists of 7 reasoning tasks over 13 planning domains. The collection is constructed from planning domains described in a formal language. This allows us to synthesize problems with provably correct solutions across many tasks and domains. Further, it allows us the luxury of scale without additional human effort, i.e., many additional problems can be created automatically. Our extensive evaluation of 22 LLMs and OpenAI o1 reasoning models highlights the significant gap in the reasoning capability of the LLMs. Our findings with OpenAI o1, a multi-turn reasoning model, reveal significant gains in performance on multiple-choice questions, yet surprisingly, no notable progress is made on boolean questions.

In this paper, the PCA method is employed initially to downscale the city evaluation indexes, extract the key principal components, and then downscale the data using the KMO and TOPSIS algorithms, all of which are based on the MindSpore framework. Secondly, for the dataset that does not pass the KMO test, the entropy weight method and TOPSIS method will be employed for comprehensive evaluation. Finally, a route planning algorithm is proposed and optimised based on the greedy algorithm, which provides personalised route customisation according to the different needs of tourists. In addition, the local travelling efficiency, the time required to visit tourist attractions and the necessary daily breaks are considered in order to reduce the cost and avoid falling into the locally optimal solution.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juyeon Heo, Christina Heinze-Deml, Oussama Elachqar, Shirley Ren, Udhay Nallasamy, Andy Miller, Kwan Ho Ryan Chan, Jaya Narain</p>
<p>Abstract: Instruction-following is crucial for building AI agents with large language models (LLMs), as these models must adhere strictly to user-provided constraints and guidelines. However, LLMs often fail to follow even simple and clear instructions. To improve instruction-following behavior and prevent undesirable outputs, a deeper understanding of how LLMs' internal states relate to these outcomes is required. Our analysis of LLM internal states reveal a dimension in the input embedding space linked to successful instruction-following. We demonstrate that modifying representations along this dimension improves instruction-following success rates compared to random changes, without compromising response quality. Further investigation reveals that this dimension is more closely related to the phrasing of prompts rather than the inherent difficulty of the task or instructions. This discovery also suggests explanations for why LLMs sometimes fail to follow clear instructions and why prompt engineering is often effective, even when the content remains largely unchanged. This work provides insight into the internal workings of LLMs' instruction-following, paving the way for reliable LLM agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juyeon Heo, Miao Xiong, Christina Heinze-Deml, Jaya Narain</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) could be valuable personal AI agents across various domains, provided they can precisely follow user instructions. However, recent studies have shown significant limitations in LLMs' instruction-following capabilities, raising concerns about their reliability in high-stakes applications. Accurately estimating LLMs' uncertainty in adhering to instructions is critical to mitigating deployment risks. We present, to our knowledge, the first systematic evaluation of the uncertainty estimation abilities of LLMs in the context of instruction-following. Our study identifies key challenges with existing instruction-following benchmarks, where multiple factors are entangled with uncertainty stems from instruction-following, complicating the isolation and comparison across methods and models. To address these issues, we introduce a controlled evaluation setup with two benchmark versions of data, enabling a comprehensive comparison of uncertainty estimation methods under various conditions. Our findings show that existing uncertainty methods struggle, particularly when models make subtle errors in instruction following. While internal model states provide some improvement, they remain inadequate in more complex scenarios. The insights from our controlled evaluation setups provide a crucial understanding of LLMs' limitations and potential for uncertainty estimation in instruction-following tasks, paving the way for more trustworthy AI agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihui Wu, Haichang Gao, Ping Wang, Shudong Zhang, Zhaoxiang Liu, Shiguo Lian</p>
<p>Abstract: Glitch tokens in Large Language Models (LLMs) can trigger unpredictable behaviors, compromising model reliability and safety. Existing detection methods often rely on manual observation to infer the prior distribution of glitch tokens, which is inefficient and lacks adaptability across diverse model architectures. To address these limitations, we introduce GlitchMiner, a gradient-based discrete optimization framework designed for efficient glitch token detection in LLMs. GlitchMiner leverages an entropy-based loss function to quantify the uncertainty in model predictions and integrates first-order Taylor approximation with a local search strategy to effectively explore the token space. Our evaluation across various mainstream LLM architectures demonstrates that GlitchMiner surpasses existing methods in both detection precision and adaptability. In comparison to the previous state-of-the-art, GlitchMiner achieves an average improvement of 19.07% in precision@1000 for glitch token detection. By enabling efficient detection of glitch tokens, GlitchMiner provides a valuable tool for assessing and mitigating potential vulnerabilities in LLMs, contributing to their overall security.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fnu Neha, Arvind K. Bansal</p>
<p>Abstract: Renal tumors, especially renal cell carcinoma (RCC), show significant heterogeneity, posing challenges for diagnosis using radiology images such as MRI, echocardiograms, and CT scans. U-Net based deep learning techniques are emerging as a promising approach for automated medical image segmentation for minimally invasive diagnosis of renal tumors. However, current techniques need further improvements in accuracy to become clinically useful to radiologists. In this study, we present an improved U-Net based model for end-to-end automated semantic segmentation of CT scan images to identify renal tumors. The model uses residual connections across convolution layers, integrates a multi-layer feature fusion (MFF) and cross-channel attention (CCA) within encoder blocks, and incorporates skip connections augmented with additional information derived using MFF and CCA. We evaluated our model on the KiTS19 dataset, which contains data from 210 patients. For kidney segmentation, our model achieves a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 0.97 and a Jaccard index (JI) of 0.95. For renal tumor segmentation, our model achieves a DSC of 0.96 and a JI of 0.91. Based on a comparison of available DSC scores, our model outperforms the current leading models.</p>

<p>Abstract: As machine intelligence evolves, the need to test and compare the problem-solving abilities of different AI models grows. However, current benchmarks are often overly simplistic, allowing models to perform uniformly well, making it difficult to distinguish their capabilities. Additionally, benchmarks typically rely on static question-answer pairs, which models might memorize or guess. To address these limitations, we introduce the Dynamic Intelligence Assessment (DIA), a novel methodology for testing AI models using dynamic question templates and improved metrics across multiple disciplines such as mathematics, cryptography, cybersecurity, and computer science. The accompanying DIA-Bench dataset, which includes 150 diverse and challenging task templates with mutable parameters, is presented in various formats such as text, PDFs, compiled binaries, and visual puzzles. Our framework introduces four new metrics to assess a model's reliability and confidence across multiple attempts. These metrics revealed that even simple questions are frequently answered incorrectly when posed in varying forms, highlighting significant gaps in models' reliability. Notably, models like GPT-4o tended to overestimate their mathematical abilities, while ChatGPT-4o demonstrated better decision-making and performance through effective tool usage. We evaluated eight state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) using DIA-Bench, showing that current models struggle with complex tasks and often display unexpectedly low confidence, even with simpler questions. The DIA framework sets a new standard for assessing not only problem-solving but also a model's adaptive intelligence and ability to assess its own limitations. The dataset is publicly available on our project's website.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jo\~ao Pedro Fernandes Torres, Catherine Mulligan, Joaquim Jorge, Catarina Moreira</p>
<p>Abstract: The growing volume of academic publications poses significant challenges for researchers conducting timely and accurate Systematic Literature Reviews, particularly in fast-evolving fields like artificial intelligence. This growth of academic literature also makes it increasingly difficult for lay people to access scientific knowledge effectively, meaning academic literature is often misrepresented in the popular press and, more broadly, in society. Traditional SLR methods are labor-intensive and error-prone, and they struggle to keep up with the rapid pace of new research. To address these issues, we developed \textit{PROMPTHEUS}: an AI-driven pipeline solution that automates the SLR process using Large Language Models. We aimed to enhance efficiency by reducing the manual workload while maintaining the precision and coherence required for comprehensive literature synthesis. PROMPTHEUS automates key stages of the SLR process, including systematic search, data extraction, topic modeling using BERTopic, and summarization with transformer models. Evaluations conducted across five research domains demonstrate that PROMPTHEUS reduces review time, achieves high precision, and provides coherent topic organization, offering a scalable and effective solution for conducting literature reviews in an increasingly crowded research landscape. In addition, such tools may reduce the increasing mistrust in science by making summarization more accessible to laypeople.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeremy Stephen Gabriel Yee, Pai Chet Ng, Zhengkui Wang, Ian McLoughlin, Aik Beng Ng, Simon See</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a systematic review of the infrastructure requirements for deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) on-device within the context of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), focusing on both hardware and software perspectives. From the hardware viewpoint, we discuss the utilization of processing units like GPUs and TPUs, efficient memory and storage solutions, and strategies for effective deployment, addressing the challenges of limited computational resources typical in SME settings. From the software perspective, we explore framework compatibility, operating system optimization, and the use of specialized libraries tailored for resource-constrained environments. The review is structured to first identify the unique challenges faced by SMEs in deploying LLMs on-device, followed by an exploration of the opportunities that both hardware innovations and software adaptations offer to overcome these obstacles. Such a structured review provides practical insights, contributing significantly to the community by enhancing the technological resilience of SMEs in integrating LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alejandro Guerrero-L\'opez, Carlos Sevilla-Salcedo, Vanessa G\'omez-Verdejo, Pablo M. Olmos</p>
<p>Abstract: Purpose: Handling heterogeneous and mixed data types has become increasingly critical with the exponential growth in real-world databases. While deep generative models attempt to merge diverse data views into a common latent space, they often sacrifice interpretability, flexibility, and modularity. This study proposes a novel method to address these limitations by combining Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs) with a Factor Analysis latent space (FA-VAE).
  Methods: The proposed FA-VAE method employs multiple VAEs to learn a private representation for each heterogeneous data view in a continuous latent space. Information is shared between views using a low-dimensional latent space, generated via a linear projection matrix. This modular design creates a hierarchical dependency between private and shared latent spaces, allowing for the flexible addition of new views and conditioning of pre-trained models.
  Results: The FA-VAE approach facilitates cross-generation of data from different domains and enables transfer learning between generative models. This allows for effective integration of information across diverse data views while preserving their distinct characteristics.
  Conclusions: By overcoming the limitations of existing methods, the FA-VAE provides a more interpretable, flexible, and modular solution for managing heterogeneous data types. It offers a pathway to more efficient and scalable data-handling strategies, enhancing the potential for cross-domain data synthesis and model transferability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jangwon Suh, Jimyeong Kim, Euna Jung, Wonjong Rhee</p>
<p>Abstract: The performance of cardiac arrhythmia detection with electrocardiograms(ECGs) has been considerably improved since the introduction of deep learning models. In practice, the high performance alone is not sufficient and a proper explanation is also required. Recently, researchers have started adopting feature attribution methods to address this requirement, but it has been unclear which of the methods are appropriate for ECG. In this work, we identify and customize three evaluation metrics for feature attribution methods based on the characteristics of ECG: localization score, pointing game, and degradation score. Using the three evaluation metrics, we evaluate and analyze eleven widely-used feature attribution methods. We find that some of the feature attribution methods are much more adequate for explaining ECG, where Grad-CAM outperforms the second-best method by a large margin.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jihoon Ko, Shinhwan Kang, Taehyung Kwon, Heechan Moon, Kijung Shin</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) is the process of learning ceaselessly a sequence of tasks. Most existing CL methods deal with independent data (e.g., images and text) for which many benchmark frameworks and results under standard experimental settings are available. Compared to them, however, CL methods for graph data (graph CL) are relatively underexplored because of (a) the lack of standard experimental settings, especially regarding how to deal with the dependency between instances, (b) the lack of benchmark datasets and scenarios, and (c) high complexity in implementation and evaluation due to the dependency. In this paper, regarding (a) we define four standard incremental settings (task-, class-, domain-, and time-incremental) for node-, link-, and graph-level problems, extending the previously explored scope. Regarding (b), we provide 35 benchmark scenarios based on 24 real-world graphs. Regarding (c), we develop BeGin, an easy and fool-proof framework for graph CL. BeGin is easily extended since it is modularized with reusable modules for data processing, algorithm design, and evaluation. Especially, the evaluation module is completely separated from user code to eliminate potential mistakes. Regarding benchmark results, we cover 3x more combinations of incremental settings and levels of problems than the latest benchmark. All assets for the benchmark framework are publicly available at https://github.com/ShinhwanKang/BeGin.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amirhossein Zolfagharian, Manel Abdellatif, Lionel C. Briand, Ramesh S</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has made significant advancements in various fields, such as autonomous driving, healthcare, and robotics, by enabling agents to learn optimal policies through interactions with their environments. However, the application of DRL in safety-critical domains presents challenges, particularly concerning the safety of the learned policies. DRL agents, which are focused on maximizing rewards, may select unsafe actions, leading to safety violations. Runtime safety monitoring is thus essential to ensure the safe operation of these agents, especially in unpredictable and dynamic environments. This paper introduces SMARLA, a black-box safety monitoring approach specifically designed for DRL agents. SMARLA utilizes machine learning to predict safety violations by observing the agent's behavior during execution. The approach is based on Q-values, which reflect the expected reward for taking actions in specific states. SMARLA employs state abstraction to reduce the complexity of the state space, enhancing the predictive capabilities of the monitoring model. Such abstraction enables the early detection of unsafe states, allowing for the implementation of corrective and preventive measures before incidents occur. We quantitatively and qualitatively validated SMARLA on three well-known case studies widely used in DRL research. Empirical results reveal that SMARLA is accurate at predicting safety violations, with a low false positive rate, and can predict violations at an early stage, approximately halfway through the execution of the agent, before violations occur. We also discuss different decision criteria, based on confidence intervals of the predicted violation probabilities, to trigger safety mechanisms aiming at a trade-off between early detection and low false positive rates.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Urszula Chajewska, Harsh Shrivastava</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) addresses the need to create models based on proprietary data in such a way that multiple clients retain exclusive control over their data, while all benefit from improved model accuracy due to pooled resources. Recently proposed Neural Graphical Models (NGMs) are Probabilistic Graphical models that utilize the expressive power of neural networks to learn complex non-linear dependencies between the input features. They learn to capture the underlying data distribution and have efficient algorithms for inference and sampling. We develop a FL framework which maintains a global NGM model that learns the averaged information from the local NGM models while keeping the training data within the client's environment. Our design, FedNGMs, avoids the pitfalls and shortcomings of neuron matching frameworks like Federated Matched Averaging that suffers from model parameter explosion. Our global model size remains constant throughout the process. In the cases where clients have local variables that are not part of the combined global distribution, we propose a `Stitching' algorithm, which personalizes the global NGM models by merging the additional variables using the client's data. FedNGM is robust to data heterogeneity, large number of participants, and limited communication bandwidth. We experimentally demonstrated the use of FedNGMs for extracting insights from CDC's Infant Mortality dataset and discuss interesting future applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce StochGradAdam, a novel optimizer designed as an extension of the Adam algorithm, incorporating stochastic gradient sampling techniques to improve computational efficiency while maintaining robust performance. StochGradAdam optimizes by selectively sampling a subset of gradients during training, reducing the computational cost while preserving the advantages of adaptive learning rates and bias corrections found in Adam. Our experimental results, applied to image classification and segmentation tasks, demonstrate that StochGradAdam can achieve comparable or superior performance to Adam, even when using fewer gradient updates per iteration. By focusing on key gradient updates, StochGradAdam offers stable convergence and enhanced exploration of the loss landscape, while mitigating the impact of noisy gradients. The results suggest that this approach is particularly effective for large-scale models and datasets, providing a promising alternative to traditional optimization techniques for deep learning applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Binary code analysis is the foundation of crucial tasks in the security domain; thus building effective binary analysis techniques is more important than ever. Large language models (LLMs) although have brought impressive improvement to source code tasks, do not directly generalize to assembly code due to the unique challenges of assembly: (1) the low information density of assembly and (2) the diverse optimizations in assembly code. To overcome these challenges, this work proposes a hierarchical attention mechanism that builds attention summaries to capture the semantics more effectively and designs contrastive learning objectives to train LLMs to learn assembly optimization. Equipped with these techniques, this work develops Nova, a generative LLM for assembly code. Nova outperforms existing techniques on binary code decompilation by up to 14.84 -- 21.58% (absolute percentage point improvement) higher Pass@1 and Pass@10, and outperforms the latest binary code similarity detection techniques by up to 6.17% Recall@1, showing promising abilities on both assembly generation and understanding tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maresa Schr\"oder, Dennis Frauen, Stefan Feuerriegel</p>
<p>Abstract: Fairness for machine learning predictions is widely required in practice for legal, ethical, and societal reasons. Existing work typically focuses on settings without unobserved confounding, even though unobserved confounding can lead to severe violations of causal fairness and, thus, unfair predictions. In this work, we analyze the sensitivity of causal fairness to unobserved confounding. Our contributions are three-fold. First, we derive bounds for causal fairness metrics under different sources of unobserved confounding. This enables practitioners to examine the sensitivity of their machine learning models to unobserved confounding in fairness-critical applications. Second, we propose a novel neural framework for learning fair predictions, which allows us to offer worst-case guarantees of the extent to which causal fairness can be violated due to unobserved confounding. Third, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in a series of experiments, including a real-world case study about predicting prison sentences. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first work to study causal fairness under unobserved confounding. To this end, our work is of direct practical value as a refutation strategy to ensure the fairness of predictions in high-stakes applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mois\'es Santos, Andr\'e de Carvalho, Carlos Soares</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series forecasting is a subject of significant scientific and industrial importance. Despite the widespread utilization of forecasting methods, there is a dearth of research aimed at comprehending the conditions under which these methods yield favorable or unfavorable performances. Empirical studies, although common, are challenged by the limited availability of time series datasets, restricting the extraction of reliable insights. To address this limitation, we present tsMorph, a tool for generating semi-synthetic time series through dataset morphing. tsMorph works by creating a sequence of datasets from two original datasets. The characteristics of the generated datasets progressively depart from those of one of the datasets and converge toward the attributes of the other dataset. This method provides a valuable alternative for obtaining substantial datasets. In this paper, we show the benefits of tsMorph by assessing the predictive performance of the Long Short-Term Memory Network and DeepAR forecasting algorithms. The time series used for the experiments comes from the NN5 Competition. The experimental results provide important insights. Notably, the performances of the two algorithms improve proportionally with the frequency of the time series. These experiments confirm that tsMorph can be an effective tool for better understanding the behavior of forecasting algorithms, delivering a pathway to overcoming the limitations posed by empirical studies and enabling more extensive and reliable experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tung Nguyen, Rohan Shah, Hritik Bansal, Troy Arcomano, Romit Maulik, Veerabhadra Kotamarthi, Ian Foster, Sandeep Madireddy, Aditya Grover</p>
<p>Abstract: Weather forecasting is a fundamental problem for anticipating and mitigating the impacts of climate change. Recently, data-driven approaches for weather forecasting based on deep learning have shown great promise, achieving accuracies that are competitive with operational systems. However, those methods often employ complex, customized architectures without sufficient ablation analysis, making it difficult to understand what truly contributes to their success. Here we introduce Stormer, a simple transformer model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on weather forecasting with minimal changes to the standard transformer backbone. We identify the key components of Stormer through careful empirical analyses, including weather-specific embedding, randomized dynamics forecast, and pressure-weighted loss. At the core of Stormer is a randomized forecasting objective that trains the model to forecast the weather dynamics over varying time intervals. During inference, this allows us to produce multiple forecasts for a target lead time and combine them to obtain better forecast accuracy. On WeatherBench 2, Stormer performs competitively at short to medium-range forecasts and outperforms current methods beyond 7 days, while requiring orders-of-magnitude less training data and compute. Additionally, we demonstrate Stormer's favorable scaling properties, showing consistent improvements in forecast accuracy with increases in model size and training tokens.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cornelius Brand, Robert Ganian, Subrahmanyam Kalyanasundaram, Fionn Mc Inerney</p>
<p>Abstract: Atomic congestion games are a classic topic in network design, routing, and algorithmic game theory, and are capable of modeling congestion and flow optimization tasks in various application areas. While both the price of anarchy for such games as well as the computational complexity of computing their Nash equilibria are by now well-understood, the computational complexity of computing a system-optimal set of strategies -- that is, a centrally planned routing that minimizes the average cost of agents -- is severely understudied in the literature. We close this gap by identifying the exact boundaries of tractability for the problem through the lens of the parameterized complexity paradigm. After showing that the problem remains highly intractable even on extremely simple networks, we obtain a set of results which demonstrate that the structural parameters which control the computational (in)tractability of the problem are not vertex-separator based in nature (such as, e.g., treewidth), but rather based on edge separators. We conclude by extending our analysis towards the (even more challenging) min-max variant of the problem.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mang Ye, Shuoyi Chen, Chenyue Li, Wei-Shi Zheng, David Crandall, Bo Du</p>
<p>Abstract: Object Re-identification (Re-ID) aims to identify specific objects across different times and scenes, which is a widely researched task in computer vision. For a prolonged period, this field has been predominantly driven by deep learning technology based on convolutional neural networks. In recent years, the emergence of Vision Transformers has spurred a growing number of studies delving deeper into Transformer-based Re-ID, continuously breaking performance records and witnessing significant progress in the Re-ID field. Offering a powerful, flexible, and unified solution, Transformers cater to a wide array of Re-ID tasks with unparalleled efficacy. This paper provides a comprehensive review and in-depth analysis of the Transformer-based Re-ID. In categorizing existing works into Image/Video-Based Re-ID, Re-ID with limited data/annotations, Cross-Modal Re-ID, and Special Re-ID Scenarios, we thoroughly elucidate the advantages demonstrated by the Transformer in addressing a multitude of challenges across these domains. Considering the trending unsupervised Re-ID, we propose a new Transformer baseline, UntransReID, achieving state-of-the-art performance on both single/cross modal tasks. For the under-explored animal Re-ID, we devise a standardized experimental benchmark and conduct extensive experiments to explore the applicability of Transformer for this task and facilitate future research. Finally, we discuss some important yet under-investigated open issues in the large foundation model era, we believe it will serve as a new handbook for researchers in this field.

However, RLHF relies on a reward model that is trained with a limited amount of human preference data, which could lead to inaccurate predictions. As a result, RLHF may produce outputs that are misaligned with human values. To mitigate this issue, we contribute a reward ensemble method that allows the reward model to make more accurate predictions. As using an ensemble of large language model-based reward models can be computationally and resource-expensive, we explore efficient ensemble methods including linear-layer ensemble and LoRA-based ensemble. Empirically, we run Best-of-$n$ and Proximal Policy Optimization with our ensembled reward models, and verify that our ensemble methods help improve the alignment performance of RLHF outputs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyi Zhu, Yating Wang, Di Huang, Weicai Ye, Wanli Ouyang, Tong He</p>
<p>Abstract: In robot learning, the observation space is crucial due to the distinct characteristics of different modalities, which can potentially become a bottleneck alongside policy design. In this study, we explore the influence of various observation spaces on robot learning, focusing on three predominant modalities: RGB, RGB-D, and point cloud. We introduce OBSBench, a benchmark comprising two simulators and 125 tasks, along with standardized pipelines for various encoders and policy baselines. Extensive experiments on diverse contact-rich manipulation tasks reveal a notable trend: point cloud-based methods, even those with the simplest designs, frequently outperform their RGB and RGB-D counterparts. This trend persists in both scenarios: training from scratch and utilizing pre-training. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that point cloud observations often yield better policy performance and significantly stronger generalization capabilities across various geometric and visual conditions. These outcomes suggest that the 3D point cloud is a valuable observation modality for intricate robotic tasks. We also suggest that incorporating both appearance and coordinate information can enhance the performance of point cloud methods. We hope our work provides valuable insights and guidance for designing more generalizable and robust robotic models. Codes are available at https://github.com/HaoyiZhu/PointCloudMatters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhihan Zhou, Weimin Wu, Harrison Ho, Jiayi Wang, Lizhen Shi, Ramana V Davuluri, Zhong Wang, Han Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce DNABERT-S, a tailored genome model that develops species-aware embeddings to naturally cluster and segregate DNA sequences of different species in the embedding space. Differentiating species from genomic sequences (i.e., DNA and RNA) is vital yet challenging, since many real-world species remain uncharacterized, lacking known genomes for reference. Embedding-based methods are therefore used to differentiate species in an unsupervised manner. DNABERT-S builds upon a pre-trained genome foundation model named DNABERT-2. To encourage effective embeddings to error-prone long-read DNA sequences, we introduce Manifold Instance Mixup (MI-Mix), a contrastive objective that mixes the hidden representations of DNA sequences at randomly selected layers and trains the model to recognize and differentiate these mixed proportions at the output layer. We further enhance it with the proposed Curriculum Contrastive Learning (C$^2$LR) strategy. Empirical results on 23 diverse datasets show DNABERT-S's effectiveness, especially in realistic label-scarce scenarios. For example, it identifies twice more species from a mixture of unlabeled genomic sequences, doubles the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) in species clustering, and outperforms the top baseline's performance in 10-shot species classification with just a 2-shot training.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Harsh Shrivastava</p>
<p>Abstract: We discovered that the neural networks, especially the deep ReLU networks, demonstrate an `over-generalization' phenomenon. That is, the output values for the inputs that were not seen during training are mapped close to the output range that were observed during the learning process. In other words, the neural networks learn a many-to-one mapping and this effect is more prominent as we increase the number of layers or the depth of the neural network. We utilize this property of neural networks to design a dataset kaleidoscope, termed as `Generative Kaleidoscopic Networks'. Succinctly, if we learn a model to map from input $x\in\mathbb{R}^D$ to itself $f_\mathcal{N}(x)\rightarrow x$, the proposed `Kaleidoscopic sampling' procedure starts with a random input noise $z\in\mathbb{R}^D$ and recursively applies $f_\mathcal{N}(\cdots f_\mathcal{N}(z)\cdots )$. After a burn-in period duration, we start observing samples from the input distribution and the quality of samples recovered improves as we increase the depth of the model. Scope: We observed this phenomenon to various degrees for the other deep learning architectures like CNNs, Transformers & U-Nets and we are currently investigating them further.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Priyam Sahoo, Saurabh Pujar, Ganesh Nalawade, Richard Gebhardt, Louis Mandel, Luca Buratti</p>
<p>Abstract: The availability of Large Language Models (LLMs) which can generate code, has made it possible to create tools that improve developer productivity. Integrated development environments or IDEs which developers use to write software are often used as an interface to interact with LLMs. Although many such tools have been released, almost all of them focus on general-purpose programming languages. Domain-specific languages, such as those crucial for Information Technology (IT) automation, have not received much attention. Ansible is one such YAML-based IT automation-specific language. Ansible Lightspeed is an LLM-based service designed explicitly to generate Ansible YAML, given natural language prompt.
  In this paper, we present the design and implementation of the Ansible Lightspeed service. We then evaluate its utility to developers using diverse indicators, including extended utilization, analysis of user edited suggestions, as well as user sentiments analysis. The evaluation is based on data collected for 10,696 real users including 3,910 returning users. The code for Ansible Lightspeed service and the analysis framework is made available for others to use.
  To our knowledge, our study is the first to involve thousands of users of code assistants for domain-specific languages. We are also the first code completion tool to present N-Day user retention figures, which is 13.66% on Day 30. We propose an improved version of user acceptance rate, called Strong Acceptance rate, where a suggestion is considered accepted only if less than 50% of it is edited and these edits do not change critical parts of the suggestion. By focusing on Ansible, Lightspeed is able to achieve a strong acceptance rate of 49.08% for multi-line Ansible task suggestions. With our findings we provide insights into the effectiveness of small, dedicated models in a domain-specific context.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicolas Brieu, Nicolas Triltsch, Philipp Wortmann, Dominik Winter, Shashank Saran, Marlon Rebelatto, G\"unter Schmidt</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative models enable the translation from a source image domain where readily trained models are available to a target domain unseen during training. While Cycle Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are well established, the associated cycle consistency constrain relies on that an invertible mapping exists between the two domains. This is, however, not the case for the translation between images stained with chromogenic monoplex and duplex immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays. Focusing on the translation from the latter to the first, we propose - through the introduction of a novel training design, an alternative constrain leveraging a set of immunofluorescence (IF) images as an auxiliary unpaired image domain. Quantitative and qualitative results on a downstream segmentation task show the benefit of the proposed method in comparison to baseline approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhipeng Zhao, Bowen Li, Yi Du, Taimeng Fu, Chen Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Motion prediction is critical for autonomous off-road driving, however, it presents significantly more challenges than on-road driving because of the complex interaction between the vehicle and the terrain. Traditional physics-based approaches encounter difficulties in accurately modeling dynamic systems and external disturbance. In contrast, data-driven neural networks require extensive datasets and struggle with explicitly capturing the fundamental physical laws, which can easily lead to poor generalization. By merging the advantages of both methods, neuro-symbolic approaches present a promising direction. These methods embed physical laws into neural models, potentially significantly improving generalization capabilities. However, no prior works were evaluated in real-world settings for off-road driving. To bridge this gap, we present PhysORD, a neural-symbolic approach integrating the conservation law, i.e., the Euler-Lagrange equation, into data-driven neural models for motion prediction in off-road driving. Our experiments showed that PhysORD can accurately predict vehicle motion and tolerate external disturbance by modeling uncertainties. The learned dynamics model achieves 46.7% higher accuracy using only 3.1% of the parameters compared to data-driven methods, demonstrating the data efficiency and superior generalization ability of our neural-symbolic method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fatima Ezzeddine, Omran Ayoub, Silvia Giordano</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, there has been a notable increase in the deployment of machine learning (ML) models as services (MLaaS) across diverse production software applications. In parallel, explainable AI (XAI) continues to evolve, addressing the necessity for transparency and trustworthiness in ML models. XAI techniques aim to enhance the transparency of ML models by providing insights, in terms of model's explanations, into their decision-making process. Simultaneously, some MLaaS platforms now offer explanations alongside the ML prediction outputs. This setup has elevated concerns regarding vulnerabilities in MLaaS, particularly in relation to privacy leakage attacks such as model extraction attacks (MEA). This is due to the fact that explanations can unveil insights about the inner workings of the model which could be exploited by malicious users. In this work, we focus on investigating how model explanations, particularly counterfactual explanations (CFs), can be exploited for performing MEA within the MLaaS platform. We also delve into assessing the effectiveness of incorporating differential privacy (DP) as a mitigation strategy. To this end, we first propose a novel approach for MEA based on Knowledge Distillation (KD) to enhance the efficiency of extracting a substitute model of a target model exploiting CFs, without any knowledge about the training data distribution by the attacker. Then, we advise an approach for training CF generators incorporating DP to generate private CFs. We conduct thorough experimental evaluations on real-world datasets and demonstrate that our proposed KD-based MEA can yield a high-fidelity substitute model with a reduced number of queries with respect to baseline approaches. Furthermore, our findings reveal that including a privacy layer can allow mitigating the MEA. However, on the account of the quality of CFs, impacts the performance of the explanations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyuan He, Huiqiang Jiang, Zilong Wang, Yuqing Yang, Luna Qiu, Lili Qiu</p>
<p>Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) is significantly influenced by the quality of the prompts provided. In response, researchers have developed enormous prompt engineering strategies aimed at modifying the prompt text to enhance task performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel technique termed position engineering, which offers a more efficient way to guide large language models. Unlike prompt engineering, which requires substantial effort to modify the text provided to LLMs, position engineering merely involves altering the positional information in the prompt without modifying the text itself. We have evaluated position engineering in two widely-used LLM scenarios: retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and in-context learning (ICL). Our findings show that position engineering substantially improves upon the baseline in both cases. Position engineering thus represents a promising new strategy for exploiting the capabilities of large language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sebasti\'an Basterrech, Line Clemmensen, Gerardo Rubino</p>
<p>Abstract: Modeling non-stationary data is a challenging problem in the field of continual learning, and data distribution shifts may result in negative consequences on the performance of a machine learning model. Classic learning tools are often vulnerable to perturbations of the input covariates, and are sensitive to outliers and noise, and some tools are based on rigid algebraic assumptions. Distribution shifts are frequently occurring due to changes in raw materials for production, seasonality, a different user base, or even adversarial attacks. Therefore, there is a need for more effective distribution shift detection techniques. In this work, we propose a continual learning framework for monitoring and detecting distribution changes. We explore the problem in a latent space generated by a bio-inspired self-organizing clustering and statistical aspects of the latent space. In particular, we investigate the projections made by two topology-preserving maps: the Self-Organizing Map and the Scale Invariant Map. Our method can be applied in both a supervised and an unsupervised context. We construct the assessment of changes in the data distribution as a comparison of Gaussian signals, making the proposed method fast and robust. We compare it to other unsupervised techniques, specifically Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Kernel-PCA. Our comparison involves conducting experiments using sequences of images (based on MNIST and injected shifts with adversarial samples), chemical sensor measurements, and the environmental variable related to ozone levels. The empirical study reveals the potential of the proposed approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simone Brusatin, Tommaso Padoan, Andrea Coletta, Domenico Delli Gatti, Aldo Glielmo</p>
<p>Abstract: Agent-based models (ABMs) are simulation models used in economics to overcome some of the limitations of traditional frameworks based on general equilibrium assumptions. However, agents within an ABM follow predetermined 'bounded rational' behavioural rules which can be cumbersome to design and difficult to justify. Here we leverage multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) to expand the capabilities of ABMs with the introduction of 'fully rational' agents that learn their policy by interacting with the environment and maximising a reward function. Specifically, we propose a 'Rational macro ABM' (R-MABM) framework by extending a paradigmatic macro ABM from the economic literature. We show that gradually substituting ABM firms in the model with RL agents, trained to maximise profits, allows for studying the impact of rationality on the economy. We find that RL agents spontaneously learn three distinct strategies for maximising profits, with the optimal strategy depending on the level of market competition and rationality. We also find that RL agents with independent policies, and without the ability to communicate with each other, spontaneously learn to segregate into different strategic groups, thus increasing market power and overall profits. Finally, we find that a higher number of rational (RL) agents in the economy always improves the macroeconomic environment as measured by total output. Depending on the specific rational policy, this can come at the cost of higher instability. Our R-MABM framework allows for stable multi-agent learning, is available in open source, and represents a principled and robust direction to extend economic simulators.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingyuan Wu, Simon Sinong Zhan, Yixuan Wang, Yuhui Wang, Chung-Wei Lin, Chen Lv, Qi Zhu, Chao Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: In environments with delayed observation, state augmentation by including actions within the delay window is adopted to retrieve Markovian property to enable reinforcement learning (RL). However, state-of-the-art (SOTA) RL techniques with Temporal-Difference (TD) learning frameworks often suffer from learning inefficiency, due to the significant expansion of the augmented state space with the delay. To improve learning efficiency without sacrificing performance, this work introduces a novel framework called Variational Delayed Policy Optimization (VDPO), which reformulates delayed RL as a variational inference problem. This problem is further modelled as a two-step iterative optimization problem, where the first step is TD learning in the delay-free environment with a small state space, and the second step is behaviour cloning which can be addressed much more efficiently than TD learning. We not only provide a theoretical analysis of VDPO in terms of sample complexity and performance, but also empirically demonstrate that VDPO can achieve consistent performance with SOTA methods, with a significant enhancement of sample efficiency (approximately 50\% less amount of samples) in the MuJoCo benchmark.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenyu Du, Tongxu Luo, Zihan Qiu, Zeyu Huang, Yikang Shen, Reynold Cheng, Yike Guo, Jie Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: LLMs are computationally expensive to pre-train due to their large scale. Model growth emerges as a promising approach by leveraging smaller models to accelerate the training of larger ones. However, the viability of these model growth methods in efficient LLM pre-training remains underexplored. This work identifies three critical $\underline{\textit{O}}$bstacles: ($\textit{O}$1) lack of comprehensive evaluation, ($\textit{O}$2) untested viability for scaling, and ($\textit{O}$3) lack of empirical guidelines. To tackle $\textit{O}$1, we summarize existing approaches into four atomic growth operators and systematically evaluate them in a standardized LLM pre-training setting. Our findings reveal that a depthwise stacking operator, called $G_{\text{stack}}$, exhibits remarkable acceleration in training, leading to decreased loss and improved overall performance on eight standard NLP benchmarks compared to strong baselines. Motivated by these promising results, we conduct extensive experiments to delve deeper into $G_{\text{stack}}$ to address $\textit{O}$2 and $\textit{O}$3. For $\textit{O}$2 (untested scalability), our study shows that $G_{\text{stack}}$ is scalable and consistently performs well, with experiments up to 7B LLMs after growth and pre-training LLMs with 750B tokens. For example, compared to a conventionally trained 7B model using 300B tokens, our $G_{\text{stack}}$ model converges to the same loss with 194B tokens, resulting in a 54.6\% speedup. We further address $\textit{O}$3 (lack of empirical guidelines) by formalizing guidelines to determine growth timing and growth factor for $G_{\text{stack}}$, making it practical in general LLM pre-training. We also provide in-depth discussions and comprehensive ablation studies of $G_{\text{stack}}$. Our code and pre-trained model are available at https://llm-stacking.github.io.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chun-Mao Lai, Hsiang-Chun Wang, Ping-Chun Hsieh, Yu-Chiang Frank Wang, Min-Hung Chen, Shao-Hua Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Imitation learning aims to learn a policy from observing expert demonstrations without access to reward signals from environments. Generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) formulates imitation learning as adversarial learning, employing a generator policy learning to imitate expert behaviors and discriminator learning to distinguish the expert demonstrations from agent trajectories. Despite its encouraging results, GAIL training is often brittle and unstable. Inspired by the recent dominance of diffusion models in generative modeling, we propose Diffusion-Reward Adversarial Imitation Learning (DRAIL), which integrates a diffusion model into GAIL, aiming to yield more robust and smoother rewards for policy learning. Specifically, we propose a diffusion discriminative classifier to construct an enhanced discriminator, and design diffusion rewards based on the classifier's output for policy learning. Extensive experiments are conducted in navigation, manipulation, and locomotion, verifying DRAIL's effectiveness compared to prior imitation learning methods. Moreover, additional experimental results demonstrate the generalizability and data efficiency of DRAIL. Visualized learned reward functions of GAIL and DRAIL suggest that DRAIL can produce more robust and smoother rewards. Project page: https://nturobotlearninglab.github.io/DRAIL/</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Harikrishna Narasimhan, Wittawat Jitkrittum, Ankit Singh Rawat, Seungyeon Kim, Neha Gupta, Aditya Krishna Menon, Sanjiv Kumar</p>
<p>Abstract: Cascades and speculative decoding are two common approaches to improving language models' inference efficiency. Both approaches involve interleaving models of different sizes, but via fundamentally distinct mechanisms: cascades employ a deferral rule that invokes the larger model only for "hard" inputs, while speculative decoding uses speculative execution to primarily invoke the larger model in parallel verification mode. These mechanisms offer different benefits: empirically, cascades offer better cost-quality trade-offs, often even outperforming the large model, while theoretically, speculative decoding offers a guarantee of quality-neutrality. In this paper, we leverage the best of both these approaches by designing new speculative cascading techniques that implement their deferral rule through speculative execution. We characterize the optimal deferral rule for our speculative cascades, and employ a plug-in approximation to the optimal rule. Experiments with Gemma and T5 models on a range of language benchmarks show that our approach yields better cost quality trade-offs than cascading and speculative decoding baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Katarina Petrovi\'c, Shenyang Huang, Farimah Poursafaei, Petar Veli\v{c}kovi\'c</p>
<p>Abstract: Evolving relations in real-world networks are often modelled by temporal graphs. Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) emerged to model evolutionary behaviour of such graphs by leveraging the message passing primitive at the core of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). It is well-known that GNNs are vulnerable to several issues directly related to the input graph topology, such as under-reaching and over-squashing - we argue that these issues can often get exacerbated in temporal graphs, particularly as the result of stale nodes and edges. While graph rewiring techniques have seen frequent usage in GNNs to make the graph topology more favourable for message passing, they have not seen any mainstream usage on TGNNs. In this work, we propose Temporal Graph Rewiring (TGR), the first approach for graph rewiring on temporal graphs, to the best of our knowledge. TGR constructs message passing highways between temporally distant nodes in a continuous-time dynamic graph by utilizing expander graph propagation, a prominent framework used for graph rewiring on static graphs which makes minimal assumptions on the underlying graph structure. On the challenging TGB benchmark, TGR achieves state-of-the-art results on tgbl-review, tgbl-coin, tgbl-comment and tgbl-flight datasets at the time of writing. For tgbl-review, TGR has 50.5% improvement in MRR over the base TGN model and 22.2% improvement over the base TNCN model. The significant improvement over base models demonstrates clear benefits of temporal graph rewiring.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Justin Zhao, Flor Miriam Plaza-del-Arco, Benjie Genchel, Amanda Cercas Curry</p>
<p>Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to evolve, the search for efficient and meaningful evaluation methods is ongoing. Many recent evaluations use LLMs as judges to score outputs from other LLMs, often relying on a single large model like GPT-4o. However, using a single LLM judge is prone to intra-model bias, and many tasks - such as those related to emotional intelligence, creative writing, and persuasiveness - may be too subjective for a single model to judge fairly. We introduce the Language Model Council (LMC), where a group of LLMs collaborate to create tests, respond to them, and evaluate each other's responses to produce a ranking in a democratic fashion. Unlike previous approaches that focus on reducing cost or bias by using a panel of smaller models, our work examines the benefits and nuances of a fully inclusive LLM evaluation system. In a detailed case study on emotional intelligence, we deploy a council of 20 recent LLMs to rank each other on open-ended responses to interpersonal conflicts. Our results show that the LMC produces rankings that are more separable and more robust, and through a user study, we show that they are more consistent with human evaluations than any individual LLM judge. Using all LLMs for judging can be costly, however, so we use Monte Carlo simulations and hand-curated sub-councils to study hypothetical council compositions and discuss the value of the incremental LLM judge.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyan Wang, Xiaoming Huo, Hao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Contextual bandit algorithms are essential for solving real-world decision making problems. In practice, collecting a contextual bandit's feedback from different domains may involve different costs. For example, measuring drug reaction from mice (as a source domain) and humans (as a target domain). Unfortunately, adapting a contextual bandit algorithm from a source domain to a target domain with distribution shift still remains a major challenge and largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce the first general domain adaptation method for contextual bandits. Our approach learns a bandit model for the target domain by collecting feedback from the source domain. Our theoretical analysis shows that our algorithm maintains a sub-linear regret bound even adapting across domains. Empirical results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art contextual bandit algorithms on real-world datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Freda Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Language is highly structured, with syntactic and semantic structures, to some extent, agreed upon by speakers of the same language. With implicit or explicit awareness of such structures, humans can learn and use language efficiently and generalize to sentences that contain unseen words. Motivated by human language learning, in this dissertation, we consider a family of machine learning tasks that aim to learn language structures through grounding. We seek distant supervision from other data sources (i.e., grounds), including but not limited to other modalities (e.g., vision), execution results of programs, and other languages.
  We demonstrate the potential of this task formulation and advocate for its adoption through three schemes. In Part I, we consider learning syntactic parses through visual grounding. We propose the task of visually grounded grammar induction, present the first models to induce syntactic structures from visually grounded text and speech, and find that the visual grounding signals can help improve the parsing quality over language-only models. As a side contribution, we propose a novel evaluation metric that enables the evaluation of speech parsing without text or automatic speech recognition systems involved. In Part II, we propose two execution-aware methods to map sentences into corresponding semantic structures (i.e., programs), significantly improving compositional generalization and few-shot program synthesis. In Part III, we propose methods that learn language structures from annotations in other languages. Specifically, we propose a method that sets a new state of the art on cross-lingual word alignment. We then leverage the learned word alignments to improve the performance of zero-shot cross-lingual dependency parsing, by proposing a novel substructure-based projection method that preserves structural knowledge learned from the source language.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vincent Olesen, Nina Weng, Aasa Feragen, Eike Petersen</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning models have achieved high overall accuracy in medical image analysis. However, performance disparities on specific patient groups pose challenges to their clinical utility, safety, and fairness. This can affect known patient groups - such as those based on sex, age, or disease subtype - as well as previously unknown and unlabeled groups. Furthermore, the root cause of such observed performance disparities is often challenging to uncover, hindering mitigation efforts. In this paper, to address these issues, we leverage Slice Discovery Methods (SDMs) to identify interpretable underperforming subsets of data and formulate hypotheses regarding the cause of observed performance disparities. We introduce a novel SDM and apply it in a case study on the classification of pneumothorax and atelectasis from chest x-rays. Our study demonstrates the effectiveness of SDMs in hypothesis formulation and yields an explanation of previously observed but unexplained performance disparities between male and female patients in widely used chest X-ray datasets and models. Our findings indicate shortcut learning in both classification tasks, through the presence of chest drains and ECG wires, respectively. Sex-based differences in the prevalence of these shortcut features appear to cause the observed classification performance gap, representing a previously underappreciated interaction between shortcut learning and model fairness analyses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenda Xu, Jiachen Li, William Yang Wang, Lei Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Direct alignment from preferences (DAP) has emerged as a promising paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs) to human desiderata from pre-collected, offline preference datasets. While recent studies indicate that existing offline DAP methods can directly benefit from online training samples, we highlight the need to develop specific online DAP algorithms to fully harness the power of online training. Specifically, we identify that the learned LLM should adhere to the proximity of the behavior LLM, which collects the training samples. To this end, we propose online Preference Optimization in proximity to the Behavior LLM (BPO), emphasizing the importance of constructing a proper trust region for LLM alignment.
  We conduct extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness and applicability of our approach by integrating it with various DAP methods, resulting in significant performance improvements across a wide range of tasks when training with the same amount of preference data. Even when only introducing one additional data collection phase, our online BPO improves its offline DAP baseline from 72.0% to 80.2% on TL;DR and from 82.2% to 89.1% on Anthropic Helpfulness in terms of win rate against human reference text.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jimin Sohn, Haeji Jung, Alex Cheng, Jooeon Kang, Yilin Du, David R. Mortensen</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing zero-shot cross-lingual NER approaches require substantial prior knowledge of the target language, which is impractical for low-resource languages. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to NER using phonemic representation based on the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) to bridge the gap between representations of different languages. Our experiments show that our method significantly outperforms baseline models in extremely low-resource languages, with the highest average F1 score (46.38%) and lowest standard deviation (12.67), particularly demonstrating its robustness with non-Latin scripts.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marzena Karpinska, Katherine Thai, Kyle Lo, Tanya Goyal, Mohit Iyyer</p>
<p>Abstract: Synthetic long-context LLM benchmarks (e.g., "needle-in-the-haystack") test only surface-level retrieval capabilities, but how well can long-context LLMs retrieve, synthesize, and reason over information across book-length inputs? We address this question by creating NoCha, a dataset of 1,001 minimally different pairs of true and false claims about 67 recently-published English fictional books, written by human readers of those books. In contrast to existing long-context benchmarks, our annotators confirm that the largest share of pairs in NoCha require global reasoning over the entire book to verify. Our experiments show that while human readers easily perform this task, it is enormously challenging for all ten long-context LLMs that we evaluate: no open-weight model performs above random chance (despite their strong performance on synthetic benchmarks), while GPT-4o achieves the highest accuracy at 55.8%. Further analysis reveals that (1) on average, models perform much better on pairs that require only sentence-level retrieval vs. global reasoning; (2) model-generated explanations for their decisions are often inaccurate even for correctly-labeled claims; and (3) models perform substantially worse on speculative fiction books that contain extensive world-building. The methodology proposed in NoCha allows for the evolution of the benchmark dataset and the easy analysis of future models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohsen Fayyaz, Fan Yin, Jiao Sun, Nanyun Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: We study how well large language models (LLMs) explain their generations through rationales -- a set of tokens extracted from the input text that reflect the decision-making process of LLMs. Specifically, we systematically study rationales derived using two approaches: (1) popular prompting-based methods, where prompts are used to guide LLMs in generating rationales, and (2) technical attribution-based methods, which leverage attention or gradients to identify important tokens. Our analysis spans three classification datasets with annotated rationales, encompassing tasks with varying performance levels. While prompting-based self-explanations are widely used, our study reveals that these explanations are not always as "aligned" with the human rationale as attribution-based explanations. Even more so, fine-tuning LLMs to enhance classification task accuracy does not enhance the alignment of prompting-based rationales. Still, it does considerably improve the alignment of attribution-based methods (e.g., InputXGradient). More importantly, we show that prompting-based self-explanation is also less "faithful" than attribution-based explanations, failing to provide a reliable account of the model's decision-making process. To evaluate faithfulness, unlike prior studies that excluded misclassified examples, we evaluate all instances and also examine the impact of fine-tuning and accuracy on alignment and faithfulness. Our findings suggest that inconclusive faithfulness results reported in earlier studies may stem from low classification accuracy. These findings underscore the importance of more rigorous and comprehensive evaluations of LLM rationales.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zekang Yang, Hong Liu, Xiangdong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Cancer survival prediction is a challenging task that involves analyzing of the tumor microenvironment within Whole Slide Image (WSI). Previous methods cannot effectively capture the intricate interaction features among instances within the local area of WSI. Moreover, existing methods for cancer survival prediction based on WSI often fail to provide better clinically meaningful predictions. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Sparse Context-aware Multiple Instance Learning (SCMIL) framework for predicting cancer survival probability distributions. SCMIL innovatively segments patches into various clusters based on their morphological features and spatial location information, subsequently leveraging sparse self-attention to discern the relationships between these patches with a context-aware perspective. Considering many patches are irrelevant to the task, we introduce a learnable patch filtering module called SoftFilter, which ensures that only interactions between task-relevant patches are considered. To enhance the clinical relevance of our prediction, we propose a register-based mixture density network to forecast the survival probability distribution for individual patients. We evaluate SCMIL on two public WSI datasets from the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) specifically focusing on lung adenocarcinom (LUAD) and kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC). Our experimental results indicate that SCMIL outperforms current state-of-the-art methods for survival prediction, offering more clinically meaningful and interpretable outcomes.

<p>Abstract: Adapting deep learning networks for point cloud data recognition in self-driving vehicles faces challenges due to the variability in datasets and sensor technologies, emphasizing the need for adaptive techniques to maintain accuracy across different conditions. In this paper, we introduce the 3D Adaptive Structural Convolution Network (3D-ASCN), a cutting-edge framework for 3D point cloud recognition. It combines 3D convolution kernels, a structural tree structure, and adaptive neighborhood sampling for effective geometric feature extraction. This method obtains domain-invariant features and demonstrates robust, adaptable performance on a variety of point cloud datasets, ensuring compatibility across diverse sensor configurations without the need for parameter adjustments. This highlights its potential to significantly enhance the reliability and efficiency of self-driving vehicle technology.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Julien Quarez, Matthew Elliot, Oscar Maccormac, Marc Modat, Sebastien Ourselin, Jonathan Shapey, Alejandro Granados</p>
<p>Abstract: In surgical skill assessment, Objective Structured Assessments of Technical Skills (OSATS scores) and the Global Rating Scale (GRS) are established tools for evaluating the performance of surgeons during training. These metrics, coupled with feedback on their performance, enable surgeons to improve and achieve standards of practice. Recent studies on the open-source dataset JIGSAW, which contains both GRS and OSATS labels, have focused on regressing GRS scores from kinematic signals, video data, or a combination of both. In this paper, we argue that regressing the GRS score, a unitless value, by itself is too restrictive, and variations throughout the surgical trial do not hold significant clinical meaning. To address this gap, we developed a recurrent transformer model that outputs the surgeon's performance throughout their training session by relating the model's hidden states to five OSATS scores derived from kinematic signals. These scores are averaged and aggregated to produce a GRS prediction, enabling assessment of the model's performance against the state-of-the-art (SOTA). We report Spearman's Correlation Coefficient (SCC), demonstrating that our model outperforms SOTA models for all tasks, except for Suturing under the leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) scheme (SCC 0.68-0.89), while achieving comparable performance for suturing and across tasks under the leave-one-user-out (LOUO) scheme (SCC 0.45-0.68) and beating SOTA for Needle Passing (0.69). We argue that relating final OSATS scores to short instances throughout a surgeon's procedure is more clinically meaningful than a single GRS score. This approach also allows us to translate quantitative predictions into qualitative feedback, which is crucial for any automated surgical skill assessment pipeline. A senior surgeon validated our model's behaviour and agreed with the semi-supervised predictions 77 \% (p = 0.006) of the time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuang Wang, Qianwen Lu, Yihe Nie, Qingchuan Tao, Yanmei Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: For the task of low-light image enhancement, deep learning-based algorithms have demonstrated superiority and effectiveness compared to traditional methods. Existing deep learning algorithms are proposed mainly based on the Retinex theory but overlook the noise and color distortion present in the input, which frequently results in significant noise amplification and local color distortion in the final results. To address this, we propose a Dual-Path Error Compensation method (DPEC), which aims to improve image quality in low-light conditions. DPEC performs precise pixel-level error estimation, which accurately captures subtle pixels differences, and independent denoising, which effectively removes unnecessary noise. This method restores image brightness while preserving local texture details and avoiding noise amplification. Furthermore, to compensate for the traditional CNN's limited ability to capture long-range semantic information and considering both computational speed and resource efficiency, we integrated the VMamba architecture into the backbone of DPEC. In addition, we introduced the HIS-Retinex loss to constrain the training of DPEC, ensuring that the overall brightness distribution of the images more closely aligns with real-world conditions. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across six benchmark tests.</p>

<p>Abstract: Existing retrieval benchmarks primarily consist of information-seeking queries (e.g., aggregated questions from search engines) where keyword or semantic-based retrieval is usually sufficient. However, many complex real-world queries require in-depth reasoning to identify relevant documents that go beyond surface form matching. For example, finding documentation for a coding question requires understanding the logic and syntax of the functions involved. To better benchmark retrieval on such challenging queries, we introduce BRIGHT, the first text retrieval benchmark that requires intensive reasoning to retrieve relevant documents. Our dataset consists of 1,384 real-world queries spanning diverse domains, such as economics, psychology, mathematics, and coding. These queries are drawn from naturally occurring and carefully curated human data. Extensive evaluation reveals that even state-of-the-art retrieval models perform poorly on BRIGHT. The leading model on the MTEB leaderboard (Muennighoff et al., 2023), which achieves a score of 59.0 nDCG@10, produces a score of nDCG@10 of 18.3 on BRIGHT. We show that incorporating explicit reasoning about the query improves retrieval performance by up to 12.2 points. Moreover, incorporating retrieved documents from the top-performing retriever boosts question-answering performance by over 6.6 points. We believe that BRIGHT paves the way for future research on retrieval systems in more realistic and challenging settings.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14344">LLMs left, right, and center: Assessing GPT&#x27;s capabilities to label political bias from web domains</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Raphael Hernandes, Giulio Corsi</p>
<p>Abstract: This research investigates whether OpenAI's GPT-4, a state-of-the-art large language model, can accurately classify the political bias of news sources based solely on their URLs. Given the subjective nature of political labels, third-party bias ratings like those from Ad Fontes Media, AllSides, and Media Bias/Fact Check (MBFC) are often used in research to analyze news source diversity. This study aims to determine if GPT-4 can replicate these human ratings on a seven-degree scale ("far-left" to "far-right"). The analysis compares GPT-4's classifications against MBFC's, and controls for website popularity using Open PageRank scores. Findings reveal a high correlation ($\text{Spearman's } \rho = .89$, $n = 5,877$, $p < 0.001$) between GPT-4's and MBFC's ratings, indicating the model's potential reliability. However, GPT-4 abstained from classifying approximately $\frac{2}{3}$ of the dataset. It is more likely to abstain from rating unpopular websites, which also suffer from less accurate assessments. The LLM tends to avoid classifying sources that MBFC considers to be centrist, resulting in more polarized outputs. Finally, this analysis shows a slight leftward skew in GPT's classifications compared to MBFC's. Therefore, while this paper suggests that while GPT-4 can be a scalable, cost-effective tool for political bias classification of news websites, its use should be as a complement to human judgment to mitigate biases.</p>

<p>Abstract: Task planning for robots in real-life settings presents significant challenges. These challenges stem from three primary issues: the difficulty in identifying grounded sequences of steps to achieve a goal; the lack of a standardized mapping between high-level actions and low-level commands; and the challenge of maintaining low computational overhead given the limited resources of robotic hardware. We introduce EMPOWER, a framework designed for open-vocabulary online grounding and planning for embodied agents aimed at addressing these issues. By leveraging efficient pre-trained foundation models and a multi-role mechanism, EMPOWER demonstrates notable improvements in grounded planning and execution. Quantitative results highlight the effectiveness of our approach, achieving an average success rate of 0.73 across six different real-life scenarios using a TIAGo robot.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sara Pohland, Claire Tomlin</p>
<p>Abstract: Perception-based navigation systems are useful for unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) navigation in complex terrains, where traditional depth-based navigation schemes are insufficient. However, these data-driven methods are highly dependent on their training data and can fail in surprising and dramatic ways with little warning. To ensure the safety of the vehicle and the surrounding environment, it is imperative that the navigation system is able to recognize the predictive uncertainty of the perception model and respond safely and effectively in the face of uncertainty. In an effort to enable safe navigation under perception uncertainty, we develop a probabilistic and reconstruction-based competency estimation (PaRCE) method to estimate the model's level of familiarity with an input image as a whole and with specific regions in the image. We find that the overall competency score can correctly predict correctly classified, misclassified, and out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. We also confirm that the regional competency maps can accurately distinguish between familiar and unfamiliar regions across images. We then use this competency information to develop a planning and control scheme that enables effective navigation while maintaining a low probability of error. We find that the competency-aware scheme greatly reduces the number of collisions with unfamiliar obstacles, compared to a baseline controller with no competency awareness. Furthermore, the regional competency information is very valuable in enabling efficient navigation.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce Playground v3 (PGv3), our latest text-to-image model that achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance across multiple testing benchmarks, excels in graphic design abilities and introduces new capabilities. Unlike traditional text-to-image generative models that rely on pre-trained language models like T5 or CLIP text encoders, our approach fully integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with a novel structure that leverages text conditions exclusively from a decoder-only LLM. Additionally, to enhance image captioning quality-we developed an in-house captioner, capable of generating captions with varying levels of detail, enriching the diversity of text structures. We also introduce a new benchmark CapsBench to evaluate detailed image captioning performance. Experimental results demonstrate that PGv3 excels in text prompt adherence, complex reasoning, and accurate text rendering. User preference studies indicate the super-human graphic design ability of our model for common design applications, such as stickers, posters, and logo designs. Furthermore, PGv3 introduces new capabilities, including precise RGB color control and robust multilingual understanding.</p>

Based on more than 30,000 papers and 1,000 presentations from machine learning conferences, we examined and compared the words used in writing and speaking, representing the first large-scale study of how LLMs influence the two main modes of verbal communication and expression within the same group of people. Our empirical results show that LLM-style words such as "significant" have been used more frequently in abstracts and oral presentations. The impact on speaking is beginning to emerge and is likely to grow in the future, calling attention to the implicit influence and ripple effect of LLMs on human society.</p>

<p>Abstract: Increasing use of large language models (LLMs) demand performant guardrails to ensure the safety of inputs and outputs of LLMs. When these safeguards are trained on imbalanced data, they can learn the societal biases. We present a light-weight, post-processing method for mitigating counterfactual fairness in closed-source text safety classifiers. Our approach involves building an ensemble that not only outperforms the input classifiers and policy-aligns them, but also acts as a debiasing regularizer. We introduce two threshold-agnostic metrics to assess the counterfactual fairness of a model, and demonstrate how combining these metrics with Fair Data Reweighting (FDW) helps mitigate biases. We create an expanded Open AI dataset, and a new templated LLM-generated dataset based on user-prompts, both of which are counterfactually balanced across identity groups and cover four key areas of safety; we will work towards publicly releasing these datasets. Our results show that our approach improves counterfactual fairness with minimal impact on model performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihong Tang, Jiao Ou, Che Liu, Fuzheng Zhang, Di Zhang, Kun Gai</p>
<p>Abstract: Role-playing is an emerging application in the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), primarily implemented through the alignment training of a large language model (LLM) with assigned characters. Despite significant progress, role-playing agents (RPLAs) still struggle with maintaining role-consistency across conversations, particularly when confronted with boundary queries subtly related to character attributes. In this paper, we present ERABAL, a framework aimed at enhancing RPLAs' role-playing capabilities through boundary-aware learning. ERABAL encompasses a generation pipeline for role-specific dialogues and a concomitant methodology for alignment training. Through comprehensive evaluations, we demonstrate that ERABAL is both efficient and effective. By training with significantly fewer dialogues than those used in leading approaches, ERABAL achieves notable improvements across WikiRoleEval, CharacterEval, and the role-playing subset of MT-Bench compared to the generalist baseline models. Our code and datasets will be made publicly available to support further research.</p>

<p>Abstract: This report introduces PixelBytes Embedding, a novel approach for unified multimodal representation learning. Our method captures diverse inputs in a single, cohesive representation, enabling emergent properties for multimodal sequence generation, particularly for text and pixelated images. Inspired by state-of-the-art sequence models such as Image Transformers, PixelCNN, and Mamba-Bytes, PixelBytes aims to address the challenges of integrating different data types.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenlin Wu, Xiaoyu He, Zike Li, Jing Gong, Zibin Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning heavily relies on distributed gradient descent techniques. In the situation where gradient information is not available, the gradients need to be estimated from zeroth-order information, which typically involves computing finite-differences along isotropic random directions. This method suffers from high estimation errors, as the geometric features of the objective landscape may be overlooked during the isotropic sampling. In this work, we propose a non-isotropic sampling method to improve the gradient estimation procedure. Gradients in our method are estimated in a subspace spanned by historical trajectories of solutions, aiming to encourage the exploration of promising regions and hence improve the convergence. The proposed method uses a covariance matrix for sampling which is a convex combination of two parts. The first part is a thin projection matrix containing the basis of the subspace which is designed to improve the exploitation ability. The second part is the historical trajectories. We implement this method in zeroth-order federated settings, and show that the convergence rate aligns with existing ones while introducing no significant overheads in communication or local computation. The effectiveness of our proposal is verified on several numerical experiments in comparison to several commonly-used zeroth-order federated optimization algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyu Zhao, Tao Shen, Didi Zhu, Zexi Li, Jing Su, Xuwu Wang, Kun Kuang, Fei Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a popular technique for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) to various domains due to its modular design and widespread availability on platforms like Huggingface. This modularity has sparked interest in combining multiple LoRAs to enhance LLM capabilities. However, existing methods for LoRA composition primarily focus on task-specific adaptations that require additional training, and current model merging techniques often fail to fully leverage LoRA's modular nature, leading to parameter interference and performance degradation. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of disassembling and reassembling multiple LoRAs at a finer granularity, analogous to assembling LEGO blocks. We introduce the concept of Minimal Semantic Units (MSUs), where the parameters corresponding to each rank in LoRA function as independent units. These MSUs demonstrate permutation invariance and concatenation-summation equivalence properties, enabling flexible combinations to create new LoRAs. Building on these insights, we propose the LoRA-LEGO framework. This framework conducts rank-wise parameter clustering by grouping MSUs from different LoRAs into $k$ clusters. The centroid of each cluster serves as a representative MSU, enabling the assembly of a merged LoRA with an adjusted rank of $k$. Additionally, we apply a dual reweighting strategy to optimize the scale of the merged LoRA. Experiments across various benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in LoRA merging.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Suwichaya Suwanwimolkul, Natanon Tongamrak, Nuttamon Thungka, Naebboon Hoonchareon, Jitkomut Songsiri</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents an online platform that shows Thailand's solar irradiance map every 30 minutes. It is available at https://www.cusolarforecast.com. The methodology for estimating global horizontal irradiance (GHI) across Thailand relies on cloud index extracted from Himawari-8 satellite imagery, Ineichen clear-sky model with locally-tuned Linke turbidity, and machine learning models. The methods take clear-sky irradiance, cloud index, re-analyzed GHI and temperature data from the MERRA-2 database, and date-time as inputs for GHI estimation models, including LightGBM, LSTM, Informer, and Transformer. These are benchmarked with the estimate from a commercial service X by evaluating 15-minute ground GHI data from 53 ground stations over 1.5 years from 2022-2023. The results show that the four models have competitive performances and outperform the service X. The best model is LightGBM, with an MAE of 78.58 W/sqm and RMSE of 118.97 W/sqm. Obtaining re-analyzed MERRA-2 data for Thailand is not economically feasible for deployment. When removing these features, the Informer model has a winning performance of 78.67 W/sqm in MAE. The obtained performance aligns with existing literature by taking the climate zone and time granularity of data into consideration. As the map shows an estimate of GHI over 93,000 grids with a frequent update, the paper also describes a computational framework for displaying the entire map. It tests the runtime performance of deep learning models in the GHI estimation process.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present a system that transforms speech into physical objects by combining 3D generative Artificial Intelligence with robotic assembly. The system leverages natural language input to make design and manufacturing more accessible, enabling individuals without expertise in 3D modeling or robotic programming to create physical objects.

The system interprets speech to generate 3D objects, discretizes them into voxel components, computes an optimized assembly sequence, and generates a robotic toolpath. The results are demonstrated through the assembly of various objects, ranging from chairs to shelves, which are prompted via speech and realized within 5 minutes using a 6-axis robotic arm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joshua McClellan, Naveed Haghani, John Winder, Furong Huang, Pratap Tokekar</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) struggles with sample inefficiency and poor generalization [1]. These challenges are partially due to a lack of structure or inductive bias in the neural networks typically used in learning the policy. One such form of structure that is commonly observed in multi-agent scenarios is symmetry. The field of Geometric Deep Learning has developed Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (EGNN) that are equivariant (or symmetric) to rotations, translations, and reflections of nodes. Incorporating equivariance has been shown to improve learning efficiency and decrease error [ 2 ]. In this paper, we demonstrate that EGNNs improve the sample efficiency and generalization in MARL. However, we also show that a naive application of EGNNs to MARL results in poor early exploration due to a bias in the EGNN structure. To mitigate this bias, we present Exploration-enhanced Equivariant Graph Neural Networks or E2GN2. We compare E2GN2 to other common function approximators using common MARL benchmarks MPE and SMACv2. E2GN2 demonstrates a significant improvement in sample efficiency, greater final reward convergence, and a 2x-5x gain in over standard GNNs in our generalization tests. These results pave the way for more reliable and effective solutions in complex multi-agent systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaemoo Choi, Jaewoong Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: The Optimal Transport (OT) problem investigates a transport map that connects two distributions while minimizing a given cost function. Finding such a transport map has diverse applications in machine learning, such as generative modeling and image-to-image translation. In this paper, we introduce a scalable and simulation-free approach for solving the Entropic Unbalanced Optimal Transport (EUOT) problem. We derive the dynamical form of this EUOT problem, which is a generalization of the Schr\"odinger bridges (SB) problem. Based on this, we derive dual formulation and optimality conditions of the EUOT problem from the stochastic optimal control interpretation. By leveraging these properties, we propose a simulation-free algorithm to solve EUOT, called Simulation-free EUOT (SF-EUOT). While existing SB models require expensive simulation costs during training and evaluation, our model achieves simulation-free training and one-step generation by utilizing the reciprocal property. Our model demonstrates significantly improved scalability in generative modeling and image-to-image translation tasks compared to previous SB methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joost de Winter, Dimitra Dodou, Yke Bauke Eisma</p>
<p>Abstract: The processes underlying human cognition are often divided into System 1, which involves fast, intuitive thinking, and System 2, which involves slow, deliberate reasoning. Previously, large language models were criticized for lacking the deeper, more analytical capabilities of System 2. In September 2024, OpenAI introduced the o1 model series, designed to handle System 2-like reasoning. While OpenAI's benchmarks are promising, independent validation is still needed. In this study, we tested the o1-preview model twice on the Dutch 'Mathematics B' final exam. It scored a near-perfect 76 and 74 out of 76 points. For context, only 24 out of 16,414 students in the Netherlands achieved a perfect score. By comparison, the GPT-4o model scored 66 and 62 out of 76, well above the Dutch average of 40.63 points. Neither model had access to the exam figures. Since there was a risk of model contamination (i.e., the knowledge cutoff of o1-preview and GPT-4o was after the exam was published online), we repeated the procedure with a new Mathematics B exam that was published after the cutoff date. The results again indicated that o1-preview performed strongly (97.8th percentile), which suggests that contamination was not a factor. We also show that there is some variability in the output of o1-preview, which means that sometimes there is 'luck' (the answer is correct) or 'bad luck' (the output has diverged into something that is incorrect). We demonstrate that a self-consistency approach, where repeated prompts are given and the most common answer is selected, is a useful strategy for identifying the correct answer. It is concluded that while OpenAI's new model series holds great potential, certain risks must be considered.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peiran Wang, Xiaogeng Liu, Chaowei Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: In this study, we introduce RePD, an innovative attack Retrieval-based Prompt Decomposition framework designed to mitigate the risk of jailbreak attacks on large language models (LLMs). Despite rigorous pretraining and finetuning focused on ethical alignment, LLMs are still susceptible to jailbreak exploits. RePD operates on a one-shot learning model, wherein it accesses a database of pre-collected jailbreak prompt templates to identify and decompose harmful inquiries embedded within user prompts. This process involves integrating the decomposition of the jailbreak prompt into the user's original query into a one-shot learning example to effectively teach the LLM to discern and separate malicious components. Consequently, the LLM is equipped to first neutralize any potentially harmful elements before addressing the user's prompt in a manner that aligns with its ethical guidelines. RePD is versatile and compatible with a variety of open-source LLMs acting as agents. Through comprehensive experimentation with both harmful and benign prompts, we have demonstrated the efficacy of our proposed RePD in enhancing the resilience of LLMs against jailbreak attacks, without compromising their performance in responding to typical user requests.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bokai Hu, Sai Ashish Somayajula, Xin Pan, Zihan Huang, Pengtao Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), built on decoder-only transformers, excel in natural language generation and adapt to diverse tasks using zero-shot and few-shot prompting. However, these prompting methods often struggle on natural language understanding (NLU) tasks, where encoder-only models like BERT-base outperform LLMs on benchmarks like GLUE and SuperGLUE. This paper explores two approaches-supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and proximal policy optimization (PPO)-to enhance LLMs' NLU abilities. To reduce the cost of full-model fine-tuning, we integrate low-rank adaptation (LoRA) layers, limiting updates to these layers during both SFT and PPO. In SFT, task-specific prompts are concatenated with input queries and ground-truth labels, optimizing with next-token prediction. Despite this, LLMs still underperform compared to models like BERT-base on several NLU tasks. To close this gap, we apply PPO, a reinforcement learning technique that treats each token generation as an action and uses a reward function based on alignment with ground-truth answers. PPO then updates the model to maximize these rewards, aligning outputs with correct labels. Our experiments with LLAMA2-7B show that PPO improves performance, with a 6.3-point gain over SFT on GLUE. PPO exceeds zero-shot by 38.7 points and few-shot by 26.1 points on GLUE, while surpassing these by 28.8 and 28.5 points on SuperGLUE. Additionally, PPO outperforms BERT-large by 2.7 points on GLUE and 9.3 points on SuperGLUE. The improvements are consistent across models like Qwen2.5-7B and MPT-7B, highlighting PPO's robustness in enhancing LLMs' NLU capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guixian Zhang, Guan Yuan, Debo Cheng, Lin Liu, Jiuyong Li, Shichao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: With the widespread use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for representation learning from network data, the fairness of GNN models has raised great attention lately. Fair GNNs aim to ensure that node representations can be accurately classified, but not easily associated with a specific group. Existing advanced approaches essentially enhance the generalisation of node representation in combination with data augmentation strategy, and do not directly impose constraints on the fairness of GNNs. In this work, we identify that a fundamental reason for the unfairness of GNNs in social network learning is the phenomenon of social homophily, i.e., users in the same group are more inclined to congregate. The message-passing mechanism of GNNs can cause users in the same group to have similar representations due to social homophily, leading model predictions to establish spurious correlations with sensitive attributes. Inspired by this reason, we propose a method called Equity-Aware GNN (EAGNN) towards fair graph representation learning. Specifically, to ensure that model predictions are independent of sensitive attributes while maintaining prediction performance, we introduce constraints for fair representation learning based on three principles: sufficiency, independence, and separation. We theoretically demonstrate that our EAGNN method can effectively achieve group fairness. Extensive experiments on three datasets with varying levels of social homophily illustrate that our EAGNN method achieves the state-of-the-art performance across two fairness metrics and offers competitive effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aditya Cowsik, Kfir Dolev, Alex Infanger</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a complete mechanistic description of the algorithm learned by a minimal non-linear sparse data autoencoder in the limit of large input dimension. The model, originally presented in arXiv:2209.10652, compresses sparse data vectors through a linear layer and decompresses using another linear layer followed by a ReLU activation. We notice that when the data is permutation symmetric (no input feature is privileged) large models reliably learn an algorithm that is sensitive to individual weights only through their large-scale statistics. For these models, the loss function becomes analytically tractable. Using this understanding, we give the explicit scalings of the loss at high sparsity, and show that the model is near-optimal among recently proposed architectures. In particular, changing or adding to the activation function any elementwise or filtering operation can at best improve the model's performance by a constant factor. Finally, we forward-engineer a model with the requisite symmetries and show that its loss precisely matches that of the trained models. Unlike the trained model weights, the low randomness in the artificial weights results in miraculous fractal structures resembling a Persian rug, to which the algorithm is oblivious. Our work contributes to neural network interpretability by introducing techniques for understanding the structure of autoencoders.

<p>Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a key tool in Scientific Machine Learning since their introduction in 2017, enabling the efficient solution of ordinary and partial differential equations using sparse measurements. Over the past few years, significant advancements have been made in the training and optimization of PINNs, covering aspects such as network architectures, adaptive refinement, domain decomposition, and the use of adaptive weights and activation functions. A notable recent development is the Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (PIKANS), which leverage a representation model originally proposed by Kolmogorov in 1957, offering a promising alternative to traditional PINNs. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the latest advancements in PINNs, focusing on improvements in network design, feature expansion, optimization techniques, uncertainty quantification, and theoretical insights. We also survey key applications across a range of fields, including biomedicine, fluid and solid mechanics, geophysics, dynamical systems, heat transfer, chemical engineering, and beyond. Finally, we review computational frameworks and software tools developed by both academia and industry to support PINN research and applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced their ability to understand both natural language and code, driving their use in tasks like natural language-to-code (NL2Code) and code summarization. However, LLMs are prone to hallucination-outputs that stray from intended meanings. Detecting hallucinations in code summarization is especially difficult due to the complex interplay between programming and natural languages. We introduce a first-of-its-kind dataset with $\sim$10K samples, curated specifically for hallucination detection in code summarization. We further propose a novel Entity Tracing Framework (ETF) that a) utilizes static program analysis to identify code entities from the program and b) uses LLMs to map and verify these entities and their intents within generated code summaries. Our experimental analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the framework, leading to a 0.73 F1 score. This approach provides an interpretable method for detecting hallucinations by grounding entities, allowing us to evaluate summary accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dipo Dunsin, Mohamed Chahine Ghanem, Karim Ouazzane, Vassil Vassilev</p>
<p>Abstract: This Research proposes a Novel Reinforcement Learning (RL) model to optimise malware forensics investigation during cyber incident response. It aims to improve forensic investigation efficiency by reducing false negatives and adapting current practices to evolving malware signatures. The proposed RL framework leverages techniques such as Q-learning and the Markov Decision Process (MDP) to train the system to identify malware patterns in live memory dumps, thereby automating forensic tasks. The RL model is based on a detailed malware workflow diagram that guides the analysis of malware artefacts using static and behavioural techniques as well as machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, it seeks to address challenges in the UK justice system by ensuring the accuracy of forensic evidence. We conduct testing and evaluation in controlled environments, using datasets created with Windows operating systems to simulate malware infections. The experimental results demonstrate that RL improves malware detection rates compared to conventional methods, with the RL model's performance varying depending on the complexity and learning rate of the environment. The study concludes that while RL offers promising potential for automating malware forensics, its efficacy across diverse malware types requires ongoing refinement of reward systems and feature extraction methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sheng Liu, Haotian Ye, Lei Xing, James Zou</p>
<p>Abstract: Hallucination poses a challenge to the deployment of large vision-language models (LVLMs) in applications. Unlike in large language models (LLMs), hallucination in LVLMs often arises from misalignments between visual inputs and textual outputs. This paper investigates the underlying mechanisms of hallucination, focusing on the unique structure of LVLMs that distinguishes them from large language models (LLMs). We identify that hallucinations often arise from the sensitivity of text decoders to vision inputs, a natural phenomenon when image encoders and text decoders are pre-trained separately. Inspired by this, we introduce Visual and Textual Intervention (VTI), a novel technique designed to reduce hallucinations by steering latent space representations during inference to enhance the stability of vision features. As a task-agnostic test-time intervention, VTI can be easily applied to any problem without additional cost. Extensive experiments demonstrate that it can effectively reduce hallucinations and outperform baseline methods across multiple metrics, highlighting the critical role of vision feature stability in LVLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Ma, Yang Liu, Jingjing Liu, Xiaoxu Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), although having revolutionized many fields, still suffer from the challenging extrapolation problem, where the inference ability of LLMs sharply declines beyond their max training lengths. In this work, we conduct a theoretical analysis to better understand why No Position Encoding (NoPE) fails outside its effective range, as well as examining the power of Position Encoding (PE) in this context. Our findings reveal that with meticulous weave position, PE can indeed be extended beyond effective range. Our theorems establish that LLMs equipped with weave PE can achieve improved extrapolation performance without additional cost. Furthermore, we introduce a novel weave PE method, Mesa-Extrapolation, which utilizes a chunk-based triangular attention matrix and applies Stair PE to manage the final chunk. This method not only retains competitive performance but also offers substantial benefits such as significantly reduced memory demand and faster inference speed. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Mesa-Extrapolation, demonstrating its potential as a scalable solution to enhancing LLMs applicative reach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanlin Yang, Jian Yao, Weiming Liu, Qing Wang, Hanmin Qin, Hansheng Kong, Kirk Tang, Jiechao Xiong, Chao Yu, Kai Li, Junliang Xing, Hongwu Chen, Juchao Zhuo, Qiang Fu, Yang Wei, Haobo Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recovering a spectrum of diverse policies from a set of expert trajectories is an important research topic in imitation learning. After determining a latent style for a trajectory, previous diverse policies recovering methods usually employ a vanilla behavioral cloning learning objective conditioned on the latent style, treating each state-action pair in the trajectory with equal importance. Based on an observation that in many scenarios, behavioral styles are often highly relevant with only a subset of state-action pairs, this paper presents a new principled method in diverse polices recovery. In particular, after inferring or assigning a latent style for a trajectory, we enhance the vanilla behavioral cloning by incorporating a weighting mechanism based on pointwise mutual information. This additional weighting reflects the significance of each state-action pair's contribution to learning the style, thus allowing our method to focus on state-action pairs most representative of that style. We provide theoretical justifications for our new objective, and extensive empirical evaluations confirm the effectiveness of our method in recovering diverse policies from expert data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Giannis Daras, Weili Nie, Karsten Kreis, Alex Dimakis, Morteza Mardani, Nikola Borislavov Kovachki, Arash Vahdat</p>
<p>Abstract: Using image models naively for solving inverse video problems often suffers from flickering, texture-sticking, and temporal inconsistency in generated videos. To tackle these problems, in this paper, we view frames as continuous functions in the 2D space, and videos as a sequence of continuous warping transformations between different frames. This perspective allows us to train function space diffusion models only on images and utilize them to solve temporally correlated inverse problems. The function space diffusion models need to be equivariant with respect to the underlying spatial transformations. To ensure temporal consistency, we introduce a simple post-hoc test-time guidance towards (self)-equivariant solutions. Our method allows us to deploy state-of-the-art latent diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion XL to solve video inverse problems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for video inpainting and $8\times$ video super-resolution, outperforming existing techniques based on noise transformations.
