<p><b>Authors:</b> Shih-Ying Yeh, Sang-Hyun Park, Giyeong Oh, Min Song, Youngjae Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: TIPO (Text to Image with text pre-sampling for Prompt Optimization) is an innovative framework designed to enhance text-to-image (T2I) generation by language model (LM) for automatic prompt engineering. By refining and extending user-provided prompts, TIPO bridges the gap between simple inputs and the detailed prompts required for high-quality image generation. Unlike previous approaches that rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) or reinforcement learning (RL), TIPO adjusts user input prompts with the distribution of a trained prompt dataset, eliminating the need for complex runtime cost via lightweight model. This pre-sampling approach enables efficient and scalable prompt optimization, grounded in the model's training distribution. Experimental results demonstrate TIPO's effectiveness in improving aesthetic scores, reducing image corruption, and better aligning generated images with dataset distributions. These findings highlight the critical role of prompt engineering in T2I systems and open avenues for broader applications of automatic prompt refinement.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Priyanka Patel, Michael J. Black</p>
<p>Abstract: We address the challenge of accurate 3D human pose and shape estimation from monocular images. The key to accuracy and robustness lies in high-quality training data. Existing training datasets containing real images with pseudo ground truth (pGT) use SMPLify to fit SMPL to sparse 2D joint locations, assuming a simplified camera with default intrinsics. We make two contributions that improve pGT accuracy. First, to estimate camera intrinsics, we develop a field-of-view prediction model (HumanFoV) trained on a dataset of images containing people. We use the estimated intrinsics to enhance the 4D-Humans dataset by incorporating a full perspective camera model during SMPLify fitting. Second, 2D joints provide limited constraints on 3D body shape, resulting in average-looking bodies. To address this, we use the BEDLAM dataset to train a dense surface keypoint detector. We apply this detector to the 4D-Humans dataset and modify SMPLify to fit the detected keypoints, resulting in significantly more realistic body shapes. Finally, we upgrade the HMR2.0 architecture to include the estimated camera parameters. We iterate model training and SMPLify fitting initialized with the previously trained model. This leads to more accurate pGT and a new model, CameraHMR, with state-of-the-art accuracy. Code and pGT are available for research purposes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aditya V. Jonnalagadda, Hashim A. Hashim, Andrew Harris</p>
<p>Abstract: Contemporary Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) research places a significant emphasis on transfer learning, showcasing its transformative potential in enhancing model performance across diverse domains. This paper examines the efficiency and effectiveness of transfer learning in the context of wildfire detection. Three purpose-built models -- Visual Geometry Group (VGG)-7, VGG-10, and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-Support Vector Machine(SVM) CNN-SVM -- are rigorously compared with three pretrained models -- VGG-16, VGG-19, and Residual Neural Network (ResNet) ResNet101. We trained and evaluated these models using a dataset that captures the complexities of wildfires, incorporating variables such as varying lighting conditions, time of day, and diverse terrains. The objective is to discern how transfer learning performs against models trained from scratch in addressing the intricacies of the wildfire detection problem. By assessing the performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, a comprehensive understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of transfer learning in this specific domain is obtained. This study contributes valuable insights to the ongoing discourse, guiding future directions in AI and ML research. Keywords: Wildfire prediction, deep learning, machine learning fire, detection</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anoushkrit Goel, Bipanjit Singh, Ankita Joshi, Ranjeet Ranjan Jha, Chirag Ahuja, Aditya Nigam, Arnav Bhavsar</p>
<p>Abstract: White matter tract segmentation is crucial for studying brain structural connectivity and neurosurgical planning. However, segmentation remains challenging due to issues like class imbalance between major and minor tracts, structural similarity, subject variability, symmetric streamlines between hemispheres etc. To address these challenges, we propose TractoEmbed, a modular multi-level embedding framework, that encodes localized representations through learning tasks in respective encoders. In this paper, TractoEmbed introduces a novel hierarchical streamline data representation that captures maximum spatial information at each level i.e. individual streamlines, clusters, and patches. Experiments show that TractoEmbed outperforms state-of-the-art methods in white matter tract segmentation across different datasets, and spanning various age groups. The modular framework directly allows the integration of additional embeddings in future works.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohsin Ali, Haider Raza, John Q Gan, Ariel Pokhojaev, Matanel Katz, Esra Kosan, Dian Agustin Wahjuningrum, Omnina Saleh, Rachel Sarig, Akhilanada Chaurasia</p>
<p>Abstract: Objectives: Age and gender estimation is crucial for various applications, including forensic investigations and anthropological studies. This research aims to develop a predictive system for age and gender estimation in living individuals, leveraging dental measurements such as Coronal Height (CH), Coronal Pulp Cavity Height (CPCH), and Tooth Coronal Index (TCI). Methods: Machine learning models were employed in our study, including Cat Boost Classifier (Catboost), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Ada Boost Classifier (AdaBoost), Random Forest (RF), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGB), and Extra Trees Classifier (ETC), to analyze dental data from 862 living individuals (459 males and 403 females). Specifically, periapical radiographs from six teeth per individual were utilized, including premolars and molars from both maxillary and mandibular. A novel ensemble learning technique was developed, which uses multiple models each tailored to distinct dental metrics, to estimate age and gender accurately. Furthermore, an explainable AI model has been created utilizing SHAP, enabling dental experts to make judicious decisions based on comprehensible insight. Results: The RF and XGB models were particularly effective, yielding the highest F1 score for age and gender estimation. Notably, the XGB model showed a slightly better performance in age estimation, achieving an F1 score of 73.26%. A similar trend for the RF model was also observed in gender estimation, achieving a F1 score of 77.53%. Conclusions: This study marks a significant advancement in dental forensic methods, showcasing the potential of machine learning to automate age and gender estimation processes with improved accuracy.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08196">Latent Space Disentanglement in Diffusion Transformers Enables Precise Zero-shot Semantic Editing</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zitao Shuai, Chenwei Wu, Zhengxu Tang, Bowen Song, Liyue Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have recently achieved remarkable success in text-guided image generation. In image editing, DiTs project text and image inputs to a joint latent space, from which they decode and synthesize new images. However, it remains largely unexplored how multimodal information collectively forms this joint space and how they guide the semantics of the synthesized images. In this paper, we investigate the latent space of DiT models and uncover two key properties: First, DiT's latent space is inherently semantically disentangled, where different semantic attributes can be controlled by specific editing directions. Second, consistent semantic editing requires utilizing the entire joint latent space, as neither encoded image nor text alone contains enough semantic information. We show that these editing directions can be obtained directly from text prompts, enabling precise semantic control without additional training or mask annotations. Based on these insights, we propose a simple yet effective Encode-Identify-Manipulate (EIM) framework for zero-shot fine-grained image editing. Specifically, we first encode both the given source image and the text prompt that describes the image, to obtain the joint latent embedding. Then, using our proposed Hessian Score Distillation Sampling (HSDS) method, we identify editing directions that control specific target attributes while preserving other image features. These directions are guided by text prompts and used to manipulate the latent embeddings. Moreover, we propose a new metric to quantify the disentanglement degree of the latent space of diffusion models. Extensive experiment results on our new curated benchmark dataset and analysis demonstrate DiT's disentanglement properties and effectiveness of the EIM framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiacheng Sun, Hsiang-Wei Huang, Cheng-Yen Yang, Zhongyu Jiang, Jenq-Neng Hwang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-object tracking in sports scenarios has become one of the focal points in computer vision, experiencing significant advancements through the integration of deep learning techniques. Despite these breakthroughs, challenges remain, such as accurately re-identifying players upon re-entry into the scene and minimizing ID switches. In this paper, we propose an appearance-based global tracklet association algorithm designed to enhance tracking performance by splitting tracklets containing multiple identities and connecting tracklets seemingly from the same identity. This method can serve as a plug-and-play refinement tool for any multi-object tracker to further boost their performance. The proposed method achieved a new state-of-the-art performance on the SportsMOT dataset with HOTA score of 81.04%. Similarly, on the SoccerNet dataset, our method enhanced multiple trackers' performance, consistently increasing the HOTA score from 79.41% to 83.11%. These significant and consistent improvements across different trackers and datasets underscore our proposed method's potential impact on the application of sports player tracking.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08227">DPU: Dynamic Prototype Updating for Multimodal Out-of-Distribution Detection</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shawn Li, Huixian Gong, Hao Dong, Tiankai Yang, Zhengzhong Tu, Yue Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for ensuring the robustness of machine learning models by identifying samples that deviate from the training distribution. While traditional OOD detection has primarily focused on single-modality inputs, such as images, recent advances in multimodal models have demonstrated the potential of leveraging multiple modalities (e.g., video, optical flow, audio) to enhance detection performance. However, existing methods often overlook intra-class variability within in-distribution (ID) data, assuming that samples of the same class are perfectly cohesive and consistent. This assumption can lead to performance degradation, especially when prediction discrepancies are uniformly amplified across all samples. To address this issue, we propose Dynamic Prototype Updating (DPU), a novel plug-and-play framework for multimodal OOD detection that accounts for intra-class variations. Our method dynamically updates class center representations for each class by measuring the variance of similar samples within each batch, enabling adaptive adjustments. This approach allows us to amplify prediction discrepancies based on the updated class centers, thereby improving the model's robustness and generalization across different modalities. Extensive experiments on two tasks, five datasets, and nine base OOD algorithms demonstrate that DPU significantly improves OOD detection performance, setting a new state-of-the-art in multimodal OOD detection, with improvements of up to 80 percent in Far-OOD detection. To facilitate accessibility and reproducibility, our code is publicly available on GitHub.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Oguzhan Yigit, Richard C. Wilson</p>
<p>Abstract: The Laplace-Beltrami operator has established itself in the field of non-rigid shape analysis due to its many useful properties such as being invariant under isometric transformation, having a countable eigensystem forming an orthonormal basis, and fully characterizing geodesic distances of the manifold. However, this invariancy only applies under isometric deformations, which leads to a performance breakdown in many real-world applications. In recent years emphasis has been placed upon extracting optimal features using deep learning methods, however spectral signatures play a crucial role and still add value. In this paper we take a step back, revisiting the LBO and proposing a supervised way to learn several operators on a manifold. Depending on the task, by applying these functions, we can train the LBO eigenbasis to be more task-specific. The optimization of the LBO leads to enormous improvements to established descriptors such as the heat kernel signature in various tasks such as retrieval, classification, segmentation, and correspondence, proving the adaption of the LBO eigenbasis to both global and highly local learning settings.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08279">MBA-SLAM: Motion Blur Aware Dense Visual SLAM with Radiance Fields Representation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Peng Wang, Lingzhe Zhao, Yin Zhang, Shiyu Zhao, Peidong Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Emerging 3D scene representations, such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have demonstrated their effectiveness in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) for photo-realistic rendering, particularly when using high-quality video sequences as input. However, existing methods struggle with motion-blurred frames, which are common in real-world scenarios like low-light or long-exposure conditions. This often results in a significant reduction in both camera localization accuracy and map reconstruction quality. To address this challenge, we propose a dense visual SLAM pipeline (i.e. MBA-SLAM) to handle severe motion-blurred inputs. Our approach integrates an efficient motion blur-aware tracker with either neural radiance fields or Gaussian Splatting based mapper. By accurately modeling the physical image formation process of motion-blurred images, our method simultaneously learns 3D scene representation and estimates the cameras' local trajectory during exposure time, enabling proactive compensation for motion blur caused by camera movement. In our experiments, we demonstrate that MBA-SLAM surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods in both camera localization and map reconstruction, showcasing superior performance across a range of datasets, including synthetic and real datasets featuring sharp images as well as those affected by motion blur, highlighting the versatility and robustness of our approach.

These algorithms are not adapted to the case of noisy images because the textures are corrupted by noise. In this paper, we propose a new model which decomposes an image into three parts (structures, textures and noise) based on a local regularization scheme.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiang Zhou, Shaofeng Zhang, Nianzu Yang, Ye Qian, Hao Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing text-to-video (T2V) models often struggle with generating videos with sufficiently pronounced or complex actions. A key limitation lies in the text prompt's inability to precisely convey intricate motion details. To address this, we propose a novel framework, MVideo, designed to produce long-duration videos with precise, fluid actions. MVideo overcomes the limitations of text prompts by incorporating mask sequences as an additional motion condition input, providing a clearer, more accurate representation of intended actions. Leveraging foundational vision models such as GroundingDINO and SAM2, MVideo automatically generates mask sequences, enhancing both efficiency and robustness. Our results demonstrate that, after training, MVideo effectively aligns text prompts with motion conditions to produce videos that simultaneously meet both criteria. This dual control mechanism allows for more dynamic video generation by enabling alterations to either the text prompt or motion condition independently, or both in tandem. Furthermore, MVideo supports motion condition editing and composition, facilitating the generation of videos with more complex actions. MVideo thus advances T2V motion generation, setting a strong benchmark for improved action depiction in current video diffusion models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanming Wang, Yunlong Li, Zijun Wu, Huifen Wang, Yuan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In the past few years, channel-wise and spatial-wise attention blocks have been widely adopted as supplementary modules in deep neural networks, enhancing network representational abilities while introducing low complexity. Most attention modules follow a squeeze-and-excitation paradigm. However, to design such attention modules, requires a substantial amount of experiments and computational resources. Neural Architecture Search (NAS), meanwhile, is able to automate the design of neural networks and spares the numerous experiments required for an optimal architecture. This motivates us to design a search architecture that can automatically find near-optimal attention modules through NAS. We propose SASE, a Searching Architecture for Squeeze and Excitation operations, to form a plug-and-play attention block by searching within certain search space. The search space is separated into 4 different sets, each corresponds to the squeeze or excitation operation along the channel or spatial dimension. Additionally, the search sets include not only existing attention blocks but also other operations that have not been utilized in attention mechanisms before. To the best of our knowledge, SASE is the first attempt to subdivide the attention search space and search for architectures beyond currently known attention modules. The searched attention module is tested with extensive experiments across a range of visual tasks. Experimental results indicate that visual backbone networks (ResNet-50/101) using the SASE attention module achieved the best performance compared to those using the current state-of-the-art attention modules. Codes are included in the supplementary material, and they will be made public later.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yeong-Joon Ju, Ho-Joong Kim, Seong-Whan Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing multimodal retrieval systems often rely on disjointed models for image comprehension, such as object detectors and caption generators, leading to cumbersome implementations and training processes. To overcome this limitation, we propose an end-to-end retrieval system, Ret-XKnow, to endow a text retriever with the ability to understand multimodal queries via dynamic modality interaction. Ret-XKnow leverages a partial convolution mechanism to focus on visual information relevant to the given textual query, thereby enhancing multimodal query representations. To effectively learn multimodal interaction, we also introduce the Visual Dialogue-to-Retrieval (ViD2R) dataset automatically constructed from visual dialogue datasets. Our dataset construction process ensures that the dialogues are transformed into suitable information retrieval tasks using a text retriever. We demonstrate that our approach not only significantly improves retrieval performance in zero-shot settings but also achieves substantial improvements in fine-tuning scenarios.

<p>Abstract: This paper presents DEEGITS (Deep Learning Based Heterogeneous Traffic State Measurement), a comprehensive framework that leverages state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) techniques to accurately and rapidly detect vehicles and pedestrians, as well as to measure traffic states in challenging scenarios (i.e., congestion, occlusion). In this study, we enhance the training dataset through data fusion, enabling simultaneous detection of vehicles and pedestrians. Image preprocessing and augmentation are subsequently performed to improve the quality and quantity of the dataset. Transfer learning is applied on the YOLOv8 pretrained model to increase the model's capability to identify a diverse array of vehicles. Optimal hyperparameters are obtained using the Grid Search algorithm, with the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer outperforming other optimizers under these settings. Extensive experimentation and evaluation demonstrate substantial accuracy within the detection framework, with the model achieving 0.794 mAP@0.5 on the validation set and 0.786 mAP@0.5 on the test set, surpassing previous benchmarks on similar datasets. The DeepSORT multi-object tracking algorithm is incorporated to track detected vehicles and pedestrians in this study. Finally, the framework is tested to measure heterogeneous traffic states in mixed traffic conditions. Two locations with differing traffic compositions and congestion levels are selected: one motorized-dominant location with moderate density and one non-motorized-dominant location with higher density. Errors are statistically insignificant for both cases, showing correlations from 0.99 to 0.88 and 0.91 to 0.97 for heterogeneous traffic flow and speed measurements, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhimin Chen, Bing Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) leverages limited labeled and abundant unlabeled data but often faces challenges with data imbalance, especially in 3D contexts. This study investigates class-level confidence as an indicator of learning status in 3D SSL, proposing a novel method that utilizes dynamic thresholding to better use unlabeled data, particularly from underrepresented classes. A re-sampling strategy is also introduced to mitigate bias towards well-represented classes, ensuring equitable class representation. Through extensive experiments in 3D SSL, our method surpasses state-of-the-art counterparts in classification and detection tasks, highlighting its effectiveness in tackling data imbalance. This approach presents a significant advancement in SSL for 3D datasets, providing a robust solution for data imbalance issues.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingyi Zhou, Senlin Luo, Haofan Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Emotion and personality are central elements in understanding human psychological states. Emotions reflect an individual subjective experiences, while personality reveals relatively stable behavioral and cognitive patterns. Existing affective computing datasets often annotate emotion and personality traits separately, lacking fine-grained labeling of micro-emotions and emotion intensity in both single-label and multi-label classifications. Chinese emotion datasets are extremely scarce, and datasets capturing Chinese user personality traits are even more limited. To address these gaps, this study collected data from the major social media platform Weibo, screening 11,338 valid users from over 50,000 individuals with diverse MBTI personality labels and acquiring 566,900 posts along with the user MBTI personality tags. Using the EQN method, we compiled a multi-label Chinese affective computing dataset that integrates the same user's personality traits with six emotions and micro-emotions, each annotated with intensity levels. Validation results across multiple NLP classification models demonstrate the dataset strong utility. This dataset is designed to advance machine recognition of complex human emotions and provide data support for research in psychology, education, marketing, finance, and politics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Reina Kaneko, Hayate Kojima, Kenta Yanagiya, Junya Hara, Hiroshi Higashi, Yuichi Tanaka</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a multiscale graph construction method using both graph and signal features. Multiscale graph is a hierarchical representation of the graph, where a node at each level indicates a cluster in a finer resolution. To obtain the hierarchical clusters, existing methods often use graph clustering; however, they may ignore signal variations. As a result, these methods could fail to detect the clusters having similar features on nodes. In this paper, we consider graph and node-wise features simultaneously for multiscale clustering of a graph. With given clusters of the graph, the clusters are merged hierarchically in three steps: 1) Feature vectors in the clusters are extracted. 2) Similarities among cluster features are calculated using optimal transport. 3) A variable $k$-nearest neighbor graph (V$k$NNG) is constructed and graph spectral clustering is applied to the V$k$NNG to obtain clusters at a coarser scale. Additionally, the multiscale graph in this paper has \textit{non-local} characteristics: Nodes with similar features are merged even if they are spatially separated. In experiments on multiscale image and point cloud segmentation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

<p>Abstract: Video generation has emerged as a promising tool for world simulation, leveraging visual data to replicate real-world environments. Within this context, egocentric video generation, which centers on the human perspective, holds significant potential for enhancing applications in virtual reality, augmented reality, and gaming. However, the generation of egocentric videos presents substantial challenges due to the dynamic nature of egocentric viewpoints, the intricate diversity of actions, and the complex variety of scenes encountered. Existing datasets are inadequate for addressing these challenges effectively. To bridge this gap, we present EgoVid-5M, the first high-quality dataset specifically curated for egocentric video generation. EgoVid-5M encompasses 5 million egocentric video clips and is enriched with detailed action annotations, including fine-grained kinematic control and high-level textual descriptions. To ensure the integrity and usability of the dataset, we implement a sophisticated data cleaning pipeline designed to maintain frame consistency, action coherence, and motion smoothness under egocentric conditions. Furthermore, we introduce EgoDreamer, which is capable of generating egocentric videos driven simultaneously by action descriptions and kinematic control signals. The EgoVid-5M dataset, associated action annotations, and all data cleansing metadata will be released for the advancement of research in egocentric video generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuelin Zhang, Qingpeng Ding, Long Lei, Jiwei Shan, Wenxuan Xie, Tianyi Zhang, Wanquan Yan, Raymond Shing-Yan Tang, Shing Shin Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Ultrasound (US)-guided needle insertion is widely employed in percutaneous interventions. However, providing feedback on the needle tip position via US image presents challenges due to noise, artifacts, and the thin imaging plane of US, which degrades needle features and leads to intermittent tip visibility. In this paper, a Mamba-based US needle tracker MambaXCTrack utilizing structured state space models cross-correlation (SSMX-Corr) and implicit motion prompt is proposed, which is the first application of Mamba in US needle tracking. The SSMX-Corr enhances cross-correlation by long-range modeling and global searching of distant semantic features between template and search maps, benefiting the tracking under noise and artifacts by implicitly learning potential distant semantic cues. By combining with cross-map interleaved scan (CIS), local pixel-wise interaction with positional inductive bias can also be introduced to SSMX-Corr. The implicit low-level motion descriptor is proposed as a non-visual prompt to enhance tracking robustness, addressing the intermittent tip visibility problem. Extensive experiments on a dataset with motorized needle insertion in both phantom and tissue samples demonstrate that the proposed tracker outperforms other state-of-the-art trackers while ablation studies further highlight the effectiveness of each proposed tracking module.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xun Huang, Jinlong Wang, Qiming Xia, Siheng Chen, Bisheng Yang, Cheng Wang, Chenglu Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: Current Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) systems have significantly enhanced 3D object detection using LiDAR and camera data. However, these methods suffer from performance degradation in adverse weather conditions. The weatherrobust 4D radar provides Doppler and additional geometric information, raising the possibility of addressing this challenge. To this end, we present V2X-R, the first simulated V2X dataset incorporating LiDAR, camera, and 4D radar. V2X-R contains 12,079 scenarios with 37,727 frames of LiDAR and 4D radar point clouds, 150,908 images, and 170,859 annotated 3D vehicle bounding boxes. Subsequently, we propose a novel cooperative LiDAR-4D radar fusion pipeline for 3D object detection and implement it with various fusion strategies. To achieve weather-robust detection, we additionally propose a Multi-modal Denoising Diffusion (MDD) module in our fusion pipeline. MDD utilizes weather-robust 4D radar feature as a condition to prompt the diffusion model to denoise noisy LiDAR features. Experiments show that our LiDAR-4D radar fusion pipeline demonstrates superior performance in the V2X-R dataset. Over and above this, our MDD module further improved the performance of basic fusion model by up to 5.73%/6.70% in foggy/snowy conditions with barely disrupting normal performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Feiyu Yin, Yu Lei, Siyuan Dai, Wenwen Zeng, Guoqing Wu, Liang Zhan, Jinhua Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Brain connectivity alternations associated with brain disorders have been widely reported in resting-state functional imaging (rs-fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). While many dual-modal fusion methods based on graph neural networks (GNNs) have been proposed, they generally follow homogenous fusion ways ignoring rich heterogeneity of dual-modal information. To address this issue, we propose a novel method that integrates functional and structural connectivity based on heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) to better leverage the rich heterogeneity in dual-modal images. We firstly use blood oxygen level dependency and whiter matter structure information provided by rs-fMRI and DTI to establish homo-meta-path, capturing node relationships within the same modality. At the same time, we propose to establish hetero-meta-path based on structure-function coupling and brain community searching to capture relations among cross-modal nodes. Secondly, we further introduce a heterogeneous graph pooling strategy that automatically balances homo- and hetero-meta-path, effectively leveraging heterogeneous information and preventing feature confusion after pooling. Thirdly, based on the flexibility of heterogeneous graphs, we propose a heterogeneous graph data augmentation approach that can conveniently address the sample imbalance issue commonly seen in clinical diagnosis. We evaluate our method on ADNI-3 dataset for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) diagnosis. Experimental results indicate the proposed method is effective and superior to other algorithms, with a mean classification accuracy of 93.3%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Guo, Wei Fan, Baichun Wei, Jianfei Zhu, Jin Tian, Chunzhi Yi, Feng Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Embodied reference understanding is crucial for intelligent agents to predict referents based on human intention through gesture signals and language descriptions. This paper introduces the Attention-Dynamic DINO, a novel framework designed to mitigate misinterpretations of pointing gestures across various interaction contexts. Our approach integrates visual and textual features to simultaneously predict the target object's bounding box and the attention source in pointing gestures. Leveraging the distance-aware nature of nonverbal communication in visual perspective taking, we extend the virtual touch line mechanism and propose an attention-dynamic touch line to represent referring gesture based on interactive distances. The combination of this distance-aware approach and independent prediction of the attention source, enhances the alignment between objects and the gesture represented line. Extensive experiments on the YouRefIt dataset demonstrate the efficacy of our gesture information understanding method in significantly improving task performance. Our model achieves 76.4% accuracy at the 0.25 IoU threshold and, notably, surpasses human performance at the 0.75 IoU threshold, marking a first in this domain. Comparative experiments with distance-unaware understanding methods from previous research further validate the superiority of the Attention-Dynamic Touch Line across diverse contexts.</p>

<p>Abstract: Biomass estimation of oilseed rape is crucial for optimizing crop productivity and breeding strategies. While UAV-based imaging has advanced high-throughput phenotyping, current methods often rely on orthophoto images, which struggle with overlapping leaves and incomplete structural information in complex field environments. This study integrates 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for precise 3D reconstruction and biomass estimation of oilseed rape. UAV multi-view oblique images from 36 angles were used to perform 3D reconstruction, with the SAM module enhancing point cloud segmentation. The segmented point clouds were then converted into point cloud volumes, which were fitted to ground-measured biomass using linear regression. The results showed that 3DGS (7k and 30k iterations) provided high accuracy, with peak signal-to-noise ratios (PSNR) of 27.43 and 29.53 and training times of 7 and 49 minutes, respectively. This performance exceeded that of structure from motion (SfM) and mipmap Neural Radiance Fields (Mip-NeRF), demonstrating superior efficiency. The SAM module achieved high segmentation accuracy, with a mean intersection over union (mIoU) of 0.961 and an F1-score of 0.980. Additionally, a comparison of biomass extraction models found the point cloud volume model to be the most accurate, with an determination coefficient (R2) of 0.976, root mean square error (RMSE) of 2.92 g/plant, and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 6.81%, outperforming both the plot crop volume and individual crop volume models. This study highlights the potential of combining 3DGS with multi-view UAV imaging for improved biomass phenotyping.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Quan Zhang, Yuxin Qi</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained significant recognition within the deep learning community, where the fusion of the Video Foundation Models (VFMs) and Large Language Models(LLMs) has proven instrumental in constructing robust video understanding systems, effectively surmounting constraints associated with predefined visual tasks. These sophisticated MLLMs exhibit remarkable proficiency in comprehending videos, swiftly attaining unprecedented performance levels across diverse benchmarks. However, their operation demands substantial memory and computational resources, underscoring the continued importance of traditional models in video comprehension tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel learning paradigm termed MLLM4WTAL. This paradigm harnesses the potential of MLLM to offer temporal action key semantics and complete semantic priors for conventional Weakly-supervised Temporal Action Localization (WTAL) methods. MLLM4WTAL facilitates the enhancement of WTAL by leveraging MLLM guidance. It achieves this by integrating two distinct modules: Key Semantic Matching (KSM) and Complete Semantic Reconstruction (CSR). These modules work in tandem to effectively address prevalent issues like incomplete and over-complete outcomes common in WTAL methods. Rigorous experiments are conducted to validate the efficacy of our proposed approach in augmenting the performance of various heterogeneous WTAL models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hatef Otroshi Shahreza, S\'ebastien Marcel</p>
<p>Abstract: Face recognition datasets are often collected by crawling Internet and without individuals' consents, raising ethical and privacy concerns. Generating synthetic datasets for training face recognition models has emerged as a promising alternative. However, the generation of synthetic datasets remains challenging as it entails adequate inter-class and intra-class variations. While advances in generative models have made it easier to increase intra-class variations in face datasets (such as pose, illumination, etc.), generating sufficient inter-class variation is still a difficult task. In this paper, we formulate the dataset generation as a packing problem on the embedding space (represented on a hypersphere) of a face recognition model and propose a new synthetic dataset generation approach, called HyperFace. We formalize our packing problem as an optimization problem and solve it with a gradient descent-based approach. Then, we use a conditional face generator model to synthesize face images from the optimized embeddings. We use our generated datasets to train face recognition models and evaluate the trained models on several benchmarking real datasets. Our experimental results show that models trained with HyperFace achieve state-of-the-art performance in training face recognition using synthetic datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: In autonomous driving, object detection is an essential task to perceive the environment by localizing and classifying objects. Most object detection algorithms rely on deep learning for their superior performance. However, their black box nature makes it challenging to ensure safety. In this paper, we propose a first-of-its-kind methodology for statistical analysis of the influence of various factors related to the objects to detect or the environment on the detection performance of both LiDAR- and camera-based 3D object detectors. We perform a univariate analysis between each of the factors and the detection error in order to compare the strength of influence. To better identify potential sources of detection errors, we also analyze the performance in dependency of the influencing factors and examine the interdependencies between the different influencing factors. Recognizing the factors that influence detection performance helps identify robustness issues in the trained object detector and supports the safety approval of object detection systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Geetanjali Sharma, Abhishek Tandon, Gaurav Jaswal, Aditya Nigam, Raghavendra Ramachandra</p>
<p>Abstract: Iris recognition technology plays a critical role in biometric identification systems, but their performance can be affected by variations in iris pigmentation. In this work, we investigate the impact of iris pigmentation on the efficacy of biometric recognition systems, focusing on a comparative analysis of blue and dark irises. Data sets were collected using multiple devices, including P1, P2, and P3 smartphones [4], to assess the robustness of the systems in different capture environments [19]. Both traditional machine learning techniques and deep learning models were used, namely Open-Iris, ViT-b, and ResNet50, to evaluate performance metrics such as Equal Error Rate (EER) and True Match Rate (TMR). Our results indicate that iris recognition systems generally exhibit higher accuracy for blue irises compared to dark irises. Furthermore, we examined the generalization capabilities of these systems across different iris colors and devices, finding that while training on diverse datasets enhances recognition performance, the degree of improvement is contingent on the specific model and device used. Our analysis also identifies inherent biases in recognition performance related to iris color and cross-device variability. These findings underscore the need for more inclusive dataset collection and model refinement to reduce bias and promote equitable biometric recognition across varying iris pigmentation and device configurations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Svitov, Pietro Morerio, Lourdes Agapito, Alessio Del Bue</p>
<p>Abstract: We present billboard Splatting (BBSplat) - a novel approach for 3D scene representation based on textured geometric primitives. BBSplat represents the scene as a set of optimizable textured planar primitives with learnable RGB textures and alpha-maps to control their shape. BBSplat primitives can be used in any Gaussian Splatting pipeline as drop-in replacements for Gaussians. Our method's qualitative and quantitative improvements over 3D and 2D Gaussians are most noticeable when fewer primitives are used, when BBSplat achieves over 1200 FPS. Our novel regularization term encourages textures to have a sparser structure, unlocking an efficient compression that leads to a reduction in storage space of the model. Our experiments show the efficiency of BBSplat on standard datasets of real indoor and outdoor scenes such as Tanks&Temples, DTU, and Mip-NeRF-360. We demonstrate improvements on PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics compared to the state-of-the-art, especially for the case when fewer primitives are used, which, on the other hand, leads to up to 2 times inference speed improvement for the same rendering quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ravi Kant Gupta, Dadi Dharani, Shambhavi Shanker, Amit Sethi</p>
<p>Abstract: The advancement of digital pathology, particularly through computational analysis of whole slide images (WSI), is poised to significantly enhance diagnostic precision and efficiency. However, the large size and complexity of WSIs make it difficult to analyze and classify them using computers. This study introduces a novel method for WSI classification by automating the identification and examination of the most informative patches, thus eliminating the need to process the entire slide. Our method involves two-stages: firstly, it extracts only a few patches from the WSIs based on their pathological significance; and secondly, it employs Fisher vectors (FVs) for representing features extracted from these patches, which is known for its robustness in capturing fine-grained details. This approach not only accentuates key pathological features within the WSI representation but also significantly reduces computational overhead, thus making the process more efficient and scalable. We have rigorously evaluated the proposed method across multiple datasets to benchmark its performance against comprehensive WSI analysis and contemporary weakly-supervised learning methodologies. The empirical results indicate that our focused analysis of select patches, combined with Fisher vector representation, not only aligns with, but at times surpasses, the classification accuracy of standard practices. Moreover, this strategy notably diminishes computational load and resource expenditure, thereby establishing an efficient and precise framework for WSI analysis in the realm of digital pathology.</p>

<p>Abstract: We address the challenge of automated classification of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) into its two primary subtypes: activated B-cell-like (ABC) and germinal center B-cell-like (GCB). Accurate classification between these subtypes is essential for determining the appropriate therapeutic strategy, given their distinct molecular profiles and treatment responses. Our proposed deep learning model demonstrates robust performance, achieving an average area under the curve (AUC) of (87.4 pm 5.7)\% during cross-validation. It shows a high positive predictive value (PPV), highlighting its potential for clinical application, such as triaging for molecular testing. To gain biological insights, we performed an analysis of morphological features of ABC and GCB subtypes. We segmented cell nuclei using a pre-trained deep neural network and compared the statistics of geometric and color features for ABC and GCB. We found that the distributions of these features were not very different for the two subtypes, which suggests that the visual differences between them are more subtle. These results underscore the potential of our method to assist in more precise subtype classification and can contribute to improved treatment management and outcomes for patients of DLBCL.</p>

<p>Abstract: Meningeal lymphatic vessels (MLVs) are responsible for the drainage of waste products from the human brain. An impairment in their functionality has been associated with aging as well as brain disorders like multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease. However, MLVs have only recently been described for the first time in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and their ramified structure renders manual segmentation particularly difficult. Further, as there is no consistent notion of their appearance, human-annotated MLV structures contain a high inter-rater variability that most automatic segmentation methods cannot take into account. In this work, we propose a new rater-aware training scheme for the popular nnU-Net model, and we explore rater-based ensembling strategies for accurate and consistent segmentation of MLVs. This enables us to boost nnU-Net's performance while obtaining explicit predictions in different annotation styles and a rater-based uncertainty estimation. Our final model, MLV$^2$-Net, achieves a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.806 with respect to the human reference standard. The model further matches the human inter-rater reliability and replicates age-related associations with MLV volume.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Jin, Qianqian Qiao, Yi Lu, Huaye Wang, Heng Huang, Shan Gao, Jianfei Liu, Rui Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Datasets play a pivotal role in training visual models, facilitating the development of abstract understandings of visual features through diverse image samples and multidimensional attributes. However, in the realm of aesthetic evaluation of artistic images, datasets remain relatively scarce. Existing painting datasets are often characterized by limited scoring dimensions and insufficient annotations, thereby constraining the advancement and application of automatic aesthetic evaluation methods in the domain of painting. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Aesthetics Paintings and Drawings Dataset (APDD), the first comprehensive collection of paintings encompassing 24 distinct artistic categories and 10 aesthetic attributes. Building upon the initial release of APDDv1, our ongoing research has identified opportunities for enhancement in data scale and annotation precision. Consequently, APDDv2 boasts an expanded image corpus and improved annotation quality, featuring detailed language comments to better cater to the needs of both researchers and practitioners seeking high-quality painting datasets. Furthermore, we present an updated version of the Art Assessment Network for Specific Painting Styles, denoted as ArtCLIP. Experimental validation demonstrates the superior performance of this revised model in the realm of aesthetic evaluation, surpassing its predecessor in accuracy and efficacy. The dataset and model are available at https://github.com/BestiVictory/APDDv2.git.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ashkan Nejad, Mohammad Reza Faraji, Xiaojun Qi</p>
<p>Abstract: With the widespread adoption of digital devices equipped with cameras and the rapid development of Internet technology, numerous content-based image retrieval systems and novel image feature extraction techniques have emerged in recent years. This paper introduces a saliency map-based image retrieval approach using invariant Krawtchouk moments (SM-IKM) to enhance retrieval speed and accuracy. The proposed method applies a global contrast-based salient region detection algorithm to create a saliency map that effectively isolates the foreground from the background. It then combines multiple orders of invariant Krawtchouk moments (IKM) with local binary patterns (LBPs) and color histograms to comprehensively represent the foreground and background. Additionally, it incorporates LBPs derived from the saliency map to improve discriminative power, facilitating more precise image differentiation. A bag-of-visual-words (BoVW) model is employed to generate a codebook for classification and discrimination. By using compact IKMs in the BoVW framework and integrating a range of region-based feature-including color histograms, LBPs, and saliency map-enhanced LBPs, our proposed SM-IKM achieves efficient and accurate image retrieval. xtensive experiments on publicly available datasets, such as Caltech 101 and Wang, demonstrate that SM-IKM outperforms recent state-of-the-art retrieval methods. The source code for SM-IKM is available at github.com/arnejad/SMIKM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengyuan Zhang, Yilin Zhang, Lei Zhu, Deyin Liu, Lin Wu, Bo Li, Shichao Zhang, Mohammed Bennamoun, Farid Boussaid</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for unified incremental few-shot object detection (iFSOD) and instance segmentation (iFSIS) using the Transformer architecture. Our goal is to create an optimal solution for situations where only a few examples of novel object classes are available, with no access to training data for base or old classes, while maintaining high performance across both base and novel classes. To achieve this, We extend Mask-DINO into a two-stage incremental learning framework. Stage 1 focuses on optimizing the model using the base dataset, while Stage 2 involves fine-tuning the model on novel classes. Besides, we incorporate a classifier selection strategy that assigns appropriate classifiers to the encoder and decoder according to their distinct functions. Empirical evidence indicates that this approach effectively mitigates the over-fitting on novel classes learning. Furthermore, we implement knowledge distillation to prevent catastrophic forgetting of base classes. Comprehensive evaluations on the COCO and LVIS datasets for both iFSIS and iFSOD tasks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youzhi Liu, Fanglong Yao, Yuanchang Yue, Guangluan Xu, Xian Sun, Kun Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN), as a widely discussed research direction in embodied intelligence, aims to enable embodied agents to navigate in complicated visual environments through natural language commands. Most existing VLN methods focus on indoor ground robot scenarios. However, when applied to UAV VLN in outdoor urban scenes, it faces two significant challenges. First, urban scenes contain numerous objects, which makes it challenging to match fine-grained landmarks in images with complex textual descriptions of these landmarks. Second, overall environmental information encompasses multiple modal dimensions, and the diversity of representations significantly increases the complexity of the encoding process. To address these challenges, we propose NavAgent, the first urban UAV embodied navigation model driven by a large Vision-Language Model. NavAgent undertakes navigation tasks by synthesizing multi-scale environmental information, including topological maps (global), panoramas (medium), and fine-grained landmarks (local). Specifically, we utilize GLIP to build a visual recognizer for landmark capable of identifying and linguisticizing fine-grained landmarks. Subsequently, we develop dynamically growing scene topology map that integrate environmental information and employ Graph Convolutional Networks to encode global environmental data. In addition, to train the visual recognizer for landmark, we develop NavAgent-Landmark2K, the first fine-grained landmark dataset for real urban street scenes. In experiments conducted on the Touchdown and Map2seq datasets, NavAgent outperforms strong baseline models. The code and dataset will be released to the community to facilitate the exploration and development of outdoor VLN.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jun Xie, Wenxiao Li, Faqiang Wang, Liqiang Zhang, Zhengyang Hou, Jun Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Morphological methods play a crucial role in remote sensing image processing, due to their ability to capture and preserve small structural details. However, most of the existing deep learning models for semantic segmentation are based on the encoder-decoder architecture including U-net and Segment Anything Model (SAM), where the downsampling process tends to discard fine details. In this paper, we propose a new approach that integrates learnable morphological skeleton prior into deep neural networks using the variational method. To address the difficulty in backpropagation in neural networks caused by the non-differentiability presented in classical morphological operations, we provide a smooth representation of the morphological skeleton and design a variational segmentation model integrating morphological skeleton prior by employing operator splitting and dual methods. Then, we integrate this model into the network architecture of SAM, which is achieved by adding a token to mask decoder and modifying the final sigmoid layer, ensuring the final segmentation results preserve the skeleton structure as much as possible. Experimental results on remote sensing datasets, including buildings and roads, demonstrate that our method outperforms the original SAM on slender object segmentation and exhibits better generalization capability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dominik Borer, Jakob Buhmann, Martin Guay</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern pose estimation models are trained on large, manually-labelled datasets which are costly and may not cover the full extent of human poses and appearances in the real world. With advances in neural rendering, analysis-by-synthesis and the ability to not only predict, but also render the pose, is becoming an appealing framework, which could alleviate the need for large scale manual labelling efforts. While recent work have shown the feasibility of this approach, the predictions admit many flips due to a simplistic intermediate skeleton representation, resulting in low precision and inhibiting the acquisition of any downstream knowledge such as three-dimensional positioning. We solve this problem with a more expressive intermediate skeleton representation capable of capturing the semantics of the pose (left and right), which significantly reduces flips. To successfully train this new representation, we extend the analysis-by-synthesis framework with a training protocol based on synthetic data. We show that our representation results in less flips and more accurate predictions. Our approach outperforms previous models trained with analysis-by-synthesis on standard benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengwei Yin, Jingjing Wang, Guanzhong Zeng, Di Xie, Jiang Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: The ability of gaze estimation models to generalize is often significantly hindered by various factors unrelated to gaze, especially when the training dataset is limited. Current strategies aim to address this challenge through different domain generalization techniques, yet they have had limited success due to the risk of overfitting when solely relying on value labels for regression. Recent progress in pre-trained vision-language models has motivated us to capitalize on the abundant semantic information available. We propose a novel approach in this paper, reframing the gaze estimation task as a vision-language alignment issue. Our proposed framework, named Language-Guided Gaze Estimation (LG-Gaze), learns continuous and geometry-sensitive features for gaze estimation benefit from the rich prior knowledges of vision-language models. Specifically, LG-Gaze aligns gaze features with continuous linguistic features through our proposed multimodal contrastive regression loss, which customizes adaptive weights for different negative samples. Furthermore, to better adapt to the labels for gaze estimation task, we propose a geometry-aware interpolation method to obtain more precise gaze embeddings. Through extensive experiments, we validate the efficacy of our framework in four different cross-domain evaluation tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Caroline Magg, Hoel Kervadec, Clara I. S\'anchez</p>
<p>Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) and similar models build a family of promptable foundation models (FMs) for image and video segmentation. The object of interest is identified using prompts, such as bounding boxes or points. With these FMs becoming part of medical image segmentation, extensive evaluation studies are required to assess their strengths and weaknesses in clinical setting. Since the performance is highly dependent on the chosen prompting strategy, it is important to investigate different prompting techniques to define optimal guidelines that ensure effective use in medical image segmentation. Currently, no dedicated evaluation studies exist specifically for bone segmentation in CT scans, leaving a gap in understanding the performance for this task. Thus, we use non-iterative, ``optimal'' prompting strategies composed of bounding box, points and combinations to test the zero-shot capability of SAM-family models for bone CT segmentation on three different skeletal regions. Our results show that the best settings depend on the model type and size, dataset characteristics and objective to optimize. Overall, SAM and SAM2 prompted with a bounding box in combination with the center point for all the components of an object yield the best results across all tested settings. As the results depend on multiple factors, we provide a guideline for informed decision-making in 2D prompting with non-interactive, ''optimal'' prompts.</p>

<p>Abstract: The remarkable progress in neural-network-driven visual data generation, especially with neural rendering techniques like Neural Radiance Fields and 3D Gaussian splatting, offers a powerful alternative to GANs and diffusion models. These methods can produce high-fidelity images and lifelike avatars, highlighting the need for robust detection methods. In response, an unsupervised training technique is proposed that enables the model to extract comprehensive features from the Fourier spectrum magnitude, thereby overcoming the challenges of reconstructing the spectrum due to its centrosymmetric properties. By leveraging the spectral domain and dynamically combining it with spatial domain information, we create a robust multimodal detector that demonstrates superior generalization capabilities in identifying challenging synthetic images generated by the latest image synthesis techniques. To address the absence of a 3D neural rendering-based fake image database, we develop a comprehensive database that includes images generated by diverse neural rendering techniques, providing a robust foundation for evaluating and advancing detection methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose MikuDance, a diffusion-based pipeline incorporating mixed motion dynamics to animate stylized character art. MikuDance consists of two key techniques: Mixed Motion Modeling and Mixed-Control Diffusion, to address the challenges of high-dynamic motion and reference-guidance misalignment in character art animation. Specifically, a Scene Motion Tracking strategy is presented to explicitly model the dynamic camera in pixel-wise space, enabling unified character-scene motion modeling. Building on this, the Mixed-Control Diffusion implicitly aligns the scale and body shape of diverse characters with motion guidance, allowing flexible control of local character motion. Subsequently, a Motion-Adaptive Normalization module is incorporated to effectively inject global scene motion, paving the way for comprehensive character art animation. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of MikuDance across various character art and motion guidance, consistently producing high-quality animations with remarkable motion dynamics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanz Cuevas-Velasquez, Priyanka Patel, Haiwen Feng, Michael Black</p>
<p>Abstract: Training methods to perform robust 3D human pose and shape (HPS) estimation requires diverse training images with accurate ground truth. While BEDLAM demonstrates the potential of traditional procedural graphics to generate such data, the training images are clearly synthetic. In contrast, generative image models produce highly realistic images but without ground truth. Putting these methods together seems straightforward: use a generative model with the body ground truth as controlling signal. However, we find that, the more realistic the generated images, the more they deviate from the ground truth, making them inappropriate for training and evaluation. Enhancements of realistic details, such as clothing and facial expressions, can lead to subtle yet significant deviations from the ground truth, potentially misleading training models. We empirically verify that this misalignment causes the accuracy of HPS networks to decline when trained with generated images. To address this, we design a controllable synthesis method that effectively balances image realism with precise ground truth. We use this to create the Generative BEDLAM (Gen-B) dataset, which improves the realism of the existing synthetic BEDLAM dataset while preserving ground truth accuracy. We perform extensive experiments, with various noise-conditioning strategies, to evaluate the tradeoff between visual realism and HPS accuracy. We show, for the first time, that generative image models can be controlled by traditional graphics methods to produce training data that increases the accuracy of HPS methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youqi Liao, Xieyuanli Chen, Shuhao Kang, Jianping Li, Zhen Dong, Hongchao Fan, Bisheng Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: OpenStreetMap (OSM), an online and versatile source of volunteered geographic information (VGI), is widely used for human self-localization by matching nearby visual observations with vectorized map data. However, due to the divergence in modalities and views, image-to-OSM (I2O) matching and localization remain challenging for robots, preventing the full utilization of VGI data in the unmanned ground vehicles and logistic industry. Inspired by the fact that the human brain relies on geometric and semantic understanding of sensory information for spatial localization tasks, we propose the OSMLoc in this paper. OSMLoc is a brain-inspired single-image visual localization method with semantic and geometric guidance to improve accuracy, robustness, and generalization ability. First, we equip the OSMLoc with the visual foundational model to extract powerful image features. Second, a geometry-guided depth distribution adapter is proposed to bridge the monocular depth estimation and camera-to-BEV transform. Thirdly, the semantic embeddings from the OSM data are utilized as auxiliary guidance for image-to-OSM feature matching. To validate the proposed OSMLoc, we collect a worldwide cross-area and cross-condition (CC) benchmark for extensive evaluation. Experiments on the MGL dataset, CC validation benchmark, and KITTI dataset have demonstrated the superiority of our method.

<p>Abstract: The very shallow marine basin of Puck Lagoon in the southern Baltic Sea, on the Northern coast of Poland, hosts valuable benthic habitats and cultural heritage sites. These include, among others, protected Zostera marina meadows, one of the Baltic's major medieval harbours, a ship graveyard, and likely other submerged features that are yet to be discovered. Prior to this project, no comprehensive high-resolution remote sensing data were available for this area. This article describes the first Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) derived from a combination of airborne bathymetric LiDAR, multibeam echosounder, airborne photogrammetry and satellite imagery. These datasets also include multibeam echosounder backscatter and LiDAR intensity, allowing determination of the character and properties of the seafloor. Combined, these datasets are a vital resource for assessing and understanding seafloor morphology, benthic habitats, cultural heritage, and submerged landscapes. Given the significance of Puck Lagoon's hydrographical, ecological, geological, and archaeological environs, the high-resolution bathymetry, acquired by our project, can provide the foundation for sustainable management and informed decision-making for this area of interest.</p>

<p>Abstract: Given the potential applications of generating recipes from food images, this area has garnered significant attention from researchers in recent years. Existing works for recipe generation primarily utilize a two-stage training method, first generating ingredients and then obtaining instructions from both the image and ingredients. Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs), which have achieved notable success across a variety of vision and language tasks, shed light to generating both ingredients and instructions directly from images. Nevertheless, LMMs still face the common issue of hallucinations during recipe generation, leading to suboptimal performance. To tackle this, we propose a retrieval augmented large multimodal model for recipe generation. We first introduce Stochastic Diversified Retrieval Augmentation (SDRA) to retrieve recipes semantically related to the image from an existing datastore as a supplement, integrating them into the prompt to add diverse and rich context to the input image. Additionally, Self-Consistency Ensemble Voting mechanism is proposed to determine the most confident prediction recipes as the final output. It calculates the consistency among generated recipe candidates, which use different retrieval recipes as context for generation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, which demonstrates state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in recipe generation tasks on the Recipe1M dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sagnik Majumder, Tushar Nagarajan, Ziad Al-Halah, Reina Pradhan, Kristen Grauman</p>
<p>Abstract: Given a multi-view video, which viewpoint is most informative for a human observer? Existing methods rely on heuristics or expensive ``best-view" supervision to answer this question, limiting their applicability. We propose a weakly supervised approach that leverages language accompanying an instructional multi-view video as a means to recover its most informative viewpoint(s). Our key hypothesis is that the more accurately an individual view can predict a view-agnostic text summary, the more informative it is. To put this into action, we propose a framework that uses the relative accuracy of view-dependent caption predictions as a proxy for best view pseudo-labels. Then, those pseudo-labels are used to train a view selector, together with an auxiliary camera pose predictor that enhances view-sensitivity. During inference, our model takes as input only a multi-view video -- no language or camera poses -- and returns the best viewpoint to watch at each timestep. On two challenging datasets comprised of diverse multi-camera setups and how-to activities, our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, both with quantitative metrics and human evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sareh Soltani Nejad, Anwar Haque</p>
<p>Abstract: The widespread implementation of urban surveillance systems has necessitated more sophisticated techniques for anomaly detection to ensure enhanced public safety. This paper presents a significant advancement in the field of anomaly detection through the application of Two-Stream Inflated 3D (I3D) Convolutional Networks. These networks substantially outperform traditional 3D Convolutional Networks (C3D) by more effectively extracting spatial and temporal features from surveillance videos, thus improving the precision of anomaly detection. Our research advances the field by implementing a weakly supervised learning framework based on Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), which uniquely conceptualizes surveillance videos as collections of 'bags' that contain instances (video clips). Each instance is innovatively processed through a ranking mechanism that prioritizes clips based on their potential to display anomalies. This novel strategy not only enhances the accuracy and precision of anomaly detection but also significantly diminishes the dependency on extensive manual annotations. Moreover, through meticulous optimization of model settings, including the choice of optimizer, our approach not only establishes new benchmarks in the performance of anomaly detection systems but also offers a scalable and efficient solution for real-world surveillance applications. This paper contributes significantly to the field of computer vision by delivering a more adaptable, efficient, and context-aware anomaly detection system, which is poised to redefine practices in urban surveillance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yangyang Li, Xuanting Hao, Ronghua Shang, Licheng Jiao</p>
<p>Abstract: In view of the fact that semi- and self-supervised learning share a fundamental principle, effectively modeling knowledge from unlabeled data, various semi-supervised semantic segmentation methods have integrated representative self-supervised learning paradigms for further regularization. However, the potential of the state-of-the-art generative self-supervised paradigm, masked image modeling, has been scarcely studied. This paradigm learns the knowledge through establishing connections between the masked and visible parts of masked image, during the pixel reconstruction process. By inheriting and extending this insight, we successfully leverage masked image modeling to boost semi-supervised semantic segmentation. Specifically, we introduce a novel class-wise masked image modeling that independently reconstructs different image regions according to their respective classes. In this way, the mask-induced connections are established within each class, mitigating the semantic confusion that arises from plainly reconstructing images in basic masked image modeling. To strengthen these intra-class connections, we further develop a feature aggregation strategy that minimizes the distances between features corresponding to the masked and visible parts within the same class. Additionally, in semantic space, we explore the application of masked image modeling to enhance regularization. Extensive experiments conducted on well-known benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance. The code will be available at https://github.com/haoxt/S4MIM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanting Chen, Yi Ren, Xiaoting Qin, Jue Zhang, Kehong Yuan, Lu Han, Qingwei Lin, Dongmei Zhang, Saravan Rajmohan, Qi Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Video recordings of user activities, particularly desktop recordings, offer a rich source of data for understanding user behaviors and automating processes. However, despite advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and their increasing use in video analysis, extracting user actions from desktop recordings remains an underexplored area. This paper addresses this gap by proposing two novel VLM-based methods for user action extraction: the Direct Frame-Based Approach (DF), which inputs sampled frames directly into VLMs, and the Differential Frame-Based Approach (DiffF), which incorporates explicit frame differences detected via computer vision techniques. We evaluate these methods using a basic self-curated dataset and an advanced benchmark adapted from prior work. Our results show that the DF approach achieves an accuracy of 70% to 80% in identifying user actions, with the extracted action sequences being re-playable though Robotic Process Automation. We find that while VLMs show potential, incorporating explicit UI changes can degrade performance, making the DF approach more reliable. This work represents the first application of VLMs for extracting user action sequences from desktop recordings, contributing new methods, benchmarks, and insights for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianing Zhou, Han Li, Shuai Zhang, Ning Xie, Ruijie Wang, Xiaohan Nie, Sheng Liu, Lingyun Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Handling lengthy context is crucial for enhancing the recognition and understanding capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in applications such as processing high-resolution images or high frame rate videos. The rise in image resolution and frame rate substantially increases computational demands due to the increased number of input tokens. This challenge is further exacerbated by the quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length of the self-attention mechanism. Most prior works either pre-train models with long contexts, overlooking the efficiency problem, or attempt to reduce the context length via downsampling (e.g., identify the key image patches or frames) to decrease the context length, which may result in information loss. To circumvent this issue while keeping the remarkable effectiveness of MLLMs, we propose a novel approach using a hybrid transformer-MAMBA model to efficiently handle long contexts in multimodal applications. Our multimodal model can effectively process long context input exceeding 100k tokens, outperforming existing models across various benchmarks. Remarkably, our model enhances inference efficiency for high-resolution images and high-frame-rate videos by about 4 times compared to current models, with efficiency gains increasing as image resolution or video frames rise. Furthermore, our model is the first to be trained on low-resolution images or low-frame-rate videos while being capable of inference on high-resolution images and high-frame-rate videos, offering flexibility for inference in diverse scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mijeong Kim, Jongwoo Lim, Bohyung Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Novel view synthesis of dynamic scenes is becoming important in various applications, including augmented and virtual reality. We propose a novel 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) algorithm for dynamic scenes from casually recorded monocular videos. To overcome the overfitting problem of existing work for these real-world videos, we introduce an uncertainty-aware regularization that identifies uncertain regions with few observations and selectively imposes additional priors based on diffusion models and depth smoothness on such regions. This approach improves both the performance of novel view synthesis and the quality of training image reconstruction. We also identify the initialization problem of 4DGS in fast-moving dynamic regions, where the Structure from Motion (SfM) algorithm fails to provide reliable 3D landmarks. To initialize Gaussian primitives in such regions, we present a dynamic region densification method using the estimated depth maps and scene flow. Our experiments show that the proposed method improves the performance of 4DGS reconstruction from a video captured by a handheld monocular camera and also exhibits promising results in few-shot static scene reconstruction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Brian Hsuan-Cheng Liao, Yingjie Xu, Chih-Hong Cheng, Hasan Esen, Alois Knoll</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a monitoring framework that infers the level of autonomous vehicle (AV) collision risk based on its object detector's performance using only monocular camera images. Essentially, the framework takes two sets of predictions produced by different algorithms and associates their inconsistencies with the collision risk via fuzzy inference. The first set of predictions is obtained through retrieving safety-critical 2.5D objects from a depth map, and the second set comes from the AV's 3D object detector. We experimentally validate that, based on Intersection-over-Union (IoU) and a depth discrepancy measure, the inconsistencies between the two sets of predictions strongly correlate to the safety-related error of the 3D object detector against ground truths. This correlation allows us to construct a fuzzy inference system and map the inconsistency measures to an existing collision risk indicator. In particular, we apply various knowledge- and data-driven techniques and find using particle swarm optimization that learns general fuzzy rules gives the best mapping result. Lastly, we validate our monitor's capability to produce relevant risk estimates with the large-scale nuScenes dataset and show it can safeguard an AV in closed-loop simulations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taha Bouhsine</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a yat-product-powered neural network, the Neural Matter Network (NMN), a breakthrough in deep learning that achieves non-linear pattern recognition without activation functions. Our key innovation relies on the yat-product and yat-product, which naturally induces non-linearity by projecting inputs into a pseudo-metric space, eliminating the need for traditional activation functions while maintaining only a softmax layer for final class probability distribution. This approach simplifies network architecture and provides unprecedented transparency into the network's decision-making process. Our comprehensive empirical evaluation across different datasets demonstrates that NMN consistently outperforms traditional MLPs. The results challenge the assumption that separate activation functions are necessary for effective deep-learning models. The implications of this work extend beyond immediate architectural benefits, by eliminating intermediate activation functions while preserving non-linear capabilities, yat-MLP establishes a new paradigm for neural network design that combines simplicity with effectiveness. Most importantly, our approach provides unprecedented insights into the traditionally opaque "black-box" nature of neural networks, offering a clearer understanding of how these models process and classify information.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Di Xu, Yang Yang, Hengjie Liu, Qihui Lyu, Martina Descovich, Dan Ruan, Ke Sheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Computed tomography (CT) provides high spatial resolution visualization of 3D structures for scientific and clinical applications. Traditional analytical/iterative CT reconstruction algorithms require hundreds of angular data samplings, a condition that may not be met in practice due to physical and mechanical limitations. Sparse view CT reconstruction has been proposed using constrained optimization and machine learning methods with varying success, less so for ultra-sparse view CT reconstruction with one to two views. Neural radiance field (NeRF) is a powerful tool for reconstructing and rendering 3D natural scenes from sparse views, but its direct application to 3D medical image reconstruction has been minimally successful due to the differences between optical and X-ray photon transportation. Here, we develop a novel TomoGRAF framework incorporating the unique X-ray transportation physics to reconstruct high-quality 3D volumes using ultra-sparse projections without prior. TomoGRAF captures the CT imaging geometry, simulates the X-ray casting and tracing process, and penalizes the difference between simulated and ground truth CT sub-volume during training. We evaluated the performance of TomoGRAF on an unseen dataset of distinct imaging characteristics from the training data and demonstrated a vast leap in performance compared with state-of-the-art deep learning and NeRF methods. TomoGRAF provides the first generalizable solution for image-guided radiotherapy and interventional radiology applications, where only one or a few X-ray views are available, but 3D volumetric information is desired.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuohang Yu, Ling An, Yansong Li, Yu Wu, Zeyu Dong, Zhangdi Liu, Le Gao, Zhenyu Zhang, Chichun Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Conventional methods, including Decision Tree (DT)-based methods, have been effective in scientific tasks, such as non-image medical diagnostics, system anomaly detection, and inorganic catalysis efficiency prediction. However, most deep-learning techniques have struggled to surpass or even match this level of success as traditional machine-learning methods. The primary reason is that these applications involve multi-source, heterogeneous data where features lack explicit relationships. This contrasts with image data, where pixels exhibit spatial relationships; textual data, where words have sequential dependencies; and graph data, where nodes are connected through established associations. The absence of explicit Feature Relation Patterns (FRPs) presents a significant challenge for deep learning techniques in scientific applications that are not image, text, and graph-based. In this paper, we introduce EAPCR, a universal feature extractor designed for data without explicit FRPs. Tested across various scientific tasks, EAPCR consistently outperforms traditional methods and bridges the gap where deep learning models fall short. To further demonstrate its robustness, we synthesize a dataset without explicit FRPs. While Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) and feature extractors like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), and Transformers struggle, EAPCR excels, demonstrating its robustness and superior performance in scientific tasks without FRPs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Runze Cheng, Zhongao Sun, Ye Zhang, Chun Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) provides essential complementary information for analyzing brain tumor subregions. While methods using four common MRI modalities for automatic segmentation have shown success, they often face challenges with missing modalities due to image quality issues, inconsistent protocols, allergic reactions, or cost factors. Thus, developing a segmentation paradigm that handles missing modalities is clinically valuable. A novel single-modality parallel processing network framework based on H\"older divergence and mutual information is introduced. Each modality is independently input into a shared network backbone for parallel processing, preserving unique information. Additionally, a dynamic sharing framework is introduced that adjusts network parameters based on modality availability. A H\"older divergence and mutual information-based loss functions are used for evaluating discrepancies between predictions and labels. Extensive testing on the BraTS 2018 and BraTS 2020 datasets demonstrates that our method outperforms existing techniques in handling missing modalities and validates each component's effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yangyang Guo, Fangkai Jiao, Liqiang Nie, Mohan Kankanhalli</p>
<p>Abstract: The vulnerability of Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) to jailbreak attacks appears as no surprise. However, recent defense mechanisms against these attacks have reached near-saturation performance on benchmarks, often with minimal effort. This simultaneous high performance in both attack and defense presents a perplexing paradox. Resolving it is critical for advancing the development of trustworthy models. To address this research gap, we first investigate why VLLMs are prone to these attacks. We then make a key observation: existing defense mechanisms suffer from an \textbf{over-prudence} problem, resulting in unexpected abstention even in the presence of benign inputs. Additionally, we find that the two representative evaluation methods for jailbreak often exhibit chance agreement. This limitation makes it potentially misleading when evaluating attack strategies or defense mechanisms. Beyond these empirical observations, our another contribution in this work is to repurpose the guardrails of LLMs on the shelf, as an effective alternative detector prior to VLLM response. We believe these findings offer useful insights to rethink the foundational development of VLLM safety with respect to benchmark datasets, evaluation methods, and defense strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Laiqiao Qin, Tianqing Zhu, Linlin Wang, Wanlei Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine unlearning is new emerged technology that removes a subset of the training data from a trained model without affecting the model performance on the remaining data. This topic is becoming increasingly important in protecting user privacy and eliminating harmful or outdated data. The key challenge lies in effectively and efficiently unlearning specific information without compromising the model's utility on the retained data. For the pre-trained models, fine-tuning is an important way to achieve the unlearning target. Previous work typically fine-tuned the entire model's parameters, which incurs significant computation costs. In addition, the fine-tuning process may cause shifts in the intermediate layer features, affecting the model's overall utility. In this work, we propose a novel and efficient machine unlearning method on pre-trained models. We term the method as Residual Feature Alignment Unlearning. Specifically, we leverage LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) to decompose the model's intermediate features into pre-trained features and residual features. By adjusting the residual features, we align the unlearned model with the pre-trained model at the intermediate feature level to achieve both unlearning and remaining targets. The method aims to learn the zero residuals on the retained set and shifted residuals on the unlearning set. Extensive experiments on numerous datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhen-Ting Liu, Shang-Tse Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Model Inversion (MI) attacks pose a significant threat to the privacy of Deep Neural Networks by recovering training data distribution from well-trained models. While existing defenses often rely on regularization techniques to reduce information leakage, they remain vulnerable to recent attacks. In this paper, we propose the Trapdoor-based Model Inversion Defense (Trap-MID) to mislead MI attacks. A trapdoor is integrated into the model to predict a specific label when the input is injected with the corresponding trigger. Consequently, this trapdoor information serves as the "shortcut" for MI attacks, leading them to extract trapdoor triggers rather than private data. We provide theoretical insights into the impacts of trapdoor's effectiveness and naturalness on deceiving MI attacks. In addition, empirical experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art defense performance of Trap-MID against various MI attacks without the requirements for extra data or large computational overhead.

<p>Abstract: Total hip arthroplasty (THA) relies on accurate landmark detection from radiographic images, but unstructured data caused by irregular patient postures or occluded anatomical markers pose significant challenges for existing methods. To address this, we propose UNSCT-HRNet (Unstructured CT - High-Resolution Net), a deep learning-based framework that integrates a Spatial Relationship Fusion (SRF) module and an Uncertainty Estimation (UE) module. The SRF module, utilizing coordinate convolution and polarized attention, enhances the model's ability to capture complex spatial relationships. Meanwhile, the UE module which based on entropy ensures predictions are anatomically relevant. For unstructured data, the proposed method can predict landmarks without relying on the fixed number of points, which shows higher accuracy and better robustness comparing with the existing methods. Our UNSCT-HRNet demonstrates over a 60% improvement across multiple metrics in unstructured data. The experimental results also reveal that our approach maintains good performance on the structured dataset. Overall, the proposed UNSCT-HRNet has the potential to be used as a new reliable, automated solution for THA surgical planning and postoperative monitoring.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurately determining the shape and location of internal structures within deformable objects is crucial for medical tasks that require precise targeting, such as robotic biopsies. We introduce LUDO, a method for accurate low-latency understanding of deformable objects. LUDO reconstructs objects in their deformed state, including their internal structures, from a single-view point cloud observation in under 30 ms using occupancy networks. We demonstrate LUDO's abilities for autonomous targeting of internal regions of interest (ROIs) in highly deformable objects. Additionally, LUDO provides uncertainty estimates and explainability for its predictions, both of which are important in safety-critical applications such as surgical interventions. We evaluate LUDO in real-world robotic experiments, achieving a success rate of 98.9% for puncturing various ROIs inside highly deformable objects. LUDO demonstrates the potential to interact with deformable objects without the need for deformable registration methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in the field of saliency have concentrated on fixation prediction, with benchmarks reaching saturation. However, there is an extensive body of works in psychology and neuroscience that describe aspects of human visual attention that might not be adequately captured by current approaches. Here, we investigate singleton detection, which can be thought of as a canonical example of salience. We introduce two novel datasets, one with psychophysical patterns and one with natural odd-one-out stimuli. Using these datasets we demonstrate through extensive experimentation that nearly all saliency algorithms do not adequately respond to singleton targets in synthetic and natural images. Furthermore, we investigate the effect of training state-of-the-art CNN-based saliency models on these types of stimuli and conclude that the additional training data does not lead to a significant improvement of their ability to find odd-one-out targets.

<p>Abstract: Histopathological image classification is an important task in medical image analysis. Recent approaches generally rely on weakly supervised learning due to the ease of acquiring case-level labels from pathology reports. However, patch-level classification is preferable in applications where only a limited number of cases are available or when local prediction accuracy is critical. On the other hand, acquiring extensive datasets with localized labels for training is not feasible. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised patch-level histopathological image classification model, named CLASS-M, that does not require extensively labeled datasets. CLASS-M is formed by two main parts: a contrastive learning module that uses separated Hematoxylin and Eosin images generated through an adaptive stain separation process, and a module with pseudo-labels using MixUp. We compare our model with other state-of-the-art models on two clear cell renal cell carcinoma datasets. We demonstrate that our CLASS-M model has the best performance on both datasets.

<p>Abstract: Reconstructing and rendering 3D objects from highly sparse views is of critical importance for promoting applications of 3D vision techniques and improving user experience. However, images from sparse views only contain very limited 3D information, leading to two significant challenges: 1) Difficulty in building multi-view consistency as images for matching are too few; 2) Partially omitted or highly compressed object information as view coverage is insufficient. To tackle these challenges, we propose GaussianObject, a framework to represent and render the 3D object with Gaussian splatting that achieves high rendering quality with only 4 input images. We first introduce techniques of visual hull and floater elimination, which explicitly inject structure priors into the initial optimization process to help build multi-view consistency, yielding a coarse 3D Gaussian representation. Then we construct a Gaussian repair model based on diffusion models to supplement the omitted object information, where Gaussians are further refined. We design a self-generating strategy to obtain image pairs for training the repair model. We further design a COLMAP-free variant, where pre-given accurate camera poses are not required, which achieves competitive quality and facilitates wider applications. GaussianObject is evaluated on several challenging datasets, including MipNeRF360, OmniObject3D, OpenIllumination, and our-collected unposed images, achieving superior performance from only four views and significantly outperforming previous SOTA methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daan Bon, Gautam Pai, Gijs Bellaard, Olga Mula, Remco Duits</p>
<p>Abstract: The roto-translation group SE2 has been of active interest in image analysis due to methods that lift the image data to multi-orientation representations defined on this Lie group. This has led to impactful applications of crossing-preserving flows for image de-noising, geodesic tracking, and roto-translation equivariant deep learning. In this paper, we develop a computational framework for optimal transportation over Lie groups, with a special focus on SE2. We make several theoretical contributions (generalizable to matrix Lie groups) such as the non-optimality of group actions as transport maps, invariance and equivariance of optimal transport, and the quality of the entropic-regularized optimal transport plan using geodesic distance approximations. We develop a Sinkhorn like algorithm that can be efficiently implemented using fast and accurate distance approximations of the Lie group and GPU-friendly group convolutions. We report valuable advancements in the experiments on 1) image barycentric interpolation, 2) interpolation of planar orientation fields, and 3) Wasserstein gradient flows on SE2. We observe that our framework of lifting images to SE2 and optimal transport with left-invariant anisotropic metrics leads to equivariant transport along dominant contours and salient line structures in the image.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Banglei Guan, Ji Zhao, Laurent Kneip</p>
<p>Abstract: Relative pose estimation using point correspondences (PC) is a widely used technique. A minimal configuration of six PCs is required for two views of generalized cameras. In this paper, we present several minimal solvers that use six PCs to compute the 6DOF relative pose of multi-camera systems, including a minimal solver for the generalized camera and two minimal solvers for the practical configuration of two-camera rigs. The equation construction is based on the decoupling of rotation and translation. Rotation is represented by Cayley or quaternion parametrization, and translation can be eliminated by using the hidden variable technique. Ray bundle constraints are found and proven when a subset of PCs relate the same cameras across two views. This is the key to reducing the number of solutions and generating numerically stable solvers. Moreover, all configurations of six-point problems for multi-camera systems are enumerated. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior accuracy and efficiency of our solvers compared to state-of-the-art six-point methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chieh Hubert Lin, Changil Kim, Jia-Bin Huang, Qinbo Li, Chih-Yao Ma, Johannes Kopf, Ming-Hsuan Yang, Hung-Yu Tseng</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) is a representation for 3D reconstruction from multi-view images. Despite some recent work showing preliminary success in editing a reconstructed NeRF with diffusion prior, they remain struggling to synthesize reasonable geometry in completely uncovered regions. One major reason is the high diversity of synthetic contents from the diffusion model, which hinders the radiance field from converging to a crisp and deterministic geometry. Moreover, applying latent diffusion models on real data often yields a textural shift incoherent to the image condition due to auto-encoding errors. These two problems are further reinforced with the use of pixel-distance losses. To address these issues, we propose tempering the diffusion model's stochasticity with per-scene customization and mitigating the textural shift with masked adversarial training. During the analyses, we also found the commonly used pixel and perceptual losses are harmful in the NeRF inpainting task. Through rigorous experiments, our framework yields state-of-the-art NeRF inpainting results on various real-world scenes. Project page: https://hubert0527.github.io/MALD-NeRF</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rasel Ahmed Bhuiyan, Adam Czajka</p>
<p>Abstract: Post-mortem iris recognition is an emerging application of iris-based human identification in a forensic setup. One factor that may be useful in conditioning iris recognition methods is the tissue decomposition level, which is correlated with the post-mortem interval (PMI), \ie the number of hours that have elapsed since death. PMI, however, is not always available, and its precise estimation remains one of the core challenges in forensic examination. This paper presents the first known to us method of the PMI estimation directly from iris images captured after death. To assess the feasibility of the iris-based PMI estimation, we designed models predicting the PMI from (a) near-infrared (NIR), (b) visible (RGB), and (c) multispectral (RGB+NIR) forensic iris images. Models were evaluated following a 10-fold cross-validation, in (S1) sample-disjoint, (S2) subject-disjoint, and (S3) cross-dataset scenarios. We explore two data balancing techniques for S3: resampling-based balancing (S3-real), and synthetic data-supplemented balancing (S3-synthetic). We found that using the multispectral data offers a spectacularly low mean absolute error (MAE) of $\approx 3.5$ hours in the scenario (S1), a bit worse MAE $\approx 17.5$ hours in the scenario (S2), and MAE $\approx 45.77$ hours in the scenario (S3). Additionally, supplementing the training set with synthetically-generated forensic iris images (S3-synthetic) significantly enhances the models' ability to generalize to new NIR, RGB and multispectral data collected in a different lab. This suggests that if the environmental conditions are favorable (\eg, bodies are kept in low temperatures), forensic iris images provide features that are indicative of the PMI and can be automatically estimated.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nadezda Kirillova, M. Jehanzeb Mirza, Horst Bischof, Horst Possegger</p>
<p>Abstract: State-of-the-art Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) approaches have shown remarkable performance when trained and evaluated on current benchmarks. However, these benchmarks primarily consist of clear weather scenarios, overlooking adverse atmospheric conditions such as fog, haze, smoke and dust. As a result, the robustness of trackers against these challenging conditions remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce physics-based volumetric fog simulation method for arbitrary MOT datasets, utilizing frame-by-frame monocular depth estimation and a fog formation optical model. We enhance our simulation by rendering both homogeneous and heterogeneous fog and propose to use the dark channel prior method to estimate atmospheric light, showing promising results even in night and indoor scenes. We present the leading benchmark MOTChallenge (third release) augmented with fog (smoke for indoor scenes) of various intensities and conduct a comprehensive evaluation of MOT methods, revealing their limitations under fog and fog-like challenges.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhicheng Ding, Panfeng Li, Qikai Yang, Siyang Li, Qingtian Gong</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel contribution to the field of regional style transfer. Existing methods often suffer from the drawback of applying style homogeneously across the entire image, leading to stylistic inconsistencies or foreground object twisted when applied to image with foreground elements such as person figures. To address this limitation, we propose a new approach that leverages a segmentation network to precisely isolate foreground objects within the input image. Subsequently, style transfer is applied exclusively to the background region. The isolated foreground objects are then carefully reintegrated into the style-transferred background. To enhance the visual coherence between foreground and background, a color transfer step is employed on the foreground elements prior to their rein-corporation. Finally, we utilize feathering techniques to achieve a seamless amalgamation of foreground and background, resulting in a visually unified and aesthetically pleasing final composition. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our proposed approach yields significantly more natural stylistic transformations compared to conventional methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amar Ali-Bey, Brahim Chaib-draa, Philippe Gigu\`ere</p>
<p>Abstract: In visual place recognition, accurately identifying and matching images of locations under varying environmental conditions and viewpoints remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we introduce a new technique, called Bag-of-Queries (BoQ), which learns a set of global queries designed to capture universal place-specific attributes. Unlike existing methods that employ self-attention and generate the queries directly from the input features, BoQ employs distinct learnable global queries, which probe the input features via cross-attention, ensuring consistent information aggregation. In addition, our technique provides an interpretable attention mechanism and integrates with both CNN and Vision Transformer backbones. The performance of BoQ is demonstrated through extensive experiments on 14 large-scale benchmarks. It consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques including NetVLAD, MixVPR and EigenPlaces. Moreover, as a global retrieval technique (one-stage), BoQ surpasses two-stage retrieval methods, such as Patch-NetVLAD, TransVPR and R2Former, all while being orders of magnitude faster and more efficient.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xusheng Li, Chengliang Wang, Shumao Wang, Zhuo Zeng, Ji Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The multi-line LiDAR is widely used in autonomous vehicles, so point cloud-based 3D detectors are essential for autonomous driving. Extracting rich multi-scale features is crucial for point cloud-based 3D detectors in autonomous driving due to significant differences in the size of different types of objects. However, because of the real-time requirements, large-size convolution kernels are rarely used to extract large-scale features in the backbone. Current 3D detectors commonly use feature pyramid networks to obtain large-scale features; however, some objects containing fewer point clouds are further lost during down-sampling, resulting in degraded performance. Since pillar-based schemes require much less computation than voxel-based schemes, they are more suitable for constructing real-time 3D detectors. Hence, we propose the *, a pillar-based scheme. We redesigned the feature encoding, the backbone, and the neck of the 3D detector. We propose the Voxel2Pillar feature encoding, which uses a sparse convolution constructor to construct pillars with richer point cloud features, especially height features. The Voxel2Pillar adds more learnable parameters to the feature encoding, enabling the initial pillars to have higher performance ability. We extract multi-scale and large-scale features in the proposed fully sparse backbone, which does not utilize large-size convolutional kernels; the backbone consists of the proposed multi-scale feature extraction module. The neck consists of the proposed sparse ConvNeXt, whose simple structure significantly improves the performance. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed * on the Waymo Open Dataset, and the object detection accuracy for vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists is improved. We also verify the effectiveness of each proposed module in detail through ablation studies.</p>

<p>Abstract: Compositional Reasoning (CR) entails grasping the significance of attributes, relations, and word order. Recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs), comprising a visual encoder and a Large Language Model (LLM) decoder, have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in such reasoning tasks. This prompts a crucial question: have VLMs effectively tackled the CR challenge? We conjecture that existing CR benchmarks may not adequately push the boundaries of modern VLMs due to the reliance on an LLM-only negative text generation pipeline. Consequently, the negatives produced either appear as outliers from the natural language distribution learned by VLMs' LLM decoders or as improbable within the corresponding image context. To address these limitations, we introduce ConMe -- a compositional reasoning benchmark and a novel data generation pipeline leveraging VLMs to produce `hard CR Q&A'. Through a new concept of VLMs conversing with each other to collaboratively expose their weaknesses, our pipeline autonomously generates, evaluates, and selects challenging compositional reasoning questions, establishing a robust CR benchmark, also subsequently validated manually. Our benchmark provokes a noteworthy, up to 33%, decrease in CR performance compared to preceding benchmarks, reinstating the CR challenge even for state-of-the-art VLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shilei Cao, Yan Liu, Juepeng Zheng, Weijia Li, Runmin Dong, Haohuan Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-world application models are commonly deployed in dynamic environments, where the target domain distribution undergoes temporal changes. Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) has recently emerged as a promising technique to gradually adapt a source-trained model to continually changing target domains. Despite recent advancements in addressing CTTA, two critical issues remain: 1) Fixed thresholds for pseudo-labeling in existing methodologies lead to low-quality pseudo-labels, as model confidence varies across categories and domains; 2) Stochastic parameter restoration methods for mitigating catastrophic forgetting fail to preserve critical information effectively, due to their intrinsic randomness. To tackle these challenges for detection models in CTTA scenarios, we present AMROD, featuring three core components. Firstly, the object-level contrastive learning module extracts object-level features for contrastive learning to refine the feature representation in the target domain. Secondly, the adaptive monitoring module dynamically skips unnecessary adaptation and updates the category-specific threshold based on predicted confidence scores to enable efficiency and improve the quality of pseudo-labels. Lastly, the adaptive randomized restoration mechanism selectively reset inactive parameters with higher possibilities, ensuring the retention of essential knowledge. We demonstrate the effectiveness of AMROD on four CTTA object detection tasks, where AMROD outperforms existing methods, especially achieving a 3.2 mAP improvement and a 20% increase in efficiency on the Cityscapes-to-Cityscapes-C CTTA task. The code will be released.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hui Lu, Albert Ali Salah, Ronald Poppe</p>
<p>Abstract: Video understanding requires the extraction of rich spatio-temporal representations, which transformer models achieve through self-attention. Unfortunately, self-attention poses a computational burden. In NLP, Mamba has surfaced as an efficient alternative for transformers. However, Mamba's successes do not trivially extend to vision tasks, including those in video analysis. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the differences between self-attention and Mamba. We identify two limitations in Mamba's token processing: historical decay and element contradiction. We propose VideoMambaPro (VMP) that solves the identified limitations by adding masked backward computation and elemental residual connections to a VideoMamba backbone. Differently sized VideoMambaPro models surpass VideoMamba by 1.6-2.8% and 1.1-1.9% top-1 on Kinetics-400 and Something-Something V2, respectively. Even without extensive pre-training, our models present an increasingly attractive and efficient alternative to current transformer models. Moreover, our two solutions are orthogonal to recent advances in Vision Mamba models, and are likely to provide further improvements in future models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yangyi Chen, Xingyao Wang, Hao Peng, Heng Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: We present SOLO, a single transformer for Scalable visiOn-Language mOdeling. Current large vision-language models (LVLMs) such as LLaVA mostly employ heterogeneous architectures that connect pre-trained visual encoders with large language models (LLMs) to facilitate visual recognition and complex reasoning. Although achieving remarkable performance with relatively lightweight training, we identify four primary scalability limitations: (1) The visual capacity is constrained by pre-trained visual encoders, which are typically an order of magnitude smaller than LLMs. (2) The heterogeneous architecture complicates the use of established hardware and software infrastructure. (3) Study of scaling laws on such architecture must consider three separate components - visual encoder, connector, and LLMs, which complicates the analysis. (4) The use of existing visual encoders typically requires following a pre-defined specification of image inputs pre-processing, for example, by reshaping inputs to fixed-resolution square images, which presents difficulties in processing and training on high-resolution images or those with unusual aspect ratio. A unified single Transformer architecture, like SOLO, effectively addresses these scalability concerns in LVLMs; however, its limited adoption in the modern context likely stems from the absence of reliable training recipes that balance both modalities and ensure stable training for billion-scale models. In this paper, we introduce the first open-source training recipe for developing SOLO, an open-source 7B LVLM using moderate academic resources. The training recipe involves initializing from LLMs, sequential pre-training on ImageNet and web-scale data, and instruction fine-tuning on our curated high-quality datasets. On extensive evaluation, SOLO demonstrates performance comparable to LLaVA-v1.5-7B, particularly excelling in visual mathematical reasoning.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Textured-GS, an innovative method for rendering Gaussian splatting that incorporates spatially defined color and opacity variations using Spherical Harmonics (SH). This approach enables each Gaussian to exhibit a richer representation by accommodating varying colors and opacities across its surface, significantly enhancing rendering quality compared to traditional methods. To demonstrate the merits of our approach, we have adapted the Mini-Splatting architecture to integrate textured Gaussians without increasing the number of Gaussians. Our experiments across multiple real-world datasets show that Textured-GS consistently outperforms both the baseline Mini-Splatting and standard 3DGS in terms of visual fidelity. The results highlight the potential of Textured-GS to advance Gaussian-based rendering technologies, promising more efficient and high-quality scene reconstructions.

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a variant of video object segmentation (VOS) that bridges interactive and semi-automatic approaches, termed Lazy Video Object Segmentation (ziVOS). In contrast, to both tasks, which handle video object segmentation in an off-line manner (i.e., pre-recorded sequences), we propose through ziVOS to target online recorded sequences. Here, we strive to strike a balance between performance and robustness for long-term scenarios by soliciting user feedback's on-the-fly during the segmentation process. Hence, we aim to maximize the tracking duration of an object of interest, while requiring minimal user corrections to maintain tracking over an extended period. We propose a competitive baseline, i.e., Lazy-XMem, as a reference for future works in ziVOS. Our proposed approach uses an uncertainty estimation of the tracking state to determine whether a user interaction is necessary to refine the model's prediction. To quantitatively assess the performance of our method and the user's workload, we introduce complementary metrics alongside those already established in the field. We evaluate our approach using the recently introduced LVOS dataset, which offers numerous long-term videos. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Vujas-Eteph/LazyXMem.</p>

Additionally, we propose a Multi-level Information System (MISS) to effectively leverage roof masks, building masks, and offsets for accurate footprint prediction.

<p>Abstract: In recent years, diffusion models have revolutionized visual generation, outperforming traditional frameworks like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). However, generating images of humans with realistic semantic parts, such as hands and faces, remains a significant challenge due to their intricate structural complexity. To address this issue, we propose a novel post-processing solution named RealisHuman. The RealisHuman framework operates in two stages. First, it generates realistic human parts, such as hands or faces, using the original malformed parts as references, ensuring consistent details with the original image. Second, it seamlessly integrates the rectified human parts back into their corresponding positions by repainting the surrounding areas to ensure smooth and realistic blending. The RealisHuman framework significantly enhances the realism of human generation, as demonstrated by notable improvements in both qualitative and quantitative metrics.

<p>Abstract: Understanding long text is of great demands in practice but beyond the reach of most language-image pre-training (LIP) models. In this work, we empirically confirm that the key reason causing such an issue is that the training images are usually paired with short captions, leaving certain tokens easily overshadowed by salient tokens. Towards this problem, our initial attempt is to relabel the data with long captions, however, directly learning with which may lead to performance degradation in understanding short text (e.g., in the image classification task). Then, after incorporating corner tokens to aggregate diverse textual information, we manage to help the model catch up to its original level of short text understanding yet greatly enhance its capability of long text understanding. We further look into whether the model can continuously benefit from longer captions and notice a clear trade-off between the performance and the efficiency. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our approach using a self-constructed large-scale dataset, which consists of 100M long caption oriented text-image pairs. Our method demonstrates superior performance in long-text-image retrieval tasks. The project page is available at https://wuw2019.github.io/lot-lip.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruiqi Liu, Boyu Diao, Libo Huang, Zijia An, Zhulin An, Yongjun Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual learning (CL) is designed to learn new tasks while preserving existing knowledge. Replaying samples from earlier tasks has proven to be an effective method to mitigate the forgetting of previously acquired knowledge. However, the current research on the training efficiency of rehearsal-based methods is insufficient, which limits the practical application of CL systems in resource-limited scenarios. The human visual system (HVS) exhibits varying sensitivities to different frequency components, enabling the efficient elimination of visually redundant information. Inspired by HVS, we propose a novel framework called Continual Learning in the Frequency Domain (CLFD). To our knowledge, this is the first study to utilize frequency domain features to enhance the performance and efficiency of CL training on edge devices. For the input features of the feature extractor, CLFD employs wavelet transform to map the original input image into the frequency domain, thereby effectively reducing the size of input feature maps. Regarding the output features of the feature extractor, CLFD selectively utilizes output features for distinct classes for classification, thereby balancing the reusability and interference of output features based on the frequency domain similarity of the classes across various tasks. Optimizing only the input and output features of the feature extractor allows for seamless integration of CLFD with various rehearsal-based methods. Extensive experiments conducted in both cloud and edge environments demonstrate that CLFD consistently improves the performance of state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in both precision and training efficiency. Specifically, CLFD can increase the accuracy of the SOTA CL method by up to 6.83% and reduce the training time by 2.6$\times$.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of computer vision, the task of accurately estimating the poses of multiple individuals from various viewpoints presents a formidable challenge, especially if the estimations should be reliable as well. This work presents an extensive evaluation of the generalization capabilities of multi-view multi-person pose estimators to unseen datasets and presents a new algorithm with strong performance in this task. It also studies the improvements by additionally using depth information. Since the new approach can not only generalize well to unseen datasets, but also to different keypoints, the first multi-view multi-person whole-body estimator is presented. To support further research on those topics, all of the work is publicly accessible.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wen-Dong Jiang, Chih-Yung Chang, Ssu-Chi Kuai, Diptendu Sinha Roy</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, research based on pre-trained models has demonstrated outstanding performance in violence surveillance tasks. However, most of them were black-box systems which faced challenges regarding explainability during training and inference processes. An important question is how to incorporate explicit knowledge into these implicit models, thereby designing expert-driven and interpretable violence surveillance systems. This paper proposes a new paradigm for weakly supervised violence monitoring (WSVM) called Rule base Violence Monitoring (RuleVM). The proposed RuleVM uses a dual-branch structure with different designs for images and text. One of the branches is called the implicit branch, which uses only visual features for coarse-grained binary classification. In this branch, image feature extraction is divided into two channels: one responsible for extracting scene frames and the other focusing on extracting actions. The other branch is called the explicit branch, which utilizes language-image alignment to perform fine-grained classification. For the language channel design in the explicit branch, the proposed RuleCLIP uses the state-of-the-art YOLO-World model to detect objects in video frames, and association rules are identified through data mining methods as descriptions of the video. Leveraging the dual-branch architecture, RuleVM achieves interpretable coarse-grained and fine-grained violence surveillance. Extensive experiments were conducted on two commonly used benchmarks, and the results show that RuleCLIP achieved the best performance in both coarse-grained and fine-grained monitoring, significantly outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, interpretability experiments uncovered some interesting rules, such as the observation that as the number of people increases, the risk level of violent behavior also rises.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ke Li, Fuyu Dong, Di Wang, Shaofeng Li, Quan Wang, Xinbo Gao, Tat-Seng Chua</p>
<p>Abstract: Remote sensing change detection aims to perceive changes occurring on the Earth's surface from remote sensing data in different periods, and feed these changes back to humans. However, most existing methods only focus on detecting change regions, lacking the capability to interact with users to identify changes that the users expect. In this paper, we introduce a new task named Change Detection Question Answering and Grounding (CDQAG), which extends the traditional change detection task by providing interpretable textual answers and intuitive visual evidence. To this end, we construct the first CDQAG benchmark dataset, termed QAG-360K, comprising over 360K triplets of questions, textual answers, and corresponding high-quality visual masks. It encompasses 10 essential land-cover categories and 8 comprehensive question types, which provides a valuable and diverse dataset for remote sensing applications. Furthermore, we present VisTA, a simple yet effective baseline method that unifies the tasks of question answering and grounding by delivering both visual and textual answers. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on both the classic change detection-based visual question answering (CDVQA) and the proposed CDQAG datasets. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experimental results provide useful insights for developing better CDQAG models, and we hope that our work can inspire further research in this important yet underexplored research field.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tao Wang, Xinlin Zhang, Yuanbin Chen, Yuanbo Zhou, Longxuan Zhao, Tao Tan, Tong Tong</p>
<p>Abstract: Semi-supervised learning has received considerable attention for its potential to leverage abundant unlabeled data to enhance model robustness. Pseudo labeling is a widely used strategy in semi supervised learning. However, existing methods often suffer from noise contamination, which can undermine model performance. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel Synergy-Guided Regional Supervision of Pseudo Labels (SGRS-Net) framework. Built upon the mean teacher network, we employ a Mix Augmentation module to enhance the unlabeled data. By evaluating the synergy before and after augmentation, we strategically partition the pseudo labels into distinct regions. Additionally, we introduce a Region Loss Evaluation module to assess the loss across each delineated area. Extensive experiments conducted on the LA dataset have demonstrated superior performance over state-of-the-art techniques, underscoring the efficiency and practicality of our framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhan Pan, Yanan Sun, Wei Gong</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep long-tailed recognition has been widely studied to address the issue of imbalanced data distributions in real-world scenarios. However, there has been insufficient focus on the design of neural architectures, despite empirical evidence suggesting that architecture can significantly impact performance. In this paper, we attempt to mitigate long-tailed issues through architectural improvements. To simplify the design process, we utilize Differential Architecture Search (DARTS) to achieve this goal. Unfortunately, existing DARTS methods struggle to perform well in long-tailed scenarios. To tackle this challenge, we introduce Long-Tailed Differential Architecture Search (LT-DARTS). Specifically, we conduct extensive experiments to explore architectural components that demonstrate better performance on long-tailed data and propose a new search space based on our observations. This ensures that the architecture obtained through our search process incorporates superior components. Additionally, we propose replacing the learnable linear classifier with an Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF) classifier to further enhance our method. This classifier effectively alleviates the biased search process and prevents performance collapse. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that our approach consistently improves upon existing methods from an orthogonal perspective and achieves state-of-the-art results with simple enhancements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaorui Tan, Xi Yang, Tan Pan, Tianyi Liu, Chen Jiang, Xin Guo, Qiufeng Wang, Anh Nguyen, Yuan Qi, Kaizhu Huang, Yuan Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: The differences among medical imaging modalities, driven by distinct underlying principles, pose significant challenges for generalization in multi-modal medical tasks. Beyond modality gaps, individual variations, such as differences in organ size and metabolic rate, further impede a model's ability to generalize effectively across both modalities and diverse populations. Despite the importance of personalization, existing approaches to multi-modal generalization often neglect individual differences, focusing solely on common anatomical features. This limitation may result in weakened generalization in various medical tasks. In this paper, we unveil that personalization is critical for multi-modal generalization. Specifically, we propose an approach to achieve personalized generalization through approximating the underlying personalized invariant representation ${X}_h$ across various modalities by leveraging individual-level constraints and a learnable biological prior. We validate the feasibility and benefits of learning a personalized ${X}_h$, showing that this representation is highly generalizable and transferable across various multi-modal medical tasks. Extensive experimental results consistently show that the additionally incorporated personalization significantly improves performance and generalization across diverse scenarios, confirming its effectiveness.</p>

Experiments on the standard COCO dataset demonstrate that ViTOC outperforms baseline models across all evaluation metrics.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chika Maduabuchi, Ericmoore Jossou, Matteo Bucci</p>
<p>Abstract: Purpose: High-speed video (HSV) phase detection (PD) segmentation is vital in nuclear reactors, chemical processing, and electronics cooling for detecting vapor, liquid, and microlayer phases. Traditional segmentation models face pixel-level accuracy and generalization issues in multimodal data. MSEG-VCUQ introduces VideoSAM, a hybrid framework leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformer-based vision models to enhance segmentation accuracy and generalizability across complex multimodal PD tasks. Methods: VideoSAM combines U-Net CNN and the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for advanced feature extraction and segmentation across diverse HSV PD modalities, spanning fluids like water, FC-72, nitrogen, and argon under varied heat flux conditions. The framework also incorporates uncertainty quantification (UQ) to assess pixel-based discretization errors, delivering reliable metrics such as contact line density and dry area fraction under experimental conditions. Results: VideoSAM outperforms SAM and modality-specific CNN models in segmentation accuracy, excelling in environments with complex phase boundaries, overlapping bubbles, and dynamic liquid-vapor interactions. Its hybrid architecture supports cross-dataset generalization, adapting effectively to varying modalities. The UQ module provides accurate error estimates, enhancing the reliability of segmentation outputs for advanced HSV PD research. Conclusion: MSEG-VCUQ, via VideoSAM, offers a robust solution for HSV PD segmentation, addressing previous limitations with advanced deep learning and UQ techniques. The open-source datasets and tools introduced enable scalable, precise, and adaptable segmentation for multimodal PD datasets, supporting advancements in HSV analysis and autonomous experimentation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Han Qi, Tao Cai, Xiyue Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting has dominated novel-view synthesis with its real-time rendering speed and state-of-the-art rendering quality. However, during the rendering process, the use of the Jacobian of the affine approximation of the projection transformation leads to inevitable errors, resulting in blurriness, artifacts and a lack of scene consistency in the final rendered images. To address this issue, we introduce an ellipsoid-based projection method to calculate the projection of Gaussian ellipsoid on the image plane, witch is the primitive of 3D Gaussian Splatting. As our proposed ellipsoid-based projection method cannot handle Gaussian ellipsoids with camera origins inside them or parts lying below $z=0$ plane in the camera space, we designed a pre-filtering strategy. Experiments over multiple widely adopted benchmark datasets show that using our ellipsoid-based projection method can enhance the rendering quality of 3D Gaussian Splatting and its extensions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lukas Helff, Wolfgang Stammer, Hikaru Shindo, Devendra Singh Dhami, Kristian Kersting</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the successes of recent developments in visual AI, different shortcomings still exist; from missing exact logical reasoning, to abstract generalization abilities, to understanding complex and noisy scenes. Unfortunately, existing benchmarks, were not designed to capture more than a few of these aspects. Whereas deep learning datasets focus on visually complex data but simple visual reasoning tasks, inductive logic datasets involve complex logical learning tasks, however, lack the visual component. To address this, we propose the diagnostic visual logical learning dataset, V-LoL, that seamlessly combines visual and logical challenges. Notably, we introduce the first instantiation of V-LoL, V-LoL-Train, - a visual rendition of a classic benchmark in symbolic AI, the Michalski train problem. By incorporating intricate visual scenes and flexible logical reasoning tasks within a versatile framework, V-LoL-Train provides a platform for investigating a wide range of visual logical learning challenges. We evaluate a variety of AI systems including traditional symbolic AI, neural AI, as well as neuro-symbolic AI. Our evaluations demonstrate that even SOTA AI faces difficulties in dealing with visual logical learning challenges, highlighting unique advantages and limitations of each methodology. Overall, V-LoL opens up new avenues for understanding and enhancing current abilities in visual logical learning for AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziqi Yu, Botao Zhao, Shengjie Zhang, Xiang Chen, Jianfeng Feng, Tingying Peng, Xiao-Yong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Synthesizing medical images while preserving their structural information is crucial in medical research. In such scenarios, the preservation of anatomical content becomes especially important. Although recent advances have been made by incorporating instance-level information to guide translation, these methods overlook the spatial coherence of structural-level representation and the anatomical invariance of content during translation. To address these issues, we introduce hierarchical granularity discrimination, which exploits various levels of semantic information present in medical images. Our strategy utilizes three levels of discrimination granularity: pixel-level discrimination using a Brain Memory Bank, structure-level discrimination on each brain structure with a re-weighting strategy to focus on hard samples, and global-level discrimination to ensure anatomical consistency during translation. The image translation performance of our strategy has been evaluated on three independent datasets (UK Biobank, IXI, and BraTS 2018), and it has outperformed state-of-the-art algorithms. Particularly, our model excels not only in synthesizing normal structures but also in handling abnormal (pathological) structures, such as brain tumors, despite the variations in contrast observed across different imaging modalities due to their pathological characteristics. The diagnostic value of synthesized MR images containing brain tumors has been evaluated by radiologists. This indicates that our model may offer an alternative solution in scenarios where specific MR modalities of patients are unavailable. Extensive experiments further demonstrate the versatility of our method, providing unique insights into medical image translation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Meiqi Chen, Yixin Cao, Yan Zhang, Chaochao Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have facilitated the development of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). Despite their impressive capabilities, MLLMs often suffer from over-reliance on unimodal biases (e.g., language bias and vision bias), leading to incorrect answers or hallucinations in complex multimodal tasks. To investigate this issue, we propose a causal framework to interpret the biases in Visual Question Answering (VQA) problems. Within this framework, we conduct an in-depth causal analysis to assess the causal effect of these biases on MLLM predictions. Based on the analysis, we introduce 1) a novel MORE dataset with 12,000 challenging VQA instances requiring multi-hop reasoning and overcoming unimodal biases. 2) a causality-enhanced agent framework CAVE that guides models to comprehensively integrate information from different modalities and mitigate biases. Our experiments show that MLLMs perform poorly on MORE, indicating strong unimodal biases and limited semantic understanding. However, when integrated with our CAVE, promising improvements in reasoning and bias mitigation can be seen. These findings provide important insights for the development of more robust MLLMs and contribute to the broader goal of advancing multimodal AI systems capable of deeper understanding and reasoning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andreas Madsen, Himabindu Lakkaraju, Siva Reddy, Sarath Chandar</p>
<p>Abstract: Interpretability is the study of explaining models in understandable terms to humans. At present, interpretability is divided into two paradigms: the intrinsic paradigm, which believes that only models designed to be explained can be explained, and the post-hoc paradigm, which believes that black-box models can be explained. At the core of this debate is how each paradigm ensures its explanations are faithful, i.e., true to the model's behavior. This is important, as false but convincing explanations lead to unsupported confidence in artificial intelligence (AI), which can be dangerous. This paper's position is that we should think about new paradigms while staying vigilant regarding faithfulness. First, by examining the history of paradigms in science, we see that paradigms are constantly evolving. Then, by examining the current paradigms, we can understand their underlying beliefs, the value they bring, and their limitations. Finally, this paper presents 3 emerging paradigms for interpretability. The first paradigm designs models such that faithfulness can be easily measured. Another optimizes models such that explanations become faithful. The last paradigm proposes to develop models that produce both a prediction and an explanation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qilai Zhang, Jiawen Li, Peiran Liao, Jiali Hu, Tian Guan, Anjia Han, Yonghong He</p>
<p>Abstract: The two primary types of Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) slides in histopathology are Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) and Fresh Frozen (FF). FFPE slides offer high quality histopathological images but require a labor-intensive acquisition process. In contrast, FF slides can be prepared quickly, but the image quality is relatively poor. Our task is to translate FF images into FFPE style, thereby improving the image quality for diagnostic purposes. In this paper, we propose Diffusion-FFPE, a method for FF-to-FFPE histopathological image translation using a pre-trained diffusion model. Specifically, we utilize a one-step diffusion model as the generator, which we fine-tune using LoRA adapters within an adversarial learning framework. To enable the model to effectively capture both global structural patterns and local details, we introduce a multi-scale feature fusion module that leverages two VAE encoders to extract features at different image resolutions, performing feature fusion before inputting them into the UNet. Additionally, a pre-trained vision-language model for histopathology serves as the backbone for the discriminator, enhancing model performance. Our FF-to-FFPE translation experiments on the TCGA-NSCLC dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christofel Rio Goenawan</p>
<p>Abstract: In the modern world, the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has contributed to improvements in various areas, including automation, computer vision, fraud detection, and more. AI can be leveraged to enhance the efficiency of Autonomous Smart Traffic Management (ASTM) systems and reduce traffic congestion rates. This paper presents an Autonomous Smart Traffic Management (STM) system that uses AI to improve traffic flow rates. The system employs the YOLO V5 Convolutional Neural Network to detect vehicles in traffic management images. Additionally, it predicts the number of vehicles for the next 12 hours using a Recurrent Neural Network with Long Short-Term Memory (RNN-LSTM). The Smart Traffic Management Cycle Length Analysis manages the traffic cycle length based on these vehicle predictions, aided by AI. From the results of the RNN-LSTM model for predicting vehicle numbers over the next 12 hours, we observe that the model predicts traffic with a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 4.521 vehicles and a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 2.232 vehicles. After simulating the STM system in the CARLA simulation environment, we found that the Traffic Management Congestion Flow Rate with ASTM (21 vehicles per minute) is 50\% higher than the rate without STM (around 15 vehicles per minute). Additionally, the Traffic Management Vehicle Pass Delay with STM (5 seconds per vehicle) is 70\% lower than without STM (around 12 seconds per vehicle). These results demonstrate that the STM system using AI can increase traffic flow by 50\% and reduce vehicle pass delays by 70\%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Heiko Hoffmann</p>
<p>Abstract: Scalar variables, e.g., the orientation of a shape in an image, are commonly predicted using a single output neuron in a neural network. In contrast, the mammalian cortex represents variables with a population of neurons. In this population code, each neuron is most active at its preferred value and shows partial activity for other values. Here, we investigate the benefit of using a population code for the output layer of a neural network. We compare population codes against single-neuron outputs and one-hot vectors. First, we show theoretically and in experiments with synthetic data that population codes improve robustness to input noise in networks of stacked linear layers. Second, we demonstrate the benefit of using population codes to encode ambiguous outputs, such as the pose of symmetric objects. Using the T-LESS dataset of feature-less real-world objects, we show that population codes improve the accuracy of predicting 3D object orientation from image input.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaizhe Hu, Zihang Rui, Yao He, Yuyao Liu, Pu Hua, Huazhe Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual imitation learning methods demonstrate strong performance, yet they lack generalization when faced with visual input perturbations, including variations in lighting and textures, impeding their real-world application. We propose Stem-OB that utilizes pretrained image diffusion models to suppress low-level visual differences while maintaining high-level scene structures. This image inversion process is akin to transforming the observation into a shared representation, from which other observations stem, with extraneous details removed. Stem-OB contrasts with data-augmentation approaches as it is robust to various unspecified appearance changes without the need for additional training. Our method is a simple yet highly effective plug-and-play solution. Empirical results confirm the effectiveness of our approach in simulated tasks and show an exceptionally significant improvement in real-world applications, with an average increase of 22.2% in success rates compared to the best baseline.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gaurav Menghani, Ravi Kumar, Sanjiv Kumar</p>
<p>Abstract: One of the core pillars of efficient deep learning methods is architectural improvements such as the residual/skip connection, which has led to significantly better model convergence and quality. Since then the residual connection has become ubiquitous in not just convolutional neural networks but also transformer-based architectures, the backbone of LLMs.
  In this paper we introduce \emph{Learned Augmented Residual Layer} (LAuReL) -- a novel generalization of the canonical residual connection -- with the goal to be an in-situ replacement of the latter while outperforming on both model quality and footprint metrics. Our experiments show that using \laurel can help boost performance for both vision and language models. For example, on the ResNet-50, ImageNet 1K task, it achieves $60\%$ of the gains from adding an extra layer, while only adding $0.003\%$ more parameters, and matches it while adding $2.6\times$ fewer parameters.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07940">Automatic dataset shift identification to support root cause analysis of AI performance drift</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> M\'elanie Roschewitz, Raghav Mehta, Charles Jones, Ben Glocker</p>
<p>Abstract: Shifts in data distribution can substantially harm the performance of clinical AI models. Hence, various methods have been developed to detect the presence of such shifts at deployment time. However, root causes of dataset shifts are varied, and the choice of shift mitigation strategies is highly dependent on the precise type of shift encountered at test time. As such, detecting test-time dataset shift is not sufficient: precisely identifying which type of shift has occurred is critical. In this work, we propose the first unsupervised dataset shift identification framework, effectively distinguishing between prevalence shift (caused by a change in the label distribution), covariate shift (caused by a change in input characteristics) and mixed shifts (simultaneous prevalence and covariate shifts). We discuss the importance of self-supervised encoders for detecting subtle covariate shifts and propose a novel shift detector leveraging both self-supervised encoders and task model outputs for improved shift detection. We report promising results for the proposed shift identification framework across three different imaging modalities (chest radiography, digital mammography, and retinal fundus images) on five types of real-world dataset shifts, using four large publicly available datasets.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07976">DINO-LG: A Task-Specific DINO Model for Coronary Calcium Scoring</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Mahmut S. Gokmen, Cody Bumgardner, Caner Ozcan</p>
<p>Abstract: Coronary artery disease (CAD), one of the most common cause of mortality in the world. Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring using computed tomography (CT) is key for risk assessment to prevent coronary disease. Previous studies on risk assessment and calcification detection in CT scans primarily use approaches based on UNET architecture, frequently implemented on pre-built models. However, these models are limited by the availability of annotated CT scans containing CAC and suffering from imbalanced dataset, decreasing performance of CAC segmentation and scoring. In this study, we extend this approach by incorporating the self-supervised learning (SSL) technique of DINO (self-distillation with no labels) to eliminate limitations of scarce annotated data in CT scans. The DINO model's ability to train without requiring CAC area annotations enhances its robustness in generating distinct features. The DINO model is trained on to focus specifically on calcified areas by using labels, aiming to generate features that effectively capture and highlight key characteristics. The label-guided DINO (DINO-LG) enhances classification by distinguishing CT slices that contain calcification from those that do not, performing 57% better than the standard DINO model in this task. CAC scoring and segmentation tasks are performed by a basic U-NET architecture, fed specifically with CT slices containing calcified areas as identified by the DINO-LG model. This targeted identification performed by DINO-LG model improves CAC segmentation performance by approximately 10% and significant increase in CAC scoring accuracy.</p>
