<p><b>Authors:</b> Birger Moell, Fredrik Sand Aronsson, Sanian Akbar</p>
<p>Abstract: Integrating large language models (LLMs) like DeepSeek R1 into healthcare requires rigorous evaluation of their reasoning alignment with clinical expertise. This study assesses DeepSeek R1's medical reasoning against expert patterns using 100 MedQA clinical cases. The model achieved 93% diagnostic accuracy, demonstrating systematic clinical judgment through differential diagnosis, guideline-based treatment selection, and integration of patient-specific factors. However, error analysis of seven incorrect cases revealed persistent limitations: anchoring bias, challenges reconciling conflicting data, insufficient exploration of alternatives, overthinking, knowledge gaps, and premature prioritization of definitive treatment over intermediate care. Crucially, reasoning length correlated with accuracy - shorter responses (<5,000 characters) were more reliable, suggesting extended explanations may signal uncertainty or rationalization of errors. While DeepSeek R1 exhibits foundational clinical reasoning capabilities, recurring flaws highlight critical areas for refinement, including bias mitigation, knowledge updates, and structured reasoning frameworks. These findings underscore LLMs' potential to augment medical decision-making through artificial reasoning but emphasize the need for domain-specific validation, interpretability safeguards, and confidence metrics (e.g., response length thresholds) to ensure reliability in real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Indraneil Paul, Haoyi Yang, Goran Glava\v{s}, Kristian Kersting, Iryna Gurevych</p>
<p>Abstract: Language models (LMs) have become a staple of the code-writing toolbox. Their pre-training recipe has, however, remained stagnant over recent years, barring the occasional changes in data sourcing and filtering strategies. In particular, research exploring modifications to Code-LMs' pre-training objectives, geared towards improving data efficiency and better disentangling between syntax and semantics, has been noticeably sparse, especially compared with corresponding efforts in natural language LMs. In this work, we examine grounding on obfuscated code as a means of helping Code-LMs look beyond the surface-form syntax and enhance their pre-training sample efficiency. To this end, we compile ObscuraX, a dataset of approximately 55M source and obfuscated code pairs in seven languages. Subsequently, we pre-train ObscuraCoder models, ranging in size from 255M to 2.8B parameters, on a 272B-token corpus that includes ObscuraX and demonstrate that our obfuscation-based pre-training recipe leads to consistent improvements in Code-LMs' abilities compared to both vanilla autoregressive pre-training as well as existing de-obfuscation (DOBF) objectives. ObscuraCoder demonstrates sizeable gains across multiple tests of syntactic and semantic code understanding, along with improved capabilities in multilingual code completion, multilingual code commit summarization, and multi-purpose library-oriented code generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rahul Raja, Arpita Vats</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents the winning submission of the RaaVa team to the AmericasNLP 2025 Shared Task 3 on Automatic Evaluation Metrics for Machine Translation (MT) into Indigenous Languages of America, where our system ranked first overall based on average Pearson correlation with the human annotations. We introduce Feature-Union Scorer (FUSE) for Evaluation, FUSE integrates Ridge regression and Gradient Boosting to model translation quality. In addition to FUSE, we explore five alternative approaches leveraging different combinations of linguistic similarity features and learning paradigms. FUSE Score highlights the effectiveness of combining lexical, phonetic, semantic, and fuzzy token similarity with learning-based modeling to improve MT evaluation for morphologically rich and low-resource languages. MT into Indigenous languages poses unique challenges due to polysynthesis, complex morphology, and non-standardized orthography. Conventional automatic metrics such as BLEU, TER, and ChrF often fail to capture deeper aspects like semantic adequacy and fluency. Our proposed framework, formerly referred to as FUSE, incorporates multilingual sentence embeddings and phonological encodings to better align with human evaluation. We train supervised models on human-annotated development sets and evaluate held-out test data. Results show that FUSE consistently achieves higher Pearson and Spearman correlations with human judgments, offering a robust and linguistically informed solution for MT evaluation in low-resource settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Uwe Peters, Benjamin Chin-Yee</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence chatbots driven by large language models (LLMs) have the potential to increase public science literacy and support scientific research, as they can quickly summarize complex scientific information in accessible terms. However, when summarizing scientific texts, LLMs may omit details that limit the scope of research conclusions, leading to generalizations of results broader than warranted by the original study. We tested 10 prominent LLMs, including ChatGPT-4o, ChatGPT-4.5, DeepSeek, LLaMA 3.3 70B, and Claude 3.7 Sonnet, comparing 4900 LLM-generated summaries to their original scientific texts. Even when explicitly prompted for accuracy, most LLMs produced broader generalizations of scientific results than those in the original texts, with DeepSeek, ChatGPT-4o, and LLaMA 3.3 70B overgeneralizing in 26 to 73% of cases. In a direct comparison of LLM-generated and human-authored science summaries, LLM summaries were nearly five times more likely to contain broad generalizations (OR = 4.85, 95% CI [3.06, 7.70]). Notably, newer models tended to perform worse in generalization accuracy than earlier ones. Our results indicate a strong bias in many widely used LLMs towards overgeneralizing scientific conclusions, posing a significant risk of large-scale misinterpretations of research findings. We highlight potential mitigation strategies, including lowering LLM temperature settings and benchmarking LLMs for generalization accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Ahmad, Humaira Farid, Iqra Ameer, Muhammad Muzamil, Ameer Hamza Muhammad Jalal, Ildar Batyrshin, Grigori Sidorov</p>
<p>Abstract: The opioid overdose epidemic remains a critical public health crisis, particularly in the United States, leading to significant mortality and societal costs. Social media platforms like Reddit provide vast amounts of unstructured data that offer insights into public perceptions, discussions, and experiences related to opioid use. This study leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP), specifically Opioid Named Entity Recognition (ONER-2025), to extract actionable information from these platforms. Our research makes four key contributions. First, we created a unique, manually annotated dataset sourced from Reddit, where users share self-reported experiences of opioid use via different administration routes. This dataset contains 331,285 tokens and includes eight major opioid entity categories. Second, we detail our annotation process and guidelines while discussing the challenges of labeling the ONER-2025 dataset. Third, we analyze key linguistic challenges, including slang, ambiguity, fragmented sentences, and emotionally charged language, in opioid discussions. Fourth, we propose a real-time monitoring system to process streaming data from social media, healthcare records, and emergency services to identify overdose events. Using 5-fold cross-validation in 11 experiments, our system integrates machine learning, deep learning, and transformer-based language models with advanced contextual embeddings to enhance understanding. Our transformer-based models (bert-base-NER and roberta-base) achieved 97% accuracy and F1-score, outperforming baselines by 10.23% (RF=0.88).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aayush Gautam, Susav Shrestha, Narasimha Annapareddy</p>
<p>Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates large language model (LLM) inference by using a smaller draft model to propose tokens, which are then verified by a larger target model. However, selecting an optimal speculation length is critical for maximizing speedup while minimizing wasted computation. We introduce \textit{GammaTune} and \textit{GammaTune+}, training-free adaptive algorithms that dynamically adjust speculation length based on token acceptance rates using a heuristic-based switching mechanism. Evaluated on SpecBench across multiple tasks and model pairs, our method outperforms other heuristic-based approaches and fixed-length speculative decoding, achieving an average speedup of 15\% ($\pm$5\%) with \textit{GammaTune} and 16\% ($\pm$3\%) with \textit{GammaTune+}, while reducing performance variance. This makes \textit{GammaTune} a robust and efficient solution for real-world deployment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jurek Eisinger, Ward Gauderis, Lin de Huybrecht, Geraint A. Wiggins</p>
<p>Abstract: The Categorical Compositional Distributional (DisCoCat) framework models meaning in natural language using the mathematical framework of quantum theory, expressed as formal diagrams. DisCoCat diagrams can be associated with tensor networks and quantum circuits. DisCoCat diagrams have been connected to density matrices in various contexts in Quantum Natural Language Processing (QNLP). Previous use of density matrices in QNLP entails modelling ambiguous words as probability distributions over more basic words (the word \texttt{queen}, e.g., might mean the reigning queen or the chess piece). In this article, we investigate using probability distributions over processes to account for syntactic ambiguity in sentences. The meanings of these sentences are represented by density matrices. We show how to create probability distributions on quantum circuits that represent the meanings of sentences and explain how this approach generalises tasks from the literature. We conduct an experiment to validate the proposed theory.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Agam Shah, Liqin Ye, Sebastian Jaskowski, Wei Xu, Sudheer Chava</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are frequently utilized as sources of knowledge for question-answering. While it is known that LLMs may lack access to real-time data or newer data produced after the model's cutoff date, it is less clear how their knowledge spans across historical information. In this study, we assess the breadth of LLMs' knowledge using financial data of U.S. publicly traded companies by evaluating more than 197k questions and comparing model responses to factual data. We further explore the impact of company characteristics, such as size, retail investment, institutional attention, and readability of financial filings, on the accuracy of knowledge represented in LLMs. Our results reveal that LLMs are less informed about past financial performance, but they display a stronger awareness of larger companies and more recent information. Interestingly, at the same time, our analysis also reveals that LLMs are more likely to hallucinate for larger companies, especially for data from more recent years. We will make the code, prompts, and model outputs public upon the publication of the work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jixuan Leng, Chengsong Huang, Langlin Huang, Bill Yuchen Lin, William W. Cohen, Haohan Wang, Jiaxin Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing reasoning evaluation frameworks for Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) predominantly either assess text-based reasoning or vision-language understanding capabilities, with limited dynamic interplay between textual and visual constraints. To address this limitation, we introduce CrossWordBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of both LLMs and LVLMs through the medium of crossword puzzles-a task requiring multimodal adherence to semantic constraints from text-based clues and intersectional constraints from visual grid structures. CrossWordBench leverages a controllable puzzle generation framework that produces puzzles in multiple formats (text and image) and offers different evaluation strategies ranging from direct puzzle solving to interactive modes. Our extensive evaluation of over 20 models reveals that reasoning LLMs outperform non-reasoning models substantially by effectively leveraging crossing-letter constraints. We further demonstrate that LVLMs struggle with the task, showing a strong correlation between their puzzle-solving performance and grid-parsing accuracy. Our findings offer insights into the limitations of the reasoning capabilities of current LLMs and LVLMs, and provide an effective approach for creating multimodal constrained tasks for future evaluations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adrian Bermudez-Villalva, Maryam Mehrnezhad, Ehsan Toreini</p>
<p>Abstract: Online hate speech can harmfully impact individuals and groups, specifically on non-moderated platforms such as 4chan where users can post anonymous content. This work focuses on analysing and measuring the prevalence of online hate on 4chan's politically incorrect board (/pol/) using state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) models, specifically transformer-based models such as RoBERTa and Detoxify. By leveraging these advanced models, we provide an in-depth analysis of hate speech dynamics and quantify the extent of online hate non-moderated platforms. The study advances understanding through multi-class classification of hate speech (racism, sexism, religion, etc.), while also incorporating the classification of toxic content (e.g., identity attacks and threats) and a further topic modelling analysis. The results show that 11.20% of this dataset is identified as containing hate in different categories. These evaluations show that online hate is manifested in various forms, confirming the complicated and volatile nature of detection in the wild.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Loris Belcastro, Cristian Cosentino, Fabrizio Marozzo, Merve G\"und\"uz-C\"ure, \c{S}ule \"Ozt\"urk-Birim</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, social media has emerged as a primary channel for users to promptly share feedback and issues during disasters and emergencies, playing a key role in crisis management. While significant progress has been made in collecting and analyzing social media content, there remains a pressing need to enhance the automation, aggregation, and customization of this data to deliver actionable insights tailored to diverse stakeholders, including the press, police, EMS, and firefighters. This effort is essential for improving the coordination of activities such as relief efforts, resource distribution, and media communication. This paper presents a methodology that leverages the capabilities of LLMs to enhance disaster response and management. Our approach combines classification techniques with generative AI to bridge the gap between raw user feedback and stakeholder-specific reports. Social media posts shared during catastrophic events are analyzed with a focus on user-reported issues, service interruptions, and encountered challenges. We employ full-spectrum LLMs, using analytical models like BERT for precise, multi-dimensional classification of content type, sentiment, emotion, geolocation, and topic. Generative models such as ChatGPT are then used to produce human-readable, informative reports tailored to distinct audiences, synthesizing insights derived from detailed classifications. We compare standard approaches, which analyze posts directly using prompts in ChatGPT, to our advanced method, which incorporates multi-dimensional classification, sub-event selection, and tailored report generation. Our methodology demonstrates superior performance in both quantitative metrics, such as text coherence scores and latent representations, and qualitative assessments by automated tools and field experts, delivering precise insights for diverse disaster response stakeholders.</p>

<p>Abstract: The growing adoption of large language models (LLMs) in business applications has amplified interest in Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL) solutions, in which there is competing demand for high performance and efficiency. Domain- and customer-specific requirements further complicate the problem. To address this conundrum, we introduce Distill-C, a distilled customization framework tailored for NL2SQL tasks. Distill-C utilizes large teacher LLMs to produce high-quality synthetic data through a robust and scalable pipeline. Finetuning smaller and open-source LLMs on this synthesized data enables them to rival or outperform teacher models an order of magnitude larger. Evaluated on multiple challenging benchmarks, Distill-C achieves an average improvement of 36% in execution accuracy compared to the base models from three distinct LLM families. Additionally, on three internal customer benchmarks, Distill-C demonstrates a 22.6% performance improvement over the base models. Our results demonstrate that Distill-C is an effective, high-performing and generalizable approach for deploying lightweight yet powerful NL2SQL models, delivering exceptional accuracies while maintaining low computational cost.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) as evaluators offers a scalable alternative to human annotation, yet existing Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) for judges approaches often fall short in domains requiring complex reasoning. In this work, we investigate whether LLM judges truly benefit from enhanced reasoning capabilities. Through a detailed analysis of reasoning requirements across evaluation tasks, we reveal a negative correlation between SFT performance gains and the proportion of reasoning-demanding samples - highlighting the limitations of SFT in such scenarios. To address this, we introduce JudgeLRM, a family of judgment-oriented LLMs trained using reinforcement learning (RL) with judge-wise, outcome-driven rewards. JudgeLRM models consistently outperform both SFT-tuned and state-of-the-art reasoning models. Notably, JudgeLRM-3B surpasses GPT-4, and JudgeLRM-7B outperforms DeepSeek-R1 by 2.79% in F1 score, particularly excelling in judge tasks requiring deep reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jie Pan, Seungwon Lee, Cheligeer Cheligeer, Elliot A. Martin, Kiarash Riazi, Hude Quan, Na Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Objective: Electronic health records (EHR) are widely available to complement administrative data-based disease surveillance and healthcare performance evaluation. Defining conditions from EHR is labour-intensive and requires extensive manual labelling of disease outcomes. This study developed an efficient strategy based on advanced large language models to identify multiple conditions from EHR clinical notes. Methods: We linked a cardiac registry cohort in 2015 with an EHR system in Alberta, Canada. We developed a pipeline that leveraged a generative large language model (LLM) to analyze, understand, and interpret EHR notes by prompts based on specific diagnosis, treatment management, and clinical guidelines. The pipeline was applied to detect acute myocardial infarction (AMI), diabetes, and hypertension. The performance was compared against clinician-validated diagnoses as the reference standard and widely adopted International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes-based methods. Results: The study cohort accounted for 3,088 patients and 551,095 clinical notes. The prevalence was 55.4%, 27.7%, 65.9% and for AMI, diabetes, and hypertension, respectively. The performance of the LLM-based pipeline for detecting conditions varied: AMI had 88% sensitivity, 63% specificity, and 77% positive predictive value (PPV); diabetes had 91% sensitivity, 86% specificity, and 71% PPV; and hypertension had 94% sensitivity, 32% specificity, and 72% PPV. Compared with ICD codes, the LLM-based method demonstrated improved sensitivity and negative predictive value across all conditions. The monthly percentage trends from the detected cases by LLM and reference standard showed consistent patterns.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dou Liu, Ying Long, Sophia Zuoqiu, Tian Tang, Rong Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Effective physician-patient communications in pre-diagnostic environments, and most specifically in complex and sensitive medical areas such as infertility, are critical but consume a lot of time and, therefore, cause clinic workflows to become inefficient. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a potential solution for automating conversational medical history-taking and improving diagnostic accuracy. This study evaluates the feasibility and performance of LLMs in those tasks for infertility cases. An AI-driven conversational system was developed to simulate physician-patient interactions with ChatGPT-4o and ChatGPT-4o-mini. A total of 70 real-world infertility cases were processed, generating 420 diagnostic histories. Model performance was assessed using F1 score, Differential Diagnosis (DDs) Accuracy, and Accuracy of Infertility Type Judgment (ITJ). ChatGPT-4o-mini outperformed ChatGPT-4o in information extraction accuracy (F1 score: 0.9258 vs. 0.9029, p = 0.045, d = 0.244) and demonstrated higher completeness in medical history-taking (97.58% vs. 77.11%), suggesting that ChatGPT-4o-mini is more effective in extracting detailed patient information, which is critical for improving diagnostic accuracy. In contrast, ChatGPT-4o performed slightly better in differential diagnosis accuracy (2.0524 vs. 2.0048, p > 0.05). ITJ accuracy was higher in ChatGPT-4o-mini (0.6476 vs. 0.5905) but with lower consistency (Cronbach's $\alpha$ = 0.562), suggesting variability in classification reliability. Both models demonstrated strong feasibility in automating infertility history-taking, with ChatGPT-4o-mini excelling in completeness and extraction accuracy. In future studies, expert validation for accuracy and dependability in a clinical setting, AI model fine-tuning, and larger datasets with a mix of cases of infertility have to be prioritized.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aleksandra Bakalova, Yana Veitsman, Xinting Huang, Michael Hahn</p>
<p>Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) is an intriguing ability of large language models (LLMs). Despite a substantial amount of work on its behavioral aspects and how it emerges in miniature setups, it remains unclear which mechanism assembles task information from the individual examples in a fewshot prompt. We use causal interventions to identify information flow in Gemma-2 2B for five naturalistic ICL tasks. We find that the model infers task information using a two-step strategy we call contextualize-then-aggregate: In the lower layers, the model builds up representations of individual fewshot examples, which are contextualized by preceding examples through connections between fewshot input and output tokens across the sequence. In the higher layers, these representations are aggregated to identify the task and prepare prediction of the next output. The importance of the contextualization step differs between tasks, and it may become more important in the presence of ambiguous examples. Overall, by providing rigorous causal analysis, our results shed light on the mechanisms through which ICL happens in language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Collin Zhang, John X. Morris, Vitaly Shmatikov</p>
<p>Abstract: Embedding inversion, i.e., reconstructing text given its embedding and black-box access to the embedding encoder, is a fundamental problem in both NLP and security. From the NLP perspective, it helps determine how much semantic information about the input is retained in the embedding. From the security perspective, it measures how much information is leaked by vector databases and embedding-based retrieval systems. State-of-the-art methods for embedding inversion, such as vec2text, have high accuracy but require (a) training a separate model for each embedding, and (b) a large number of queries to the corresponding encoder.
  We design, implement, and evaluate ZSInvert, a zero-shot inversion method based on the recently proposed adversarial decoding technique. ZSInvert is fast, query-efficient, and can be used for any text embedding without training an embedding-specific inversion model. We measure the effectiveness of ZSInvert on several embeddings and demonstrate that it recovers key semantic information about the corresponding texts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yilin Qi, Dong Won Lee, Cynthia Breazeal, Hae Won Park</p>
<p>Abstract: Cognitive Reframing, a core element of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), helps individuals reinterpret negative experiences by finding positive meaning. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated improved performance through reasoning-based strategies. This inspires a promising direction of leveraging the reasoning capabilities of LLMs to improve CBT and mental reframing by simulating the process of critical thinking, potentially enabling more effective recognition, generation, and reframing of cognitive distortions. In this work, we investigate the role of various reasoning methods, including pre-trained reasoning LLMs and augmented reasoning strategies such as CoT and self-consistency in enhancing LLMs' ability to perform cognitive reframing tasks. We find that augmented reasoning methods, even when applied to "outdated" LLMs like GPT-3.5, consistently outperform state-of-the-art pretrained reasoning models on recognizing, generating and reframing unhelpful thoughts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Craig W. Schmidt, Varshini Reddy, Chris Tanner, Yuval Pinter</p>
<p>Abstract: Pre-tokenization, the initial step in many modern tokenization pipelines, segments text into smaller units called pretokens, typically splitting on whitespace and punctuation. While this process encourages having full, individual words as tokens, it introduces a fundamental limitation in most tokenization algorithms such as Byte Pair Encoding (BPE). Specifically, pre-tokenization causes the distribution of tokens in a corpus to heavily skew towards common, full-length words. This skewed distribution limits the benefits of expanding to larger vocabularies, since the additional tokens appear with progressively lower counts. To overcome this barrier, we propose BoundlessBPE, a modified BPE algorithm that relaxes the pretoken boundary constraint. Our approach selectively merges two complete pretokens into a larger unit we term a superword. Superwords are not necessarily semantically cohesive. For example, the pretokens " of" and " the" might be combined to form the superword " of the". This merging strategy results in a substantially more uniform distribution of tokens across a corpus than standard BPE, and compresses text more effectively, with an approximate 20% increase in bytes per token.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vignesh Gokul, Srikanth Tenneti, Alwarappan Nakkiran</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have emerged as a powerful method for enhancing large language models (LLMs) with up-to-date information. However, the retrieval step in RAG can sometimes surface documents containing contradictory information, particularly in rapidly evolving domains such as news. These contradictions can significantly impact the performance of LLMs, leading to inconsistent or erroneous outputs. This study addresses this critical challenge in two ways. First, we present a novel data generation framework to simulate different types of contradictions that may occur in the retrieval stage of a RAG system. Second, we evaluate the robustness of different LLMs in performing as context validators, assessing their ability to detect contradictory information within retrieved document sets. Our experimental results reveal that context validation remains a challenging task even for state-of-the-art LLMs, with performance varying significantly across different types of contradictions. While larger models generally perform better at contradiction detection, the effectiveness of different prompting strategies varies across tasks and model architectures. We find that chain-of-thought prompting shows notable improvements for some models but may hinder performance in others, highlighting the complexity of the task and the need for more robust approaches to context validation in RAG systems.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00187">Insight-RAG: Enhancing LLMs with Insight-Driven Augmentation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Pouya Pezeshkpour, Estevam Hruschka</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks have shown significant promise in leveraging external knowledge to enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs). However, conventional RAG methods often retrieve documents based solely on surface-level relevance, leading to many issues: they may overlook deeply buried information within individual documents, miss relevant insights spanning multiple sources, and are not well-suited for tasks beyond traditional question answering. In this paper, we propose Insight-RAG, a novel framework designed to address these issues. In the initial stage of Insight-RAG, instead of using traditional retrieval methods, we employ an LLM to analyze the input query and task, extracting the underlying informational requirements. In the subsequent stage, a specialized LLM -- trained on the document database -- is queried to mine content that directly addresses these identified insights. Finally, by integrating the original query with the retrieved insights, similar to conventional RAG approaches, we employ a final LLM to generate a contextually enriched and accurate response. Using two scientific paper datasets, we created evaluation benchmarks targeting each of the mentioned issues and assessed Insight-RAG against traditional RAG pipeline. Our results demonstrate that the Insight-RAG pipeline successfully addresses these challenges, outperforming existing methods by a significant margin in most cases. These findings suggest that integrating insight-driven retrieval within the RAG framework not only enhances performance but also broadens the applicability of RAG to tasks beyond conventional question answering.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rabimba Karanjai, Boris Shor, Amanda Austin, Ryan Kennedy, Yang Lu, Lei Xu, Weidong Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to synthesize public opinion data, addressing challenges in traditional survey methods like declining response rates and non-response bias. We introduce a novel technique: role creation based on knowledge injection, a form of in-context learning that leverages RAG and specified personality profiles from the HEXACO model and demographic information, and uses that for dynamically generated prompts. This method allows LLMs to simulate diverse opinions more accurately than existing prompt engineering approaches. We compare our results with pre-trained models with standard few-shot prompts. Experiments using questions from the Cooperative Election Study (CES) demonstrate that our role-creation approach significantly improves the alignment of LLM-generated opinions with real-world human survey responses, increasing answer adherence. In addition, we discuss challenges, limitations and future research directions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanzheng Xiang, Hanqi Yan, Shuyin Ouyang, Lin Gui, Yulan He</p>
<p>Abstract: This study evaluates large language models (LLMs) in generating code from algorithm descriptions from recent NLP papers. The task requires two key competencies: (1) algorithm comprehension: synthesizing information from papers and academic literature to understand implementation logic, and (2) coding expertise: identifying dependencies and correctly implementing necessary APIs. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce SciReplicate-Bench, a benchmark of 100 tasks from 36 NLP papers published in 2024, featuring detailed annotations and comprehensive test cases. Building on SciReplicate-Bench, we propose Sci-Reproducer, a multi-agent framework consisting of a Paper Agent that interprets algorithmic concepts from literature and a Code Agent that retrieves dependencies from repositories and implement solutions. To assess algorithm understanding, we introduce reasoning graph accuracy, which quantifies similarity between generated and reference reasoning graphs derived from code comments and structure. For evaluating implementation quality, we employ execution accuracy, CodeBLEU, and repository dependency/API recall metrics. In our experiments, we evaluate various powerful Non-Reasoning LLMs and Reasoning LLMs as foundational models. The best-performing LLM using Sci-Reproducer achieves only 39% execution accuracy, highlighting the benchmark's difficulty.Our analysis identifies missing or inconsistent algorithm descriptions as key barriers to successful reproduction. We will open-source our benchmark, and code at https://github.com/xyzCS/SciReplicate-Bench.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mikhail Krasitskii, Grigori Sidorov, Olga Kolesnikova, Liliana Chanona Hernandez, Alexander Gelbukh</p>
<p>Abstract: Summarization significantly impacts sentiment analysis across languages with diverse morphologies. This study examines extractive and abstractive summarization effects on sentiment classification in English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Finnish, Hungarian, and Arabic. We assess sentiment shifts post-summarization using multilingual transformers (mBERT, XLM-RoBERTa, T5, and BART) and language-specific models (FinBERT, AraBERT). Results show extractive summarization better preserves sentiment, especially in morphologically complex languages, while abstractive summarization improves readability but introduces sentiment distortion, affecting sentiment accuracy. Languages with rich inflectional morphology, such as Finnish, Hungarian, and Arabic, experience greater accuracy drops than English or German. Findings emphasize the need for language-specific adaptations in sentiment analysis and propose a hybrid summarization approach balancing readability and sentiment preservation. These insights benefit multilingual sentiment applications, including social media monitoring, market analysis, and cross-lingual opinion mining.</p>

<p>Abstract: Urban systems are managed using complex textual documentation that need coding and analysis to set requirements and evaluate built environment performance. This paper contributes to the study of applying large-language models (LLM) to qualitative coding activities to reduce resource requirements while maintaining comparable reliability to humans. Qualitative coding and assessment face challenges like resource limitations and bias, accuracy, and consistency between human evaluators. Here we report the application of LLMs to deductively code 10 case documents on the presence of 17 digital twin characteristics for the management of urban systems. We utilize two prompting methods to compare the semantic processing of LLMs with human coding efforts: whole text analysis and text chunk analysis using OpenAI's GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, and o1-mini models. We found similar trends of internal variability between methods and results indicate that LLMs may perform on par with human coders when initialized with specific deductive coding contexts. GPT-4o, o1-mini and GPT-4o-mini showed significant agreement with human raters when employed using a chunking method. The application of both GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini as an additional rater with three manual raters showed statistically significant agreement across all raters, indicating that the analysis of textual documents is benefited by LLMs. Our findings reveal nuanced sub-themes of LLM application suggesting LLMs follow human memory coding processes where whole-text analysis may introduce multiple meanings. The novel contributions of this paper lie in assessing the performance of OpenAI GPT models and introduces the chunk-based prompting approach, which addresses context aggregation biases by preserving localized context.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00285">Do Large Language Models Exhibit Spontaneous Rational Deception?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Samuel M. Taylor, Benjamin K. Bergen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are effective at deceiving, when prompted to do so. But under what conditions do they deceive spontaneously? Models that demonstrate better performance on reasoning tasks are also better at prompted deception. Do they also increasingly deceive spontaneously in situations where it could be considered rational to do so? This study evaluates spontaneous deception produced by LLMs in a preregistered experimental protocol using tools from signaling theory. A range of proprietary closed-source and open-source LLMs are evaluated using modified 2x2 games (in the style of Prisoner's Dilemma) augmented with a phase in which they can freely communicate to the other agent using unconstrained language. This setup creates an opportunity to deceive, in conditions that vary in how useful deception might be to an agent's rational self-interest. The results indicate that 1) all tested LLMs spontaneously misrepresent their actions in at least some conditions, 2) they are generally more likely to do so in situations in which deception would benefit them, and 3) models exhibiting better reasoning capacity overall tend to deceive at higher rates. Taken together, these results suggest a tradeoff between LLM reasoning capability and honesty. They also provide evidence of reasoning-like behavior in LLMs from a novel experimental configuration. Finally, they reveal certain contextual factors that affect whether LLMs will deceive or not. We discuss consequences for autonomous, human-facing systems driven by LLMs both now and as their reasoning capabilities continue to improve.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrea W Wen-Yi, Unso Eun Seo Jo, David Mimno</p>
<p>Abstract: The release of top-performing open-weight LLMs has cemented China's role as a leading force in AI development. Do these models support languages spoken in China? Or do they speak the same languages as Western models? Comparing multilingual capabilities is important for two reasons. First, language ability provides insights into pre-training data curation, and thus into resource allocation and development priorities. Second, China has a long history of explicit language policy, varying between inclusivity of minority languages and a Mandarin-first policy. To test whether Chinese LLMs today reflect an agenda about China's languages, we test performance of Chinese and Western open-source LLMs on Asian regional and Chinese minority languages. Our experiments on Information Parity and reading comprehension show Chinese models' performance across these languages correlates strongly (r=0.93) with Western models', with the sole exception being better Mandarin. Sometimes, Chinese models cannot identify languages spoken by Chinese minorities such as Kazakh and Uyghur, even though they are good at French and German. These results provide a window into current development priorities, suggest options for future development, and indicate guidance for end users.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rajeev Kumar, Harishankar Kumar, Kumari Shalini</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models have revolutionized natural language processing with their surprising capability to understand and generate human-like text. However, many of these models inherit and further amplify the biases present in their training data, raising ethical and fairness concerns. The detection and mitigation of such biases are vital to ensuring that LLMs act responsibly and equitably across diverse domains. This work investigates Knowledge Graph-Augmented Training (KGAT) as a novel method to mitigate bias in LLM. Using structured domain-specific knowledge from real-world knowledge graphs, we improve the understanding of the model and reduce biased output. Public datasets for bias assessment include Gender Shades, Bias in Bios, and FairFace, while metrics such as demographic parity and equal opportunity facilitate rigorous detection. We also performed targeted mitigation strategies to correct biased associations, leading to a significant drop in biased output and improved bias metrics. Equipped with real-world datasets and knowledge graphs, our framework is both scalable and effective, paving the way toward responsible deployment in sensitive and high-stakes applications.</p>

It features a targeted data augmentation strategy using advanced LLMs with Chain-of-Thought prompting for challenging segments identified via corpus analysis. Subsequently, we employ efficient fine-tuning techniques (Unsloth with QLoRA) on a capable, low-parameter autoregressive model (specifically, a fine-tuned version of the 1.8B parameter Sailor model, which is based on the Qwen architecture) to create a practical and high-performing translation system.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mahak Agarwal, Divyam Khanna</p>
<p>Abstract: In many real-world scenarios, a single Large Language Model (LLM) may encounter contradictory claims-some accurate, others forcefully incorrect-and must judge which is true. We investigate this risk in a single-turn, multi-agent debate framework: one LLM-based agent provides a factual answer from TruthfulQA, another vigorously defends a falsehood, and the same LLM architecture serves as judge. We introduce the Confidence-Weighted Persuasion Override Rate (CW-POR), which captures not only how often the judge is deceived but also how strongly it believes the incorrect choice. Our experiments on five open-source LLMs (3B-14B parameters), where we systematically vary agent verbosity (30-300 words), reveal that even smaller models can craft persuasive arguments that override truthful answers-often with high confidence. These findings underscore the importance of robust calibration and adversarial testing to prevent LLMs from confidently endorsing misinformation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiuzhou Han, Wray Buntine, Ehsan Shareghi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models demonstrate remarkable reasoning capabilities but often produce unreliable or incorrect responses. Existing verification methods are typically model-specific or domain-restricted, requiring significant computational resources and lacking scalability across diverse reasoning tasks. To address these limitations, we propose VerifiAgent, a unified verification agent that integrates two levels of verification: meta-verification, which assesses completeness and consistency in model responses, and tool-based adaptive verification, where VerifiAgent autonomously selects appropriate verification tools based on the reasoning type, including mathematical, logical, or commonsense reasoning. This adaptive approach ensures both efficiency and robustness across different verification scenarios. Experimental results show that VerifiAgent outperforms baseline verification methods (e.g., deductive verifier, backward verifier) among all reasoning tasks. Additionally, it can further enhance reasoning accuracy by leveraging feedback from verification results. VerifiAgent can also be effectively applied to inference scaling, achieving better results with fewer generated samples and costs compared to existing process reward models in the mathematical reasoning domain.

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have greatly improved their capability in performing NLP tasks. However, deeper semantic understanding, contextual coherence, and more subtle reasoning are still difficult to obtain. The paper discusses state-of-the-art methodologies that advance LLMs with more advanced NLU techniques, such as semantic parsing, knowledge integration, and contextual reinforcement learning. We analyze the use of structured knowledge graphs, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and fine-tuning strategies that match models with human-level understanding. Furthermore, we address the incorporation of transformer-based architectures, contrastive learning, and hybrid symbolic-neural methods that address problems like hallucinations, ambiguity, and inconsistency in the factual perspectives involved in performing complex NLP tasks, such as question-answering text summarization and dialogue generation. Our findings show the importance of semantic precision for enhancing AI-driven language systems and suggest future research directions to bridge the gap between statistical language models and true natural language understanding.</p>

<p>Abstract: We explore how multimodal Large Language Models (mLLMs) can help researchers transcribe historical documents, extract relevant historical information, and construct datasets from historical sources. Specifically, we investigate the capabilities of mLLMs in performing (1) Optical Character Recognition (OCR), (2) OCR Post-Correction, and (3) Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks on a set of city directories published in German between 1754 and 1870. First, we benchmark the off-the-shelf transcription accuracy of both mLLMs and conventional OCR models. We find that the best-performing mLLM model significantly outperforms conventional state-of-the-art OCR models and other frontier mLLMs. Second, we are the first to introduce multimodal post-correction of OCR output using mLLMs. We find that this novel approach leads to a drastic improvement in transcription accuracy and consistently produces highly accurate transcriptions (<1% CER), without any image pre-processing or model fine-tuning. Third, we demonstrate that mLLMs can efficiently recognize entities in transcriptions of historical documents and parse them into structured dataset formats. Our findings provide early evidence for the long-term potential of mLLMs to introduce a paradigm shift in the approaches to historical data collection and document transcription.</p>

<p>Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) excel in knowledge recall and reasoning, their static nature leads to outdated information as the real world evolves or when adapting to domain-specific knowledge, highlighting the need for effective knowledge injection. However, current research on knowledge injection remains superficial, mainly focusing on knowledge memorization and retrieval. This paper proposes a four-tier knowledge injection framework that systematically defines the levels of knowledge injection: memorization, retrieval, reasoning, and association. Based on this framework, we introduce DeepKnowledge, a synthetic experimental testbed designed for fine-grained evaluation of the depth of knowledge injection across three knowledge types (novel, incremental, and updated). We then explore various knowledge injection scenarios and evaluate the depth of knowledge injection for each scenario on the benchmark. Experimental results reveal key factors to reach each level of knowledge injection for LLMs and establish a mapping between the levels of knowledge injection and the corresponding suitable injection methods, aiming to provide a comprehensive approach for efficient knowledge injection across various levels.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can perform complex reasoning by generating intermediate thoughts under zero-shot or few-shot settings. However, zero-shot prompting always encounters low performance, and the superior performance of few-shot prompting hinges on the manual-crafted demonstrations. In this paper, we present RoSE (Reasoning with Orchestrated Streaming Experiences), a general framework for solving reasoning tasks that can self-improve without complex external efforts. To enable RoSE, we describe an architecture that extends an LLM to store all answered questions and their thoughts in a streaming experience pool then orchestrates helpful questions from the pool to assist in answering new questions. To set up a question-aware orchestration mechanism, RoSE first calculates the similarity of each question in the pool with a new test question. Since the solution to each answered question is not always correct, RoSE will sort the questions according to their similarity with the new question, and then uniformly divide them into multiple buckets. It finally extracts one question from each bucket to make these extracted questions more diverse. To make these extracted questions help RoSE answer new questions as much as possible, we introduce two other attributes of uncertainty and complexity for each question. RoSE will preferentially select the questions with low uncertainty and high complexity from each bucket. We evaluate the versatility of RoSE in various reasoning tasks, LLMs, and CoT methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yilong Xu, Jinhua Gao, Xiaoming Yu, Yuanhai Xue, Baolong Bi, Huawei Shen, Xueqi Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Language Models boost task performance, owing to the retriever that provides external knowledge. Although crucial, the retriever primarily focuses on semantics relevance, which may not always be effective for generation. Thus, utility-based retrieval has emerged as a promising topic, prioritizing passages that provides valid benefits for downstream tasks. However, due to insufficient understanding, capturing passage utility accurately remains unexplored. This work proposes SCARLet, a framework for training utility-based retrievers in RALMs, which incorporates two key factors, multi-task generalization and inter-passage interaction. First, SCARLet constructs shared context on which training data for various tasks is synthesized. This mitigates semantic bias from context differences, allowing retrievers to focus on learning task-specific utility for better task generalization. Next, SCARLet uses a perturbation-based attribution method to estimate passage-level utility for shared context, which reflects interactions between passages and provides more accurate feedback. We evaluate our approach on ten datasets across various tasks, both in-domain and out-of-domain, showing that retrievers trained by SCARLet consistently improve the overall performance of RALMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongliu Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: Negation plays an important role in various natural language processing tasks such as Natural Language Inference and Sentiment Analysis tasks. Numerous prior studies have found that contextual text embedding models such as BERT, ELMO, RoBERTa or XLNet face challenges in accurately understanding negation. Recent advancements in universal text embeddings have demonstrated superior performance over contextual text embeddings in various tasks. However, due to the bias in popular evaluation benchmarks, the negation awareness capacity of these models remains unclear. To bridge the gap in existing literature, an in-depth analysis is initiated in this work to study the negation awareness of cutting-edge universal text embedding models. Our findings reveal a significant lack of negation awareness in these models, often interpreting negated text pairs as semantically similar. To efficiently deal with the conflict that different tasks need different trade-offs between topic and negation information among other semantic information, a data-efficient and computational-efficient embedding re-weighting method is proposed without modifying the parameters of text embedding models. The proposed solution is able to improve text embedding models' negation awareness significantly on both simple negation understanding task and complex negation understanding task. Furthermore, the proposed solution can also significantly improve the negation awareness of Large Language Model based task-specific high dimensional universal text embeddings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Owen Cook, Jake Vasilakes, Ian Roberts, Xingyi Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Data annotation is an essential component of the machine learning pipeline; it is also a costly and time-consuming process. With the introduction of transformer-based models, annotation at the document level is increasingly popular; however, there is no standard framework for structuring such tasks. The EffiARA annotation framework is, to our knowledge, the first project to support the whole annotation pipeline, from understanding the resources required for an annotation task to compiling the annotated dataset and gaining insights into the reliability of individual annotators as well as the dataset as a whole. The framework's efficacy is supported by two previous studies: one improving classification performance through annotator-reliability-based soft label aggregation and sample weighting, and the other increasing the overall agreement among annotators through removing identifying and replacing an unreliable annotator. This work introduces the EffiARA Python package and its accompanying webtool, which provides an accessible graphical user interface for the system. We open-source the EffiARA Python package at https://github.com/MiniEggz/EffiARA and the webtool is publicly accessible at https://effiara.gate.ac.uk.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weizhi Wang, Yu Tian, Linjie Yang, Heng Wang, Xifeng Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: The reproduction of state-of-the-art multimodal LLM pre-training faces barriers at every stage of the pipeline, including high-quality data filtering, multimodal data mixture strategies, sequence packing techniques, and training frameworks. We introduce Open-Qwen2VL, a fully open-source 2B-parameter Multimodal Large Language Model pre-trained efficiently on 29M image-text pairs using only 442 A100-40G GPU hours. Our approach employs low-to-high dynamic image resolution and multimodal sequence packing to significantly enhance pre-training efficiency. The training dataset was carefully curated using both MLLM-based filtering techniques (e.g., MLM-Filter) and conventional CLIP-based filtering methods, substantially improving data quality and training efficiency. The Open-Qwen2VL pre-training is conducted on academic level 8xA100-40G GPUs at UCSB on 5B packed multimodal tokens, which is 0.36\% of 1.4T multimodal pre-training tokens of Qwen2-VL. The final instruction-tuned Open-Qwen2VL outperforms partially-open state-of-the-art MLLM Qwen2-VL-2B on various multimodal benchmarks of MMBench, SEEDBench, MMstar, and MathVista, indicating the remarkable training efficiency of Open-Qwen2VL. We open-source all aspects of our work, including compute-efficient and data-efficient training details, data filtering methods, sequence packing scripts, pre-training data in WebDataset format, FSDP-based training codebase, and both base and instruction-tuned model checkpoints. We redefine "fully open" for multimodal LLMs as the complete release of: 1) the training codebase, 2) detailed data filtering techniques, and 3) all pre-training and supervised fine-tuning data used to develop the model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jirui Qi, Raquel Fern\'andez, Arianna Bisazza</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated strong performance in multilingual question-answering (QA) tasks by leveraging relevant passages retrieved from corpora. In multilingual RAG (mRAG), the retrieved passages can be written in languages other than that of the query entered by the user, making it challenging for LLMs to effectively utilize the provided information. Recent research suggests that retrieving passages from multilingual corpora can improve RAG performance, particularly for low-resource languages. However, the extent to which LLMs can leverage different kinds of multilingual contexts to generate accurate answers, *independently from retrieval quality*, remains understudied. In this paper, we conduct an extensive assessment of LLMs' ability to (i) make consistent use of a relevant passage regardless of its language, (ii) respond in the expected language, and (iii) focus on the relevant passage even when multiple `distracting' passages in different languages are provided in the context. Our experiments with four LLMs across three QA datasets covering a total of 48 languages reveal a surprising ability of LLMs to extract the relevant information from out-language passages, but a much weaker ability to formulate a full answer in the correct language. Our analysis, based on both accuracy and feature attribution techniques, further shows that distracting passages negatively impact answer quality regardless of their language. However, distractors in the query language exert a slightly stronger influence. Taken together, our findings deepen the understanding of how LLMs utilize context in mRAG systems, providing directions for future improvements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kazuki Yano, Sho Takase, Sosuke Kobayashi, Shun Kiyono, Jun Suzuki</p>
<p>Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) gain widespread practical application, providing the model family of different parameter sizes has become standard practice to address diverse computational requirements. Conventionally, each model in a family is trained independently, resulting in computational costs that scale additively with the number of models. We propose an efficient method for constructing the model family through progressive training, where smaller models are incrementally expanded to larger sizes to create a complete model family. Through extensive experiments with a model family ranging from 1B to 8B parameters, we demonstrate that our method reduces computational costs by approximately 25% while maintaining comparable performance to independently trained models. Furthermore, by strategically adjusting maximum learning rates based on model size, our method outperforms the independent training across various metrics. Beyond performance gains, our approach offers an additional advantage: models in our family tend to yield more consistent behavior across different model sizes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Enrico Liscio, Michela Lorandi, Pradeep K. Murukannaiah</p>
<p>Abstract: News articles are more than collections of facts; they reflect journalists' framing, shaping how events are presented to the audience. One key aspect of framing is the choice to write in (or quote verbatim) morally charged language as opposed to using neutral terms. This moral framing carries implicit judgments that automated news summarizers should recognize and preserve to maintain the original intent of the writer. In this work, we perform the first study on the preservation of moral framing in AI-generated news summaries. We propose an approach that leverages the intuition that journalists intentionally use or report specific moral-laden words, which should be retained in summaries. Through automated, crowd-sourced, and expert evaluations, we demonstrate that our approach enhances the preservation of moral framing while maintaining overall summary quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dengchun Li, Naizheng Wang, Zihao Zhang, Haoyang Yin, Lei Duan, Meng Xiao, Mingjie Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Instruction-based fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) has achieved remarkable success in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as Mixture of LoRA Experts (MoLE), combine the efficiency of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) with the versatility of Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, demonstrating significant potential for handling multiple downstream tasks. However, the existing routing mechanisms for MoLE often involve a trade-off between computational efficiency and predictive accuracy, and they fail to fully address the diverse expert selection demands across different transformer layers. In this work, we propose DynMoLE, a hybrid routing strategy that dynamically adjusts expert selection based on the Tsallis entropy of the router's probability distribution. This approach mitigates router uncertainty, enhances stability, and promotes more equitable expert participation, leading to faster convergence and improved model performance. Additionally, we introduce an auxiliary loss based on Tsallis entropy to further guide the model toward convergence with reduced uncertainty, thereby improving training stability and performance. Our extensive experiments on commonsense reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that DynMoLE achieves substantial performance improvements, outperforming LoRA by 9.6% and surpassing the state-of-the-art MoLE method, MoLA, by 2.3%. We also conduct a comprehensive ablation study to evaluate the contributions of DynMoLE's key components.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00664">Do LLMs Surpass Encoders for Biomedical NER?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Motasem S Obeidat, Md Sultan Al Nahian, Ramakanth Kavuluru</p>
<p>Abstract: Recognizing spans of biomedical concepts and their types (e.g., drug or gene) in free text, often called biomedical named entity recognition (NER), is a basic component of information extraction (IE) pipelines. Without a strong NER component, other applications, such as knowledge discovery and information retrieval, are not practical. State-of-the-art in NER shifted from traditional ML models to deep neural networks with transformer-based encoder models (e.g., BERT) emerging as the current standard. However, decoder models (also called large language models or LLMs) are gaining traction in IE. But LLM-driven NER often ignores positional information due to the generative nature of decoder models. Furthermore, they are computationally very expensive (both in inference time and hardware needs). Hence, it is worth exploring if they actually excel at biomedical NER and assess any associated trade-offs (performance vs efficiency). This is exactly what we do in this effort employing the same BIO entity tagging scheme (that retains positional information) using five different datasets with varying proportions of longer entities. Our results show that the LLMs chosen (Mistral and Llama: 8B range) often outperform best encoder models (BERT-(un)cased, BiomedBERT, and DeBERTav3: 300M range) by 2-8% in F-scores except for one dataset, where they equal encoder performance. This gain is more prominent among longer entities of length >= 3 tokens. However, LLMs are one to two orders of magnitude more expensive at inference time and may need cost prohibitive hardware. Thus, when performance differences are small or real time user feedback is needed, encoder models might still be more suitable than LLMs.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00676">GLiNER-biomed: A Suite of Efficient Models for Open Biomedical Named Entity Recognition</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Anthony Yazdani, Ihor Stepanov, Douglas Teodoro</p>
<p>Abstract: Biomedical named entity recognition (NER) presents unique challenges due to specialized vocabularies, the sheer volume of entities, and the continuous emergence of novel entities. Traditional NER models, constrained by fixed taxonomies and human annotations, struggle to generalize beyond predefined entity types or efficiently adapt to emerging concepts. To address these issues, we introduce GLiNER-biomed, a domain-adapted suite of Generalist and Lightweight Model for NER (GLiNER) models specifically tailored for biomedical NER. In contrast to conventional approaches, GLiNER uses natural language descriptions to infer arbitrary entity types, enabling zero-shot recognition. Our approach first distills the annotation capabilities of large language models (LLMs) into a smaller, more efficient model, enabling the generation of high-coverage synthetic biomedical NER data. We subsequently train two GLiNER architectures, uni- and bi-encoder, at multiple scales to balance computational efficiency and recognition performance. Evaluations on several biomedical datasets demonstrate that GLiNER-biomed outperforms state-of-the-art GLiNER models in both zero- and few-shot scenarios, achieving 5.96% improvement in F1-score over the strongest baseline. Ablation studies highlight the effectiveness of our synthetic data generation strategy and emphasize the complementary benefits of synthetic biomedical pre-training combined with fine-tuning on high-quality general-domain annotations.

<p>Abstract: Pre-training large language models (LLMs) necessitates enormous diverse textual corpora, making effective data selection a key challenge for balancing computational resources and model performance. Current methodologies primarily emphasize data quality metrics and mixing proportions, yet they fail to adequately capture the underlying semantic connections between training samples and quality disparities within individual domains. We introduce ToReMi (Topic-based Reweighting for Model improvement), a novel two-stage framework that dynamically adjusts training sample weights according to their topical associations and observed learning patterns. Our comprehensive experiments reveal that ToReMi variants consistently achieve superior performance over conventional pre-training approaches, demonstrating accelerated perplexity reduction across multiple domains and enhanced capabilities on downstream evaluation tasks.

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been increasingly used to optimize the analysis and synthesis of legal documents, enabling the automation of tasks such as summarization, classification, and retrieval of legal information. This study aims to conduct a systematic literature review to identify the state of the art in prompt engineering applied to LLMs in the legal context. The results indicate that models such as GPT-4, BERT, Llama 2, and Legal-Pegasus are widely employed in the legal field, and techniques such as Few-shot Learning, Zero-shot Learning, and Chain-of-Thought prompting have proven effective in improving the interpretation of legal texts. However, challenges such as biases in models and hallucinations still hinder their large-scale implementation. It is concluded that, despite the great potential of LLMs for the legal field, there is a need to improve prompt engineering strategies to ensure greater accuracy and reliability in the generated results.</p>

<p>Abstract: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is essential in diagnostic pathology and biomedical research, offering critical insights into protein expression and tumour biology. This study presents an automated pipeline, IHC-LLMiner, for extracting IHC-tumour profiles from PubMed abstracts, leveraging advanced biomedical text mining. There are two subtasks: abstract classification (include/exclude as relevant) and IHC-tumour profile extraction on relevant included abstracts. The best-performing model, "Gemma-2 finetuned", achieved 91.5% accuracy and an F1 score of 91.4, outperforming GPT4-O by 9.5% accuracy with 5.9 times faster inference time. From an initial dataset of 107,759 abstracts identified for 50 immunohistochemical markers, the classification task identified 30,481 relevant abstracts (Include) using the Gemma-2 finetuned model. For IHC-tumour profile extraction, the Gemma-2 finetuned model achieved the best performance with 63.3% Correct outputs. Extracted IHC-tumour profiles (tumour types and markers) were normalised to Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) concepts to ensure consistency and facilitate IHC-tumour profile landscape analysis. The extracted IHC-tumour profiles demonstrated excellent concordance with available online summary data and provided considerable added value in terms of both missing IHC-tumour profiles and quantitative assessments. Our proposed LLM based pipeline provides a practical solution for large-scale IHC-tumour profile data mining, enhancing the accessibility and utility of such data for research and clinical applications as well as enabling the generation of quantitative and structured data to support cancer-specific knowledge base development.

<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance, efficient knowledge evaluation becomes crucial to verifying their capabilities. Traditional methods, relying on benchmarks, face limitations such as high resource costs and information loss. We propose the Large-scale Reference-based Efficient Knowledge Evaluation for Large Language Model (RECKON), which directly uses reference data to evaluate models. RECKON organizes unstructured data into manageable units and generates targeted questions for each cluster, improving evaluation accuracy and efficiency. Experimental results show that RECKON reduces resource consumption by 56.5% compared to traditional methods while achieving over 97% accuracy across various domains, including world knowledge, code, legal, and biomedical datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anja Ryser, Yingqiang Gao, Sarah Ebling</p>
<p>Abstract: Language sample analysis (LSA) is a process that complements standardized psychometric tests for diagnosing, for example, developmental language disorder (DLD) in children. However, its labor-intensive nature has limited its use in speech-language pathology practice. We introduce an approach that leverages natural language processing (NLP) methods not based on commercial large language models (LLMs) applied to transcribed speech data from 119 children in the German speaking part of Switzerland with typical and atypical language development. The study aims to identify optimal practices that support speech-language pathologists in diagnosing DLD more efficiently within a human-in-the-loop framework, without relying on potentially unethical implementations that leverage commercial LLMs. Preliminary findings underscore the potential of integrating locally deployed NLP methods into the process of semi-automatic LSA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xi Wang, Fanfei Meng, Shiyang Zhang, Lan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Electronic dictionaries have largely replaced paper dictionaries and become central tools for L2 learners seeking to expand their vocabulary. Users often assume these resources are reliable and rarely question the validity of the definitions provided. The accuracy of major E-dictionaries is seldom scrutinized, and little attention has been paid to how their corpora are constructed. Research on dictionary use, particularly the limitations of electronic dictionaries, remains scarce. This study adopts a combined method of experimentation, user survey, and dictionary critique to examine Youdao, one of the most widely used E-dictionaries in China. The experiment involved a translation task paired with retrospective reflection. Participants were asked to translate sentences containing words that are insufficiently or inaccurately defined in Youdao. Their consultation behavior was recorded to analyze how faulty definitions influenced comprehension. Results show that incomplete or misleading definitions can cause serious misunderstandings. Additionally, students exhibited problematic consultation habits. The study further explores how such flawed definitions originate, highlighting issues in data processing and the integration of AI and machine learning technologies in dictionary construction. The findings suggest a need for better training in dictionary literacy for users, as well as improvements in the underlying AI models used to build E-dictionaries.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaojian Yu, Yinghao Wu, Yilun Zhao, Arman Cohan, Xiao-Ping Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can achieve enhanced complex problem-solving through test-time computing scaling, yet this often entails longer contexts and numerous reasoning token costs. In this paper, we propose an efficient test-time scaling method that trains LLMs on code-related reasoning trajectories, facilitating their reduction of excess thinking tokens while maintaining performance. First, we create Z1-Code-Reasoning-107K, a curated dataset of simple and complex coding problems paired with their short and long solution trajectories. Second, we present a novel Shifted Thinking Window to mitigate overthinking overhead by removing context-delimiting tags (e.g., <think>. . . </think>) and capping reasoning tokens. Trained with long and short trajectory data and equipped with Shifted Thinking Window, our model, Z1-7B, demonstrates the ability to adjust its reasoning level as the complexity of problems and exhibits efficient test-time scaling across different reasoning tasks that matches R1-Distill-Qwen-7B performance with about 30% of its average thinking tokens. Notably, fine-tuned with only code trajectories, Z1-7B demonstrates generalization to broader reasoning tasks (47.5% on GPQA Diamond). Our analysis of efficient reasoning elicitation also provides valuable insights for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yubo Wang, Xueguang Ma, Ping Nie, Huaye Zeng, Zhiheng Lyu, Yuxuan Zhang, Benjamin Schneider, Yi Lu, Xiang Yue, Wenhu Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Academic writing requires both coherent text generation and precise citation of relevant literature. Although recent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have significantly improved factual accuracy in general-purpose text generation, their capacity to adequately support professional academic writing remains limited. In this work, we introduce ScholarCopilot, a unified framework designed to enhance existing large language models for generating professional academic articles with accurate and contextually relevant citations. ScholarCopilot dynamically determines when to retrieve scholarly references by generating a retrieval token [RET], and then utilizes its representation to look up relevant citations from a database. The retrieved references are fed into the model to augment the generation process. We jointly optimize both the generation and citation tasks within a single framework to increase efficiency. Trained on 500K papers from arXiv, our model achieves a top-1 retrieval accuracy of 40.1% on our evaluation dataset, outperforming baselines such as E5-Mistral-7B-Instruct (15.0%) and BM25 (9.8%). On a dataset of 1,000 academic writing samples, ScholarCopilot scores 16.2/25 in generation quality (measured across relevance, coherence, academic rigor, completeness, and innovation), surpassing models with 10x more parameters such as Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct (15.8/25). Human studies also confirm ScholarCopilot's superior performance in citation recall, writing efficiency, and overall user experience, confirming the effectiveness of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunjie Ji, Sitong Zhao, Xiaoyu Tian, Haotian Wang, Shuaiting Chen, Yiping Peng, Han Zhao, Xiangang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with efficiency and scalability remains a fundamental challenge in artificial intelligence research. This paper presents a rigorous experimental investigation into how difficulty-aware staged reinforcement learning (RL) strategies can substantially improve LLM reasoning performance. Through systematic analysis, we demonstrate that strategically selecting training data according to well-defined difficulty levels markedly enhances RL optimization. Moreover, we introduce a staged training methodology, progressively exposing models to increasingly challenging tasks, further amplifying reasoning capabilities. Our findings reveal significant cross-domain benefits when simultaneously training models on mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks. Notably, our proposed approach enables a 1.5B parameter model to achieve an accuracy of 42.3\% on the AIME-2024 benchmark, 89.5\% on the MATH-500 benchmark. These results underscore the efficacy of our method in advancing the reasoning proficiency of LLMs. We will open-source our datasets on GitHub and Hugging Face.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lucy Havens, Benjamin Bach, Melissa Terras, Beatrice Alex</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite numerous efforts to mitigate their biases, ML systems continue to harm already-marginalized people. While predominant ML approaches assume bias can be removed and fair models can be created, we show that these are not always possible, nor desirable, goals. We reframe the problem of ML bias by creating models to identify biased language, drawing attention to a dataset's biases rather than trying to remove them. Then, through a workshop, we evaluated the models for a specific use case: workflows of information and heritage professionals. Our findings demonstrate the limitations of ML for identifying bias due to its contextual nature, the way in which approaches to mitigating it can simultaneously privilege and oppress different communities, and its inevitability. We demonstrate the need to expand ML approaches to bias and fairness, providing a mixed-methods approach to investigating the feasibility of removing bias or achieving fairness in a given ML use case.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00869">m1: Unleash the Potential of Test-Time Scaling for Medical Reasoning with Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoke Huang, Juncheng Wu, Hui Liu, Xianfeng Tang, Yuyin Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Test-time scaling has emerged as a powerful technique for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models. However, its effectiveness in medical reasoning remains uncertain, as the medical domain fundamentally differs from mathematical tasks in terms of knowledge representation and decision-making processes. In this paper, we provide the first comprehensive investigation of test-time scaling for medical reasoning and present m1, a simple yet effective approach that increases a model's medical reasoning capability at inference. Our evaluation across diverse medical tasks demonstrates that test-time scaling consistently enhances medical reasoning, enabling lightweight fine-tuned models under 10B parameters to establish new state-of-the-art performance, while our 32B model rivals previous 70B-scale medical LLMs. However, we identify an optimal reasoning token budget of approximately 4K, beyond which performance may degrade due to overthinking. Budget forcing, which extends test-time computation through iterative prompts, helps models double-check answers but does not necessarily improve the overall medical QA performance and, in some cases, even introduces errors into previously correct responses. Our case-by-case analysis identifies insufficient medical knowledge as a key bottleneck that prevents further performance gains through test-time scaling. We find that increasing data scale, improving data quality, and expanding model capacity consistently enhance medical knowledge grounding, enabling continued performance improvements, particularly on challenging medical benchmarks where smaller models reach saturation. These findings underscore fundamental differences between medical and mathematical reasoning in LLMs, highlighting that enriched medical knowledge, other than increased reasoning depth alone, is essential for realizing the benefits of test-time scaling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jian Zhao, Runze Liu, Kaiyan Zhang, Zhimu Zhou, Junqi Gao, Dong Li, Jiafei Lyu, Zhouyi Qian, Biqing Qi, Xiu Li, Bowen Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown that it is promising to utilize Process Reward Models (PRMs) as verifiers to enhance the performance of LLMs. However, current PRMs face three key challenges: (1) limited process supervision and generalization capabilities, (2) dependence on scalar value prediction without leveraging the generative abilities of LLMs, and (3) inability to scale the test-time compute of PRMs. In this work, we introduce GenPRM, a generative process reward model that performs explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with code verification before providing judgment for each reasoning step. To obtain high-quality process supervision labels and rationale data, we propose Relative Progress Estimation (RPE) and a rationale synthesis framework that incorporates code verification. Experimental results on ProcessBench and several mathematical reasoning tasks show that GenPRM significantly outperforms prior PRMs with only 23K training data from MATH dataset. Through test-time scaling, a 1.5B GenPRM outperforms GPT-4o, and a 7B GenPRM surpasses Qwen2.5-Math-PRM-72B on ProcessBench. Additionally, GenPRM demonstrates strong abilities to serve as a critic model for policy model refinement. This work establishes a new paradigm for process supervision that bridges the gap between PRMs and critic models in LLMs. Our code, model, and data will be available in https://ryanliu112.github.io/GenPRM.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly acting as autonomous agents, with function calling (FC) capabilities enabling them to invoke specific tools for tasks. While prior research has primarily focused on improving FC accuracy, little attention has been given to the robustness of these agents to perturbations in their input. We introduce a benchmark assessing FC robustness in two key areas: resilience to naturalistic query variations, and stability in function calling when the toolkit expands with semantically related tools. Evaluating best-performing FC models on a carefully expanded subset of the Berkeley function calling leaderboard (BFCL), we identify critical weaknesses in existing evaluation methodologies, and highlight areas for improvement in real-world agentic deployments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Olga Golovneva, Tianlu Wang, Jason Weston, Sainbayar Sukhbaatar</p>
<p>Abstract: Soft attention is a critical mechanism powering LLMs to locate relevant parts within a given context. However, individual attention weights are determined by the similarity of only a single query and key token vector. This "single token attention" bottlenecks the amount of information used in distinguishing a relevant part from the rest of the context. To address this issue, we propose a new attention method, Multi-Token Attention (MTA), which allows LLMs to condition their attention weights on multiple query and key vectors simultaneously. This is achieved by applying convolution operations over queries, keys and heads, allowing nearby queries and keys to affect each other's attention weights for more precise attention. As a result, our method can locate relevant context using richer, more nuanced information that can exceed a single vector's capacity. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that MTA achieves enhanced performance on a range of popular benchmarks. Notably, it outperforms Transformer baseline models on standard language modeling tasks, and on tasks that require searching for information within long contexts, where our method's ability to leverage richer information proves particularly beneficial.</p>

<p>Abstract: Representational harms are widely recognized among fairness-related harms caused by generative language systems. However, their definitions are commonly under-specified. We present a framework, grounded in speech act theory (Austin, 1962), that conceptualizes representational harms caused by generative language systems as the perlocutionary effects (i.e., real-world impacts) of particular types of illocutionary acts (i.e., system behaviors). Building on this argument and drawing on relevant literature from linguistic anthropology and sociolinguistics, we provide new definitions stereotyping, demeaning, and erasure. We then use our framework to develop a granular taxonomy of illocutionary acts that cause representational harms, going beyond the high-level taxonomies presented in previous work. We also discuss the ways that our framework and taxonomy can support the development of valid measurement instruments. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our framework and taxonomy via a case study that engages with recent conceptual debates about what constitutes a representational harm and how such harms should be measured.</p>

<p>Abstract: Leveraging large language models (LLMs) to generate high-stakes documents, such as informed consent forms (ICFs), remains a significant challenge due to the extreme need for regulatory compliance and factual accuracy. Here, we present InformGen, an LLM-driven copilot for accurate and compliant ICF drafting by optimized knowledge document parsing and content generation, with humans in the loop. We further construct a benchmark dataset comprising protocols and ICFs from 900 clinical trials. Experimental results demonstrate that InformGen achieves near 100% compliance with 18 core regulatory rules derived from FDA guidelines, outperforming a vanilla GPT-4o model by up to 30%. Additionally, a user study with five annotators shows that InformGen, when integrated with manual intervention, attains over 90% factual accuracy, significantly surpassing the vanilla GPT-4o model's 57%-82%. Crucially, InformGen ensures traceability by providing inline citations to source protocols, enabling easy verification and maintaining the highest standards of factual integrity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anna Bavaresco, Raquel Fern\'andez</p>
<p>Abstract: A common assumption in Computational Linguistics is that text representations learnt by multimodal models are richer and more human-like than those by language-only models, as they are grounded in images or audio -- similar to how human language is grounded in real-world experiences. However, empirical studies checking whether this is true are largely lacking. We address this gap by comparing word representations from contrastive multimodal models vs. language-only ones in the extent to which they capture experiential information -- as defined by an existing norm-based 'experiential model' -- and align with human fMRI responses. Our results indicate that, surprisingly, language-only models are superior to multimodal ones in both respects. Additionally, they learn more unique brain-relevant semantic information beyond that shared with the experiential model. Overall, our study highlights the need to develop computational models that better integrate the complementary semantic information provided by multimodal data sources.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxuan Zhu, Ali Falahati, David H. Yang, Mohammad Mohammadi Amiri</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models face significant computational and memory challenges when processing long contexts. During inference, efficient management of the key-value (KV) cache, which stores intermediate activations for autoregressive generation, is critical to reducing memory overhead and improving computational efficiency. Traditional token-level efficient KV caching methods overlook semantic information, treating tokens independently without considering their semantic relationships. Meanwhile, existing semantic-preserving KV cache management approaches often suffer from substantial memory usage and high time-to-first-token. To address these limitations, we propose SentenceKV, a novel sentence-level semantic KV caching approach designed to enhance inference efficiency while preserving semantic coherence. During prefilling, SentenceKV groups tokens based on sentence-level semantic similarity, compressing sentence representations into concise semantic vectors stored directly on the GPU, while individual KV pairs are offloaded to CPU. During decoding, SentenceKV generates tokens by selectively retrieving semantically relevant sentence-level KV entries, leveraging the semantic similarity between the prefilling-stage semantic vectors and decoding-stage queries. This ensures efficient and contextually accurate predictions, minimizing the loading of redundant or irrelevant data into GPU memory and significantly reducing memory overhead while maintaining stable inference latency, even for extremely long contexts. Extensive evaluations on benchmarks including PG-19, LongBench, and Needle-In-A-Haystack demonstrate that SentenceKV significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both efficiency and memory usage, without compromising model accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Chinese Grammatical Error Correction (CGEC) is a critical task in Natural Language Processing, addressing the growing demand for automated writing assistance in both second-language (L2) and native (L1) Chinese writing. While L2 learners struggle with mastering complex grammatical structures, L1 users also benefit from CGEC in academic, professional, and formal contexts where writing precision is essential. This survey provides a comprehensive review of CGEC research, covering datasets, annotation schemes, evaluation methodologies, and system advancements. We examine widely used CGEC datasets, highlighting their characteristics, limitations, and the need for improved standardization. We also analyze error annotation frameworks, discussing challenges such as word segmentation ambiguity and the classification of Chinese-specific error types. Furthermore, we review evaluation metrics, focusing on their adaptation from English GEC to Chinese, including character-level scoring and the use of multiple references. In terms of system development, we trace the evolution from rule-based and statistical approaches to neural architectures, including Transformer-based models and the integration of large pre-trained language models. By consolidating existing research and identifying key challenges, this survey provides insights into the current state of CGEC and outlines future directions, including refining annotation standards to address segmentation challenges, and leveraging multilingual approaches to enhance CGEC.</p>

<p>Abstract: Medical tasks such as diagnosis and treatment planning require precise and complex reasoning, particularly in life-critical domains. Unlike mathematical reasoning, medical reasoning demands meticulous, verifiable thought processes to ensure reliability and accuracy. However, there is a notable lack of datasets that provide transparent, step-by-step reasoning to validate and enhance the medical reasoning ability of AI models. To bridge this gap, we introduce MedReason, a large-scale high-quality medical reasoning dataset designed to enable faithful and explainable medical problem-solving in large language models (LLMs). We utilize a structured medical knowledge graph (KG) to convert clinical QA pairs into logical chains of reasoning, or ``thinking paths'', which trace connections from question elements to answers via relevant KG entities. Each path is validated for consistency with clinical logic and evidence-based medicine. Our pipeline generates detailed reasoning for various medical questions from 7 medical datasets, resulting in a dataset of 32,682 question-answer pairs, each with detailed, step-by-step explanations. Experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning with our dataset consistently boosts medical problem-solving capabilities, achieving significant gains of up to 7.7% for DeepSeek-Ditill-8B. Our top-performing model, MedReason-8B, outperforms the Huatuo-o1-8B, a state-of-the-art medical reasoning model, by up to 4.2% on the clinical benchmark MedBullets. We also engage medical professionals from diverse specialties to assess our dataset's quality, ensuring MedReason offers accurate and coherent medical reasoning. Our data, models, and code will be publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jos\'e Pombal, Nuno M. Guerreiro, Ricardo Rei, Andr\'e F. T. Martins</p>
<p>Abstract: As language models improve and become capable of performing more complex tasks across modalities, evaluating them automatically becomes increasingly challenging. Developing strong and robust task-specific automatic metrics gets harder, and human-annotated test sets -- which are expensive to create -- saturate more quickly. A compelling alternative is to design reliable strategies to automate the creation of test data and evaluation, but previous attempts either rely on pre-existing data, or focus solely on individual tasks. We present Zero-shot Benchmarking (ZSB), a framework for creating high-quality benchmarks for any task by leveraging language models for both synthetic test data creation and evaluation. ZSB is simple and flexible: it requires only the creation of a prompt for data generation and one for evaluation; it is scalable to tasks and languages where collecting real-world data is costly or impractical; it is model-agnostic, allowing the creation of increasingly challenging benchmarks as models improve. To assess the effectiveness of our framework, we create benchmarks for five text-only tasks and a multi-modal one: general capabilities in four languages (English, Chinese, French, and Korean), translation, and general vision-language capabilities in English. We then rank a broad range of open and closed systems on our benchmarks. ZSB rankings consistently correlate strongly with human rankings, outperforming widely-adopted standard benchmarks. Through ablations, we find that strong benchmarks can be created with open models, and that judge model size and dataset variety are crucial drivers of performance. We release all our benchmarks, and code to reproduce our experiments and to produce new benchmarks.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01002">Token embeddings violate the manifold hypothesis</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Robinson, Sourya Dey, Tony Chiang</p>
<p>Abstract: To fully understand the behavior of a large language model (LLM) requires our understanding of its input space. If this input space differs from our assumption, our understanding of and conclusions about the LLM is likely flawed, regardless of its architecture. Here, we elucidate the structure of the token embeddings, the input domain for LLMs, both empirically and theoretically. We present a generalized and statistically testable model where the neighborhood of each token splits into well-defined signal and noise dimensions.
  This model is based on a generalization of a manifold called a fiber bundle, so we denote our hypothesis test as the ``fiber bundle null.'' Failing to reject the null is uninformative, but rejecting it at a specific token indicates that token has a statistically significant local structure, and so is of interest to us. By running our test over several open-source LLMs, each with unique token embeddings, we find that the null is frequently rejected, and so the token subspace is provably not a fiber bundle and hence also not a manifold. As a consequence of our findings, when an LLM is presented with two semantically equivalent prompts, and if one prompt contains a token implicated by our test, that prompt will likely exhibit more output variability proportional to the local signal dimension of the token.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nishad Singhi, Hritik Bansal, Arian Hosseini, Aditya Grover, Kai-Wei Chang, Marcus Rohrbach, Anna Rohrbach</p>
<p>Abstract: Scaling test-time compute has emerged as a key strategy for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly in tasks like mathematical problem-solving. A traditional approach, Self-Consistency (SC), generates multiple solutions to a problem and selects the most common answer via majority voting. Another common method involves scoring each solution with a reward model (verifier) and choosing the best one. Recent advancements in Generative Reward Models (GenRM) reframe verification as a next-token prediction task, enabling inference-time scaling along a new axis. Specifically, GenRM generates multiple verification chains-of-thought to score each solution. Under a limited inference budget, this introduces a fundamental trade-off: should you spend the budget on scaling solutions via SC or generate fewer solutions and allocate compute to verification via GenRM? To address this, we evaluate GenRM against SC under a fixed inference budget. Interestingly, we find that SC is more compute-efficient than GenRM for most practical inference budgets across diverse models and datasets. For instance, GenRM first matches SC after consuming up to 8x the inference compute and requires significantly more compute to outperform it. Furthermore, we derive inference scaling laws for the GenRM paradigm, revealing that compute-optimal inference favors scaling solution generation more aggressively than scaling the number of verifications. Our work provides practical guidance on optimizing test-time scaling by balancing solution generation and verification. The code is available at https://github.com/nishadsinghi/sc-genrm-scaling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Di Wu, Jia-Chen Gu, Kai-Wei Chang, Nanyun Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: Selective retrieval improves retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) by reducing distractions from low-quality retrievals and improving efficiency. However, existing approaches under-utilize the inherent knowledge of large language models (LLMs), leading to suboptimal retrieval decisions and degraded generation performance. To bridge this gap, we propose Self-Routing RAG (SR-RAG), a novel framework that binds selective retrieval with knowledge verbalization. SR-RAG enables an LLM to dynamically decide between external retrieval and verbalizing its own parametric knowledge. To this end, we design a multi-task objective that jointly optimizes an LLM on knowledge source selection, knowledge verbalization, and response generation. We further introduce dynamic knowledge source inference via nearest neighbor search to improve the accuracy of knowledge source decision under domain shifts. Fine-tuning three LLMs with SR-RAG significantly improves both their response accuracy and inference latency. Compared to the strongest selective retrieval baseline, SR-RAG reduces retrievals by 29% while improving the performance by 5.1%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ryan Marinelli, Magnus Eckhoff</p>
<p>Abstract: To effectively deploy Large Language Models (LLMs) in application-specific settings, fine-tuning techniques are applied to enhance performance on specialized tasks. This process often involves fine-tuning on user data data, which may contain sensitive information. Although not recommended, it is not uncommon for users to send passwords in messages, and fine-tuning models on this could result in passwords being leaked. In this study, a Large Language Model is fine-tuned with customer support data and passwords from the RockYou password wordlist using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Out of the first 200 passwords from the list, 37 were successfully recovered. Further, causal tracing is used to identify that password information is largely located in a few layers. Lastly, Rank One Model Editing (ROME) is used to remove the password information from the model, resulting in the number of passwords recovered going from 37 to 0.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Riccardo Cantini, Fabrizio Marozzo, Alessio Orsino, Domenico Talia, Paolo Trunfio</p>
<p>Abstract: The widespread use of social media platforms results in the generation of vast amounts of user-generated content, which requires efficient methods for categorization and search. Hashtag recommendation systems have emerged as a crucial tool for automatically suggesting relevant hashtags and improving content discoverability. However, existing static models struggle to adapt to the highly dynamic and real-time nature of social media conversations, where new hashtags emerge and existing ones undergo semantic shifts. To address these challenges, this paper presents H-ADAPTS (Hashtag recommendAtion by Detecting and adAPting to Trend Shifts), a BERT-based hashtag recommendation methodology that can detect and adapt to shifts in the main trends and topics underlying social media conversation. Our approach introduces a trend-aware detection mechanism to identify changes in hashtag usage, triggering efficient model adaptation on a (small) set of recent posts. The framework leverages Apache Storm for real-time stream processing, enabling scalable and fault-tolerant analysis of high-velocity social data. Experimental results on two real-world case studies, including the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2020 US presidential election, demonstrate the ability to maintain high recommendation accuracy by adapting to emerging trends. Our methodology significantly outperforms existing solutions, ensuring timely and relevant hashtag recommendations in dynamic environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Transformers trained on tokenized text, audio, and images can generate high-quality autoregressive samples. But handwriting data, represented as sequences of pen coordinates, remains underexplored. We introduce a novel tokenization scheme that converts pen stroke offsets to polar coordinates, discretizes them into bins, and then turns them into sequences of tokens with which to train a standard GPT model. This allows us to capture complex stroke distributions without using any specialized architectures (eg. the mixture density network or the self-advancing ASCII attention head from Graves 2014). With just 3,500 handwritten words and a few simple data augmentations, we are able to train a model that can generate realistic cursive handwriting. Our approach is simpler and more performant than previous RNN-based methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahsan Bilal, David Ebert, Beiyu Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising approach to enhancing Explainable AI (XAI) by transforming complex machine learning outputs into easy-to-understand narratives, making model predictions more accessible to users, and helping bridge the gap between sophisticated model behavior and human interpretability. AI models, such as state-of-the-art neural networks and deep learning models, are often seen as "black boxes" due to a lack of transparency. As users cannot fully understand how the models reach conclusions, users have difficulty trusting decisions from AI models, which leads to less effective decision-making processes, reduced accountabilities, and unclear potential biases. A challenge arises in developing explainable AI (XAI) models to gain users' trust and provide insights into how models generate their outputs. With the development of Large Language Models, we want to explore the possibilities of using human language-based models, LLMs, for model explainabilities. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of existing approaches regarding LLMs for XAI, and evaluation techniques for LLM-generated explanation, discusses the corresponding challenges and limitations, and examines real-world applications. Finally, we discuss future directions by emphasizing the need for more interpretable, automated, user-centric, and multidisciplinary approaches for XAI via LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rana Muhammad Shahroz Khan, Zhen Tan, Sukwon Yun, Charles Flemming, Tianlong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Most discussions about Large Language Model (LLM) safety have focused on single-agent settings but multi-agent LLM systems now create novel adversarial risks because their behavior depends on communication between agents and decentralized reasoning. In this work, we innovatively focus on attacking pragmatic systems that have constrains such as limited token bandwidth, latency between message delivery, and defense mechanisms. We design a $\textit{permutation-invariant adversarial attack}$ that optimizes prompt distribution across latency and bandwidth-constraint network topologies to bypass distributed safety mechanisms within the system. Formulating the attack path as a problem of $\textit{maximum-flow minimum-cost}$, coupled with the novel $\textit{Permutation-Invariant Evasion Loss (PIEL)}$, we leverage graph-based optimization to maximize attack success rate while minimizing detection risk. Evaluating across models including $\texttt{Llama}$, $\texttt{Mistral}$, $\texttt{Gemma}$, $\texttt{DeepSeek}$ and other variants on various datasets like $\texttt{JailBreakBench}$ and $\texttt{AdversarialBench}$, our method outperforms conventional attacks by up to $7\times$, exposing critical vulnerabilities in multi-agent systems. Moreover, we demonstrate that existing defenses, including variants of $\texttt{Llama-Guard}$ and $\texttt{PromptGuard}$, fail to prohibit our attack, emphasizing the urgent need for multi-agent specific safety mechanisms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huandong Chang, Zicheng Ma, Mingyuan Ma, Zhenting Qi, Andrew Sabot, Hong Jiang, H. T. Kung</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become a widely adopted technique for fine-tuning large-scale pre-trained models with minimal parameter updates. However, existing methods rely on fixed ranks or focus solely on either rank pruning or expansion, failing to adapt ranks dynamically to match the importance of different layers during training. In this work, we propose ElaLoRA, an adaptive low-rank adaptation framework that dynamically prunes and expands ranks based on gradient-derived importance scores. To the best of our knowledge, ElaLoRA is the first method that enables both rank pruning and expansion during fine-tuning. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that ElaLoRA consistently outperforms existing PEFT methods across different parameter budgets. Furthermore, our studies validate that layers receiving higher rank allocations contribute more significantly to model performance, providing theoretical justification for our adaptive strategy. By introducing a principled and adaptive rank allocation mechanism, ElaLoRA offers a scalable and efficient fine-tuning solution, particularly suited for resource-constrained environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Inference-time scaling can enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) on complex problems that benefit from step-by-step problem solving. Although lengthening generated scratchpads has proven effective for mathematical tasks, the broader impact of this approach on other tasks remains less clear. In this work, we investigate the benefits and limitations of scaling methods across nine state-of-the-art models and eight challenging tasks, including math and STEM reasoning, calendar planning, NP-hard problems, navigation, and spatial reasoning. We compare conventional models (e.g., GPT-4o) with models fine-tuned for inference-time scaling (e.g., o1) through evaluation protocols that involve repeated model calls, either independently or sequentially with feedback. These evaluations approximate lower and upper performance bounds and potential for future performance improvements for each model, whether through enhanced training or multi-model inference systems. Our extensive empirical analysis reveals that the advantages of inference-time scaling vary across tasks and diminish as problem complexity increases. In addition, simply using more tokens does not necessarily translate to higher accuracy in these challenging regimes. Results from multiple independent runs with conventional models using perfect verifiers show that, for some tasks, these models can achieve performance close to the average performance of today's most advanced reasoning models. However, for other tasks, a significant performance gap remains, even in very high scaling regimes. Encouragingly, all models demonstrate significant gains when inference is further scaled with perfect verifiers or strong feedback, suggesting ample potential for future improvements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jie Ma, Zhitao Gao, Qi Chai, Jun Liu, Pinghui Wang, Jing Tao, Zhou Su</p>
<p>Abstract: Audio-Visual Question Answering (AVQA) is a challenging multimodal reasoning task requiring intelligent systems to answer natural language queries based on paired audio-video inputs accurately. However, existing AVQA approaches often suffer from overfitting to dataset biases, leading to poor robustness. Moreover, current datasets may not effectively diagnose these methods. To address these challenges, we first introduce a novel dataset, FortisAVQA, constructed in two stages: (1) rephrasing questions in the test split of the public MUSIC-AVQA dataset and (2) introducing distribution shifts across questions. The first stage expands the test space with greater diversity, while the second enables a refined robustness evaluation across rare, frequent, and overall question distributions. Second, we introduce a robust Multimodal Audio-Visual Epistemic Network (MAVEN) that leverages a multifaceted cycle collaborative debiasing strategy to mitigate bias learning. Experimental results demonstrate that our architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance on FortisAVQA, with a notable improvement of 7.81\%. Extensive ablation studies on both datasets validate the effectiveness of our debiasing components. Additionally, our evaluation reveals the limited robustness of existing multimodal QA methods. We also verify the plug-and-play capability of our strategy by integrating it with various baseline models across both datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qianhao Yuan, Qingyu Zhang, Yanjiang Liu, Jiawei Chen, Yaojie Lu, Hongyu Lin, Jia Zheng, Xianpei Han, Le Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) suffer from high computational costs due to their massive size and the large number of visual tokens. In this paper, we investigate layer-wise redundancy in MLLMs by introducing a novel metric, Layer Contribution (LC), which quantifies the impact of a layer's transformations on visual and text tokens, respectively. The calculation of LC involves measuring the divergence in model output that results from removing the layer's transformations on the specified tokens. Our pilot experiment reveals that many layers of MLLMs exhibit minimal contribution during the processing of visual tokens. Motivated by this observation, we propose ShortV, a training-free method that leverages LC to identify ineffective layers, and freezes visual token updates in these layers. Experiments show that ShortV can freeze visual token in approximately 60\% of the MLLM layers, thereby dramatically reducing computational costs related to updating visual tokens. For example, it achieves a 50\% reduction in FLOPs on LLaVA-NeXT-13B while maintaining superior performance. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/icip-cas/ShortV</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid escalation from elementary school-level to frontier problems of the difficulty for LLM benchmarks in recent years have weaved a miracle for researchers that we are only inches away from surpassing human intelligence. However, is the LLMs' remarkable reasoning ability indeed comes from true intelligence by human standards, or are they simply reciting solutions witnessed during training at an Internet level? To study this problem, we propose RoR-Bench, a novel, multi-modal benchmark for detecting LLM's recitation behavior when asked simple reasoning problems but with conditions subtly shifted, and conduct empirical analysis on our benchmark. Surprisingly, we found existing cutting-edge LLMs unanimously exhibits extremely severe recitation behavior; by changing one phrase in the condition, top models such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1 can suffer $60\%$ performance loss on elementary school-level arithmetic and reasoning problems. Such findings are a wake-up call to the LLM community that compels us to re-evaluate the true intelligence level of cutting-edge LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized code generation, significantly enhancing developer productivity. However, for a vast number of users with minimal coding knowledge, LLMs provide little support, as they primarily generate isolated code snippets rather than complete, large-scale project code. Without coding expertise, these users struggle to interpret, modify, and iteratively refine the outputs of LLMs, making it impossible to assemble a complete project. To address this issue, we propose Self-Rectified Large-Scale Code Generator (SRLCG), a framework that generates complete multi-file project code from a single prompt. SRLCG employs a novel multidimensional chain-of-thought (CoT) and self-rectification to guide LLMs in generating correct and robust code files, then integrates them into a complete and coherent project using our proposed dynamic backtracking algorithm. Experimental results show that SRLCG generates code 15x longer than DeepSeek-V3, 16x longer than GPT-4, and at least 10x longer than other leading CoT-based baselines. Furthermore, they confirm its improved correctness, robustness, and performance compared to baselines in large-scale code generation.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has catalyzed the development of multi-agent systems, where multiple LLM-based agents collaborate to solve complex tasks. However, existing systems predominantly rely on centralized coordination, which introduces scalability bottlenecks, limits adaptability, and creates single points of failure. Additionally, concerns over privacy and proprietary knowledge sharing hinder cross-organizational collaboration, leading to siloed expertise. To address these challenges, we propose AgentNet, a decentralized, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based framework that enables LLM-based agents to autonomously evolve their capabilities and collaborate efficiently in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-structured network. Unlike traditional multi-agent systems that depend on static role assignments or centralized control, AgentNet allows agents to specialize dynamically, adjust their connectivity, and route tasks without relying on predefined workflows. AgentNet's core design is built upon several key innovations: (1) Fully Decentralized Paradigm: Removing the central orchestrator, allowing agents to coordinate and specialize autonomously, fostering fault tolerance and emergent collective intelligence. (2) Dynamically Evolving Graph Topology: Real-time adaptation of agent connections based on task demands, ensuring scalability and resilience.(3) Adaptive Learning for Expertise Refinement: A retrieval-based memory system that enables agents to continuously update and refine their specialized skills. By eliminating centralized control, AgentNet enhances fault tolerance, promotes scalable specialization, and enables privacy-preserving collaboration across organizations. Through decentralized coordination and minimal data exchange, agents can leverage diverse knowledge sources while safeguarding sensitive information.</p>

<p>Abstract: While football analytics has changed the way teams and analysts assess performance, there remains a communication gap between machine learning practice and how coaching staff talk about football. Coaches and practitioners require actionable insights, which are not always provided by models. To bridge this gap, we show how to build wordalizations (a novel approach that leverages large language models) for shots in football. Specifically, we first build an expected goals model using logistic regression. We then use the co-efficients of this regression model to write sentences describing how factors (such as distance, angle and defensive pressure) contribute to the model's prediction. Finally, we use large language models to give an entertaining description of the shot. We describe our approach in a model card and provide an interactive open-source application describing shots in recent tournaments. We discuss how shot wordalisations might aid communication in coaching and football commentary, and give a further example of how the same approach can be applied to other actions in football.</p>

<p>Abstract: Dialect translation plays a key role in enabling seamless interaction across heterogeneous database systems. However, translating SQL queries between different dialects (e.g., from PostgreSQL to MySQL) remains a challenging task due to syntactic discrepancies and subtle semantic variations. Existing approaches including manual rewriting, rule-based systems, and large language model (LLM)-based techniques often involve high maintenance effort (e.g., crafting custom translation rules) or produce unreliable results (e.g., LLM generates non-existent functions), especially when handling complex queries. In this demonstration, we present CrackSQL, the first hybrid SQL dialect translation system that combines rule and LLM-based methods to overcome these limitations. CrackSQL leverages the adaptability of LLMs to minimize manual intervention, while enhancing translation accuracy by segmenting lengthy complex SQL via functionality-based query processing. To further improve robustness, it incorporates a novel cross-dialect syntax embedding model for precise syntax alignment, as well as an adaptive local-to-global translation strategy that effectively resolves interdependent query operations. CrackSQL supports three translation modes and offers multiple deployment and access options including a web console interface, a PyPI package, and a command-line prompt, facilitating adoption across a variety of real-world use cases</p>

<p>Abstract: Computer use agents automate digital tasks by directly interacting with graphical user interfaces (GUIs) on computers and mobile devices, offering significant potential to enhance human productivity by completing an open-ended space of user queries. However, current agents face significant challenges: imprecise grounding of GUI elements, difficulties with long-horizon task planning, and performance bottlenecks from relying on single generalist models for diverse cognitive tasks. To this end, we introduce Agent S2, a novel compositional framework that delegates cognitive responsibilities across various generalist and specialist models. We propose a novel Mixture-of-Grounding technique to achieve precise GUI localization and introduce Proactive Hierarchical Planning, dynamically refining action plans at multiple temporal scales in response to evolving observations. Evaluations demonstrate that Agent S2 establishes new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on three prominent computer use benchmarks. Specifically, Agent S2 achieves 18.9% and 32.7% relative improvements over leading baseline agents such as Claude Computer Use and UI-TARS on the OSWorld 15-step and 50-step evaluation. Moreover, Agent S2 generalizes effectively to other operating systems and applications, surpassing previous best methods by 52.8% on WindowsAgentArena and by 16.52% on AndroidWorld relatively.

<p>Abstract: We present the challenging task of automatically creating a high-level Wikipedia-style article that aggregates information from multiple diverse videos about real-world events, such as natural disasters or political elections. Videos are intuitive sources for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), but most contemporary RAG workflows focus heavily on text and existing methods for video-based summarization focus on low-level scene understanding rather than high-level event semantics. To close this gap, we introduce WikiVideo, a benchmark consisting of expert-written articles and densely annotated videos that provide evidence for articles' claims, facilitating the integration of video into RAG pipelines and enabling the creation of in-depth content that is grounded in multimodal sources. We further propose Collaborative Article Generation (CAG), a novel interactive method for article creation from multiple videos. CAG leverages an iterative interaction between an r1-style reasoning model and a VideoLLM to draw higher level inferences about the target event than is possible with VideoLLMs alone, which fixate on low-level visual features. We benchmark state-of-the-art VideoLLMs and CAG in both oracle retrieval and RAG settings and find that CAG consistently outperforms alternative methods, while suggesting intriguing avenues for future work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiatong Li, Wei Liu, Zhihao Ding, Wenqi Fan, Yuqiang Li, Qing Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in biochemical tasks, especially the molecule caption translation task, which aims to bridge the gap between molecules and natural language texts. However, previous methods in adapting LLMs to the molecule-caption translation task required extra domain-specific pre-training stages, suffered weak alignment between molecular and textual spaces, or imposed stringent demands on the scale of LLMs. To resolve the challenges, we propose In-Context Molecule Adaptation (ICMA), as a new paradigm allowing LLMs to learn the molecule-text alignment from context examples via In-Context Molecule Tuning. Specifically, ICMA incorporates the following three stages: Hybrid Context Retrieval, Post-retrieval Re-ranking, and In-context Molecule Tuning. Initially, Hybrid Context Retrieval utilizes BM25 Caption Retrieval and Molecule Graph Retrieval to retrieve similar informative context examples. Additionally, Post-retrieval Re-ranking is composed of Sequence Reversal and Random Walk selection to further improve the quality of retrieval results. Finally, In-Context Molecule Tuning unlocks the in-context learning and reasoning capability of LLMs with the retrieved examples and adapts the parameters of LLMs for better alignment between molecules and texts. Experimental results demonstrate that ICMA can empower LLMs to achieve state-of-the-art or comparable performance without extra training corpora and intricate structures, showing that LLMs are inherently in-context molecule learners.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingchen Li, Jiatan Huang, Jeremy Yeung, Anne Blaes, Steven Johnson, Hongfang Liu, Hua Xu, Rui Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on a wide variety of medical NLP tasks; however, there still lacks a LLM specifically designed for phenotyping identification and diagnosis in cancer domain. Moreover, these LLMs typically have several billions of parameters, making them computationally expensive for healthcare systems. Thus, in this study, we propose CancerLLM, a model with 7 billion parameters and a Mistral-style architecture, pre-trained on nearly 2.7M clinical notes and over 515K pathology reports covering 17 cancer types, followed by fine-tuning on two cancer-relevant tasks, including cancer phenotypes extraction and cancer diagnosis generation. Our evaluation demonstrated that the CancerLLM achieves state-of-the-art results with F1 score of 91.78% on phenotyping extraction and 86.81% on disganois generation. It outperformed existing LLMs, with an average F1 score improvement of 9.23%. Additionally, the CancerLLM demonstrated its efficiency on time and GPU usage, and robustness comparing with other LLMs. We demonstrated that CancerLLM can potentially provide an effective and robust solution to advance clinical research and practice in cancer domain</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Meiling Tao, Xuechen Liang, Ziyi Wang, Yiling Tao, Tianyu Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have unlocked the potential for generating high-quality game commentary. However, producing insightful and engaging commentary for complex games with incomplete information remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we introduce a novel commentary method that combine Reinforcement Learning (RL) and LLMs, tailored specifically for the Chinese card game \textit{Guandan}. Our system leverages RL to generate intricate card-playing scenarios and employs LLMs to generate corresponding commentary text, effectively emulating the strategic analysis and narrative prowess of professional commentators. The framework comprises a state commentary guide, a Theory of Mind (ToM)-based strategy analyzer, and a style retrieval module, which seamlessly collaborate to deliver detailed and context-relevant game commentary in the Chinese language environment. We empower LLMs with ToM capabilities and refine both retrieval and information filtering mechanisms. This facilitates the generation of personalized commentary content. Our experimental results showcase the substantial enhancement in performance achieved by the proposed commentary framework when applied to open-source LLMs, surpassing the performance of GPT-4 across multiple evaluation metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziqi Wang, Hanlin Zhang, Xiner Li, Kuan-Hao Huang, Chi Han, Shuiwang Ji, Sham M. Kakade, Hao Peng, Heng Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: Position bias has proven to be a prevalent issue of modern language models (LMs), where the models prioritize content based on its position within the given context. This bias often leads to unexpected model failures and hurts performance, robustness, and reliability across various applications. Our mechanistic analysis attributes the position bias to two components employed in nearly all state-of-the-art LMs: causal attention and relative positional encodings. Based on the analyses, we propose to eliminate position bias (e.g., different retrieved documents' orders in QA affect performance) with a training-free zero-shot approach. Our method changes the causal attention to bidirectional attention between documents and utilizes model attention values to decide the relative orders of documents instead of using the order provided in input prompts, therefore enabling Position-INvariant inferencE (PINE) at the document level. By eliminating position bias, models achieve better performance and reliability in downstream tasks, including LM-as-a-judge, retrieval-augmented QA, molecule generation, and math reasoning. Notably, PINE is especially useful when adapting LMs for evaluating reasoning pairs: it consistently provides 8 to 10 percentage points performance gains, making Llama-3-70B-Instruct perform even better than GPT-4-0125-preview and GPT-4o-2024-08-06 on the RewardBench reasoning set.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongjian Tang, Rakebul Hasan, Thomas Runkler</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have provided a new pathway for Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks. Compared with fine-tuning, LLM-powered prompting methods avoid the need for training, conserve substantial computational resources, and rely on minimal annotated data. Previous studies have achieved comparable performance to fully supervised BERT-based fine-tuning approaches on general NER benchmarks. However, none of the previous approaches has investigated the efficiency of LLM-based few-shot learning in domain-specific scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce FsPONER, a novel approach for optimizing few-shot prompts, and evaluate its performance on domain-specific NER datasets, with a focus on industrial manufacturing and maintenance, while using multiple LLMs -- GPT-4-32K, GPT-3.5-Turbo, LLaMA 2-chat, and Vicuna. FsPONER consists of three few-shot selection methods based on random sampling, TF-IDF vectors, and a combination of both. We compare these methods with a general-purpose GPT-NER method as the number of few-shot examples increases and evaluate their optimal NER performance against fine-tuned BERT and LLaMA 2-chat. In the considered real-world scenarios with data scarcity, FsPONER with TF-IDF surpasses fine-tuned models by approximately 10% in F1 score.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present a novel approach to data preparation for developing multilingual Indic large language model. Our meticulous data acquisition spans open-source and proprietary sources, including Common Crawl, Indic books, news articles, and Wikipedia, ensuring a diverse and rich linguistic representation. For each Indic language, we design a custom preprocessing pipeline to effectively eliminate redundant and low-quality text content. Additionally, we perform deduplication on Common Crawl data to address the redundancy present in 70% of the crawled web pages. This study focuses on developing high-quality data, optimizing tokenization for our multilingual dataset for Indic large language models with 3B and 7B parameters, engineered for superior performance in Indic languages.

<p>Abstract: LLM (large language model) practitioners commonly notice that outputs can vary for the same inputs under settings expected to be deterministic. Yet the questions of how pervasive this is, and with what impact on results, have not to our knowledge been systematically investigated. We investigate non-determinism in five LLMs configured to be deterministic when applied to eight common tasks in across 10 runs, in both zero-shot and few-shot settings. We see accuracy variations up to 15% across naturally occurring runs with a gap of best possible performance to worst possible performance up to 70%. In fact, none of the LLMs consistently delivers repeatable accuracy across all tasks, much less identical output strings. Sharing preliminary results with insiders has revealed that non-determinism perhaps essential to the efficient use of compute resources via co-mingled data in input buffers so this issue is not going away anytime soon. To better quantify our observations, we introduce metrics focused on quantifying determinism, TARr@N for the total agreement rate at N runs over raw output, and TARa@N for total agreement rate of parsed-out answers.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weichao Zhang, Ruqing Zhang, Jiafeng Guo, Maarten de Rijke, Yixing Fan, Xueqi Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: As the scale of training corpora for large language models (LLMs) grows, model developers become increasingly reluctant to disclose details on their data. This lack of transparency poses challenges to scientific evaluation and ethical deployment. Recently, pretraining data detection approaches, which infer whether a given text was part of an LLM's training data through black-box access, have been explored. The Min-K\% Prob method, which has achieved state-of-the-art results, assumes that a non-training example tends to contain a few outlier words with low token probabilities. However, the effectiveness may be limited as it tends to misclassify non-training texts that contain many common words with high probabilities predicted by LLMs. To address this issue, we introduce a divergence-based calibration method, inspired by the divergence-from-randomness concept, to calibrate token probabilities for pretraining data detection. We compute the cross-entropy (i.e., the divergence) between the token probability distribution and the token frequency distribution to derive a detection score. We have developed a Chinese-language benchmark, PatentMIA, to assess the performance of detection approaches for LLMs on Chinese text. Experimental results on English-language benchmarks and PatentMIA demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms existing methods. Our code and PatentMIA benchmark are available at https://github.com/zhang-wei-chao/DC-PDD.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Creston Brooks, Johannes Haubold, Charlie Cowen-Breen, Jay White, Desmond DeVaul, Frederick Riemenschneider, Karthik Narasimhan, Barbara Graziosi</p>
<p>Abstract: As premodern texts are passed down over centuries, errors inevitably accrue. These errors can be challenging to identify, as some have survived undetected for so long precisely because they are so elusive. While prior work has evaluated error detection methods on artificially-generated errors, we introduce the first dataset of real errors in premodern Greek, enabling the evaluation of error detection methods on errors that genuinely accumulated at some stage in the centuries-long copying process. To create this dataset, we use metrics derived from BERT conditionals to sample 1,000 words more likely to contain errors, which are then annotated and labeled by a domain expert as errors or not. We then propose and evaluate new error detection methods and find that our discriminator-based detector outperforms all other methods, improving the true positive rate for classifying real errors by 5%. We additionally observe that scribal errors are more difficult to detect than print or digitization errors. Our dataset enables the evaluation of error detection methods on real errors in premodern texts for the first time, providing a benchmark for developing more effective error detection algorithms to assist scholars in restoring premodern works.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rajkumar Pujari, Dan Goldwasser</p>
<p>Abstract: Conversations often adhere to well-understood social norms that vary across cultures. For example, while "addressing parents by name" is commonplace in the West, it is rare in most Asian cultures. Adherence or violation of such norms often dictates the tenor of conversations. Humans are able to navigate social situations requiring cultural awareness quite adeptly. However, it is a hard task for NLP models.
  In this paper, we tackle this problem by introducing a "Cultural Context Schema" for conversations. It comprises (1) conversational information such as emotions, dialogue acts, etc., and (2) cultural information such as social norms, violations, etc. We generate ~110k social norm and violation descriptions for ~23k conversations from Chinese culture using LLMs. We refine them using automated verification strategies which are evaluated against culturally aware human judgements. We organize these descriptions into meaningful structures we call "Norm Concepts", using an interactive human-in-loop framework. We ground the norm concepts and the descriptions in conversations using symbolic annotation. Finally, we use the obtained dataset for downstream tasks such as emotion, sentiment, and dialogue act detection. We show that it significantly improves the empirical performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samarth Garg, Vivek Hruday Kavuri, Gargi Shroff, Rahul Mishra</p>
<p>Abstract: The constant shifts in social and political contexts, driven by emerging social movements and political events, lead to new forms of hate content and previously unrecognized hate patterns that machine learning models may not have captured. Some recent literature proposes data augmentation-based techniques to enrich existing hate datasets by incorporating samples that reveal new implicit hate patterns. This approach aims to improve the model's performance on out-of-domain implicit hate instances. It is observed, that further addition of more samples for augmentation results in the decrease of the performance of the model. In this work, we propose a Knowledge Transfer-driven Concept Refinement method that distills and refines the concepts related to implicit hate samples through novel prototype alignment and concept losses, alongside data augmentation based on concept activation vectors. Experiments with several publicly available datasets show that incorporating additional implicit samples reflecting new hate patterns through concept refinement enhances the model's performance, surpassing baseline results while maintaining cross-dataset generalization capabilities.</p>

<p>Abstract: An ecosystem of Transformer-based models has been established by building large models with extensive data. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) is a crucial technology for deploying these models to downstream tasks with minimal cost while achieving effective performance. Recently, Mamba, a State Space Model (SSM)-based model, has attracted attention as a potential alternative to Transformers. While many large-scale Mamba-based models have been proposed, efficiently adapting pre-trained Mamba-based models to downstream tasks remains unexplored. In this paper, we conduct an exploratory analysis of PEFT methods for Mamba. We investigate the effectiveness of existing PEFT methods for Transformers when applied to Mamba. We also modify these methods to better align with the Mamba architecture. Additionally, we propose new Mamba-specific PEFT methods that leverage the distinctive structure of Mamba. Our experiments indicate that PEFT performs more effectively for Mamba than Transformers. Lastly, we demonstrate how to effectively combine multiple PEFT methods and provide a framework that outperforms previous works. To ensure reproducibility, we will release the code after publication.</p>

<p>Abstract: Low-resource machine translation (MT) presents a diversity of community needs and application challenges that remain poorly understood. To complement surveys and focus groups, which tend to rely on small samples of respondents, we propose an observational study on actual usage patterns of tetun.org, a specialized MT service for the Tetun language, which is the lingua franca in Timor-Leste. Our analysis of 100,000 translation requests reveals patterns that challenge assumptions based on existing corpora. We find that users, many of them students on mobile devices, typically translate text from a high-resource language into Tetun across diverse domains including science, healthcare, and daily life. This contrasts sharply with available Tetun corpora, which are dominated by news articles covering government and social issues. Our results suggest that MT systems for institutionalized minority languages like Tetun should prioritize accuracy on domains relevant to educational contexts, in the high-resource to low-resource direction.More broadly, this study demonstrates how observational analysis can inform low-resource language technology development, by grounding research in practical community needs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenni Bi, Kai Han, Chuanjian Liu, Yehui Tang, Yunhe Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities across various language tasks, but solving complex reasoning problems remains a significant challenge. While existing methods, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT), enhance reasoning by decomposing problems or structuring prompts, they typically perform a single pass of reasoning and may fail to revisit flawed paths, compromising accuracy. To address this limitation, we propose a novel reasoning framework called Forest-of-Thought (FoT), which integrates multiple reasoning trees to leverage collective decision-making for solving complex logical problems. FoT employs sparse activation strategies to select the most relevant reasoning paths, improving both efficiency and accuracy. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic self-correction strategy that enables real-time error correction, along with consensus-guided decision-making strategies to optimize both correctness and computational resources. Experimental results demonstrate that the FoT framework, combined with these strategies, significantly enhances the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, enabling them to solve complex tasks with greater precision and efficiency.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sepideh Mamooler, Syrielle Montariol, Alexander Mathis, Antoine Bosselut</p>
<p>Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform tasks using few demonstrations, facilitating task adaptation when labeled examples are hard to obtain. However, ICL is sensitive to the choice of demonstrations, and it remains unclear which demonstration attributes enable in-context generalization. In this work, we conduct a perturbation study of in-context demonstrations for low-resource Named Entity Detection (NED). Our surprising finding is that in-context demonstrations with partially correct annotated entity mentions can be as effective for task transfer as fully correct demonstrations. Based off our findings, we propose Pseudo-annotated In-Context Learning (PICLe), a framework for in-context learning with noisy, pseudo-annotated demonstrations. PICLe leverages LLMs to annotate many demonstrations in a zero-shot first pass. We then cluster these synthetic demonstrations, sample specific sets of in-context demonstrations from each cluster, and predict entity mentions using each set independently. Finally, we use self-verification to select the final set of entity mentions. We evaluate PICLe on five biomedical NED datasets and show that, with zero human annotation, PICLe outperforms ICL in low-resource settings where limited gold examples can be used as in-context demonstrations.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose Text-based Open Molecule Generation Benchmark (TOMG-Bench), the first benchmark to evaluate the open-domain molecule generation capability of LLMs. TOMG-Bench encompasses a dataset of three major tasks: molecule editing (MolEdit), molecule optimization (MolOpt), and customized molecule generation (MolCustom). Each major task further contains three subtasks, while each subtask comprises 5,000 test samples. Given the inherent complexity of open molecule generation evaluation, we also developed an automated evaluation system that helps measure both the quality and the accuracy of the generated molecules. Our comprehensive benchmarking of 25 LLMs reveals the current limitations as well as potential areas for improvement in text-guided molecule discovery. Furthermore, we propose OpenMolIns, a specialized instruction tuning dataset established for solving challenges raised by TOMG-Bench. Fine-tuned on OpenMolIns, Llama3.1-8B could outperform all the open-source general LLMs, even surpassing GPT-3.5-turbo by 46.5\% on TOMG-Bench.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Felix Friedrich, Simone Tedeschi, Patrick Schramowski, Manuel Brack, Roberto Navigli, Huu Nguyen, Bo Li, Kristian Kersting</p>
<p>Abstract: Building safe Large Language Models (LLMs) across multiple languages is essential in ensuring both safe access and linguistic diversity. To this end, we introduce M-ALERT, a multilingual benchmark that evaluates the safety of LLMs in five languages: English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish. M-ALERT includes 15k high-quality prompts per language, totaling 75k, following the detailed ALERT taxonomy. Our extensive experiments on 10 state-of-the-art LLMs highlight the importance of language-specific safety analysis, revealing that models often exhibit significant inconsistencies in safety across languages and categories. For instance, Llama3.2 shows high unsafety in the category crime_tax for Italian but remains safe in other languages. Similar differences can be observed across all models. In contrast, certain categories, such as substance_cannabis and crime_propaganda, consistently trigger unsafe responses across models and languages. These findings underscore the need for robust multilingual safety practices in LLMs to ensure safe and responsible usage across diverse user communities.</p>

<p>Abstract: Universal Multimodal Retrieval (UMR) aims to enable search across various modalities using a unified model, where queries and candidates can consist of pure text, images, or a combination of both. Previous work has attempted to adopt multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to realize UMR using only text data. However, our preliminary experiments demonstrate that more diverse multimodal training data can further unlock the potential of MLLMs. Despite its effectiveness, the existing multimodal training data is highly imbalanced in terms of modality, which motivates us to develop a training data synthesis pipeline and construct a large-scale, high-quality fused-modal training dataset. Based on the synthetic training data, we develop the General Multimodal Embedder (GME), an MLLM-based dense retriever designed for UMR. Furthermore, we construct a comprehensive UMR Benchmark (UMRB) to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among existing UMR methods. Last, we provide in-depth analyses of model scaling and training strategies, and perform ablation studies on both the model and synthetic data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yewon Hwang, Sungbum Jung, Hanwool Lee, Sara Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain specificity of embedding models is critical for effective performance. However, existing benchmarks, such as FinMTEB, are primarily designed for high-resource languages, leaving low-resource settings, such as Korean, under-explored. Directly translating established English benchmarks often fails to capture the linguistic and cultural nuances present in low-resource domains. In this paper, titled TWICE: What Advantages Can Low-Resource Domain-Specific Embedding Models Bring? A Case Study on Korea Financial Texts, we introduce KorFinMTEB, a novel benchmark for the Korean financial domain, specifically tailored to reflect its unique cultural characteristics in low-resource languages. Our experimental results reveal that while the models perform robustly on a translated version of FinMTEB, their performance on KorFinMTEB uncovers subtle yet critical discrepancies, especially in tasks requiring deeper semantic understanding, that underscore the limitations of direct translation. This discrepancy highlights the necessity of benchmarks that incorporate language-specific idiosyncrasies and cultural nuances. The insights from our study advocate for the development of domain-specific evaluation frameworks that can more accurately assess and drive the progress of embedding models in low-resource settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Wu, Qiuyi Li, Mingyang Li, Kun Fu, Fuli Feng, Jieping Ye, Hui Xiong, Zheng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Advancements in DNA sequencing technologies have significantly improved our ability to decode genomic sequences. However, the prediction and interpretation of these sequences remain challenging due to the intricate nature of genetic material. Large language models (LLMs) have introduced new opportunities for biological sequence analysis. Recent developments in genomic language models have underscored the potential of LLMs in deciphering DNA sequences. Nonetheless, existing models often face limitations in robustness and application scope, primarily due to constraints in model structure and training data scale. To address these limitations, we present GENERator, a generative genomic foundation model featuring a context length of 98k base pairs (bp) and 1.2B parameters. Trained on an expansive dataset comprising 386B bp of eukaryotic DNA, the GENERator demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across both established and newly proposed benchmarks. The model adheres to the central dogma of molecular biology, accurately generating protein-coding sequences that translate into proteins structurally analogous to known families. It also shows significant promise in sequence optimization, particularly through the prompt-responsive generation of enhancer sequences with specific activity profiles. These capabilities position the GENERator as a pivotal tool for genomic research and biotechnological advancement, enhancing our ability to interpret and predict complex biological systems and enabling precise genomic interventions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xianjun Yang, Shaoliang Nie, Lijuan Liu, Suchin Gururangan, Ujjwal Karn, Rui Hou, Madian Khabsa, Yuning Mao</p>
<p>Abstract: Instruction tuning data are often quantity-saturated due to the large volume of data collection and fast model iteration, leaving data selection important but underexplored. Existing quality-driven data selection methods, such as LIMA (NeurIPS 2023 \citep{zhou2024lima}) and AlpaGasus (ICLR 2024 \citep{chenalpagasus}) generally ignore the equal importance of data diversity and complexity. In this work, we aim to design a diversity-aware data selection strategy and creatively propose using sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to tackle the challenge of data diversity measure. In addition, SAEs can also provide more interpretability of model behavior and explain, e.g., the surprising effectiveness of selecting the longest response (ICML 2024 \citep{zhaolong}). Using effective data selection, we experimentally prove that models trained on our selected data can outperform other methods in terms of model capabilities, reduce training cost, and potentially gain more control over model behaviors. We prove that SAEs can serve as a good alternative to diversity measure and design our method to be scalable for potential industrial large-scale pruning, and we will also release our trained SAEs for use by the broader community.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ayeong Lee, Ethan Che, Tianyi Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: Chain-of-thought prompting has emerged as a powerful technique for enabling large language models (LLMs) to solve complex reasoning tasks. However, these reasoning chains can be verbose, raising concerns about efficiency. In response, recent works have sought to decrease response lengths through simple prompting strategies (e.g. 'be concise'). In this work, we conduct the first systematic study of the relationship between reasoning length and model performance across a diverse range of compression instructions (e.g. 'use 10 words or less' or 'remove all punctuation'). In doing so, we discover a universal tradeoff between reasoning length and accuracy that persists across even very distinct reasoning chains. We demonstrate that this tradeoff emerges from a sharp threshold behavior at the question level: each task has an intrinsic 'token complexity' - a minimal number of tokens required for successful problem-solving. We show how token complexity enables us to compute information-theoretic limits on the accuracy-compression tradeoff, and find that prompt-based compression strategies operate far from these theoretical limits. This suggests there may be significant room for improvement and our framework provides a benchmark to help researchers evaluate progress in reasoning efficiency. Our work also highlights the importance of adaptive compression -- giving shorter responses for easier questions -- and we show that token complexity is a useful tool for measuring this capability.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces Light-R1, an open-source suite for training long reasoning models using reproducible and cost-effective methodology. Given the proprietary nature of data used in the DeepSeek-R1 series, we develop an alternative approach leveraging exclusively public data and models. Our curriculum training progressively increases data difficulty, combined with multi-staged post-training. Our Light-R1-32B model, trained from Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, outperforms DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B in math reasoning.
  Experimental results show that this curriculum approach becomes more effective when distinct, diverse datasets are available for different training stages: fine-tuning DeepSeek-R1-Distilled models (pre-tuned by DeepSeek team on proprietary data) with 3,000 challenging examples from our curriculum dataset yielded state-of-the-art 7B and 14B models, while the 32B model, Light-R1-32B-DS performed comparably to QwQ-32B and DeepSeek-R1.
  Furthermore, we extend our work by applying GRPO on long reasoning models. Our final Light-R1-14B-DS achieves SOTA performance among 14B models in math, with AIME24 \& 25 scores of 74.0 and 60.2 respectively, surpassing many 32B models and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B. Despite math-focused training, Light-R1-14B-DS demonstrates strong cross-domain generalization.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sinan Fan, Liang Xie, Chen Shen, Ge Teng, Xiaosong Yuan, Xiaofeng Zhang, Chenxi Huang, Wenxiao Wang, Xiaofei He, Jieping Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Prompt-tuning (PT) for large language models (LLMs) can facilitate the performance on various conventional NLP tasks with significantly fewer trainable parameters. However, our investigation reveals that PT provides limited improvement and may even degrade the primitive performance of LLMs on complex reasoning tasks. Such a phenomenon suggests that soft prompts can positively impact certain instances while negatively affecting others, particularly during the later phases of reasoning. To address these challenges, We first identify an information accumulation within the soft prompts. Through detailed analysis, we demonstrate that this phenomenon is often accompanied by erroneous information flow patterns in the deeper layers of the model, which ultimately lead to incorrect reasoning outcomes. we propose a novel method called Dynamic Prompt Corruption (DPC) to take better advantage of soft prompts in complex reasoning tasks, which dynamically adjusts the influence of soft prompts based on their impact on the reasoning process. Specifically, DPC consists of two stages: Dynamic Trigger and Dynamic Corruption. First, Dynamic Trigger measures the impact of soft prompts, identifying whether beneficial or detrimental. Then, Dynamic Corruption mitigates the negative effects of soft prompts by selectively masking key tokens that interfere with the reasoning process. We validate the proposed approach through extensive experiments on various LLMs and reasoning tasks, including GSM8K, MATH, and AQuA. Experimental results demonstrate that DPC can consistently enhance the performance of PT, achieving 4%-8% accuracy gains compared to vanilla prompt tuning, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach and its potential to enhance complex reasoning in LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pin-Jie Lin, Ernie Chang, Yangyang Shi, Vikas Chandra</p>
<p>Abstract: Past vocabulary learning techniques identify relevant vocabulary before training, relying on statistical and entropy-based assumptions that largely neglect the role of model training. Empirically, we observe that trained translation models are induced to use a byte-pair encoding (BPE) vocabulary subset distinct from the original BPE vocabulary, leading to performance improvements when retrained with the induced vocabulary. In this paper, we analyze this discrepancy in neural machine translation by examining vocabulary and entropy shifts during self-training--where each iteration generates a labeled dataset by pairing source sentences with the model's predictions to define a new vocabulary. Building on these insights, we propose self-vocabularizing training, an iterative method that self-selects a smaller, more optimal vocabulary, yielding up to a 1.49 BLEU improvement. Moreover, we find that deeper model architectures lead to both an increase in unique token usage and a 6-8% reduction in vocabulary size.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet their transition to real-world applications reveals a critical limitation: the inability to adapt to individual preferences while maintaining alignment with universal human values. Current alignment techniques adopt a one-size-fits-all approach that fails to accommodate users' diverse backgrounds and needs. This paper presents the first comprehensive survey of personalized alignment-a paradigm that enables LLMs to adapt their behavior within ethical boundaries based on individual preferences. We propose a unified framework comprising preference memory management, personalized generation, and feedback-based alignment, systematically analyzing implementation approaches and evaluating their effectiveness across various scenarios. By examining current techniques, potential risks, and future challenges, this survey provides a structured foundation for developing more adaptable and ethically-aligned LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: We evaluate the performance of four leading solutions for de-identification of unstructured medical text - Azure Health Data Services, AWS Comprehend Medical, OpenAI GPT-4o, and John Snow Labs - on a ground truth dataset of 48 clinical documents annotated by medical experts. The analysis, conducted at both entity-level and token-level, suggests that John Snow Labs' Medical Language Models solution achieves the highest accuracy, with a 96% F1-score in protected health information (PHI) detection, outperforming Azure (91%), AWS (83%), and GPT-4o (79%). John Snow Labs is not only the only solution which achieves regulatory-grade accuracy (surpassing that of human experts) but is also the most cost-effective solution: It is over 80% cheaper compared to Azure and GPT-4o, and is the only solution not priced by token. Its fixed-cost local deployment model avoids the escalating per-request fees of cloud-based services, making it a scalable and economical choice.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Raman Dutt, Harleen Hanspal, Guoxuan Xia, Petru-Daniel Tudosiu, Alexander Black, Yongxin Yang, Steven McDonagh, Sarah Parisot</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we undertake the challenge of augmenting the existing generative capabilities of pre-trained text-only large language models (LLMs) with multi-modal generation capability while satisfying two core constraints: C1 preserving the preservation of original language generative capabilities with negligible performance degradation, and C2 adhering to a small parameter budget to learn the new modality, ensuring scalability and efficiency. In contrast to current approaches that add dedicated modules, thereby significantly increasing the parameter count, we propose a method that leverages the underutilized capacity inherent in deep models. Specifically, we exploit the parameter redundancy within Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs) as a source of additional capacity for learning a new modality, enabling better parameter efficiency (C1). Moreover, we preserve the original language generation capabilities by applying low-rank adaptation exclusively to the tokens of the new modality (C2). Furthermore, we introduce a novel parameter initialization scheme based on the Gromov-Wasserstein distance to improve convergence and training stability. Through an extensive analysis of the routing mechanism, we uncover the emergence of modality-specific pathways and decreased redundancy within the experts that can efficiently unlock multi-modal generative capabilities. Overall, our method can be seamlessly applied to a wide range of contemporary LLMs, providing a new pathway for transitioning from uni-modal to multi-modal architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenhan Liu, Xinyu Ma, Yutao Zhu, Lixin Su, Shuaiqiang Wang, Dawei Yin, Zhicheng Dou</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated superior listwise ranking performance. However, their superior performance often relies on large-scale parameters (\eg, GPT-4) and a repetitive sliding window process, which introduces significant efficiency challenges. In this paper, we propose \textbf{CoRanking}, a novel collaborative ranking framework that combines small and large ranking models for efficient and effective ranking. CoRanking first employs a small-size reranker to pre-rank all the candidate passages, bringing relevant ones to the top part of the list (\eg, top-20). Then, the LLM listwise reranker is applied to only rerank these top-ranked passages instead of the whole list, substantially enhancing overall ranking efficiency. Although more efficient, previous studies have revealed that the LLM listwise reranker have significant positional biases on the order of input passages. Directly feed the top-ranked passages from small reranker may result in the sub-optimal performance of LLM listwise reranker. To alleviate this problem, we introduce a passage order adjuster trained via reinforcement learning, which reorders the top passages from the small reranker to align with the LLM's preferences of passage order. Extensive experiments on three IR benchmarks demonstrate that CoRanking significantly improves efficiency (reducing ranking latency by about 70\%) while achieving even better effectiveness compared to using only the LLM listwise reranker.</p>

<p>Abstract: The release of advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and Copilot is changing the way text is created and may influence the content that we find on the web. This study investigated whether the release of these two popular LLMs coincided with a change in writing style in headlines and links on worldwide news websites. 175 NLP features were obtained for each text in a dataset of 451 million headlines/links. An interrupted time series analysis was applied for each of the 175 NLP features to evaluate whether there were any statistically significant sustained changes after the release dates of ChatGPT and/or Copilot. There were a total of 44 features that did not appear to have any significant sustained change after the release of ChatGPT/Copilot. A total of 91 other features did show significant change with ChatGPT and/or Copilot although significance with earlier control LLM release dates (GPT-1/2/3, Gopher) removed them from consideration. This initial analysis suggests these language models may have had a limited impact on the style of individual news headlines/links, with respect to only some NLP measures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Su, Dian Yu, Linfeng Song, Juntao Li, Haitao Mi, Zhaopeng Tu, Min Zhang, Dong Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated significant success in enhancing mathematical reasoning and coding performance of large language models (LLMs), especially when structured reference answers are accessible for verification. However, its extension to broader, less structured domains remains unexplored. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness and scalability of RLVR across diverse real-world domains including medicine, chemistry, psychology, economics, and education, where structured reference answers are typically unavailable. We reveal that binary verification judgments on broad-domain tasks exhibit high consistency across various LLMs provided expert-written reference answers exist. Motivated by this finding, we utilize a generative scoring technique that yields soft, model-based reward signals to overcome limitations posed by binary verifications, especially in free-form, unstructured answer scenarios. We further demonstrate the feasibility of training cross-domain generative reward models using relatively small (7B) LLMs without the need for extensive domain-specific annotation. Through comprehensive experiments, our RLVR framework establishes clear performance gains, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art open-source aligned models such as Qwen2.5-72B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B across domains in free-form settings. Our approach notably enhances the robustness, flexibility, and scalability of RLVR, representing a substantial step towards practical reinforcement learning applications in complex, noisy-label scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gergely Flamich, David Vilar, Jan-Thorsten Peter, Markus Freitag</p>
<p>Abstract: The goal of translation, be it by human or by machine, is, given some text in a source language, to produce text in a target language that simultaneously 1) preserves the meaning of the source text and 2) achieves natural expression in the target language. However, researchers in the machine translation community usually assess translations using a single score intended to capture semantic accuracy and the naturalness of the output simultaneously. In this paper, we build on recent advances in information theory to mathematically prove and empirically demonstrate that such single-score summaries do not and cannot give the complete picture of a system's true performance. Concretely, we prove that a tradeoff exists between accuracy and naturalness and demonstrate it by evaluating the submissions to the WMT24 shared task. Our findings help explain well-known empirical phenomena, such as the observation that optimizing translation systems for a specific accuracy metric (like BLEU) initially improves the system's naturalness, while ``overfitting'' the system to the metric can significantly degrade its naturalness. Thus, we advocate for a change in how translations are evaluated: rather than comparing systems using a single number, they should be compared on an accuracy-naturalness plane.</p>

<p>Abstract: The detection of telecom fraud faces significant challenges due to the lack of high-quality multimodal training data that integrates audio signals with reasoning-oriented textual analysis. To address this gap, we present TeleAntiFraud-28k, the first open-source audio-text slow-thinking dataset specifically designed for automated telecom fraud analysis. Our dataset is constructed through three strategies: (1) Privacy-preserved text-truth sample generation using automatically speech recognition (ASR)-transcribed call recordings (with anonymized original audio), ensuring real-world consistency through text-to-speech (TTS) model regeneration; (2) Semantic enhancement via large language model (LLM)-based self-instruction sampling on authentic ASR outputs to expand scenario coverage; (3) Multi-agent adversarial synthesis that simulates emerging fraud tactics through predefined communication scenarios and fraud typologies. The generated dataset contains 28,511 rigorously processed speech-text pairs, complete with detailed annotations for fraud reasoning. The dataset is divided into three tasks: scenario classification, fraud detection, fraud type classification. Furthermore, we construct TeleAntiFraud-Bench, a standardized evaluation benchmark comprising proportionally sampled instances from the dataset, to facilitate systematic testing of model performance on telecom fraud detection tasks. We also contribute a production-optimized supervised fine-tuning (SFT) model trained on hybrid real/synthetic data, while open-sourcing the data processing framework to enable community-driven dataset expansion. This work establishes a foundational framework for multimodal anti-fraud research while addressing critical challenges in data privacy and scenario diversity.

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce CodingTeachLLM, a large language model (LLM) designed for coding teaching. Specially, we aim to enhance the coding ability of LLM and lead it to better teaching mode in education context. Thus, we propose an end-to-end prior-based three-phases supervised fine-tuned model, which is proved more competitive than traditional fine-tuning method. More specifically, our model realizes the structural disassembly and incremental guided output of educational knowledge. To this end, we robustify data classification of three types via a sampler and overlap estimation neural network, and inject the preprocessing datasets into pre-trained model in three batches for LORA fine-tuning. Then, we design a prior module couples system prompt, vector databases, and abstract syntax tree task segmentation. Finally, the compression method and regularization constraint are applied to the prior-based fine-tuned model, followed by text filter at the output end to obtain incremental guided results. Our model represents the first research effort to truly embody the tutor role with the features of abundant educational knowledge, step-by-step incremental guided outputs and non-disclosure of answers. Extensive experiments report that our model also achieves state-of-the-art in code abilities compared to open-source models, reaching an impressive 75.10% on the HumanEval (@pass 1) benchmark. Additionally, our model maintains strong conversational capabilities, with the 13B quantized version achieving scores of 56.34, 50.60, and 45.27 respectively on the MMLU, C-Eval, and AGIEval (5 shot) dialogue evaluation benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Task automation has been greatly empowered by the recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) via Python code, where the tasks ranging from software engineering development to general-purpose reasoning. While current benchmarks have shown that LLMs can solve tasks using programs like human developers, the majority of their evaluations are limited to short and self-contained algorithmic tasks or standalone function calls. Solving challenging and practical tasks requires the capability of utilizing diverse function calls as tools to efficiently implement functionalities like data analysis and web development. In addition, using multiple tools to solve a task needs compositional reasoning by accurately understanding complex instructions. Fulfilling both of these characteristics can pose a great challenge for LLMs.To assess how well LLMs can solve challenging and practical tasks via programs, we introduce BigCodeBench, a benchmark that challenges LLMs to invoke multiple function calls as tools from 139 libraries and 7 domains for 1,140 fine-grained tasks. To evaluate LLMs rigorously, each task encompasses 5.6 test cases with an average branch coverage of 99%. In addition, we propose a natural-language-oriented variant of BigCodeBench, BigCodeBench-Instruct, that automatically transforms the original docstrings into short instructions only with essential information. Our extensive evaluation of 60 LLMs shows that LLMs are not yet capable of following complex instructions to use function calls precisely, with scores up to 60%, significantly lower than the human performance of 97%. The results underscore the need for further advancements in this area.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Melanie Subbiah, Faisal Ladhak, Akankshya Mishra, Griffin Adams, Lydia B. Chilton, Kathleen McKeown</p>
<p>Abstract: Human evaluation has been the gold standard for checking faithfulness in abstractive summarization. However, with a challenging source domain like narrative, multiple annotators can agree a summary is faithful, while missing details that are obvious errors only once pointed out. We therefore introduce a new dataset, STORYSUMM, comprising LLM summaries of short stories with localized faithfulness labels and error explanations. This benchmark is for evaluation methods, testing whether a given method can detect challenging inconsistencies. Using this dataset, we first show that any one human annotation protocol is likely to miss inconsistencies, and we advocate for pursuing a range of methods when establishing ground truth for a summarization dataset. We finally test recent automatic metrics and find that none of them achieve more than 70% balanced accuracy on this task, demonstrating that it is a challenging benchmark for future work in faithfulness evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pranshu Pandya, Vatsal Gupta, Agney S Talwarr, Tushar Kataria, Dan Roth, Vivek Gupta</p>
<p>Abstract: Cognitive textual and visual reasoning tasks, including puzzles, series, and analogies, demand the ability to quickly reason, decipher, and evaluate patterns both textually and spatially. Due to extensive training on vast amounts of human-curated data, LLMs and VLMs excel in common-sense reasoning tasks, however still struggle with more complex reasoning that demands deeper cognitive understanding. We introduce NTSEBench, a new dataset designed to evaluate cognitive multi-modal reasoning and problem-solving skills of large models. The dataset contains 2728 multiple-choice questions, accompanied by a total of 4,642 images, categorized into 26 different types. These questions are drawn from the nationwide NTSE examination in India and feature a mix of visual and textual general aptitude challenges, designed to assess intelligence and critical thinking skills beyond mere rote learning. We establish baselines on the dataset using state-of-the-art LLMs and VLMs. To facilitate a comparison between open source and propriety models, we propose four distinct modeling strategies to handle different modalities -- text and images -- in the dataset instances.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sungmin Cha, Sungjun Cho, Dasol Hwang, Moontae Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning and memorization capabilities via pretraining on massive textual corpora. However, this poses risk of privacy and copyright violations, highlighting the need for efficient machine unlearning methods that remove sensitive data without retraining from scratch. While Gradient Ascent (GA) is commonly used to unlearn by reducing the likelihood of generating unwanted content, it leads to unstable optimization and catastrophic forgetting of retrained knowledge. We find that combining GA with low-rank adaptation results in poor trade-offs between computational cost and generative performance. To address these challenges, we propose Low-rank Knowledge Unlearning (LoKU), a novel framework that enables robust and efficient unlearning for LLMs. First, we introduce Inverted Hinge Loss, which suppresses unwanted tokens while maintaining fluency by boosting the probability of the next most likely token. Second, we develop a data-adaptive initialization for LoRA adapters via low-rank approximation weighted with relative Fisher information, thereby focusing updates on parameters critical for removing targeted knowledge. Experiments on the Training Data Extraction Challenge dataset using GPT-Neo models as well as on the TOFU benchmark with Phi-1.5B and Llama2-7B models demonstrate that our approach effectively removes sensitive information while maintaining reasoning and generative capabilities with minimal impact. Our implementation can be found in https://github.com/csm9493/efficient-llm-unlearning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siyin Wang, Wenyi Yu, Yudong Yang, Changli Tang, Yixuan Li, Jimin Zhuang, Xianzhao Chen, Xiaohai Tian, Jun Zhang, Guangzhi Sun, Lu Lu, Yuxuan Wang, Chao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Speech quality assessment typically requires evaluating audio from multiple aspects, such as mean opinion score (MOS) and speaker similarity (SIM) \etc., which can be challenging to cover using one small model designed for a single task. In this paper, we propose leveraging recently introduced auditory large language models (LLMs) for automatic speech quality assessment. By employing task-specific prompts, auditory LLMs are finetuned to predict MOS, SIM and A/B testing results, which are commonly used for evaluating text-to-speech systems. Additionally, the finetuned auditory LLM is able to generate natural language descriptions assessing aspects like noisiness, distortion, discontinuity, and overall quality, providing more interpretable outputs. Extensive experiments have been performed on the NISQA, BVCC, SOMOS and VoxSim speech quality datasets, using open-source auditory LLMs such as SALMONN, Qwen-Audio, and Qwen2-Audio. For the natural language descriptions task, a commercial model Google Gemini 1.5 Pro is also evaluated. The results demonstrate that auditory LLMs achieve competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art task-specific small models in predicting MOS and SIM, while also delivering promising results in A/B testing and natural language descriptions. Our data processing scripts and finetuned model checkpoints can be found at https://github.com/bytedance/SALMONN.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaming Yang, Dilxat Muhtar, Yelong Shen, Yuefeng Zhan, Jianfeng Liu, Yujing Wang, Hao Sun, Denvy Deng, Feng Sun, Qi Zhang, Weizhu Chen, Yunhai Tong</p>
<p>Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has been widely employed for domain adaptation, with LoRA being one of the most prominent methods due to its simplicity and effectiveness. However, in multi-task learning (MTL) scenarios, LoRA tends to obscure the distinction between tasks by projecting sparse high-dimensional features from different tasks into the same dense low-dimensional intrinsic space. This leads to task interference and suboptimal performance for LoRA and its variants. To tackle this challenge, we propose MTL-LoRA, which retains the advantages of low-rank adaptation while significantly enhancing MTL capabilities. MTL-LoRA augments LoRA by incorporating additional task-adaptive parameters that differentiate task-specific information and capture shared knowledge across various tasks within low-dimensional spaces. This approach enables pre-trained models to jointly adapt to different target domains with a limited number of trainable parameters. Comprehensive experimental results, including evaluations on public academic benchmarks for natural language understanding, commonsense reasoning, and image-text understanding, as well as real-world industrial text Ads relevance datasets, demonstrate that MTL-LoRA outperforms LoRA and its various variants with comparable or even fewer learnable parameters in MTL setting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jun Luo, Chen Chen, Shandong Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated prompt learning benefits federated learning with CLIP-like Vision-Language Model's (VLM's) robust representation learning ability through prompt learning. However, current federated prompt learning methods are habitually restricted to the traditional FL paradigm, where the participating clients are generally only allowed to download a single globally aggregated model from the server. While justifiable for training full-sized models under federated settings, in this work, we argue that this paradigm is ill-suited for lightweight prompts. By facilitating the clients to download multiple pre-aggregated prompts as fixed non-local experts, we propose Personalized Federated Mixture of Adaptive Prompts (pFedMoAP), a novel FL framework that personalizes the prompt learning process through the lens of Mixture of Experts (MoE). pFedMoAP implements a local attention-based gating network that learns to generate enhanced text features for better alignment with local image data, benefiting from both local and downloaded non-local adaptive prompt experts. Extensive experiments on 9 datasets under various federated settings demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed pFedMoAP algorithm. The code is available at https://github.com/ljaiverson/pFedMoAP.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10397">Features that Make a Difference: Leveraging Gradients for Improved Dictionary Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeffrey Olmo, Jared Wilson, Max Forsey, Bryce Hepner, Thomas Vin Howe, David Wingate</p>
<p>Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) are a promising approach for extracting neural network representations by learning a sparse and overcomplete decomposition of the network's internal activations. However, SAEs are traditionally trained considering only activation values and not the effect those activations have on downstream computations. This limits the information available to learn features, and biases the autoencoder towards neglecting features which are represented with small activation values but strongly influence model outputs. To address this, we introduce Gradient SAEs (g-SAEs), which modify the $k$-sparse autoencoder architecture by augmenting the TopK activation function to rely on the gradients of the input activation when selecting the $k$ elements. For a given sparsity level, g-SAEs produce reconstructions that are more faithful to original network performance when propagated through the network. Additionally, we find evidence that g-SAEs learn latents that are on average more effective at steering models in arbitrary contexts. By considering the downstream effects of activations, our approach leverages the dual nature of neural network features as both $\textit{representations}$, retrospectively, and $\textit{actions}$, prospectively. While previous methods have approached the problem of feature discovery primarily focused on the former aspect, g-SAEs represent a step towards accounting for the latter as well.</p>

<p>Abstract: Existing vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP have showcased an impressive capability to generalize well across various downstream tasks. These models leverage the synergy between visual and textual information, enabling them to understand and reason about the content present in images and text in a unified manner. This article provides a brief overview of CLIP based on few-shot prompt learning, including experimental data and technical characteristics of some methods. The purpose of this review is to provide a reference for researchers who have just started their research in generalizable prompting of CLIP through few-shot training for classification across 15 datasets and also to facilitate the integration of this field by researchers in other downstream tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhixuan Lin, Evgenii Nikishin, Xu Owen He, Aaron Courville</p>
<p>Abstract: An essential component of modern recurrent sequence models is the forget gate. While Transformers do not have an explicit recurrent form, we show that a forget gate can be naturally incorporated into Transformers by down-weighting the unnormalized attention scores in a data-dependent way. We name this attention mechanism Forgetting Attention and the resulting model the Forgetting Transformer (FoX). We show that FoX outperforms the Transformer on long-context language modeling, length extrapolation, and short-context downstream tasks, while performing on par with the Transformer on long-context downstream tasks. Moreover, it is compatible with the FlashAttention algorithm and does not require any positional embeddings. Several analyses, including the needle-in-the-haystack test, show that FoX also retains the Transformer's superior long-context capabilities over recurrent sequence models such as Mamba-2, HGRN2, and DeltaNet. We also introduce a "Pro" block design that incorporates some common architectural components in recurrent sequence models and find it significantly improves the performance of both FoX and the Transformer.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jacob Eisenstein, Reza Aghajani, Adam Fisch, Dheeru Dua, Fantine Huot, Mirella Lapata, Vicky Zayats, Jonathan Berant</p>
<p>Abstract: To be helpful assistants, AI agents must be aware of their own capabilities and limitations. This includes knowing when to answer from parametric knowledge versus using tools, when to trust tool outputs, and when to abstain or hedge. Such capabilities are hard to teach through supervised fine-tuning because they require constructing examples that reflect the agent's specific capabilities. We therefore propose a radically new approach to teaching agents what they know: \emph{collaborative self-play}. We construct multi-agent collaborations in which the group is rewarded for collectively arriving at correct answers. The desired meta-knowledge emerges from the incentives built into the structure of the interaction. We focus on small societies of agents that have access to heterogeneous tools (corpus-specific retrieval), and therefore must collaborate to maximize their success while minimizing their effort. Experiments show that group-level rewards for multi-agent communities can induce policies that \emph{transfer} to improve tool use and selective prediction in settings where individual agents are deployed in isolation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sho Sonoda, Kazumi Kasaura, Yuma Mizuno, Kei Tsukamoto, Naoto Onda</p>
<p>Abstract: We formalize the generalization error bound using Rademacher complexity in the Lean 4 theorem prover. Generalization error quantifies the gap between a learning machine's performance on given training data versus unseen test data, and Rademacher complexity serves as an estimate of this error based on the complexity of learning machines, or hypothesis class. Unlike traditional methods such as PAC learning and VC dimension, Rademacher complexity is applicable across diverse machine learning scenarios including deep learning and kernel methods. We formalize key concepts and theorems, including the empirical and population Rademacher complexities, and establish generalization error bounds through formal proofs of McDiarmid's inequality, Hoeffding's lemma, and symmetrization arguments.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper explores a novel perspective to speech quality assessment by leveraging natural language descriptions, offering richer, more nuanced insights than traditional numerical scoring methods. Natural language feedback provides instructive recommendations and detailed evaluations, yet existing datasets lack the comprehensive annotations needed for this approach. To bridge this gap, we introduce QualiSpeech, a comprehensive low-level speech quality assessment dataset encompassing 11 key aspects and detailed natural language comments that include reasoning and contextual insights. Additionally, we propose the QualiSpeech Benchmark to evaluate the low-level speech understanding capabilities of auditory large language models (LLMs). Experimental results demonstrate that finetuned auditory LLMs can reliably generate detailed descriptions of noise and distortion, effectively identifying their types and temporal characteristics. The results further highlight the potential for incorporating reasoning to enhance the accuracy and reliability of quality assessments.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ooha Lakkadi Reddy</p>
<p>Abstract: This thesis employs a hybrid CNN-Transformer architecture, in conjunction with a detailed anthropological framework, to investigate potential historical connections between the visual morphology of the Indus Valley script and pictographic systems of the Tibetan-Yi Corridor. Through an ensemble methodology of three target scripts across 15 independently trained models, we demonstrate that Tibetan-Yi Corridor scripts exhibit approximately six-fold higher visual similarity to the Indus script (61.7%-63.5%) than to the Bronze Age Proto-Cuneiform (10.2%-10.9%) or Proto-Elamite (7.6%-8.7%) systems. Additionally and contrarily to our current understanding of the networks of the Indus Valley Civilization, the Indus script unexpectedly maps closer to Tibetan-Yi Corridor scripts, with a mean cosine similarity of 0.629, than to the aforementioned contemporaneous West Asian signaries, both of which recorded mean cosine similarities of 0.104 and 0.080 despite their close geographic proximity and evident trade relations. Across various dimensionality reduction practices and clustering methodologies, the Indus script consistently clusters closest to Tibetan-Yi Corridor scripts. Our computational results align with qualitative observations of specific pictorial parallels in numeral systems, gender markers, and key iconographic elements; this is further supported by archaeological evidence of sustained contact networks along the ancient Shu-Shendu road in tandem with the Indus Valley Civilization's decline, providing a plausible transmission pathway. While alternative explanations cannot be ruled out, the specificity and consistency of observed similarities challenge conventional narratives of isolated script development and suggest more complex ancient cultural transmission networks between South and East Asia than previously recognized.</p>
