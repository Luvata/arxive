<p><b>Authors:</b> Anwar Said, Obaid Ullah Ahmad, Waseem Abbas, Mudassir Shabbir, Xenofon Koutsoukos</p>
<p>Abstract: Network control theory (NCT) offers a robust analytical framework for understanding the influence of network topology on dynamic behaviors, enabling researchers to decipher how certain patterns of external control measures can steer system dynamics towards desired states. Distinguished from other structure-function methodologies, NCT's predictive capabilities can be coupled with deploying Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which have demonstrated exceptional utility in various network-based learning tasks. However, the performance of GNNs heavily relies on the expressiveness of node features, and the lack of node features can greatly degrade their performance. Furthermore, many real-world systems may lack node-level information, posing a challenge for GNNs.To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel approach, NCT-based Enhanced Feature Augmentation (NCT-EFA), that assimilates average controllability, along with other centrality indices, into the feature augmentation pipeline to enhance GNNs performance. Our evaluation of NCT-EFA, on six benchmark GNN models across two experimental setting. solely employing average controllability and in combination with additional centrality metrics. showcases an improved performance reaching as high as 11%. Our results demonstrate that incorporating NCT into feature enrichment can substantively extend the applicability and heighten the performance of GNNs in scenarios where node-level information is unavailable.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03711">Guidance Design for Escape Flight Vehicle Using Evolution Strategy Enhanced Deep Reinforcement Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiao Hu, Tianshu Wang, Min Gong, Shaoshi Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Guidance commands of flight vehicles are a series of data sets with fixed time intervals, thus guidance design constitutes a sequential decision problem and satisfies the basic conditions for using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). In this paper, we consider the scenario where the escape flight vehicle (EFV) generates guidance commands based on DRL and the pursuit flight vehicle (PFV) generates guidance commands based on the proportional navigation method. For the EFV, the objective of the guidance design entails progressively maximizing the residual velocity, subject to the constraint imposed by the given evasion distance. Thus an irregular dynamic max-min problem of extremely large-scale is formulated, where the time instant when the optimal solution can be attained is uncertain and the optimum solution depends on all the intermediate guidance commands generated before. For solving this problem, a two-step strategy is conceived. In the first step, we use the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm to generate the guidance commands of the EFV. The results obtained by PPO in the global search space are coarse, despite the fact that the reward function, the neural network parameters and the learning rate are designed elaborately. Therefore, in the second step, we propose to invoke the evolution strategy (ES) based algorithm, which uses the result of PPO as the initial value, to further improve the quality of the solution by searching in the local space. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed guidance design method based on the PPO algorithm is capable of achieving a residual velocity of 67.24 m/s, higher than the residual velocities achieved by the benchmark soft actor-critic and deep deterministic policy gradient algorithms. Furthermore, the proposed ES-enhanced PPO algorithm outperforms the PPO algorithm by 2.7\%, achieving a residual velocity of 69.04 m/s.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03712">Your Network May Need to Be Rewritten: Network Adversarial Based on High-Dimensional Function Graph Decomposition</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyan Su, Yinghao Zhu, Run Li</p>
<p>Abstract: In the past, research on a single low dimensional activation function in networks has led to internal covariate shift and gradient deviation problems. A relatively small research area is how to use function combinations to provide property completion for a single activation function application. We propose a network adversarial method to address the aforementioned challenges. This is the first method to use different activation functions in a network. Based on the existing activation functions in the current network, an adversarial function with opposite derivative image properties is constructed, and the two are alternately used as activation functions for different network layers. For complex situations, we propose a method of high-dimensional function graph decomposition(HD-FGD), which divides it into different parts and then passes through a linear layer. After integrating the inverse of the partial derivatives of each decomposed term, we obtain its adversarial function by referring to the computational rules of the decomposition process. The use of network adversarial methods or the use of HD-FGD alone can effectively replace the traditional MLP+activation function mode. Through the above methods, we have achieved a substantial improvement over standard activation functions regarding both training efficiency and predictive accuracy. The article addresses the adversarial issues associated with several prevalent activation functions, presenting alternatives that can be seamlessly integrated into existing models without any adverse effects. We will release the code as open source after the conference review process is completed.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siddhant Kharbanda, Devaansh Gupta, Gururaj K, Pankaj Malhotra, Cho-Jui Hsieh, Rohit Babbar</p>
<p>Abstract: Extreme Multi-label Classification (XMC) involves predicting a subset of relevant labels from an extremely large label space, given an input query and labels with textual features. Models developed for this problem have conventionally used modular approach with (i) a Dual Encoder (DE) to embed the queries and label texts, (ii) a One-vs-All classifier to rerank the shortlisted labels mined through meta-classifier training. While such methods have shown empirical success, we observe two key uncharted aspects, (i) DE training typically uses only a single positive relation even for datasets which offer more, (ii) existing approaches fixate on using only OvA reduction of the multi-label problem. This work aims to explore these aspects by proposing UniDEC, a novel end-to-end trainable framework which trains the dual encoder and classifier in together in a unified fashion using a multi-class loss. For the choice of multi-class loss, the work proposes a novel pick-some-label (PSL) reduction of the multi-label problem with leverages multiple (in come cases, all) positives. The proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art results on a single GPU, while achieving on par results with respect to multi-GPU SOTA methods on various XML benchmark datasets, all while using 4-16x lesser compute and being practically scalable even beyond million label scale datasets.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03718">A Single Online Agent Can Efficiently Learn Mean Field Games</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenyu Zhang, Xu Chen, Xuan Di</p>
<p>Abstract: Mean field games (MFGs) are a promising framework for modeling the behavior of large-population systems. However, solving MFGs can be challenging due to the coupling of forward population evolution and backward agent dynamics. Typically, obtaining mean field Nash equilibria (MFNE) involves an iterative approach where the forward and backward processes are solved alternately, known as fixed-point iteration (FPI). This method requires fully observed population propagation and agent dynamics over the entire spatial domain, which could be impractical in some real-world scenarios. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces a novel online single-agent model-free learning scheme, which enables a single agent to learn MFNE using online samples, without prior knowledge of the state-action space, reward function, or transition dynamics. Specifically, the agent updates its policy through the value function (Q), while simultaneously evaluating the mean field state (M), using the same batch of observations. We develop two variants of this learning scheme: off-policy and on-policy QM iteration. We prove that they efficiently approximate FPI, and a sample complexity guarantee is provided. The efficacy of our methods is confirmed by numerical experiments.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03723">Generative adversarial learning with optimal input dimension and its adaptive generator architecture</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyao Tan, Ling Zhou, Huazhen Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigate the impact of the input dimension on the generalization error in generative adversarial networks (GANs). In particular, we first provide both theoretical and practical evidence to validate the existence of an optimal input dimension (OID) that minimizes the generalization error. Then, to identify the OID, we introduce a novel framework called generalized GANs (G-GANs), which includes existing GANs as a special case. By incorporating the group penalty and the architecture penalty developed in the paper, G-GANs have several intriguing features. First, our framework offers adaptive dimensionality reduction from the initial dimension to a dimension necessary for generating the target distribution. Second, this reduction in dimensionality also shrinks the required size of the generator network architecture, which is automatically identified by the proposed architecture penalty. Both reductions in dimensionality and the generator network significantly improve the stability and the accuracy of the estimation and prediction. Theoretical support for the consistent selection of the input dimension and the generator network is provided. Third, the proposed algorithm involves an end-to-end training process, and the algorithm allows for dynamic adjustments between the input dimension and the generator network during training, further enhancing the overall performance of G-GANs. Extensive experiments conducted with simulated and benchmark data demonstrate the superior performance of G-GANs. In particular, compared to that of off-the-shelf methods, G-GANs achieves an average improvement of 45.68% in the CT slice dataset, 43.22% in the MNIST dataset and 46.94% in the FashionMNIST dataset in terms of the maximum mean discrepancy or Frechet inception distance. Moreover, the features generated based on the input dimensions identified by G-GANs align with visually significant features.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03730">Tilt your Head: Activating the Hidden Spatial-Invariance of Classifiers</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Johann Schmidt, Sebastian Stober</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks are applied in more and more areas of everyday life. However, they still lack essential abilities, such as robustly dealing with spatially transformed input signals. Approaches to mitigate this severe robustness issue are limited to two pathways: Either models are implicitly regularised by increased sample variability (data augmentation) or explicitly constrained by hard-coded inductive biases. The limiting factor of the former is the size of the data space, which renders sufficient sample coverage intractable. The latter is limited by the engineering effort required to develop such inductive biases for every possible scenario. Instead, we take inspiration from human behaviour, where percepts are modified by mental or physical actions during inference. We propose a novel technique to emulate such an inference process for neural nets. This is achieved by traversing a sparsified inverse transformation tree during inference using parallel energy-based evaluations. Our proposed inference algorithm, called Inverse Transformation Search (ITS), is model-agnostic and equips the model with zero-shot pseudo-invariance to spatially transformed inputs. We evaluated our method on several benchmark datasets, including a synthesised ImageNet test set. ITS outperforms the utilised baselines on all zero-shot test scenarios.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03735">Select to Perfect: Imitating desired behavior from large multi-agent data</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Tim Franzmeyer, Edith Elkind, Philip Torr, Jakob Foerster, Joao Henriques</p>
<p>Abstract: AI agents are commonly trained with large datasets of demonstrations of human behavior. However, not all behaviors are equally safe or desirable. Desired characteristics for an AI agent can be expressed by assigning desirability scores, which we assume are not assigned to individual behaviors but to collective trajectories. For example, in a dataset of vehicle interactions, these scores might relate to the number of incidents that occurred. We first assess the effect of each individual agent's behavior on the collective desirability score, e.g., assessing how likely an agent is to cause incidents. This allows us to selectively imitate agents with a positive effect, e.g., only imitating agents that are unlikely to cause incidents. To enable this, we propose the concept of an agent's Exchange Value, which quantifies an individual agent's contribution to the collective desirability score. The Exchange Value is the expected change in desirability score when substituting the agent for a randomly selected agent. We propose additional methods for estimating Exchange Values from real-world datasets, enabling us to learn desired imitation policies that outperform relevant baselines.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Korn Sooksatra, Greg Hamerly, Pablo Rivas</p>
<p>Abstract: The efficacy of deep learning models has been called into question by the presence of adversarial examples. Addressing the vulnerability of deep learning models to adversarial examples is crucial for ensuring their continued development and deployment. In this work, we focus on the role of rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation functions in the generation of adversarial examples. ReLU functions are commonly used in deep learning models because they facilitate the training process. However, our empirical analysis demonstrates that ReLU functions are not robust against adversarial examples. We propose a modified version of the ReLU function, which improves robustness against adversarial examples. Our results are supported by an experiment, which confirms the effectiveness of our proposed modification. Additionally, we demonstrate that applying adversarial training to our customized model further enhances its robustness compared to a general model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengchen Fan, Baocheng Geng, Keren Li, Xueqian Wang, Pramod K. Varshney</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a representative-based approach for distributed learning that transforms multiple raw data points into a virtual representation. Unlike traditional distributed learning methods such as Federated Learning, which do not offer human interpretability, our method makes complex machine learning processes accessible and comprehensible. It achieves this by condensing extensive datasets into digestible formats, thus fostering intuitive human-machine interactions. Additionally, this approach maintains privacy and communication efficiency, and it matches the training performance of models using raw data. Simulation results show that our approach is competitive with or outperforms traditional Federated Learning in accuracy and convergence, especially in scenarios with complex models and a higher number of clients. This framework marks a step forward in integrating human intuition with machine intelligence, which potentially enhances human-machine learning interfaces and collaborative efforts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Korn Sooksatra, Bikram Khanal, Pablo Rivas</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, with the advancement of deep learning, several applications in text classification have advanced significantly. However, this improvement comes with a cost because deep learning is vulnerable to adversarial examples. This weakness indicates that deep learning is not very robust. Fortunately, the input of a text classifier is discrete. Hence, it can prevent the classifier from state-of-the-art attacks. Nonetheless, previous works have generated black-box attacks that successfully manipulate the discrete values of the input to find adversarial examples. Therefore, instead of changing the discrete values, we transform the input into its embedding vector containing real values to perform the state-of-the-art white-box attacks. Then, we convert the perturbed embedding vector back into a text and name it an adversarial example. In summary, we create a framework that measures the robustness of a text classifier by using the gradients of the classifier.</p>

<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in every stage of drug development. Continuing breakthroughs in AI-based methods for drug discovery require the creation, improvement, and refinement of drug discovery data. We posit a new data challenge that slows the advancement of drug discovery AI: datasets are often collected independently from each other, often with little overlap, creating data sparsity. Data sparsity makes data curation difficult for researchers looking to answer key research questions requiring values posed across multiple datasets. We propose a novel diffusion GNN model Syngand capable of generating ligand and pharmacokinetic data end-to-end. We show and provide a methodology for sampling pharmacokinetic data for existing ligands using our Syngand model. We show the initial promising results on the efficacy of the Syngand-generated synthetic target property data on downstream regression tasks with AqSolDB, LD50, and hERG central. Using our proposed model and methodology, researchers can easily generate synthetic ligand data to help them explore research questions that require data spanning multiple datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: As more distributed energy resources become part of the demand-side infrastructure, it is important to quantify the energy flexibility they provide on a community scale, particularly to understand the impact of geographic, climatic, and occupant behavioral differences on their effectiveness, as well as identify the best control strategies to accelerate their real-world adoption. CityLearn provides an environment for benchmarking simple and advanced distributed energy resource control algorithms including rule-based, model-predictive, and reinforcement learning control. CityLearn v2 presented here extends CityLearn v1 by providing a simulation environment that leverages the End-Use Load Profiles for the U.S. Building Stock dataset to create virtual grid-interactive communities for resilient, multi-agent distributed energy resources and objective control with dynamic occupant feedback.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anshuman Chhabra, Bo Li, Jian Chen, Prasant Mohapatra, Hongfu Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Influence functions offer a robust framework for assessing the impact of each training data sample on model predictions, serving as a prominent tool in data-centric learning. Despite their widespread use in various tasks, the strong convexity assumption on the model and the computational cost associated with calculating the inverse of the Hessian matrix pose constraints, particularly when analyzing large deep models. This paper focuses on a classical data-centric scenario--trimming detrimental samples--and addresses both challenges within a unified framework. Specifically, we establish an equivalence transformation between identifying detrimental training samples via influence functions and outlier gradient detection. This transformation not only presents a straightforward and Hessian-free formulation but also provides profound insights into the role of the gradient in sample impact. Moreover, it relaxes the convexity assumption of influence functions, extending their applicability to non-convex deep models. Through systematic empirical evaluations, we first validate the correctness of our proposed outlier gradient analysis on synthetic datasets and then demonstrate its effectiveness in detecting mislabeled samples in vision models, selecting data samples for improving performance of transformer models for natural language processing, and identifying influential samples for fine-tuned Large Language Models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Data Shapley provides a principled approach to data valuation and plays a crucial role in data-centric machine learning (ML) research. Data selection is considered a standard application of Data Shapley. However, its data selection performance has shown to be inconsistent across settings in the literature. This study aims to deepen our understanding of this phenomenon. We introduce a hypothesis testing framework and show that Data Shapley's performance can be no better than random selection without specific constraints on utility functions. We identify a class of utility functions, monotonically transformed modular functions, within which Data Shapley optimally selects data. Based on this insight, we propose a heuristic for predicting Data Shapley's effectiveness in data selection tasks. Our experiments corroborate these findings, adding new insights into when Data Shapley may or may not succeed.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aditya A. Ramesh, Kenny Young, Louis Kirsch, J\"urgen Schmidhuber</p>
<p>Abstract: Temporal credit assignment in reinforcement learning is challenging due to delayed and stochastic outcomes. Monte Carlo targets can bridge long delays between action and consequence but lead to high-variance targets due to stochasticity. Temporal difference (TD) learning uses bootstrapping to overcome variance but introduces a bias that can only be corrected through many iterations. TD($\lambda$) provides a mechanism to navigate this bias-variance tradeoff smoothly. Appropriately selecting $\lambda$ can significantly improve performance. Here, we propose Chunked-TD, which uses predicted probabilities of transitions from a model for computing $\lambda$-return targets. Unlike other model-based solutions to credit assignment, Chunked-TD is less vulnerable to model inaccuracies. Our approach is motivated by the principle of history compression and 'chunks' trajectories for conventional TD learning. Chunking with learned world models compresses near-deterministic regions of the environment-policy interaction to speed up credit assignment while still bootstrapping when necessary. We propose algorithms that can be implemented online and show that they solve some problems much faster than conventional TD($\lambda$).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minjae Cho, Jonathan P. How, Chuangchuang Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite notable successes of Reinforcement Learning (RL), the prevalent use of an online learning paradigm prevents its widespread adoption, especially in hazardous or costly scenarios. Offline RL has emerged as an alternative solution, learning from pre-collected static datasets. However, this offline learning introduces a new challenge known as distributional shift, degrading the performance when the policy is evaluated on scenarios that are Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) from the training dataset. Most existing offline RL resolves this issue by regularizing policy learning within the information supported by the given dataset. However, such regularization overlooks the potential for high-reward regions that may exist beyond the dataset. This motivates exploring novel offline learning techniques that can make improvements beyond the data support without compromising policy performance, potentially by learning causation (cause-and-effect) instead of correlation from the dataset. In this paper, we propose the MOOD-CRL (Model-based Offline OOD-Adapting Causal RL) algorithm, which aims to address the challenge of extrapolation for offline policy training through causal inference instead of policy-regularizing methods. Specifically, Causal Normalizing Flow (CNF) is developed to learn the transition and reward functions for data generation and augmentation in offline policy evaluation and training. Based on the data-invariant, physics-based qualitative causal graph and the observational data, we develop a novel learning scheme for CNF to learn the quantitative structural causal model. As a result, CNF gains predictive and counterfactual reasoning capabilities for sequential decision-making tasks, revealing a high potential for OOD adaptation. Our CNF-based offline RL approach is validated through empirical evaluations, outperforming model-free and model-based methods by a significant margin.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03904">Transformer models classify random numbers</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Rishabh Goel, YiZi Xiao, Ramin Ramezani</p>
<p>Abstract: Random numbers are incredibly important in a variety of fields, and the need for their validation remains important. A Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG) can theoretically generate truly random numbers however this does not remove the need to thoroughly test their randomness. Generally, the task of validating random numbers has been delegated to different statistical tests such as the tests from the NIST Statistical Test Suite (STS) which are often slow and only perform one task at a time. Our work presents a deep learning model that utilizes the transformer architecture to encode some of the tests from the NIST STS in a single model that also runs much faster. This model performs multi-label classification on these tests and outputs the probability of passing each statistical test that it encodes. We perform a thorough hyper-parameter optimization to converge on the best possible model and as a result, achieve a high degree of accuracy with a sample f1 score of above 0.9.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bo Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph condensation, which reduces the size of a large-scale graph by synthesizing a small-scale condensed graph as its substitution, has immediately benefited various graph learning tasks. However, existing graph condensation methods rely on centralized data storage, which is unfeasible for real-world decentralized data distribution, and overlook data holders' privacy-preserving requirements. To bridge the gap, we propose and study the novel problem of federated graph condensation for graph neural networks (GNNs). Specifically, we first propose a general framework for federated graph condensation, in which we decouple the typical gradient matching process for graph condensation into client-side gradient calculation and server-side gradient matching. In this way, the burdensome computation cost in client-side is largely alleviated. Besides, our empirical studies show that under the federated setting, the condensed graph will consistently leak data membership privacy, i.e., the condensed graph during the federated training can be utilized to steal the training data under the membership inference attacks (MIA). To tackle this issue, we innovatively incorporate information bottleneck principles into the federated graph condensation, which only needs to extract partial node features in one local pre-training step and utilize the features during federated training. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our framework can consistently protect membership privacy during training. Meanwhile, it also achieves comparable and even superior performance against existing centralized graph condensation and federated graph learning methods.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03917">KV Cache is 1 Bit Per Channel: Efficient Large Language Model Inference with Coupled Quantization</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyi Zhang, Jonah Yi, Zhaozhuo Xu, Anshumali Shrivastava</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficient deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) requires batching multiple requests together to improve throughput. As the batch size, context length, or model size increases, the size of the key and value (KV) cache can quickly become the main contributor to GPU memory usage and the bottleneck of inference latency. Quantization has emerged as an effective technique for KV cache compression, but existing methods still fail at very low bit widths. We observe that distinct channels of a key/value activation embedding are highly inter-dependent, and the joint entropy of multiple channels grows at a slower rate than the sum of their marginal entropies. Based on this insight, we propose Coupled Quantization (CQ), which couples multiple key/value channels together to exploit their inter-dependency and encode the activations in a more information-efficient manner. Extensive experiments reveal that CQ outperforms or is competitive with existing baselines in preserving model quality. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CQ can preserve model quality with KV cache quantized down to 1-bit.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kealan Dunnett, Reza Arablouei, Dimity Miller, Volkan Dedeoglu, Raja Jurdak</p>
<p>Abstract: In the era of increasing concerns over cybersecurity threats, defending against backdoor attacks is paramount in ensuring the integrity and reliability of machine learning models. However, many existing approaches require substantial amounts of data for effective mitigation, posing significant challenges in practical deployment. To address this, we propose a novel approach to counter backdoor attacks by treating their mitigation as an unlearning task. We tackle this challenge through a targeted model pruning strategy, leveraging unlearning loss gradients to identify and eliminate backdoor elements within the model. Built on solid theoretical insights, our approach offers simplicity and effectiveness, rendering it well-suited for scenarios with limited data availability. Our methodology includes formulating a suitable unlearning loss and devising a model-pruning technique tailored for convolutional neural networks. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach compared to state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in realistic data settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiayuan Chen, Changchang Yin, Yuanlong Wang, Ping Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning-based predictive models, leveraging Electronic Health Records (EHR), are receiving increasing attention in healthcare. An effective representation of a patient's EHR should hierarchically encompass both the temporal relationships between historical visits and medical events, and the inherent structural information within these elements. Existing patient representation methods can be roughly categorized into sequential representation and graphical representation. The sequential representation methods focus only on the temporal relationships among longitudinal visits. On the other hand, the graphical representation approaches, while adept at extracting the graph-structured relationships between various medical events, fall short in effectively integrate temporal information. To capture both types of information, we model a patient's EHR as a novel temporal heterogeneous graph. This graph includes historical visits nodes and medical events nodes. It propagates structured information from medical event nodes to visit nodes and utilizes time-aware visit nodes to capture changes in the patient's health status. Furthermore, we introduce a novel temporal graph transformer (TRANS) that integrates temporal edge features, global positional encoding, and local structural encoding into heterogeneous graph convolution, capturing both temporal and structural information. We validate the effectiveness of TRANS through extensive experiments on three real-world datasets. The results show that our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shusen Jing, Anlan Yu, Shuai Zhang, Songyang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent efforts have been made to integrate self-supervised learning (SSL) with the framework of federated learning (FL). One unique challenge of federated self-supervised learning (FedSSL) is that the global objective of FedSSL usually does not equal the weighted sum of local SSL objectives. Consequently, conventional approaches, such as federated averaging (FedAvg), fail to precisely minimize the FedSSL global objective, often resulting in suboptimal performance, especially when data is non-i.i.d.. To fill this gap, we propose a provable FedSSL algorithm, named FedSC, based on the spectral contrastive objective. In FedSC, clients share correlation matrices of data representations in addition to model weights periodically, which enables inter-client contrast of data samples in addition to intra-client contrast and contraction, resulting in improved quality of data representations. Differential privacy (DP) protection is deployed to control the additional privacy leakage on local datasets when correlation matrices are shared. We also provide theoretical analysis on the convergence and extra privacy leakage. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03950">Relating-Up: Advancing Graph Neural Networks through Inter-Graph Relationships</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Qi Zou, Na Yu, Daoliang Zhang, Wei Zhang, Rui Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have excelled in learning from graph-structured data, especially in understanding the relationships within a single graph, i.e., intra-graph relationships. Despite their successes, GNNs are limited by neglecting the context of relationships across graphs, i.e., inter-graph relationships. Recognizing the potential to extend this capability, we introduce Relating-Up, a plug-and-play module that enhances GNNs by exploiting inter-graph relationships. This module incorporates a relation-aware encoder and a feedback training strategy. The former enables GNNs to capture relationships across graphs, enriching relation-aware graph representation through collective context. The latter utilizes a feedback loop mechanism for the recursively refinement of these representations, leveraging insights from refining inter-graph dynamics to conduct feedback loop. The synergy between these two innovations results in a robust and versatile module. Relating-Up enhances the expressiveness of GNNs, enabling them to encapsulate a wider spectrum of graph relationships with greater precision. Our evaluations across 16 benchmark datasets demonstrate that integrating Relating-Up into GNN architectures substantially improves performance, positioning Relating-Up as a formidable choice for a broad spectrum of graph representation learning tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present VoxBind, a new score-based generative model for 3D molecules conditioned on protein structures. Our approach represents molecules as 3D atomic density grids and leverages a 3D voxel-denoising network for learning and generation. We extend the neural empirical Bayes formalism (Saremi & Hyvarinen, 2019) to the conditional setting and generate structure-conditioned molecules with a two-step procedure: (i) sample noisy molecules from the Gaussian-smoothed conditional distribution with underdamped Langevin MCMC using the learned score function and (ii) estimate clean molecules from the noisy samples with single-step denoising. Compared to the current state of the art, our model is simpler to train, significantly faster to sample from, and achieves better results on extensive in silico benchmarks -- the generated molecules are more diverse, exhibit fewer steric clashes, and bind with higher affinity to protein pockets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adeesh Kolluru, John R Kitchin</p>
<p>Abstract: Determining the optimal configuration of adsorbates on a slab (adslab) is pivotal in the exploration of novel catalysts across diverse applications. Traditionally, the quest for the lowest energy adslab configuration involves placing the adsorbate onto the slab followed by an optimization process. Prior methodologies have relied on heuristics, problem-specific intuitions, or brute-force approaches to guide adsorbate placement. In this work, we propose a novel framework for adsorbate placement using denoising diffusion. The model is designed to predict the optimal adsorbate site and orientation corresponding to the lowest energy configuration. Further, we have an end-to-end evaluation framework where diffusion-predicted adslab configuration is optimized with a pretrained machine learning force field and finally evaluated with Density Functional Theory (DFT). Our findings demonstrate an acceleration of up to 5x or 3.5x improvement in accuracy compared to the previous best approach. Given the novelty of this framework and application, we provide insights into the impact of pre-training, model architectures, and conduct extensive experiments to underscore the significance of this approach.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent progress of deep generative models in the vision and language domain has stimulated significant interest in more structured data generation such as molecules. However, beyond generating new random molecules, efficient exploration and a comprehensive understanding of the vast chemical space are of great importance to molecular science and applications in drug design and materials discovery. In this paper, we propose a new framework, ChemFlow, to traverse chemical space through navigating the latent space learned by molecule generative models through flows. We introduce a dynamical system perspective that formulates the problem as learning a vector field that transports the mass of the molecular distribution to the region with desired molecular properties or structure diversity. Under this framework, we unify previous approaches on molecule latent space traversal and optimization and propose alternative competing methods incorporating different physical priors. We validate the efficacy of ChemFlow on molecule manipulation and single- and multi-objective molecule optimization tasks under both supervised and unsupervised molecular discovery settings.

<p>Abstract: We propose a post-processing algorithm for fair classification that mitigates model bias under a unified family of group fairness criteria covering statistical parity, equal opportunity, and equalized odds, applicable to multi-class problems and both attribute-aware and attribute-blind settings. It achieves fairness by re-calibrating the output score of the given base model with a "fairness cost" -- a linear combination of the (predicted) group memberships. Our algorithm is based on a representation result showing that the optimal fair classifier can be expressed as a linear post-processing of the loss function and the group predictor, derived via using these as sufficient statistics to reformulate the fair classification problem as a linear program. The parameters of the post-processor are estimated by solving the empirical LP. Experiments on benchmark datasets show the efficiency and effectiveness of our algorithm at reducing disparity compared to existing algorithms, including in-processing, especially on larger problems.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper describes a differentially private post-processing algorithm for learning fair regressors satisfying statistical parity, addressing privacy concerns of machine learning models trained on sensitive data, as well as fairness concerns of their potential to propagate historical biases. Our algorithm can be applied to post-process any given regressor to improve fairness by remapping its outputs. It consists of three steps: first, the output distributions are estimated privately via histogram density estimation and the Laplace mechanism, then their Wasserstein barycenter is computed, and the optimal transports to the barycenter are used for post-processing to satisfy fairness. We analyze the sample complexity of our algorithm and provide fairness guarantee, revealing a trade-off between the statistical bias and variance induced from the choice of the number of bins in the histogram, in which using less bins always favors fairness at the expense of error.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingfei Lu, Shujian Yu, Robert Jenssen, Badong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Divergence measures play a central role in machine learning and become increasingly essential in deep learning. However, valid and computationally efficient divergence measures for multiple (more than two) distributions are scarcely investigated. This becomes particularly crucial in areas where the simultaneous management of multiple distributions is both unavoidable and essential. Examples include clustering, multi-source domain adaptation or generalization, and multi-view learning, among others. Although calculating the mean of pairwise distances between any two distributions serves as a common way to quantify the total divergence among multiple distributions, it is crucial to acknowledge that this approach is not straightforward and requires significant computational resources. In this study, we introduce a new divergence measure for multiple distributions named the generalized Cauchy-Schwarz divergence (GCSD), which is inspired by the classic Cauchy-Schwarz divergence. Additionally, we provide a closed-form sample estimator based on kernel density estimation, making it convenient and straightforward to use in various machine-learning applications. Finally, we apply the proposed GCSD to two challenging machine learning tasks, namely deep learning-based clustering and the problem of multi-source domain adaptation. The experimental results showcase the impressive performance of GCSD in both tasks, highlighting its potential application in machine-learning areas that involve quantifying multiple distributions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kumar Shubham, Aishwarya Jayagopal, Syed Mohammed Danish, Prathosh AP, Vaibhav Rajan</p>
<p>Abstract: Cancer, a leading cause of death globally, occurs due to genomic changes and manifests heterogeneously across patients. To advance research on personalized treatment strategies, the effectiveness of various drugs on cells derived from cancers (`cell lines') is experimentally determined in laboratory settings. Nevertheless, variations in the distribution of genomic data and drug responses between cell lines and humans arise due to biological and environmental differences. Moreover, while genomic profiles of many cancer patients are readily available, the scarcity of corresponding drug response data limits the ability to train machine learning models that can predict drug response in patients effectively. Recent cancer drug response prediction methods have largely followed the paradigm of unsupervised domain-invariant representation learning followed by a downstream drug response classification step. Introducing supervision in both stages is challenging due to heterogeneous patient response to drugs and limited drug response data. This paper addresses these challenges through a novel representation learning method in the first phase and weak supervision in the second. Experimental results on real patient data demonstrate the efficacy of our method (WISER) over state-of-the-art alternatives on predicting personalized drug response.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks have a limitation of solely processing features on graph nodes, neglecting data on high-dimensional structures such as edges and triangles. Simplicial Convolutional Neural Networks (SCNN) represent higher-order structures using simplicial complexes to break this limitation albeit still lacking time efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network architecture on simplicial complexes named Binarized Simplicial Convolutional Neural Networks (Bi-SCNN) based on the combination of simplicial convolution with a binary-sign forward propagation strategy. The usage of the Hodge Laplacian on a binary-sign forward propagation enables Bi-SCNN to efficiently and effectively represent simplicial features that have higher-order structures than traditional graph node representations. Compared to the previous Simplicial Convolutional Neural Networks, the reduced model complexity of Bi-SCNN shortens the execution time without sacrificing the prediction performance and is less prone to the over-smoothing effect. Experimenting with real-world citation and ocean-drifter data confirmed that our proposed Bi-SCNN is efficient and accurate.</p>

<p>Abstract: Continual learning (CL) provides a framework for training models in ever-evolving environments. Although re-occurrence of previously seen objects or tasks is common in real-world problems, the concept of repetition in the data stream is not often considered in standard benchmarks for CL. Unlike with the rehearsal mechanism in buffer-based strategies, where sample repetition is controlled by the strategy, repetition in the data stream naturally stems from the environment. This report provides a summary of the CLVision challenge at CVPR 2023, which focused on the topic of repetition in class-incremental learning. The report initially outlines the challenge objective and then describes three solutions proposed by finalist teams that aim to effectively exploit the repetition in the stream to learn continually. The experimental results from the challenge highlight the effectiveness of ensemble-based solutions that employ multiple versions of similar modules, each trained on different but overlapping subsets of classes. This report underscores the transformative potential of taking a different perspective in CL by employing repetition in the data stream to foster innovative strategy design.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the presence of impulsive noise, and missing observations, accurate online prediction of time-varying graph signals poses a crucial challenge in numerous application domains. We propose the Adaptive Least Mean $p^{th}$ Power Graph Neural Networks (LMP-GNN), a universal framework combining adaptive filter and graph neural network for online graph signal estimation. LMP-GNN retains the advantage of adaptive filtering in handling noise and missing observations as well as the online update capability. The incorporated graph neural network within the LMP-GNN can train and update filter parameters online instead of predefined filter parameters in previous methods, outputting more accurate prediction results. The adaptive update scheme of the LMP-GNN follows the solution of a $l_p$-norm optimization, rooting to the minimum dispersion criterion, and yields robust estimation results for time-varying graph signals under impulsive noise. A special case of LMP-GNN named the Sign-GNN is also provided and analyzed, Experiment results on two real-world datasets of temperature graph and traffic graph under four different noise distributions prove the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed LMP-GNN.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lu Ma, Zeang Sheng, Xunkai Li, Xinyi Gao, Zhezheng Hao, Ling Yang, Wentao Zhang, Bin Cui</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated effectiveness in various graph-based tasks. However, their inefficiency in training and inference presents challenges for scaling up to real-world and large-scale graph applications. To address the critical challenges, a range of algorithms have been proposed to accelerate training and inference of GNNs, attracting increasing attention from the research community. In this paper, we present a systematic review of acceleration algorithms in GNNs, which can be categorized into three main topics based on their purpose: training acceleration, inference acceleration, and execution acceleration. Specifically, we summarize and categorize the existing approaches for each main topic, and provide detailed characterizations of the approaches within each category. Additionally, we review several libraries related to acceleration algorithms in GNNs and discuss our Scalable Graph Learning (SGL) library. Finally, we propose promising directions for future research. A complete summary is presented in our GitHub repository: https://github.com/PKU-DAIR/SGL/blob/main/Awsome-GNN-Acceleration.md.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Megha Srivastava, Cedric Colas, Dorsa Sadigh, Jacob Andreas</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern AI systems such as self-driving cars and game-playing agents achieve superhuman performance, but often lack human-like features such as generalization, interpretability and human inter-operability. Inspired by the rich interactions between language and decision-making in humans, we introduce Policy Learning with a Language Bottleneck (PLLB), a framework enabling AI agents to generate linguistic rules that capture the strategies underlying their most rewarding behaviors. PLLB alternates between a rule generation step guided by language models, and an update step where agents learn new policies guided by rules. In a two-player communication game, a maze solving task, and two image reconstruction tasks, we show that PLLB agents are not only able to learn more interpretable and generalizable behaviors, but can also share the learned rules with human users, enabling more effective human-AI coordination.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chunlin Tian, Zhan Shi, Xinpeng Qin, Li Li, Chengzhong Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables multiple devices to collaboratively train a shared model while ensuring data privacy. The selection of participating devices in each training round critically affects both the model performance and training efficiency, especially given the vast heterogeneity in training capabilities and data distribution across devices. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel device selection solution called FedRank, which is an end-to-end, ranking-based approach that is pre-trained by imitation learning against state-of-the-art analytical approaches. It not only considers data and system heterogeneity at runtime but also adaptively and efficiently chooses the most suitable clients for model training. Specifically, FedRank views client selection in FL as a ranking problem and employs a pairwise training strategy for the smart selection process. Additionally, an imitation learning-based approach is designed to counteract the cold-start issues often seen in state-of-the-art learning-based approaches. Experimental results reveal that \model~ boosts model accuracy by 5.2\% to 56.9\%, accelerates the training convergence up to $2.01 \times$ and saves the energy consumption up to $40.1\%$.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Karim Galliamov, Leila Khaertdinova, Karina Denisova</p>
<p>Abstract: The latest developments in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have demonstrated remarkable progress in a code-text retrieval problem. As the Transformer-based models used in this task continue to increase in size, the computational costs and time required for end-to-end fine-tuning become substantial. This poses a significant challenge for adapting and utilizing these models when computational resources are limited. Motivated by these concerns, we propose a fine-tuning framework that leverages Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques. Moreover, we adopt contrastive learning objectives to improve the quality of bimodal representations learned by transformer models. Additionally, for PEFT methods we provide extensive benchmarking, the lack of which has been highlighted as a crucial problem in the literature. Based on the thorough experimentation with the CodeT5+ model conducted on two datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed fine-tuning framework has the potential to improve code-text retrieval performance by tuning only 0.4% parameters at most.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Paul M. Riechers</p>
<p>Abstract: A technical note aiming to offer deeper intuition for the LayerNorm function common in deep neural networks. LayerNorm is defined relative to a distinguished 'neural' basis, but it does more than just normalize the corresponding vector elements. Rather, it implements a composition -- of linear projection, nonlinear scaling, and then affine transformation -- on input activation vectors. We develop both a new mathematical expression and geometric intuition, to make the net effect more transparent. We emphasize that, when LayerNorm acts on an N-dimensional vector space, all outcomes of LayerNorm lie within the intersection of an (N-1)-dimensional hyperplane and the interior of an N-dimensional hyperellipsoid. This intersection is the interior of an (N-1)-dimensional hyperellipsoid, and typical inputs are mapped near its surface. We find the direction and length of the principal axes of this (N-1)-dimensional hyperellipsoid via the eigen-decomposition of a simply constructed matrix.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Victor Scott Prieto Ruiz, Patrick Hinsen, Thomas Wiedemann, Constantin Christof, Dmitriy Shutin</p>
<p>Abstract: This work discusses a novel method for estimating the location of a gas source based on spatially distributed con- centration measurements taken, e.g., by a mobile robot or flying platform that follows a predefined trajectory to collect samples. The proposed approach uses a Physics-Guided Neural Network to approximate the gas dispersion with the source location as an additional network input. After an initial offline training phase, the neural network can be used to efficiently solve the inverse problem of localizing the gas source based on measurements. The proposed approach allows avoiding rather costly numerical simulations of gas physics needed for solving inverse problems. Our experiments show that the method localizes the source well, even when dealing with measurements affected by noise.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jorge Garc\'ia-Carrasco, Alejandro Mat\'e, Juan Trujillo</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer-based language models are treated as black-boxes because of their large number of parameters and complex internal interactions, which is a serious safety concern. Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) intends to reverse-engineer neural network behaviors in terms of human-understandable components. In this work, we focus on understanding how GPT-2 Small performs the task of predicting three-letter acronyms. Previous works in the MI field have focused so far on tasks that predict a single token. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that tries to mechanistically understand a behavior involving the prediction of multiple consecutive tokens. We discover that the prediction is performed by a circuit composed of 8 attention heads (~5% of the total heads) which we classified in three groups according to their role. We also demonstrate that these heads concentrate the acronym prediction functionality. In addition, we mechanistically interpret the most relevant heads of the circuit and find out that they use positional information which is propagated via the causal mask mechanism. We expect this work to lay the foundation for understanding more complex behaviors involving multiple-token predictions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Technological advancements have substantially increased computational power and data availability, enabling the application of powerful machine-learning (ML) techniques across various fields. However, our ability to leverage ML methods for scientific discovery, {\it i.e.} to obtain fundamental and formalized knowledge about natural processes, is still in its infancy. In this review, we explore how the scientific community can increasingly leverage ML techniques to achieve scientific discoveries. We observe that the applicability and opportunity of ML depends strongly on the nature of the problem domain, and whether we have full ({\it e.g.}, turbulence), partial ({\it e.g.}, computational biochemistry), or no ({\it e.g.}, neuroscience) {\it a-priori} knowledge about the governing equations and physical properties of the system. Although challenges remain, principled use of ML is opening up new avenues for fundamental scientific discoveries. Throughout these diverse fields, there is a theme that ML is enabling researchers to embrace complexity in observational data that was previously intractable to classic analysis and numerical investigations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Angelo Rodio, Giovanni Neglia</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning algorithms, such as FedAvg, are negatively affected by data heterogeneity and partial client participation. To mitigate the latter problem, global variance reduction methods, like FedVARP, leverage stale model updates for non-participating clients. These methods are effective under homogeneous client participation. Yet, this paper shows that, when some clients participate much less than others, aggregating updates with different levels of staleness can detrimentally affect the training process. Motivated by this observation, we introduce FedStale, a novel algorithm that updates the global model in each round through a convex combination of "fresh" updates from participating clients and "stale" updates from non-participating ones. By adjusting the weight in the convex combination, FedStale interpolates between FedAvg, which only uses fresh updates, and FedVARP, which treats fresh and stale updates equally. Our analysis of FedStale convergence yields the following novel findings: i) it integrates and extends previous FedAvg and FedVARP analyses to heterogeneous client participation; ii) it underscores how the least participating client influences convergence error; iii) it provides practical guidelines to best exploit stale updates, showing that their usefulness diminishes as data heterogeneity decreases and participation heterogeneity increases. Extensive experiments featuring diverse levels of client data and participation heterogeneity not only confirm these findings but also show that FedStale outperforms both FedAvg and FedVARP in many settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhixuan Chu, Lei Zhang, Yichen Sun, Siqiao Xue, Zhibo Wang, Zhan Qin, Kui Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement in text-to-video (T2V) generative models has enabled the synthesis of high-fidelity video content guided by textual descriptions. Despite this significant progress, these models are often susceptible to hallucination, generating contents that contradict the input text, which poses a challenge to their reliability and practical deployment. To address this critical issue, we introduce the SoraDetector, a novel unified framework designed to detect hallucinations across diverse large T2V models, including the cutting-edge Sora model. Our framework is built upon a comprehensive analysis of hallucination phenomena, categorizing them based on their manifestation in the video content. Leveraging the state-of-the-art keyframe extraction techniques and multimodal large language models, SoraDetector first evaluates the consistency between extracted video content summary and textual prompts, then constructs static and dynamic knowledge graphs (KGs) from frames to detect hallucination both in single frames and across frames. Sora Detector provides a robust and quantifiable measure of consistency, static and dynamic hallucination. In addition, we have developed the Sora Detector Agent to automate the hallucination detection process and generate a complete video quality report for each input video. Lastly, we present a novel meta-evaluation benchmark, T2VHaluBench, meticulously crafted to facilitate the evaluation of advancements in T2V hallucination detection. Through extensive experiments on videos generated by Sora and other large T2V models, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in accurately detecting hallucinations. The code and dataset can be accessed via GitHub.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04191">Effective and Robust Adversarial Training against Data and Label Corruptions</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Peng-Fei Zhang, Zi Huang, Xin-Shun Xu, Guangdong Bai</p>
<p>Abstract: Corruptions due to data perturbations and label noise are prevalent in the datasets from unreliable sources, which poses significant threats to model training. Despite existing efforts in developing robust models, current learning methods commonly overlook the possible co-existence of both corruptions, limiting the effectiveness and practicability of the model.
  In this paper, we develop an Effective and Robust Adversarial Training (ERAT) framework to simultaneously handle two types of corruption (i.e., data and label) without prior knowledge of their specifics. We propose a hybrid adversarial training surrounding multiple potential adversarial perturbations, alongside a semi-supervised learning based on class- rebalancing sample selection to enhance the resilience of the model for dual corruption. On the one hand, in the proposed adversarial training, the perturbation generation module learns multiple surrogate malicious data perturbations by taking a DNN model as the victim, while the model is trained to maintain semantic consistency between the original data and the hybrid perturbed data. It is expected to enable the model to cope with unpredictable perturbations in real-world data corruption. On the other hand, a class-rebalancing data selection strategy is designed to fairly differentiate clean labels from noisy labels. Semi-supervised learning is performed accordingly by discarding noisy labels. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed ERAT framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taoran Fang, Wei Zhou, Yifei Sun, Kaiqiao Han, Lvbin Ma, Yang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph self-supervised learning has sparked a research surge in training informative representations without accessing any labeled data. However, our understanding of graph self-supervised learning remains limited, and the inherent relationships between various self-supervised tasks are still unexplored. Our paper aims to provide a fresh understanding of graph self-supervised learning based on task correlations. Specifically, we evaluate the performance of the representations trained by one specific task on other tasks and define correlation values to quantify task correlations. Through this process, we unveil the task correlations between various self-supervised tasks and can measure their expressive capabilities, which are closely related to downstream performance. By analyzing the correlation values between tasks across various datasets, we reveal the complexity of task correlations and the limitations of existing multi-task learning methods. To obtain more capable representations, we propose Graph Task Correlation Modeling (GraphTCM) to illustrate the task correlations and utilize it to enhance graph self-supervised training. The experimental results indicate that our method significantly outperforms existing methods across various downstream tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Caelin Kaplan, Tareq Si Salem, Angelo Rodio, Chuan Xu, Giovanni Neglia</p>
<p>Abstract: As Internet of Things (IoT) technology advances, end devices like sensors and smartphones are progressively equipped with AI models tailored to their local memory and computational constraints. Local inference reduces communication costs and latency; however, these smaller models typically underperform compared to more sophisticated models deployed on edge servers or in the cloud. Cooperative Inference Systems (CISs) address this performance trade-off by enabling smaller devices to offload part of their inference tasks to more capable devices. These systems often deploy hierarchical models that share numerous parameters, exemplified by Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) that utilize strategies like early exits or ordered dropout. In such instances, Federated Learning (FL) may be employed to jointly train the models within a CIS. Yet, traditional training methods have overlooked the operational dynamics of CISs during inference, particularly the potential high heterogeneity in serving rates across clients. To address this gap, we propose a novel FL approach designed explicitly for use in CISs that accounts for these variations in serving rates. Our framework not only offers rigorous theoretical guarantees, but also surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) training algorithms for CISs, especially in scenarios where inference request rates or data availability are uneven among clients.</p>

Through a comprehensive empirical study, VAEneu is rigorously benchmarked against 12 baseline models across 12 datasets.

<p>Abstract: We develop the first (to the best of our knowledge) provably correct neural networks for a precise computational task, with the proof of correctness generated by an automated verification algorithm without any human input. Prior work on neural network verification has focused on partial specifications that, even when satisfied, are not sufficient to ensure that a neural network never makes errors. We focus on applying neural network verification to computational tasks with a precise notion of correctness, where a verifiably correct neural network provably solves the task at hand with no caveats. In particular, we develop an approach to train and verify the first provably correct neural networks for compressed sensing, i.e., recovering sparse vectors from a number of measurements smaller than the dimension of the vector. We show that for modest problem dimensions (up to 50), we can train neural networks that provably recover a sparse vector from linear and binarized linear measurements. Furthermore, we show that the complexity of the network (number of neurons/layers) can be adapted to the problem difficulty and solve problems where traditional compressed sensing methods are not known to provably work.</p>

<p>Abstract: When deploying deep neural networks on robots or other physical systems, the learned model should reliably quantify predictive uncertainty. A reliable uncertainty allows downstream modules to reason about the safety of its actions. In this work, we address metrics for evaluating such an uncertainty. Specifically, we focus on regression tasks, and investigate Area Under Sparsification Error (AUSE), Calibration Error, Spearman's Rank Correlation, and Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL). Using synthetic regression datasets, we look into how those metrics behave under four typical types of uncertainty, their stability regarding the size of the test set, and reveal their strengths and weaknesses. Our results indicate that Calibration Error is the most stable and interpretable metric, but AUSE and NLL also have their respective use cases. We discourage the usage of Spearman's Rank Correlation for evaluating uncertainties and recommend replacing it with AUSE.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhixuan Lin, Pierluca D'Oro, Evgenii Nikishin, Aaron Courville</p>
<p>Abstract: We uncover a surprising phenomenon in deep reinforcement learning: training a diverse ensemble of data-sharing agents -- a well-established exploration strategy -- can significantly impair the performance of the individual ensemble members when compared to standard single-agent training. Through careful analysis, we attribute the degradation in performance to the low proportion of self-generated data in the shared training data for each ensemble member, as well as the inefficiency of the individual ensemble members to learn from such highly off-policy data. We thus name this phenomenon the curse of diversity. We find that several intuitive solutions -- such as a larger replay buffer or a smaller ensemble size -- either fail to consistently mitigate the performance loss or undermine the advantages of ensembling. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of representation learning to counteract the curse of diversity with a novel method named Cross-Ensemble Representation Learning (CERL) in both discrete and continuous control domains. Our work offers valuable insights into an unexpected pitfall in ensemble-based exploration and raises important caveats for future applications of similar approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: Adversarial attacks in Natural Language Processing apply perturbations in the character or token levels. Token-level attacks, gaining prominence for their use of gradient-based methods, are susceptible to altering sentence semantics, leading to invalid adversarial examples. While character-level attacks easily maintain semantics, they have received less attention as they cannot easily adopt popular gradient-based methods, and are thought to be easy to defend. Challenging these beliefs, we introduce Charmer, an efficient query-based adversarial attack capable of achieving high attack success rate (ASR) while generating highly similar adversarial examples. Our method successfully targets both small (BERT) and large (Llama 2) models. Specifically, on BERT with SST-2, Charmer improves the ASR in 4.84% points and the USE similarity in 8% points with respect to the previous art. Our implementation is available in https://github.com/LIONS-EPFL/Charmer.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this study, explainable machine learning techniques are applied to predict the toxicity of mussels in the Gulf of Trieste (Adriatic Sea) caused by harmful algal blooms. By analysing a newly created 28-year dataset containing records of toxic phytoplankton in mussel farming areas and toxin concentrations in mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis), we train and evaluate the performance of ML models to accurately predict diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) events. The random forest model provided the best prediction of positive toxicity results based on the F1 score. Explainability methods such as permutation importance and SHAP identified key species (Dinophysis fortii and D. caudata) and environmental factors (salinity, river discharge and precipitation) as the best predictors of DSP outbreaks. These findings are important for improving early warning systems and supporting sustainable aquaculture practices.</p>

<p>Abstract: Hyperparameter tuning, particularly the selection of an appropriate learning rate in adaptive gradient training methods, remains a challenge. To tackle this challenge, in this paper, we propose a novel parameter-free optimizer, AdamG (Adam with the golden step size), designed to automatically adapt to diverse optimization problems without manual tuning. The core technique underlying AdamG is our golden step size derived for the AdaGrad-Norm algorithm, which is expected to help AdaGrad-Norm preserve the tuning-free convergence and approximate the optimal step size in expectation w.r.t. various optimization scenarios. To better evaluate tuning-free performance, we propose a novel evaluation criterion, stability, to comprehensively assess the efficacy of parameter-free optimizers in addition to classical performance criteria. Empirical results demonstrate that compared with other parameter-free baselines, AdamG achieves superior performance, which is consistently on par with Adam using a manually tuned learning rate across various optimization tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pei Liu, Luping Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: Uncertainty estimation (UE), as an effective means of quantifying predictive uncertainty, is crucial for safe and reliable decision-making, especially in high-risk scenarios. Existing UE schemes usually assume that there are completely-labeled samples to support fully-supervised learning. In practice, however, many UE tasks often have no sufficiently-labeled data to use, such as the Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) with only weak instance annotations. To bridge this gap, this paper, for the first time, addresses the weakly-supervised issue of Multi-Instance UE (MIUE) and proposes a new baseline scheme, Multi-Instance Residual Evidential Learning (MIREL). Particularly, at the fine-grained instance UE with only weak supervision, we derive a multi-instance residual operator through the Fundamental Theorem of Symmetric Functions. On this operator derivation, we further propose MIREL to jointly model the high-order predictive distribution at bag and instance levels for MIUE. Extensive experiments empirically demonstrate that our MIREL not only could often make existing MIL networks perform better in MIUE, but also could surpass representative UE methods by large margins, especially in instance-level UE tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Laurent Orseau, Remi Munos</p>
<p>Abstract: We improve the proofs of the lower bounds of Coquelin and Munos (2007) that demonstrate that UCT can have $\exp(\dots\exp(1)\dots)$ regret (with $\Omega(D)$ exp terms) on the $D$-chain environment, and that a `polynomial' UCT variant has $\exp_2(\exp_2(D - O(\log D)))$ regret on the same environment -- the original proofs contain an oversight for rewards bounded in $[0, 1]$, which we fix in the present draft. We also adapt the proofs to AlphaGo's MCTS and its descendants (e.g., AlphaZero, Leela Zero) to also show $\exp_2(\exp_2(D - O(\log D)))$ regret.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ramya Prabhu, Ajay Nayak, Jayashree Mohan, Ramachandran Ramjee, Ashish Panwar</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficient use of GPU memory is essential for high throughput LLM inference. Prior systems reserved memory for the KV-cache ahead-of-time, resulting in wasted capacity due to internal fragmentation. Inspired by OS-based virtual memory systems, vLLM proposed PagedAttention to enable dynamic memory allocation for KV-cache. This approach eliminates fragmentation, enabling high-throughput LLM serving with larger batch sizes. However, to be able to allocate physical memory dynamically, PagedAttention changes the layout of KV-cache from contiguous virtual memory to non-contiguous virtual memory. This change requires attention kernels to be rewritten to support paging, and serving framework to implement a memory manager. Thus, the PagedAttention model leads to software complexity, portability issues, redundancy and inefficiency.
  In this paper, we propose vAttention for dynamic KV-cache memory management. In contrast to PagedAttention, vAttention retains KV-cache in contiguous virtual memory and leverages low-level system support for demand paging, that already exists, to enable on-demand physical memory allocation. Thus, vAttention unburdens the attention kernel developer from having to explicitly support paging and avoids re-implementation of memory management in the serving framework. We show that vAttention enables seamless dynamic memory management for unchanged implementations of various attention kernels. vAttention also generates tokens up to 1.97x faster than vLLM, while processing input prompts up to 3.92x and 1.45x faster than the PagedAttention variants of FlashAttention and FlashInfer.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Subhash Kantamneni, Ziming Liu, Max Tegmark</p>
<p>Abstract: Integrable partial differential equation (PDE) systems are of great interest in natural science, but are exceedingly rare and difficult to discover. To solve this, we introduce OptPDE, a first-of-its-kind machine learning approach that Optimizes PDEs' coefficients to maximize their number of conserved quantities, $n_{\rm CQ}$, and thus discover new integrable systems. We discover four families of integrable PDEs, one of which was previously known, and three of which have at least one conserved quantity but are new to the literature to the best of our knowledge. We investigate more deeply the properties of one of these novel PDE families, $u_t = (u_x+a^2u_{xxx})^3$. Our paper offers a promising schema of AI-human collaboration for integrable system discovery: machine learning generates interpretable hypotheses for possible integrable systems, which human scientists can verify and analyze, to truly close the discovery loop.</p>

In this work, we focus on a dataset of recordings of in-home activity from people living with Dementia. We design a representation learning method based on converting activity to text strings that can be encoded using a language model fine-tuned to transform data from the same participants within a $30$-day window to similar embeddings in the vector space. This allows for clustering and vector searching over participants and days, and the identification of activity deviations to aid with personalised delivery of care.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maximilian Beck, Korbinian P\"oppel, Markus Spanring, Andreas Auer, Oleksandra Prudnikova, Michael Kopp, G\"unter Klambauer, Johannes Brandstetter, Sepp Hochreiter</p>
<p>Abstract: In the 1990s, the constant error carousel and gating were introduced as the central ideas of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Since then, LSTMs have stood the test of time and contributed to numerous deep learning success stories, in particular they constituted the first Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the advent of the Transformer technology with parallelizable self-attention at its core marked the dawn of a new era, outpacing LSTMs at scale. We now raise a simple question: How far do we get in language modeling when scaling LSTMs to billions of parameters, leveraging the latest techniques from modern LLMs, but mitigating known limitations of LSTMs? Firstly, we introduce exponential gating with appropriate normalization and stabilization techniques. Secondly, we modify the LSTM memory structure, obtaining: (i) sLSTM with a scalar memory, a scalar update, and new memory mixing, (ii) mLSTM that is fully parallelizable with a matrix memory and a covariance update rule. Integrating these LSTM extensions into residual block backbones yields xLSTM blocks that are then residually stacked into xLSTM architectures. Exponential gating and modified memory structures boost xLSTM capabilities to perform favorably when compared to state-of-the-art Transformers and State Space Models, both in performance and scaling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sanjeev Naguleswaran</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantum algorithms based on quantum kernel methods have been investigated previously [1]. A quantum advantage is derived from the fact that it is possible to construct a family of datasets for which, only quantum processing can recognise the intrinsic labelling patterns, while for classical computers the dataset looks like noise. This is due to the algorithm leveraging inherent efficiencies in the computation of logarithms in a cyclic group. The discrete log problem.is a well-known advantage of quantum vs classical computation: where it is possible to generate all the members of the group using a single mathematical operation. Kernel methods are a powerful and popular technique in classical Machine Learning. The use of a quantum feature space that can only be calculated efficiently on a quantum computer potentially allows for deriving a quantum advantage. In this paper, we intend to first describe the application of such a kernel method to a Quantum version of the classical Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to identify conditions under which, a quantum advantage is realised. A data dependent projected quantum kernel was shown to provide significant advantage over classical kernels. Further, we present results of investigations and ideas pertaining to extending the use of quantum kernels as a feature extraction layer in a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) that is a widely used architecture in deep-learning applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Invasive plant species are detrimental to the ecology of both agricultural and wildland areas. Euphorbia esula, or leafy spurge, is one such plant that has spread through much of North America from Eastern Europe. When paired with contemporary computer vision systems, unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones, offer the means to track expansion of problem plants, such as leafy spurge, and improve chances of controlling these weeds. We gathered a dataset of leafy spurge presence and absence in grasslands of western Montana, USA, then surveyed these areas with a commercial drone. We trained image classifiers on these data, and our best performing model, a pre-trained DINOv2 vision transformer, identified leafy spurge with 0.84 accuracy (test set). This result indicates that classification of leafy spurge is tractable, but not solved. We release this unique dataset of labelled and unlabelled, aerial drone imagery for the machine learning community to explore. Improving classification performance of leafy spurge would benefit the fields of ecology, conservation, and remote sensing alike. Code and data are available at our website: leafy-spurge-dataset.github.io.</p>

<p>Abstract: The exponential growth of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) applications has necessitated the development of efficient storage solutions for vector and tensor data. This paper presents a novel approach for tensor storage in a Lakehouse architecture using Delta Lake. By adopting the multidimensional array storage strategy from array databases and sparse encoding methods to Delta Lake tables, experiments show that this approach has demonstrated notable improvements in both space and time efficiencies when compared to traditional serialization of tensors. These results provide valuable insights for the development and implementation of optimized vector and tensor storage solutions in data-intensive applications, contributing to the evolution of efficient data management practices in AI and ML domains in cloud-native environments</p>

<p>Abstract: For cyber-physical systems (CPS), including robotics and autonomous vehicles, mass deployment has been hindered by fatal errors that occur when operating in rare events. To replicate rare events such as vehicle crashes, many companies have created logging systems and employed crash reconstruction experts to meticulously recreate these valuable events in simulation. However, in these methods, "what if" questions are not easily formulated and answered. We present ScenarioNL, an AI System for creating scenario programs from natural language. Specifically, we generate these programs from police crash reports. Reports normally contain uncertainty about the exact details of the incidents which we represent through a Probabilistic Programming Language (PPL), Scenic. By using Scenic, we can clearly and concisely represent uncertainty and variation over CPS behaviors, properties, and interactions. We demonstrate how commonplace prompting techniques with the best Large Language Models (LLM) are incapable of reasoning about probabilistic scenario programs and generating code for low-resource languages such as Scenic. Our system is comprised of several LLMs chained together with several kinds of prompting strategies, a compiler, and a simulator. We evaluate our system on publicly available autonomous vehicle crash reports in California from the last five years and share insights into how we generate code that is both semantically meaningful and syntactically correct.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03710">Automating the Enterprise with Foundation Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Wornow, Avanika Narayan, Krista Opsahl-Ong, Quinn McIntyre, Nigam H. Shah, Christopher Re</p>
<p>Abstract: Automating enterprise workflows could unlock $4 trillion/year in productivity gains. Despite being of interest to the data management community for decades, the ultimate vision of end-to-end workflow automation has remained elusive. Current solutions rely on process mining and robotic process automation (RPA), in which a bot is hard-coded to follow a set of predefined rules for completing a workflow. Through case studies of a hospital and large B2B enterprise, we find that the adoption of RPA has been inhibited by high set-up costs (12-18 months), unreliable execution (60% initial accuracy), and burdensome maintenance (requiring multiple FTEs). Multimodal foundation models (FMs) such as GPT-4 offer a promising new approach for end-to-end workflow automation given their generalized reasoning and planning abilities. To study these capabilities we propose ECLAIR, a system to automate enterprise workflows with minimal human supervision. We conduct initial experiments showing that multimodal FMs can address the limitations of traditional RPA with (1) near-human-level understanding of workflows (93% accuracy on a workflow understanding task) and (2) instant set-up with minimal technical barrier (based solely on a natural language description of a workflow, ECLAIR achieves end-to-end completion rates of 40%). We identify human-AI collaboration, validation, and self-improvement as open challenges, and suggest ways they can be solved with data management techniques.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nurani Rajagopal Rohan, Vigneswaran C, Sayan Ghosh, Kishore Rajendran, Gaurav A, V Srinivasa Chakravarthy</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a novel, brain-inspired deep neural network model known as the Deep Oscillatory Neural Network (DONN). Deep neural networks like the Recurrent Neural Networks indeed possess sequence processing capabilities but the internal states of the network are not designed to exhibit brain-like oscillatory activity. With this motivation, the DONN is designed to have oscillatory internal dynamics. Neurons of the DONN are either nonlinear neural oscillators or traditional neurons with sigmoidal or ReLU activation. The neural oscillator used in the model is the Hopf oscillator, with the dynamics described in the complex domain. Input can be presented to the neural oscillator in three possible modes. The sigmoid and ReLU neurons also use complex-valued extensions. All the weight stages are also complex-valued. Training follows the general principle of weight change by minimizing the output error and therefore has an overall resemblance to complex backpropagation. A generalization of DONN to convolutional networks known as the Oscillatory Convolutional Neural Network is also proposed. The two proposed oscillatory networks are applied to a variety of benchmark problems in signal and image/video processing. The performance of the proposed models is either comparable or superior to published results on the same data sets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andac Demir, Elizaveta Solovyeva, James Boylan, Mei Xiao, Fabrizio Serluca, Sebastian Hoersch, Jeremy Jenkins, Murthy Devarakonda, Bulent Kiziltan</p>
<p>Abstract: Influenced by breakthroughs in LLMs, single-cell foundation models are emerging. While these models show successful performance in cell type clustering, phenotype classification, and gene perturbation response prediction, it remains to be seen if a simpler model could achieve comparable or better results, especially with limited data. This is important, as the quantity and quality of single-cell data typically fall short of the standards in textual data used for training LLMs. Single-cell sequencing often suffers from technical artifacts, dropout events, and batch effects. These challenges are compounded in a weakly supervised setting, where the labels of cell states can be noisy, further complicating the analysis. To tackle these challenges, we present sc-OTGM, streamlined with less than 500K parameters, making it approximately 100x more compact than the foundation models, offering an efficient alternative. sc-OTGM is an unsupervised model grounded in the inductive bias that the scRNAseq data can be generated from a combination of the finite multivariate Gaussian distributions. The core function of sc-OTGM is to create a probabilistic latent space utilizing a GMM as its prior distribution and distinguish between distinct cell populations by learning their respective marginal PDFs. It uses a Hit-and-Run Markov chain sampler to determine the OT plan across these PDFs within the GMM framework. We evaluated our model against a CRISPR-mediated perturbation dataset, called CROP-seq, consisting of 57 one-gene perturbations. Our results demonstrate that sc-OTGM is effective in cell state classification, aids in the analysis of differential gene expression, and ranks genes for target identification through a recommender system. It also predicts the effects of single-gene perturbations on downstream gene regulation and generates synthetic scRNA-seq data conditioned on specific cell states.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinglue Xu, Zhen Liu, Nagar Anthel Venkatesh Suryanarayanan, Hitoshi Iba</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, code generation driven by large language models (LLMs) has become increasingly popular. However, automatically generating code for machine learning (ML) tasks still poses significant challenges. This paper explores the limits of program synthesis for ML by combining LLMs and automated machine learning (autoML). Specifically, our goal is to fully automate the code generation process for the entire ML workflow, from data preparation to modeling and post-processing, utilizing only textual descriptions of the ML tasks. To manage the length and diversity of ML programs, we propose to break each ML program into smaller, manageable parts. Each part is generated separately by the LLM, with careful consideration of their compatibilities. To implement the approach, we design a testing technique for ML programs. Furthermore, our approach enables integration with autoML. In our approach, autoML serves to numerically assess and optimize the ML programs generated by LLMs. LLMs, in turn, help to bridge the gap between theoretical, algorithm-centered autoML and practical autoML applications. This mutual enhancement underscores the synergy between LLMs and autoML in program synthesis for ML. In experiments across various ML tasks, our method outperforms existing methods in 10 out of 12 tasks for generating ML programs. In addition, autoML significantly improves the performance of the generated ML programs. In the experiments, our method, Text-to-ML, achieves fully automated synthesis of the entire ML pipeline based solely on textual descriptions of the ML tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinho Kim, Marcel Dominik Nickel, Florian Knoll</p>
<p>Abstract: This study accelerates MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) acquisitions using deep learning-based (DL) reconstruction at 3T and 0.55T. Thirty healthy volunteers underwent conventional two-fold MRCP scans at field strengths of 3T or 0.55T. We trained a variational network (VN) using retrospectively six-fold undersampled data obtained at 3T. We then evaluated our method against standard techniques such as parallel imaging (PI) and compressed sensing (CS), focusing on peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity (SSIM) as metrics. Furthermore, considering acquiring fully-sampled MRCP is impractical, we added a self-supervised DL reconstruction (SSDU) to the evaluating group. We also tested our method in a prospective accelerated scenario to reflect real-world clinical applications and evaluated its adaptability to MRCP at 0.55T. Our method demonstrated a remarkable reduction of average acquisition time from 599/542 to 255/180 seconds for MRCP at 3T/0.55T. In both retrospective and prospective undersampling scenarios, the PSNR and SSIM of VN were higher than those of PI, CS, and SSDU. At the same time, VN preserved the image quality of undersampled data, i.e., sharpness and the visibility of hepatobiliary ducts. In addition, VN also produced high quality reconstructions at 0.55T resulting in the highest PSNR and SSIM. In summary, VN trained for highly accelerated MRCP allows to reduce the acquisition time by a factor of 2.4/3.0 at 3T/0.55T while maintaining the image quality of the conventional acquisition.</p>

Our unified modeling approach, combined with autoregressive agent injection, conditions the placement and motion trajectory of every new agent on all existing agents and their trajectories, leading to realistic scenarios with low collision rates.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sebastian Mair, Anqi Fu, Jens Sj\"olund</p>
<p>Abstract: Optimization is a time-consuming part of radiation treatment planning. We propose to reduce the optimization problem by only using a representative subset of informative voxels. This way, we improve planning efficiency while maintaining or enhancing the plan quality. To reduce the computational complexity of the optimization problem, we propose to subsample the set of voxels via importance sampling. We derive a sampling distribution based on an importance score that we obtain from pre-solving an easy optimization problem involving a simplified probing objective. By solving a reduced version of the original optimization problem using this subset, we effectively reduce the problem's size and computational demands while accounting for regions in which satisfactory dose deliveries are challenging. In contrast to other stochastic (sub-)sampling methods, our technique only requires a single sampling step to define a reduced optimization problem. This problem can be efficiently solved using established solvers. Empirical experiments on open benchmark data highlight substantially reduced optimization times, up to 50 times faster than the original ones, for intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), all while upholding plan quality comparable to traditional methods. Our approach has the potential to significantly accelerate radiation treatment planning by addressing its inherent computational challenges. We reduce the treatment planning time by reducing the size of the optimization problem rather than improving the optimization method. Our efforts are thus complementary to much of the previous developments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fuqiang Cheng, Wei Xie, Hua Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Biomanufacturing innovation relies on an efficient design of experiments (DoE) to optimize processes and product quality. Traditional DoE methods, ignoring the underlying bioprocessing mechanisms, often suffer from a lack of interpretability and sample efficiency. This limitation motivates us to create a new optimal learning approach that can guide a sequential DoEs for digital twin model calibration. In this study, we consider a multi-scale mechanistic model for cell culture process, also known as Biological Systems-of-Systems (Bio-SoS), as our digital twin. This model with modular design, composed of sub-models, allows us to integrate data across various production processes. To calibrate the Bio-SoS digital twin, we evaluate the mean squared error of model prediction and develop a computational approach to quantify the impact of parameter estimation error of individual sub-models on the prediction accuracy of digital twin, which can guide sample-efficient and interpretable DoEs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinghai He, Cheng Hua, Yingfei Wang, Zeyu Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Drug discovery is a complex process that involves sequentially screening and examining a vast array of molecules to identify those with the target properties. This process, also referred to as sequential experimentation, faces challenges due to the vast search space, the rarity of target molecules, and constraints imposed by limited data and experimental budgets. To address these challenges, we introduce a human-in-the-loop framework for sequential experiments in drug discovery. This collaborative approach combines human expert knowledge with deep learning algorithms, enhancing the discovery of target molecules within a specified experimental budget. The proposed algorithm processes experimental data to recommend both promising molecules and those that could improve its performance to human experts. Human experts retain the final decision-making authority based on these recommendations and their domain expertise, including the ability to override algorithmic recommendations. We applied our method to drug discovery tasks using real-world data and found that it consistently outperforms all baseline methods, including those which rely solely on human or algorithmic input. This demonstrates the complementarity between human experts and the algorithm. Our results provide key insights into the levels of humans' domain knowledge, the importance of meta-knowledge, and effective work delegation strategies. Our findings suggest that such a framework can significantly accelerate the development of new vaccines and drugs by leveraging the best of both human and artificial intelligence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yosuke Kaga, Yusei Suzuki, Kenta Takahashi</p>
<p>Abstract: With the development of laws and regulations related to privacy preservation, it has become difficult to collect personal data to perform machine learning. In this context, federated learning, which is distributed learning without sharing personal data, has been proposed. In this paper, we focus on federated learning for user authentication. We show that it is difficult to achieve both privacy preservation and high accuracy with existing methods. To address these challenges, we propose IPFed which is privacy-preserving federated learning using random projection for class embedding. Furthermore, we prove that IPFed is capable of learning equivalent to the state-of-the-art method. Experiments on face image datasets show that IPFed can protect the privacy of personal data while maintaining the accuracy of the state-of-the-art method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joo Young Choi, Jaesung R. Park, Inkyu Park, Jaewoong Cho, Albert No, Ernest K. Ryu</p>
<p>Abstract: Current state-of-the-art diffusion models employ U-Net architectures containing convolutional and (qkv) self-attention layers. The U-Net processes images while being conditioned on the time embedding input for each sampling step and the class or caption embedding input corresponding to the desired conditional generation. Such conditioning involves scale-and-shift operations to the convolutional layers but does not directly affect the attention layers. While these standard architectural choices are certainly effective, not conditioning the attention layers feels arbitrary and potentially suboptimal. In this work, we show that simply adding LoRA conditioning to the attention layers without changing or tuning the other parts of the U-Net architecture improves the image generation quality. For example, a drop-in addition of LoRA conditioning to EDM diffusion model yields FID scores of 1.91/1.75 for unconditional and class-conditional CIFAR-10 generation, improving upon the baseline of 1.97/1.79.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sohini Roychowdhury, Marko Krema, Anvar Mahammad, Brian Moore, Arijit Mukherjee, Punit Prakashchandra</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with residual augmented-generation (RAG) have been the optimal choice for scalable generative AI solutions in the recent past. However, the choice of use-cases that incorporate RAG with LLMs have been either generic or extremely domain specific, thereby questioning the scalability and generalizability of RAG-LLM approaches. In this work, we propose a unique LLM-based system where multiple LLMs can be invoked to enable data authentication, user query routing, data retrieval and custom prompting for question answering capabilities from data tables that are highly varying and large in size. Our system is tuned to extract information from Enterprise-level data products and furnish real time responses under 10 seconds. One prompt manages user-to-data authentication followed by three prompts to route, fetch data and generate a customizable prompt natural language responses. Additionally, we propose a five metric scoring module that detects and reports hallucinations in the LLM responses. Our proposed system and scoring metrics achieve >90% confidence scores across hundreds of user queries in the sustainability, financial health and social media domains. Extensions to the proposed extreme RAG architectures can enable heterogeneous source querying using LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) have become a promising solution to secure DNN models on edge devices. However, the existing solutions either provide inadequate protection or introduce large performance overhead. Taking both security and performance into consideration, this paper presents TBNet, a TEE-based defense framework that protects DNN model from a neural architectural perspective. Specifically, TBNet generates a novel Two-Branch substitution model, to respectively exploit (1) the computational resources in the untrusted Rich Execution Environment (REE) for latency reduction and (2) the physically-isolated TEE for model protection. Experimental results on a Raspberry Pi across diverse DNN model architectures and datasets demonstrate that TBNet achieves efficient model protection at a low cost.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anvita Mahajan, Sayali Mate, Chinmayee Kulkarni, Suraj Sawant</p>
<p>Abstract: Air pollution is a significant health concern worldwide, contributing to various respiratory diseases. Advances in air quality mapping, driven by the emergence of smart cities and the proliferation of Internet-of-Things sensor devices, have led to an increase in available data, fueling momentum in air pollution forecasting. The objective of this study is to devise an integrated approach for predicting air quality using image data and subsequently assessing lung disease severity based on Air Quality Index (AQI).The aim is to implement an integrated approach by refining existing techniques to improve accuracy in predicting AQI and lung disease severity. The study aims to forecast additional atmospheric pollutants like AQI, PM10, O3, CO, SO2, NO2 in addition to PM2.5 levels. Additionally, the study aims to compare the proposed approach with existing methods to show its effectiveness. The approach used in this paper uses VGG16 model for feature extraction in images and neural network for predicting AQI.In predicting lung disease severity, Support Vector Classifier (SVC) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithms are utilized. The neural network model for predicting AQI achieved training accuracy of 88.54 % and testing accuracy of 87.44%,which was measured using loss function, while the KNN model used for predicting lung disease severity achieved training accuracy of 98.4% and testing accuracy of 97.5% In conclusion, the integrated approach presented in this study forecasts air quality and evaluates lung disease severity, achieving high testing accuracies of 87.44% for AQI and 97.5% for lung disease severity using neural network, KNN, and SVC models. The future scope involves implementing transfer learning and advanced deep learning modules to enhance prediction capabilities. While the current study focuses on India, the objective is to expand its scope to encompass global coverage.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chang Liu, Rebecca Saul, Yihao Sun, Edward Raff, Maya Fuchs, Townsend Southard Pantano, James Holt, Kristopher Micinski</p>
<p>Abstract: Binary code is pervasive, and binary analysis is a key task in reverse engineering, malware classification, and vulnerability discovery. Unfortunately, while there exist large corpuses of malicious binaries, obtaining high-quality corpuses of benign binaries for modern systems has proven challenging (e.g., due to licensing issues). Consequently, machine learning based pipelines for binary analysis utilize either costly commercial corpuses (e.g., VirusTotal) or open-source binaries (e.g., coreutils) available in limited quantities. To address these issues, we present Assemblage: an extensible cloud-based distributed system that crawls, configures, and builds Windows PE binaries to obtain high-quality binary corpuses suitable for training state-of-the-art models in binary analysis. We have run Assemblage on AWS over the past year, producing 890k Windows PE and 428k Linux ELF binaries across 29 configurations. Assemblage is designed to be both reproducible and extensible, enabling users to publish "recipes" for their datasets, and facilitating the extraction of a wide array of features. We evaluated Assemblage by using its data to train modern learning-based pipelines for compiler provenance and binary function similarity. Our results illustrate the practical need for robust corpuses of high-quality Windows PE binaries in training modern learning-based binary analyses.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joseph Farmer, Ethan Smith, William Bennett, Ryan McClarren</p>
<p>Abstract: Radiative heat transfer is a fundamental process in high energy density physics and inertial fusion. Accurately predicting the behavior of Marshak waves across a wide range of material properties and drive conditions is crucial for design and analysis of these systems. Conventional numerical solvers and analytical approximations often face challenges in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency. In this work, we propose a novel approach to model Marshak waves using Fourier Neural Operators (FNO). We develop two FNO-based models: (1) a base model that learns the mapping between the drive condition and material properties to a solution approximation based on the widely used analytic model by Hammer & Rosen (2003), and (2) a model that corrects the inaccuracies of the analytic approximation by learning the mapping to a more accurate numerical solution. Our results demonstrate the strong generalization capabilities of the FNOs and show significant improvements in prediction accuracy compared to the base analytic model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Jin, Yang Peng, Liangyu Zhang, Zhihua Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: We study problems of federated control in Markov Decision Processes. To solve an MDP with large state space, multiple learning agents are introduced to collaboratively learn its optimal policy without communication of locally collected experience. In our settings, these agents have limited capabilities, which means they are restricted within different regions of the overall state space during the training process. In face of the difference among restricted regions, we firstly introduce concepts of leakage probabilities to understand how such heterogeneity affects the learning process, and then propose a novel communication protocol that we call Federated-Q protocol (FedQ), which periodically aggregates agents' knowledge of their restricted regions and accordingly modifies their learning problems for further training. In terms of theoretical analysis, we justify the correctness of FedQ as a communication protocol, then give a general result on sample complexity of derived algorithms FedQ-X with the RL oracle , and finally conduct a thorough study on the sample complexity of FedQ-SynQ. Specifically, FedQ-X has been shown to enjoy linear speedup in terms of sample complexity when workload is uniformly distributed among agents. Moreover, we carry out experiments in various environments to justify the efficiency of our methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Conor Hassan, Matthew Sutton, Antonietta Mira, Kerrie Mengersen</p>
<p>Abstract: Vertical federated learning (VFL) has emerged as a paradigm for collaborative model estimation across multiple clients, each holding a distinct set of covariates. This paper introduces the first comprehensive framework for fitting Bayesian models in the VFL setting. We propose a novel approach that leverages data augmentation techniques to transform VFL problems into a form compatible with existing Bayesian federated learning algorithms. We present an innovative model formulation for specific VFL scenarios where the joint likelihood factorizes into a product of client-specific likelihoods. To mitigate the dimensionality challenge posed by data augmentation, which scales with the number of observations and clients, we develop a factorized amortized variational approximation that achieves scalability independent of the number of observations. We showcase the efficacy of our framework through extensive numerical experiments on logistic regression, multilevel regression, and a novel hierarchical Bayesian split neural net model. Our work paves the way for privacy-preserving, decentralized Bayesian inference in vertically partitioned data scenarios, opening up new avenues for research and applications in various domains.</p>

<p>Abstract: As spiking neural networks (SNNs) gain traction in deploying neuromorphic computing solutions, protecting their intellectual property (IP) has become crucial. Without adequate safeguards, proprietary SNN architectures are at risk of theft, replication, or misuse, which could lead to significant financial losses for the owners. While IP protection techniques have been extensively explored for artificial neural networks (ANNs), their applicability and effectiveness for the unique characteristics of SNNs remain largely unexplored. In this work, we pioneer an investigation into adapting two prominent watermarking approaches, namely, fingerprint-based and backdoor-based mechanisms to secure proprietary SNN architectures. We conduct thorough experiments to evaluate the impact on fidelity, resilience against overwrite threats, and resistance to compression attacks when applying these watermarking techniques to SNNs, drawing comparisons with their ANN counterparts. This study lays the groundwork for developing neuromorphic-aware IP protection strategies tailored to the distinctive dynamics of SNNs.</p>

<p>Abstract: This research examines the effectiveness of OpenAI's GPT models as independent evaluators of text summaries generated by six transformer-based models from Hugging Face: DistilBART, BERT, ProphetNet, T5, BART, and PEGASUS. We evaluated these summaries based on essential properties of high-quality summary - conciseness, relevance, coherence, and readability - using traditional metrics such as ROUGE and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA). Uniquely, we also employed GPT not as a summarizer but as an evaluator, allowing it to independently assess summary quality without predefined metrics. Our analysis revealed significant correlations between GPT evaluations and traditional metrics, particularly in assessing relevance and coherence. The results demonstrate GPT's potential as a robust tool for evaluating text summaries, offering insights that complement established metrics and providing a basis for comparative analysis of transformer-based models in natural language processing tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep Learning has been a critical part of designing inverse design methods that are computationally efficient and accurate. An example of this is the design of photonic metasurfaces by using their photoluminescent spectrum as the input data to predict their topology. One fundamental challenge of these systems is their ability to represent nonlinear relationships between sets of data that have different dimensionalities. Existing design methods often implement a conditional Generative Adversarial Network in order to solve this problem, but in many cases the solution is unable to generate structures that provide multiple peaks when validated. It is demonstrated that in response to the target spectrum, the Bidirectional Adversarial Autoencoder is able to generate structures that provide multiple peaks on several occasions. As a result the proposed model represents an important advance towards the generation of nonlinear photonic metasurfaces that can be used in advanced metasurface design.</p>

We can regard that as a complex adaptive system consisting of many artificial neurons that work as an adaptive memory as a whole. The network's behavior is training dynamics with a feedback loop from the evaluation of the loss function. We already know the training response can be constant or shows power law-like aging in some ideal situations. However, we still have gaps between those findings and other complex phenomena, like network fragility. To fill the gap, we introduce a very simple network and analyze it. We show the training response consists of some different factors based on training stages, activation functions, or training methods. In addition, we show feature space reduction as an effect of stochastic training dynamics, which can result in network fragility. Finally, we discuss some complex phenomena of deep networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ammarah Hashmi, Sahibzada Adil Shahzad, Chia-Wen Lin, Yu Tsao, Hsin-Min Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The emergence of contemporary deepfakes has attracted significant attention in machine learning research, as artificial intelligence (AI) generated synthetic media increases the incidence of misinterpretation and is difficult to distinguish from genuine content. Currently, machine learning techniques have been extensively studied for automatically detecting deepfakes. However, human perception has been less explored. Malicious deepfakes could ultimately cause public and social problems. Can we humans correctly perceive the authenticity of the content of the videos we watch? The answer is obviously uncertain; therefore, this paper aims to evaluate the human ability to discern deepfake videos through a subjective study. We present our findings by comparing human observers to five state-ofthe-art audiovisual deepfake detection models. To this end, we used gamification concepts to provide 110 participants (55 native English speakers and 55 non-native English speakers) with a webbased platform where they could access a series of 40 videos (20 real and 20 fake) to determine their authenticity. Each participant performed the experiment twice with the same 40 videos in different random orders. The videos are manually selected from the FakeAVCeleb dataset. We found that all AI models performed better than humans when evaluated on the same 40 videos. The study also reveals that while deception is not impossible, humans tend to overestimate their detection capabilities. Our experimental results may help benchmark human versus machine performance, advance forensics analysis, and enable adaptive countermeasures.</p>

<p>Abstract: Emergent-scene safety is the key milestone for fully autonomous driving, and reliable on-time prediction is essential to maintain safety in emergency scenarios. However, these emergency scenarios are long-tailed and hard to collect, which restricts the system from getting reliable predictions. In this paper, we build a new dataset, which aims at the long-term prediction with the inconspicuous state variation in history for the emergency event, named the Extro-Spective Prediction (ESP) problem. Based on the proposed dataset, a flexible feature encoder for ESP is introduced to various prediction methods as a seamless plug-in, and its consistent performance improvement underscores its efficacy. Furthermore, a new metric named clamped temporal error (CTE) is proposed to give a more comprehensive evaluation of prediction performance, especially in time-sensitive emergency events of subseconds. Interestingly, as our ESP features can be described in human-readable language naturally, the application of integrating into ChatGPT also shows huge potential. The ESP-dataset and all benchmarks are released at https://dingrui-wang.github.io/ESP-Dataset/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Darius Afchar, Gabriel Meseguer Brocal, Romain Hennequin</p>
<p>Abstract: In the face of a new era of generative models, the detection of artificially generated content has become a matter of utmost importance. The ability to create credible minute-long music deepfakes in a few seconds on user-friendly platforms poses a real threat of fraud on streaming services and unfair competition to human artists. This paper demonstrates the possibility (and surprising ease) of training classifiers on datasets comprising real audio and fake reconstructions, achieving a convincing accuracy of 99.8%. To our knowledge, this marks the first publication of a music deepfake detector, a tool that will help in the regulation of music forgery. Nevertheless, informed by decades of literature on forgery detection in other fields, we stress that a good test score is not the end of the story. We step back from the straightforward ML framework and expose many facets that could be problematic with such a deployed detector: calibration, robustness to audio manipulation, generalisation to unseen models, interpretability and possibility for recourse. This second part acts as a position for future research steps in the field and a caveat to a flourishing market of fake content checkers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohit Upadhyay, Rohan Juneja, Weng-Fai Wong, Li-Shiuan Peh</p>
<p>Abstract: Attention mechanisms are becoming increasingly popular, being used in neural network models in multiple domains such as natural language processing (NLP) and vision applications, especially at the edge. However, attention layers are difficult to map onto existing neuro accelerators since they have a much higher density of non-linear operations, which lead to inefficient utilization of today's vector units. This work introduces NOVA, a NoC-based Vector Unit that can perform non-linear operations within the NoC of the accelerators, and can be overlaid onto existing neuro accelerators to map attention layers at the edge. Our results show that the NOVA architecture is up to 37.8x more power-efficient than state-of-the-art hardware approximators when running existing attention-based neural networks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Green Tsetlin (GT) is a Tsetlin Machine (TM) framework developed to solve real-world problems using TMs. Several frameworks already exist that provide access to TM implementations. However, these either lack features or have a research-first focus. GT is an easy-to-use framework that aims to lower the complexity and provide a production-ready TM implementation that is great for experienced practitioners and beginners. To this end, GT establishes a clear separation between training and inference. A C++ backend with a Python interface provides competitive training and inference performance, with the option of running in pure Python. It also integrates support for critical components such as exporting trained models, hyper-parameter search, and cross-validation out-of-the-box.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jorge F. Urb\'an, Petros Stefanou, Jos\'e A. Pons</p>
<p>Abstract: This study investigates the potential accuracy boundaries of physics-informed neural networks, contrasting their approach with previous similar works and traditional numerical methods. We find that selecting improved optimization algorithms significantly enhances the accuracy of the results. Simple modifications to the loss function may also improve precision, offering an additional avenue for enhancement. Despite optimization algorithms having a greater impact on convergence than adjustments to the loss function, practical considerations often favor tweaking the latter due to ease of implementation. On a global scale, the integration of an enhanced optimizer and a marginally adjusted loss function enables a reduction in the loss function by several orders of magnitude across diverse physical problems. Consequently, our results obtained using compact networks (typically comprising 2 or 3 layers of 20-30 neurons) achieve accuracies comparable to finite difference schemes employing thousands of grid points. This study encourages the continued advancement of PINNs and associated optimization techniques for broader applications across various fields.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyu Feng, Hao Luan, Pranav Goyal, Harold Soh</p>
<p>Abstract: Operating effectively in complex environments while complying with specified constraints is crucial for the safe and successful deployment of robots that interact with and operate around people. In this work, we focus on generating long-horizon trajectories that adhere to novel static and temporally-extended constraints/instructions at test time. We propose a data-driven diffusion-based framework, LTLDoG, that modifies the inference steps of the reverse process given an instruction specified using finite linear temporal logic ($\text{LTL}_f$). LTLDoG leverages a satisfaction value function on $\text{LTL}_f$ and guides the sampling steps using its gradient field. This value function can also be trained to generalize to new instructions not observed during training, enabling flexible test-time adaptability. Experiments in robot navigation and manipulation illustrate that the method is able to generate trajectories that satisfy formulae that specify obstacle avoidance and visitation sequences.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Somayeh Malekshahi, Javad M. Kheyridoost, Omid Fatemi</p>
<p>Abstract: Considering learner engagement has a mutual benefit for both learners and instructors. Instructors can help learners increase their attention, involvement, motivation, and interest. On the other hand, instructors can improve their instructional performance by evaluating the cumulative results of all learners and upgrading their training programs. This paper proposes a general, lightweight model for selecting and processing features to detect learners' engagement levels while preserving the sequential temporal relationship over time. During training and testing, we analyzed the videos from the publicly available DAiSEE dataset to capture the dynamic essence of learner engagement. We have also proposed an adaptation policy to find new labels that utilize the affective states of this dataset related to education, thereby improving the models' judgment. The suggested model achieves an accuracy of 68.57\% in a specific implementation and outperforms the studied state-of-the-art models detecting learners' engagement levels.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present an unsupervised single-channel method for joint blind dereverberation and room impulse response estimation, based on posterior sampling with diffusion models. We parameterize the reverberation operator using a filter with exponential decay for each frequency subband, and iteratively estimate the corresponding parameters as the speech utterance gets refined along the reverse diffusion trajectory. A measurement consistency criterion enforces the fidelity of the generated speech with the reverberant measurement, while an unconditional diffusion model implements a strong prior for clean speech generation. Without any knowledge of the room impulse response nor any coupled reverberant-anechoic data, we can successfully perform dereverberation in various acoustic scenarios. Our method significantly outperforms previous blind unsupervised baselines, and we demonstrate its increased robustness to unseen acoustic conditions in comparison to blind supervised methods. Audio samples and code are available online.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Owen Singh, Sandeep Singh Sengar</p>
<p>Abstract: Colorectal cancer contributes significantly to cancer-related mortality. Timely identification and elimination of polyps through colonoscopy screening is crucial in order to decrease mortality rates. Accurately detecting polyps in colonoscopy images is difficult because of the differences in characteristics such as size, shape, texture, and similarity to surrounding tissues. Current deep-learning methods often face difficulties in capturing long-range connections necessary for segmentation. This research presents BetterNet, a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that combines residual learning and attention methods to enhance the accuracy of polyp segmentation. The primary characteristics encompass (1) a residual decoder architecture that facilitates efficient gradient propagation and integration of multiscale features. (2) channel and spatial attention blocks within the decoder block to concentrate the learning process on the relevant areas of polyp regions. (3) Achieving state-of-the-art performance on polyp segmentation benchmarks while still ensuring computational efficiency. (4) Thorough ablation tests have been conducted to confirm the influence of architectural components. (5) The model code has been made available as open-source for further contribution. Extensive evaluations conducted on datasets such as Kvasir-SEG, CVC ClinicDB, Endoscene, EndoTect, and Kvasir-Sessile demonstrate that BetterNets outperforms current SOTA models in terms of segmentation accuracy by significant margins. The lightweight design enables real-time inference for various applications. BetterNet shows promise in integrating computer-assisted diagnosis techniques to enhance the detection of polyps and the early recognition of cancer.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ryan Whetten, Titouan Parcollet, Marco Dinarelli, Yannick Est\`eve</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has proven to be useful in various speech tasks. However, these methods are generally very demanding in terms of data, memory, and computational resources. BERT-based Speech pre-Training with Random-projection Quantizer (BEST-RQ), is an SSL method that has shown great performance on Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) while being simpler than other SSL methods, such as wav2vec 2.0. Despite BEST-RQ's great performance, details are lacking in the original paper, such as the amount of GPU/TPU hours used in pre-training, and there is no official easy-to-use open-source implementation. Furthermore, BEST-RQ has not been evaluated on other downstream tasks aside from ASR and speech translation. In this work, we describe a re-implementation of a Random-projection quantizer and perform a preliminary study with a comparison to wav2vec 2.0 on four downstream tasks. We discuss the details and differences of our implementation. We show that a random projection quantizer can achieve similar downstream performance as wav2vec 2.0 while decreasing training time by over a factor of two.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiwen Hou, Haoyuan Sun, Jinming Ma, Feng Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) provides a promising approach to avoid costly online interaction with the real environment. However, the performance of offline RL highly depends on the quality of the datasets, which may cause extrapolation error in the learning process. In many robotic applications, an inaccurate simulator is often available. However, the data directly collected from the inaccurate simulator cannot be directly used in offline RL due to the well-known exploration-exploitation dilemma and the dynamic gap between inaccurate simulation and the real environment. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach to combine the offline dataset and the inaccurate simulation data in a better manner. Specifically, we pre-train a generative adversarial network (GAN) model to fit the state distribution of the offline dataset. Given this, we collect data from the inaccurate simulator starting from the distribution provided by the generator and reweight the simulated data using the discriminator. Our experimental results in the D4RL benchmark and a real-world manipulation task confirm that our method can benefit more from both inaccurate simulator and limited offline datasets to achieve better performance than the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manuel Gonz\'alez Lastre, Pablo Pou, Miguel Wiche, Daniel Ebeling, Andre Schirmeisen, Rub\'en P\'erez</p>
<p>Abstract: Non--Contact Atomic Force Microscopy with CO--functionalized metal tips (referred to as HR-AFM) provides access to the internal structure of individual molecules adsorbed on a surface with totally unprecedented resolution. Previous works have shown that deep learning (DL) models can retrieve the chemical and structural information encoded in a 3D stack of constant-height HR--AFM images, leading to molecular identification. In this work, we overcome their limitations by using a well-established description of the molecular structure in terms of topological fingerprints, the 1024--bit Extended Connectivity Chemical Fingerprints of radius 2 (ECFP4), that were developed for substructure and similarity searching. ECFPs provide local structural information of the molecule, each bit correlating with a particular substructure within the molecule. Our DL model is able to extract this optimized structural descriptor from the 3D HR--AFM stacks and use it, through virtual screening, to identify molecules from their predicted ECFP4 with a retrieval accuracy on theoretical images of 95.4\%. Furthermore, this approach, unlike previous DL models, assigns a confidence score, the Tanimoto similarity, to each of the candidate molecules, thus providing information on the reliability of the identification.
  By construction, the number of times a certain substructure is present in the molecule is lost during the hashing process, necessary to make them useful for machine learning applications. We show that it is possible to complement the fingerprint-based virtual screening with global information provided by another DL model that predicts from the same HR--AFM stacks the chemical formula, boosting the identification accuracy up to a 97.6\%. Finally, we perform a limited test with experimental images, obtaining promising results towards the application of this pipeline under real conditions</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Antonio Biki\'c, Sayan Mukherjee</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial neural networks (ANNs) perform extraordinarily on numerous tasks including classification or prediction, e.g., speech processing and image classification. These new functions are based on a computational model that is enabled to select freely all necessary internal model parameters as long as it eventually delivers the functionality it is supposed to exhibit. Here, we review the connection between the model parameter selection in machine learning (ML) algorithms running on ANNs and the epistemological theory of neopragmatism focusing on the theory's utility and anti-representationalist aspects. To understand the consequences of the model parameter selection of an ANN, we suggest using neopragmatist theories whose implications are well studied. Incidentally, neopragmatism's notion of optimization is also based on utility considerations. This means that applying this approach elegantly reveals the inherent connections between optimization in ML, using a numerical method during the learning phase, and optimization in the ethical theory of consequentialism, where it occurs as a maxim of action. We suggest that these connections originate from the way relevance is calculated in ML systems. This could ultimately reveal a tendency for specific actions in ML systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhou Wang, Xingye Qiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Conformal prediction is a distribution-free method that wraps a given machine learning model and returns a set of plausible labels that contain the true label with a prescribed coverage rate. In practice, the empirical coverage achieved highly relies on fully observed label information from data both in the training phase for model fitting and the calibration phase for quantile estimation. This dependency poses a challenge in the context of online learning with bandit feedback, where a learner only has access to the correctness of actions (i.e., pulled an arm) but not the full information of the true label. In particular, when the pulled arm is incorrect, the learner only knows that the pulled one is not the true class label, but does not know which label is true. Additionally, bandit feedback further results in a smaller labeled dataset for calibration, limited to instances with correct actions, thereby affecting the accuracy of quantile estimation. To address these limitations, we propose Bandit Class-specific Conformal Prediction (BCCP), offering coverage guarantees on a class-specific granularity. Using an unbiased estimation of an estimand involving the true label, BCCP trains the model and makes set-valued inferences through stochastic gradient descent. Our approach overcomes the challenges of sparsely labeled data in each iteration and generalizes the reliability and applicability of conformal prediction to online decision-making environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper focuses on addressing challenges posed by non-homogeneous unstructured grids, commonly used in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Their prevalence in CFD scenarios has motivated the exploration of innovative approaches for generating reduced-order models. The core of our approach centers on geometric deep learning, specifically the utilization of graph convolutional network (GCN). The novel Autoencoder GCN architecture enhances prediction accuracy by propagating information to distant nodes and emphasizing influential points. This architecture, with GCN layers and encoding/decoding modules, reduces dimensionality based on pressure-gradient values. The autoencoder structure improves the network capability to identify key features, contributing to a more robust and accurate predictive model. To validate the proposed methodology, we analyzed two different test cases: wing-only model and wing--body configuration. Precise reconstruction of steady-state distributed quantities within a two-dimensional parametric space underscores the reliability and versatility of the implemented approach.</p>

<p>Abstract: State Space Model (SSM) is a mathematical model used to describe and analyze the behavior of dynamic systems. This model has witnessed numerous applications in several fields, including control theory, signal processing, economics and machine learning. In the field of deep learning, state space models are used to process sequence data, such as time series analysis, natural language processing (NLP) and video understanding. By mapping sequence data to state space, long-term dependencies in the data can be better captured. In particular, modern SSMs have shown strong representational capabilities in NLP, especially in long sequence modeling, while maintaining linear time complexity. Notably, based on the latest state-space models, Mamba merges time-varying parameters into SSMs and formulates a hardware-aware algorithm for efficient training and inference. Given its impressive efficiency and strong long-range dependency modeling capability, Mamba is expected to become a new AI architecture that may outperform Transformer. Recently, a number of works have attempted to study the potential of Mamba in various fields, such as general vision, multi-modal, medical image analysis and remote sensing image analysis, by extending Mamba from natural language domain to visual domain. To fully understand Mamba in the visual domain, we conduct a comprehensive survey and present a taxonomy study. This survey focuses on Mamba's application to a variety of visual tasks and data types, and discusses its predecessors, recent advances and far-reaching impact on a wide range of domains.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mathew Mithra Noel, Yug Oswal</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a significantly better class of activation functions than the almost universally used ReLU like and Sigmoidal class of activation functions. Two new activation functions referred to as the Cone and Parabolic-Cone that differ drastically from popular activation functions and significantly outperform these on the CIFAR-10 and Imagenette benchmmarks are proposed. The cone activation functions are positive only on a finite interval and are strictly negative except at the end-points of the interval, where they become zero. Thus the set of inputs that produce a positive output for a neuron with cone activation functions is a hyperstrip and not a half-space as is the usual case. Since a hyper strip is the region between two parallel hyper-planes, it allows neurons to more finely divide the input feature space into positive and negative classes than with infinitely wide half-spaces. In particular the XOR function can be learn by a single neuron with cone-like activation functions. Both the cone and parabolic-cone activation functions are shown to achieve higher accuracies with significantly fewer neurons on benchmarks. The results presented in this paper indicate that many nonlinear real-world datasets may be separated with fewer hyperstrips than half-spaces. The Cone and Parabolic-Cone activation functions have larger derivatives than ReLU and are shown to significantly speedup training.</p>

<p>Abstract: The training, testing, and deployment, of autonomous vehicles requires realistic and efficient simulators. Moreover, because of the high variability between different problems presented in different autonomous systems, these simulators need to be easy to use, and easy to modify. To address these problems we introduce TorchDriveSim and its benchmark extension TorchDriveEnv. TorchDriveEnv is a lightweight reinforcement learning benchmark programmed entirely in Python, which can be modified to test a number of different factors in learned vehicle behavior, including the effect of varying kinematic models, agent types, and traffic control patterns. Most importantly unlike many replay based simulation approaches, TorchDriveEnv is fully integrated with a state of the art behavioral simulation API. This allows users to train and evaluate driving models alongside data driven Non-Playable Characters (NPC) whose initializations and driving behavior are reactive, realistic, and diverse. We illustrate the efficiency and simplicity of TorchDriveEnv by evaluating common reinforcement learning baselines in both training and validation environments. Our experiments show that TorchDriveEnv is easy to use, but difficult to solve.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexis Ross, Jacob Andreas</p>
<p>Abstract: When a teacher provides examples for a student to study, these examples must be informative, enabling a student to progress from their current state toward a target concept or skill. Good teachers must therefore simultaneously infer what students already know and adapt their teaching to students' changing state of knowledge. There is increasing interest in using computational models, particularly large language models, as pedagogical tools. As students, language models in particular have shown a remarkable ability to adapt to new tasks given small numbers of examples. But how effectively can these models adapt as teachers to students of different types? To study this question, we introduce a suite of models and evaluation methods we call AdapT. AdapT has two components: (1) a collection of simulated Bayesian student models that can be used for evaluation of automated teaching methods; (2) a platform for evaluation with human students, to characterize the real-world effectiveness of these methods. We additionally introduce (3) AToM, a new probabilistic model for adaptive teaching that jointly infers students' past beliefs and optimizes for the correctness of future beliefs. In evaluations of simulated students across three learning domains (fraction arithmetic, English morphology, function learning), AToM systematically outperforms LLM-based and standard Bayesian teaching models. In human experiments, both AToM and LLMs outperform non-adaptive random example selection. Our results highlight both the difficulty of the adaptive teaching task and the potential of learned adaptive models for solving it.</p>

<p>Abstract: Auto-regressive generation models achieve competitive performance across many different NLP tasks such as summarization, question answering, and classifications. However, they are also known for being slow in inference, which makes them challenging to deploy in real-time applications. We propose a switchable decision to accelerate inference by dynamically assigning computation resources for each data instance. Automatically making decisions on where to skip and how to balance quality and computation cost with constrained optimization, our dynamic neural generation networks enforce the efficient inference path and determine the optimized trade-off. Experiments across question answering, summarization, and classification benchmarks show that our method benefits from less computation cost during inference while keeping the same accuracy. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that our method can be general, effective, and beneficial for many NLP tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have manifested strong ability to generate codes for productive activities. However, current benchmarks for code synthesis, such as HumanEval, MBPP, and DS-1000, are predominantly oriented towards introductory tasks on algorithm and data science, insufficiently satisfying challenging requirements prevalent in real-world coding. To fill this gap, we propose NaturalCodeBench (NCB), a challenging code benchmark designed to mirror the complexity and variety of scenarios in real coding tasks. NCB comprises 402 high-quality problems in Python and Java, meticulously selected from natural user queries from online coding services, covering 6 different domains. Noting the extraordinary difficulty in creating testing cases for real-world queries, we also introduce a semi-automated pipeline to enhance the efficiency of test case construction. Comparing with manual solutions, it achieves an efficiency increase of more than 4 times. Our systematic experiments on 39 LLMs find that performance gaps on NCB between models with close HumanEval scores could still be significant, indicating a lack of focus on practical code synthesis scenarios or over-specified optimization on HumanEval. On the other hand, even the best-performing GPT-4 is still far from satisfying on NCB. The evaluation toolkit and development set are available at https://github.com/THUDM/NaturalCodeBench.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yujun Lin, Haotian Tang, Shang Yang, Zhekai Zhang, Guangxuan Xiao, Chuang Gan, Song Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantization can accelerate large language model (LLM) inference. Going beyond INT8 quantization, the research community is actively exploring even lower precision, such as INT4. Nonetheless, state-of-the-art INT4 quantization techniques only accelerate low-batch, edge LLM inference, failing to deliver performance gains in large-batch, cloud-based LLM serving. We uncover a critical issue: existing INT4 quantization methods suffer from significant runtime overhead (20-90%) when dequantizing either weights or partial sums on GPUs. To address this challenge, we introduce QoQ, a W4A8KV4 quantization algorithm with 4-bit weight, 8-bit activation, and 4-bit KV cache. QoQ stands for quattuor-octo-quattuor, which represents 4-8-4 in Latin. QoQ is implemented by the QServe inference library that achieves measured speedup. The key insight driving QServe is that the efficiency of LLM serving on GPUs is critically influenced by operations on low-throughput CUDA cores. Building upon this insight, in QoQ algorithm, we introduce progressive quantization that can allow low dequantization overhead in W4A8 GEMM. Additionally, we develop SmoothAttention to effectively mitigate the accuracy degradation incurred by 4-bit KV quantization. In the QServe system, we perform compute-aware weight reordering and take advantage of register-level parallelism to reduce dequantization latency. We also make fused attention memory-bound, harnessing the performance gain brought by KV4 quantization. As a result, QServe improves the maximum achievable serving throughput of Llama-3-8B by 1.2x on A100, 1.4x on L40S; and Qwen1.5-72B by 2.4x on A100, 3.5x on L40S, compared to TensorRT-LLM. Remarkably, QServe on L40S GPU can achieve even higher throughput than TensorRT-LLM on A100. Thus, QServe effectively reduces the dollar cost of LLM serving by 3x.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jing Lin, Yao Feng, Weiyang Liu, Michael J. Black</p>
<p>Abstract: Numerous methods have been proposed to detect, estimate, and analyze properties of people in images, including the estimation of 3D pose, shape, contact, human-object interaction, emotion, and more. Each of these methods works in isolation instead of synergistically. Here we address this problem and build a language-driven human understanding system -- ChatHuman, which combines and integrates the skills of many different methods. To do so, we finetune a Large Language Model (LLM) to select and use a wide variety of existing tools in response to user inputs. In doing so, ChatHuman is able to combine information from multiple tools to solve problems more accurately than the individual tools themselves and to leverage tool output to improve its ability to reason about humans. The novel features of ChatHuman include leveraging academic publications to guide the application of 3D human-related tools, employing a retrieval-augmented generation model to generate in-context-learning examples for handling new tools, and discriminating and integrating tool results to enhance 3D human understanding. Our experiments show that ChatHuman outperforms existing models in both tool selection accuracy and performance across multiple 3D human-related tasks. ChatHuman is a step towards consolidating diverse methods for human analysis into a single, powerful, system for 3D human reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinquan Huang, Wenlei Shi, Xiaotian Gao, Xinran Wei, Jia Zhang, Jiang Bian, Mao Yang, Tie-Yan Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural operators, as a powerful approximation to the non-linear operators between infinite-dimensional function spaces, have proved to be promising in accelerating the solution of partial differential equations (PDE). However, it requires a large amount of simulated data, which can be costly to collect. This can be avoided by learning physics from the physics-constrained loss, which we refer to it as mean squared residual (MSR) loss constructed by the discretized PDE. We investigate the physical information in the MSR loss, which we called long-range entanglements, and identify the challenge that the neural network requires the capacity to model the long-range entanglements in the spatial domain of the PDE, whose patterns vary in different PDEs. To tackle the challenge, we propose LordNet, a tunable and efficient neural network for modeling various entanglements. Inspired by the traditional solvers, LordNet models the long-range entanglements with a series of matrix multiplications, which can be seen as the low-rank approximation to the general fully-connected layers and extracts the dominant pattern with reduced computational cost. The experiments on solving Poisson's equation and (2D and 3D) Navier-Stokes equation demonstrate that the long-range entanglements from the MSR loss can be well modeled by the LordNet, yielding better accuracy and generalization ability than other neural networks. The results show that the Lordnet can be $40\times$ faster than traditional PDE solvers. In addition, LordNet outperforms other modern neural network architectures in accuracy and efficiency with the smallest parameter size.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guoliang Lin, Yongheng Xu, Hanjiang Lai, Jian Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Few-shot learning with $N$-way $K$-shot scheme is an open challenge in machine learning. Many metric-based approaches have been proposed to tackle this problem, e.g., the Matching Networks and CLIP-Adapter. Despite that these approaches have shown significant progress, the mechanism of why these methods succeed has not been well explored. In this paper, we try to interpret these metric-based few-shot learning methods via causal mechanism. We show that the existing approaches can be viewed as specific forms of front-door adjustment, which can alleviate the effect of spurious correlations and thus learn the causality. This causal interpretation could provide us a new perspective to better understand these existing metric-based methods. Further, based on this causal interpretation, we simply introduce two causal methods for metric-based few-shot learning, which considers not only the relationship between examples but also the diversity of representations. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed methods in few-shot classification on various benchmark datasets. Code is available in https://github.com/lingl1024/causalFewShot.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas L. Lee, Amos Storkey</p>
<p>Abstract: For models consisting of a classifier in some representation space, learning online from a non-stationary data stream often necessitates changes in the representation. So, the question arises of what is the best way to adapt the classifier to shifts in representation. Current methods only slowly change the classifier to representation shift, introducing noise into learning as the classifier is misaligned to the representation. We propose DeepCCG, an empirical Bayesian approach to solve this problem. DeepCCG works by updating the posterior of a class conditional Gaussian classifier such that the classifier adapts in one step to representation shift. The use of a class conditional Gaussian classifier also enables DeepCCG to use a log conditional marginal likelihood loss to update the representation. To perform the update to the classifier and representation, DeepCCG maintains a fixed number of examples in memory and so a key part of DeepCCG is selecting what examples to store, choosing the subset that minimises the KL divergence between the true posterior and the posterior induced by the subset. We explore the behaviour of DeepCCG in online continual learning (CL), demonstrating that it performs well against a spectrum of online CL methods and that it reduces the change in performance due to representation shift.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingguo He, Zhewei Wei, Shikun Feng, Zhengjie Huang, Weibin Li, Yu Sun, Dianhai Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) have gained significant popularity in various heterogeneous graph learning tasks. However, most existing HGNNs rely on spatial domain-based methods to aggregate information, i.e., manually selected meta-paths or some heuristic modules, lacking theoretical guarantees. Furthermore, these methods cannot learn arbitrary valid heterogeneous graph filters within the spectral domain, which have limited expressiveness. To tackle these issues, we present a positive spectral heterogeneous graph convolution via positive noncommutative polynomials. Then, using this convolution, we propose PSHGCN, a novel Positive Spectral Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Network. PSHGCN offers a simple yet effective method for learning valid heterogeneous graph filters. Moreover, we demonstrate the rationale of PSHGCN in the graph optimization framework. We conducted an extensive experimental study to show that PSHGCN can learn diverse heterogeneous graph filters and outperform all baselines on open benchmarks. Notably, PSHGCN exhibits remarkable scalability, efficiently handling large real-world graphs comprising millions of nodes and edges. Our codes are available at https://github.com/ivam-he/PSHGCN.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tomohiro Hayase, Ryo Karakida</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is a fundamental component of deep learning, and recent MLP-based architectures, especially the MLP-Mixer, have achieved significant empirical success. Nevertheless, our understanding of why and how the MLP-Mixer outperforms conventional MLPs remains largely unexplored. In this work, we reveal that sparseness is a key mechanism underlying the MLP-Mixers. First, the Mixers have an effective expression as a wider MLP with Kronecker-product weights, clarifying that the Mixers efficiently embody several sparseness properties explored in deep learning. In the case of linear layers, the effective expression elucidates an implicit sparse regularization caused by the model architecture and a hidden relation to Monarch matrices, which is also known as another form of sparse parameterization. Next, for general cases, we empirically demonstrate quantitative similarities between the Mixer and the unstructured sparse-weight MLPs. Following a guiding principle proposed by Golubeva, Neyshabur and Gur-Ari (2021), which fixes the number of connections and increases the width and sparsity, the Mixers can demonstrate improved performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hieu Le, Jian Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: Lossy compression has become an important technique to reduce data size in many domains. This type of compression is especially valuable for large-scale scientific data, whose size ranges up to several petabytes. Although Autoencoder-based models have been successfully leveraged to compress images and videos, such neural networks have not widely gained attention in the scientific data domain. Our work presents a neural network that not only significantly compresses large-scale scientific data, but also maintains high reconstruction quality. The proposed model is tested with scientific benchmark data available publicly and applied to a large-scale high-resolution climate modeling data set. Our model achieves a compression ratio of 140 on several benchmark data sets without compromising the reconstruction quality. 2D simulation data from the High-Resolution Community Earth System Model (CESM) Version 1.3 over 500 years are also being compressed with a compression ratio of 200 while the reconstruction error is negligible for scientific analysis.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04661">On the power of graph neural networks and the role of the activation function</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sammy Khalife, Amitabh Basu</p>
<p>Abstract: In this article we present new results about the expressivity of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). We prove that for any GNN with piecewise polynomial activations, whose architecture size does not grow with the graph input sizes, there exists a pair of non-isomorphic rooted trees of depth two such that the GNN cannot distinguish their root vertex up to an arbitrary number of iterations. The proof relies on tools from the algebra of symmetric polynomials. In contrast, it was already known that unbounded GNNs (those whose size is allowed to change with the graph sizes) with piecewise polynomial activations can distinguish these vertices in only two iterations. It was also known prior to our work that with ReLU (piecewise linear) activations, bounded GNNs are weaker than unbounded GNNs [Aamand & Al., 2022]. Our approach adds to this result by extending it to handle any piecewise polynomial activation function, which goes towards answering an open question formulated by Grohe [Grohe,2021] more completely. Our second result states that if one allows activations that are not piecewise polynomial, then in two iterations a single neuron perceptron can distinguish the root vertices of any pair of nonisomorphic trees of depth two (our results hold for activations like the sigmoid, hyperbolic tan and others). This shows how the power of graph neural networks can change drastically if one changes the activation function of the neural networks. The proof of this result utilizes the Lindemann-Weierstrauss theorem from transcendental number theory.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Paula Chen, Tingwei Meng, Zongren Zou, J\'er\^ome Darbon, George Em Karniadakis</p>
<p>Abstract: We address two major challenges in scientific machine learning (SciML): interpretability and computational efficiency. We increase the interpretability of certain learning processes by establishing a new theoretical connection between optimization problems arising from SciML and a generalized Hopf formula, which represents the viscosity solution to a Hamilton-Jacobi partial differential equation (HJ PDE) with time-dependent Hamiltonian. Namely, we show that when we solve certain regularized learning problems with integral-type losses, we actually solve an optimal control problem and its associated HJ PDE with time-dependent Hamiltonian. This connection allows us to reinterpret incremental updates to learned models as the evolution of an associated HJ PDE and optimal control problem in time, where all of the previous information is intrinsically encoded in the solution to the HJ PDE. As a result, existing HJ PDE solvers and optimal control algorithms can be reused to design new efficient training approaches for SciML that naturally coincide with the continual learning framework, while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. As a first exploration of this connection, we consider the special case of linear regression and leverage our connection to develop a new Riccati-based methodology for solving these learning problems that is amenable to continual learning applications. We also provide some corresponding numerical examples that demonstrate the potential computational and memory advantages our Riccati-based approach can provide.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sangamesh Kodge, Gobinda Saha, Kaushik Roy</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine unlearning is a prominent and challenging field, driven by regulatory demands for user data deletion and heightened privacy awareness. Existing approaches involve retraining model or multiple finetuning steps for each deletion request, often constrained by computational limits and restricted data access. In this work, we introduce a novel class unlearning algorithm designed to strategically eliminate specific classes from the learned model. Our algorithm first estimates the Retain and the Forget Spaces using Singular Value Decomposition on the layerwise activations for a small subset of samples from the retain and unlearn classes, respectively. We then compute the shared information between these spaces and remove it from the forget space to isolate class-discriminatory feature space. Finally, we obtain the unlearned model by updating the weights to suppress the class discriminatory features from the activation spaces. We demonstrate our algorithm's efficacy on ImageNet using a Vision Transformer with only $\sim 1.5\%$ drop in retain accuracy compared to the original model while maintaining under $1\%$ accuracy on the unlearned class samples. Further, our algorithm consistently performs well when subject to Membership Inference Attacks showing $7.8\%$ improvement on average across a variety of image classification datasets and network architectures, as compared to other baselines while being $\sim 6 \times$ more computationally efficient.

<p>Abstract: This paper proposes the use of causal modeling to detect and mitigate algorithmic bias that is nonlinear in the protected attribute. We provide a general overview of our approach. We use the German Credit data set, which is available for download from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, to develop (1) a prediction model, which is treated as a black box, and (2) a causal model for bias mitigation. In this paper, we focus on age bias and the problem of binary classification. We show that the probability of getting correctly classified as "low risk" is lowest among young people. The probability increases with age nonlinearly. To incorporate the nonlinearity into the causal model, we introduce a higher order polynomial term. Based on the fitted causal model, the de-biased probability estimates are computed, showing improved fairness with little impact on overall classification accuracy. Causal modeling is intuitive and, hence, its use can enhance explicability and promotes trust among different stakeholders of AI.</p>

<p>Abstract: Inverse molecular design with diffusion models holds great potential for advancements in material and drug discovery. Despite success in unconditional molecule generation, integrating multiple properties such as synthetic score and gas permeability as condition constraints into diffusion models remains unexplored. We present the Graph Diffusion Transformer (Graph DiT) for multi-conditional molecular generation. Graph DiT has a condition encoder to learn the representation of numerical and categorical properties and utilizes a Transformer-based graph denoiser to achieve molecular graph denoising under conditions. Unlike previous graph diffusion models that add noise separately on the atoms and bonds in the forward diffusion process, we propose a graph-dependent noise model for training Graph DiT, designed to accurately estimate graph-related noise in molecules. We extensively validate the Graph DiT for multi-conditional polymer and small molecule generation. Results demonstrate our superiority across metrics from distribution learning to condition control for molecular properties. A polymer inverse design task for gas separation with feedback from domain experts further demonstrates its practical utility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonathan Balasingham, Viktor Zamaraev, Vitaliy Kurlin</p>
<p>Abstract: Periodic material or crystal property prediction using machine learning has grown popular in recent years as it provides a computationally efficient replacement for classical simulation methods. A crucial first step for any of these algorithms is the representation used for a periodic crystal. While similar objects like molecules and proteins have a finite number of atoms and their representation can be built based upon a finite point cloud interpretation, periodic crystals are unbounded in size, making their representation more challenging. In the present work, we adapt the Pointwise Distance Distribution (PDD), a continuous and generically complete isometry invariant for periodic point sets, as a representation for our learning algorithm. The PDD distinguished all (more than 660 thousand) periodic crystals in the Cambridge Structural Database as purely periodic sets of points without atomic types. We develop a transformer model with a modified self-attention mechanism that combines PDD with compositional information via a spatial encoding method. This model is tested on the crystals of the Materials Project and Jarvis-DFT databases and shown to produce accuracy on par with state-of-the-art methods while being several times faster in both training and prediction time.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have seen significant use in domains such as natural language processing and computer vision. Going beyond text, image and graphics, LLMs present a significant potential for analysis of time series data, benefiting domains such as climate, IoT, healthcare, traffic, audio and finance. This survey paper provides an in-depth exploration and a detailed taxonomy of the various methodologies employed to harness the power of LLMs for time series analysis. We address the inherent challenge of bridging the gap between LLMs' original text data training and the numerical nature of time series data, and explore strategies for transferring and distilling knowledge from LLMs to numerical time series analysis. We detail various methodologies, including (1) direct prompting of LLMs, (2) time series quantization, (3) aligning techniques, (4) utilization of the vision modality as a bridging mechanism, and (5) the combination of LLMs with tools. Additionally, this survey offers a comprehensive overview of the existing multimodal time series and text datasets and delves into the challenges and future opportunities of this emerging field.

<p>Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated significant success in various applications, such as node classification, link prediction, and graph classification. Active learning for GNNs aims to query the valuable samples from the unlabeled data for annotation to maximize the GNNs' performance at a lower cost. However, most existing algorithms for reinforced active learning in GNNs may lead to a highly imbalanced class distribution, especially in highly skewed class scenarios. GNNs trained with class-imbalanced labeled data are susceptible to bias toward majority classes, and the lower performance of minority classes may lead to a decline in overall performance. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel class-balanced and reinforced active learning framework for GNNs, namely, GCBR. It learns an optimal policy to acquire class-balanced and informative nodes for annotation, maximizing the performance of GNNs trained with selected labeled nodes. GCBR designs class-balance-aware states, as well as a reward function that achieves trade-off between model performance and class balance. The reinforcement learning algorithm Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) is employed to learn an optimal policy stably and efficiently. We further upgrade GCBR to GCBR++ by introducing a punishment mechanism to obtain a more class-balanced labeled set. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches, achieving superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yeonhong Park, Jake Hyun, SangLyul Cho, Bonggeun Sim, Jae W. Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, considerable efforts have been directed towards compressing Large Language Models (LLMs), which showcase groundbreaking capabilities across diverse applications but entail significant deployment costs due to their large sizes. Meanwhile, much less attention has been given to mitigating the costs associated with deploying multiple LLMs of varying sizes despite its practical significance. Thus, this paper introduces \emph{any-precision LLM}, extending the concept of any-precision DNN to LLMs. Addressing challenges in any-precision LLM, we propose a lightweight method for any-precision quantization of LLMs, leveraging a post-training quantization framework, and develop a specialized software engine for its efficient serving. As a result, our solution significantly reduces the high costs of deploying multiple, different-sized LLMs by overlaying LLMs quantized to varying bit-widths, such as 3, 4, ..., $n$ bits, into a memory footprint comparable to a single $n$-bit LLM. All the supported LLMs with varying bit-widths demonstrate state-of-the-art model quality and inference throughput, proving itself to be a compelling option for deployment of multiple, different-sized LLMs. Our code is open-sourced and available online.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bruno Laboissiere Camargos Borges, Bruno Machado Pacheco, Danilo Silva</p>
<p>Abstract: Semantic segmentation plays a crucial role in various computer vision applications, yet its efficacy is often hindered by the lack of high-quality labeled data. To address this challenge, a common strategy is to leverage models trained on data from different populations, such as publicly available datasets. This approach, however, leads to the distribution shift problem, presenting a reduced performance on the population of interest. In scenarios where model errors can have significant consequences, selective prediction methods offer a means to mitigate risks and reduce reliance on expert supervision. This paper investigates selective prediction for semantic segmentation in low-resource settings, thus focusing on post-hoc confidence estimators applied to pre-trained models operating under distribution shift. We propose a novel image-level confidence measure tailored for semantic segmentation and demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments on three medical imaging tasks. Our findings show that post-hoc confidence estimators offer a cost-effective approach to reducing the impacts of distribution shift.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benjamin Decardi-Nelson, Abdulelah S. Alshehri, Akshay Ajagekar, Fengqi You</p>
<p>Abstract: This article explores how emerging generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) models, such as large language models (LLMs), can enhance solution methodologies within process systems engineering (PSE). These cutting-edge GenAI models, particularly foundation models (FMs), which are pre-trained on extensive, general-purpose datasets, offer versatile adaptability for a broad range of tasks, including responding to queries, image generation, and complex decision-making. Given the close relationship between advancements in PSE and developments in computing and systems technologies, exploring the synergy between GenAI and PSE is essential. We begin our discussion with a compact overview of both classic and emerging GenAI models, including FMs, and then dive into their applications within key PSE domains: synthesis and design, optimization and integration, and process monitoring and control. In each domain, we explore how GenAI models could potentially advance PSE methodologies, providing insights and prospects for each area. Furthermore, the article identifies and discusses potential challenges in fully leveraging GenAI within PSE, including multiscale modeling, data requirements, evaluation metrics and benchmarks, and trust and safety, thereby deepening the discourse on effective GenAI integration into systems analysis, design, optimization, operations, monitoring, and control. This paper provides a guide for future research focused on the applications of emerging GenAI in PSE.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyuan Li, Hong Liu, Denny Zhou, Tengyu Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Instructing the model to generate a sequence of intermediate steps, a.k.a., a chain of thought (CoT), is a highly effective method to improve the accuracy of large language models (LLMs) on arithmetics and symbolic reasoning tasks. However, the mechanism behind CoT remains unclear. This work provides a theoretical understanding of the power of CoT for decoder-only transformers through the lens of expressiveness. Conceptually, CoT empowers the model with the ability to perform inherently serial computation, which is otherwise lacking in transformers, especially when depth is low. Given input length $n$, previous works have shown that constant-depth transformers with finite precision $\mathsf{poly}(n)$ embedding size can only solve problems in $\mathsf{TC}^0$ without CoT. We first show an even tighter expressiveness upper bound for constant-depth transformers with constant-bit precision, which can only solve problems in $\mathsf{AC}^0$, a proper subset of $ \mathsf{TC}^0$. However, with $T$ steps of CoT, constant-depth transformers using constant-bit precision and $O(\log n)$ embedding size can solve any problem solvable by boolean circuits of size $T$. Empirically, enabling CoT dramatically improves the accuracy for tasks that are hard for parallel computation, including the composition of permutation groups, iterated squaring, and circuit value problems, especially for low-depth transformers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongquan Qu, Mohamed Aziz Bhouri, Pierre Gentine</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate representations of unknown and sub-grid physical processes through parameterizations (or closure) in numerical simulations with quantified uncertainty are critical for resolving the coarse-grained partial differential equations that govern many problems ranging from weather and climate prediction to turbulence simulations. Recent advances have seen machine learning (ML) increasingly applied to model these subgrid processes, resulting in the development of hybrid physics-ML models through the integration with numerical solvers. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for the joint estimation of physical parameters and machine learning parameterizations with uncertainty quantification. Our framework incorporates online training and efficient Bayesian inference within a high-dimensional parameter space, facilitated by differentiable programming. This proof of concept underscores the substantial potential of differentiable programming in synergistically combining machine learning with differential equations, thereby enhancing the capabilities of hybrid physics-ML modeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhongkai Hao, Chang Su, Songming Liu, Julius Berner, Chengyang Ying, Hang Su, Anima Anandkumar, Jian Song, Jun Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Pre-training has been investigated to improve the efficiency and performance of training neural operators in data-scarce settings. However, it is largely in its infancy due to the inherent complexity and diversity, such as long trajectories, multiple scales and varying dimensions of partial differential equations (PDEs) data. In this paper, we present a new auto-regressive denoising pre-training strategy, which allows for more stable and efficient pre-training on PDE data and generalizes to various downstream tasks. Moreover, by designing a flexible and scalable model architecture based on Fourier attention, we can easily scale up the model for large-scale pre-training. We train our PDE foundation model with up to 0.5B parameters on 10+ PDE datasets with more than 100k trajectories. Extensive experiments show that we achieve SOTA on these benchmarks and validate the strong generalizability of our model to significantly enhance performance on diverse downstream PDE tasks like 3D data.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiuyu Liang, Weihua Wang, Feilong Bao, Guanglai Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Linear Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are used to classify the node in the graph data. However, we note that most existing linear GCN models perform neural network operations in Euclidean space, which do not explicitly capture the tree-like hierarchical structure exhibited in real-world datasets that modeled as graphs. In this paper, we attempt to introduce hyperbolic space into linear GCN and propose a novel framework for Lorentzian linear GCN. Specifically, we map the learned features of graph nodes into hyperbolic space, and then perform a Lorentzian linear feature transformation to capture the underlying tree-like structure of data. Experimental results on standard citation networks datasets with semi-supervised learning show that our approach yields new state-of-the-art results of accuracy 74.7$\%$ on Citeseer and 81.3$\%$ on PubMed datasets. Furthermore, we observe that our approach can be trained up to two orders of magnitude faster than other nonlinear GCN models on PubMed dataset.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaofei Shen, Chenhao Zhang, Yawen Zhao, Alina Bialkowski, Weitong Tony Chen, Miao Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove information derived from forgotten data while preserving that of the remaining dataset in a well-trained model. With the increasing emphasis on data privacy, several approaches to machine unlearning have emerged. However, these methods typically rely on complete supervision throughout the unlearning process. Unfortunately, obtaining such supervision, whether for the forgetting or remaining data, can be impractical due to the substantial cost associated with annotating real-world datasets. This challenge prompts us to propose a supervision-free unlearning approach that operates without the need for labels during the unlearning process. Specifically, we introduce a variational approach to approximate the distribution of representations for the remaining data. Leveraging this approximation, we adapt the original model to eliminate information from the forgotten data at the representation level. To further address the issue of lacking supervision information, which hinders alignment with ground truth, we introduce a contrastive loss to facilitate the matching of representations between the remaining data and those of the original model, thus preserving predictive performance. Experimental results across various unlearning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, Label-Agnostic Forgetting (LAF) without using any labels, which achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods that rely on full supervision information. Furthermore, our approach excels in semi-supervised scenarios, leveraging limited supervision information to outperform fully supervised baselines. This work not only showcases the viability of supervision-free unlearning in deep models but also opens up a new possibility for future research in unlearning at the representation level.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingyuan Zhou, Huangjie Zheng, Zhendong Wang, Mingzhang Yin, Hai Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Score identity Distillation (SiD), an innovative data-free method that distills the generative capabilities of pretrained diffusion models into a single-step generator. SiD not only facilitates an exponentially fast reduction in Fr\'echet inception distance (FID) during distillation but also approaches or even exceeds the FID performance of the original teacher diffusion models. By reformulating forward diffusion processes as semi-implicit distributions, we leverage three score-related identities to create an innovative loss mechanism. This mechanism achieves rapid FID reduction by training the generator using its own synthesized images, eliminating the need for real data or reverse-diffusion-based generation, all accomplished within significantly shortened generation time. Upon evaluation across four benchmark datasets, the SiD algorithm demonstrates high iteration efficiency during distillation and surpasses competing distillation approaches, whether they are one-step or few-step, data-free, or dependent on training data, in terms of generation quality. This achievement not only redefines the benchmarks for efficiency and effectiveness in diffusion distillation but also in the broader field of diffusion-based generation.

<p>Abstract: While Transformers have revolutionized deep learning, their quadratic attention complexity hinders their ability to process infinitely long inputs. We propose Feedback Attention Memory (FAM), a novel Transformer architecture that leverages a feedback loop to enable the network to attend to its own latent representations. This design fosters the emergence of working memory within the Transformer, allowing it to process indefinitely long sequences. TransformerFAM requires no additional weights, enabling seamless integration with pre-trained models. Our experiments show that TransformerFAM significantly improves Transformer performance on long-context tasks across various model sizes (1B, 8B, and 24B). These results showcase the potential to empower Large Language Models (LLMs) to process sequences of unlimited length.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Roumen Nikolaev Popov</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose an analytical solution for approximating the gradient of the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) in variational inference problems where the statistical model is a Bayesian network consisting of observations drawn from a mixture of a Gaussian distribution embedded in unrelated clutter, known as the clutter problem. The method employs the reparameterization trick to move the gradient operator inside the expectation and relies on the assumption that, because the likelihood factorizes over the observed data, the variational distribution is generally more compactly supported than the Gaussian distribution in the likelihood factors. This allows efficient local approximation of the individual likelihood factors, which leads to an analytical solution for the integral defining the gradient expectation. We integrate the proposed gradient approximation as the expectation step in an EM (Expectation Maximization) algorithm for maximizing ELBO and test against classical deterministic approaches in Bayesian inference, such as the Laplace approximation, Expectation Propagation and Mean-Field Variational Inference. The proposed method demonstrates good accuracy and rate of convergence together with linear computational complexity.</p>

<p>Abstract: Visual Reinforcement Learning is a popular and powerful framework that takes full advantage of the Deep Learning breakthrough. However, it is also known that variations in the input (e.g., different colors of the panorama due to the season of the year) or the task (e.g., changing the speed limit for a car to respect) could require complete retraining of the agents. In this work, we leverage recent developments in unifying latent representations to demonstrate that it is possible to combine the components of an agent, rather than retrain it from scratch. We build upon the recent relative representations framework and adapt it for Visual RL. This allows us to create completely new agents capable of handling environment-task combinations never seen during training. Our work paves the road toward a more accessible and flexible use of reinforcement learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shihao Zhang, kenji kawaguchi, Angela Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: Most works studying representation learning focus only on classification and neglect regression. Yet, the learning objectives and therefore the representation topologies of the two tasks are fundamentally different: classification targets class separation, leading to disconnected representations, whereas regression requires ordinality with respect to the target, leading to continuous representations. We thus wonder how the effectiveness of a regression representation is influenced by its topology, with evaluation based on the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle.
  The IB principle is an important framework that provides principles for learning effectiveness representations. We establish two connections between it and the topology of regression representations. The first connection reveals that a lower intrinsic dimension of the feature space implies a reduced complexity of the representation Z. This complexity can be quantified as the conditional entropy of Z on the target space Y and serves as an upper bound on the generalization error. The second connection suggests learning a feature space that is topologically similar to the target space will better align with the IB principle. Based on these two connections, we introduce PH-Reg, a regularizer specific to regression that matches the intrinsic dimension and topology of the feature space with the target space. Experiments on synthetic and real-world regression tasks demonstrate the benefits of PH-Reg.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have uncovered the genetic basis of complex traits, but show an under-representation of non-European descent individuals, underscoring a critical gap in genetic research. Here, we assess whether we can improve disease prediction across diverse ancestries using multiomic data. We evaluate the performance of Group-LASSO INTERaction-NET (glinternet) and pretrained lasso in disease prediction focusing on diverse ancestries in the UK Biobank. Models were trained on data from White British and other ancestries and validated across a cohort of over 96,000 individuals for 8 diseases. Out of 96 models trained, we report 16 with statistically significant incremental predictive performance in terms of ROC-AUC scores (p-value < 0.05), found for diabetes, arthritis, gall stones, cystitis, asthma and osteoarthritis. For the interaction and pretrained models that outperformed the baseline, the PRS score was the primary driver behind prediction. Our findings indicate that both interaction terms and pre-training can enhance prediction accuracy but for a limited set of diseases and moderate improvements in accuracy</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gevik Grigorian, Sandip V. George, Simon Arridge</p>
<p>Abstract: Data-driven modelling and scientific machine learning have been responsible for significant advances in determining suitable models to describe data. Within dynamical systems, neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs), where the system equations are set to be governed by a neural network, have become a popular tool for this challenge in recent years. However, less emphasis has been placed on systems that are only partially-observed. In this work, we employ a hybrid neural ODE structure, where the system equations are governed by a combination of a neural network and domain-specific knowledge, together with symbolic regression (SR), to learn governing equations of partially-observed dynamical systems. We test this approach on two case studies: A 3-dimensional model of the Lotka-Volterra system and a 5-dimensional model of the Lorenz system. We demonstrate that the method is capable of successfully learning the true underlying governing equations of unobserved states within these systems, with robustness to measurement noise.</p>

This paper seamlessly integrates mirror descent-based variational inference into Gaussian process-based few-shot classification, addressing the challenge of non-conjugate inference. By leveraging non-Euclidean geometry, mirror descent achieves accelerated convergence by providing the steepest descent direction along the corresponding manifold. It also exhibits the parameterization invariance property concerning the variational distribution. Experimental results demonstrate competitive classification accuracy, improved uncertainty quantification, and faster convergence compared to baseline models.

<p>Abstract: Sepsis is a leading cause of mortality in intensive care units (ICUs), representing a substantial medical challenge. The complexity of analyzing diverse vital signs to predict sepsis further aggravates this issue. While deep learning techniques have been advanced for early sepsis prediction, their 'black-box' nature obscures the internal logic, impairing interpretability in critical settings like ICUs. This paper introduces a framework that combines a deep learning model with an attention mechanism that highlights the critical time steps in the forecasting process, thus improving model interpretability and supporting clinical decision-making. We show that the attention mechanism could be adapted to various black box time series forecasting models such as N-HiTS and N-BEATS. Our method preserves the accuracy of conventional deep learning models while enhancing interpretability through attention-weight-generated heatmaps. We evaluated our model on the eICU-CRD dataset, focusing on forecasting vital signs for sepsis patients. We assessed its performance using mean squared error (MSE) and dynamic time warping (DTW) metrics. We explored the attention maps of N-HiTS and N-BEATS, examining the differences in their performance and identifying crucial factors influencing vital sign forecasting.</p>

We selected k-Nearest Neighbour, Multinomial Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression for the glass-box models. We show that Multinomial Naive Bayes and k-Nearest Neighbour perform better if classes with Observer (S) traits are excluded, whereas Logistic Regression obtains its best results when all classes have > 550 entries.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiexia Ye, Weiqi Zhang, Ke Yi, Yongzi Yu, Ziyue Li, Jia Li, Fugee Tsung</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series data are ubiquitous across various domains, making time series analysis critically important. Traditional time series models are task-specific, featuring singular functionality and limited generalization capacity. Recently, large language foundation models have unveiled their remarkable capabilities for cross-task transferability, zero-shot/few-shot learning, and decision-making explainability. This success has sparked interest in the exploration of foundation models to solve multiple time series challenges simultaneously. There are two main research lines, namely pre-training foundation models from scratch for time series and adapting large language foundation models for time series. They both contribute to the development of a unified model that is highly generalizable, versatile, and comprehensible for time series analysis. This survey offers a 3E analytical framework for comprehensive examination of related research. Specifically, we examine existing works from three dimensions, namely Effectiveness, Efficiency and Explainability. In each dimension, we focus on discussing how related works devise tailored solution by considering unique challenges in the realm of time series. Furthermore, we provide a domain taxonomy to help followers keep up with the domain-specific advancements. In addition, we introduce extensive resources to facilitate the field's development, including datasets, open-source, time series libraries. A GitHub repository is also maintained for resource updates (https://github.com/start2020/Awesome-TimeSeries-LLM-FM).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaroslav Averyanov, Alain Celisse</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a novel data-driven strategy to choose the hyperparameter $k$ in the $k$-NN regression estimator without using any hold-out data. We treat the problem of choosing the hyperparameter as an iterative procedure (over $k$) and propose using an easily implemented in practice strategy based on the idea of early stopping and the minimum discrepancy principle. This model selection strategy is proven to be minimax-optimal, under the fixed-design assumption on covariates, over some smoothness function classes, for instance, the Lipschitz functions class on a bounded domain. The novel method often improves statistical performance on artificial and real-world data sets in comparison to other model selection strategies, such as the Hold-out method, 5-fold cross-validation, and AIC criterion. The novelty of the strategy comes from reducing the computational time of the model selection procedure while preserving the statistical (minimax) optimality of the resulting estimator. More precisely, given a sample of size $n$, if one should choose $k$ among $\left\{ 1, \ldots, n \right\}$, and $\left\{ f^1, \ldots, f^n \right\}$ are the estimators of the regression function, the minimum discrepancy principle requires calculation of a fraction of the estimators, while this is not the case for the generalized cross-validation, Akaike's AIC criteria or Lepskii principle.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Takashi Takahashi</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-training (ST) is a simple yet effective semi-supervised learning method. However, why and how ST improves generalization performance by using potentially erroneous pseudo-labels is still not well understood. To deepen the understanding of ST, we derive and analyze a sharp characterization of the behavior of iterative ST when training a linear classifier by minimizing the ridge-regularized convex loss on binary Gaussian mixtures, in the asymptotic limit where input dimension and data size diverge proportionally. The results show that ST improves generalization in different ways depending on the number of iterations. When the number of iterations is small, ST improves generalization performance by fitting the model to relatively reliable pseudo-labels and updating the model parameters by a large amount at each iteration. This suggests that ST works intuitively. On the other hand, with many iterations, ST can gradually improve the direction of the classification plane by updating the model parameters incrementally, using soft labels and small regularization. It is argued that this is because the small update of ST can extract information from the data in an almost noiseless way. However, in the presence of label imbalance, the generalization performance of ST underperforms supervised learning with true labels. To overcome this, two heuristics are proposed to enable ST to achieve nearly compatible performance with supervised learning even with significant label imbalance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad ElNokrashy, Badr AlKhamissi, Mona Diab</p>
<p>Abstract: Language Models pretrained on large textual data have been shown to encode different types of knowledge simultaneously. Traditionally, only the features from the last layer are used when adapting to new tasks or data. We put forward that, when using or finetuning deep pretrained models, intermediate layer features that may be relevant to the downstream task are buried too deep to be used efficiently in terms of needed samples or steps. To test this, we propose a new layer fusion method: Depth-Wise Attention (DWAtt), to help re-surface signals from non-final layers. We compare DWAtt to a basic concatenation-based layer fusion method (Concat), and compare both to a deeper model baseline -- all kept within a similar parameter budget. Our findings show that DWAtt and Concat are more step- and sample-efficient than the baseline, especially in the few-shot setting. DWAtt outperforms Concat on larger data sizes. On CoNLL-03 NER, layer fusion shows 3.68--9.73% F1 gain at different few-shot sizes. The layer fusion models presented significantly outperform the baseline in various training scenarios with different data sizes, architectures, and training constraints.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Julian Todt, Simon Hanisch, Thorsten Strufe</p>
<p>Abstract: Face images are a rich source of information that can be used to identify individuals and infer private information about them. To mitigate this privacy risk, anonymizations employ transformations on clear images to obfuscate sensitive information, all while retaining some utility. Albeit published with impressive claims, they sometimes are not evaluated with convincing methodology.
  Reversing anonymized images to resemble their real input -- and even be identified by face recognition approaches -- represents the strongest indicator for flawed anonymization. Some recent results indeed indicate that this is possible for some approaches. It is, however, not well understood, which approaches are reversible, and why. In this paper, we provide an exhaustive investigation in the phenomenon of face anonymization reversibility. Among other things, we find that 11 out of 15 tested face anonymizations are at least partially reversible and highlight how both reconstruction and inversion are the underlying processes that make reversal possible.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samuel Chevalier, Spyros Chatzivasileiadis</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning, which can generate extremely fast and highly accurate black-box surrogate models, is increasingly being applied to a variety of AC power flow problems. Rigorously verifying the accuracy of the resulting black-box models, however, is computationally challenging. This paper develops a tractable neural network verification procedure which incorporates the ground truth of the non-linear AC power flow equations to determine worst-case neural network prediction error. Our approach, termed Sequential Targeted Tightening (STT), leverages a loosely convexified reformulation of the original verification problem, which is an intractable mixed integer quadratic program (MIQP). Using the sequential addition of targeted cuts, we iteratively tighten our formulation until either the solution is sufficiently tight or a satisfactory performance guarantee has been generated. After learning neural network models of the 14, 57, 118, and 200-bus PGLib test cases, we compare the performance guarantees generated by our STT procedure with ones generated by a state-of-the-art MIQP solver, Gurobi 11.0. We show that STT often generates performance guarantees which are far tighter than the MIQP upper bound.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonathan Balasingham, Viktor Zamaraev, Vitaliy Kurlin</p>
<p>Abstract: The structure-property hypothesis says that the properties of all materials are determined by an underlying crystal structure. The main obstacle was the ambiguity of conventional crystal representations based on incomplete or discontinuous descriptors that allow false negatives or false positives. This ambiguity was resolved by the ultra-fast Pointwise Distance Distribution (PDD), which distinguished all periodic structures in the world's largest collection of real materials (Cambridge Structural Database). The state-of-the-art results in property predictions were previously achieved by graph neural networks based on various graph representations of periodic crystals, including the Crystal Graph with vertices at all atoms in a crystal unit cell. This work adapts the Pointwise Distance Distribution for a simpler graph whose vertex set is not larger than the asymmetric unit of a crystal structure. The new Distribution Graph reduces mean-absolute-error by 0.6\%-12\% while having 44\%-88\% of the number of vertices when compared to the crystal graph when applied on the Materials Project and Jarvis-DFT datasets using CGCNN and ALIGNN. Methods for hyper-parameters selection for the graph are backed by the theoretical results of the Pointwise Distance Distribution and are then experimentally justified.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyunseung Kim (Seoul National University), Haeyeon Choi (Ewha Womans University), Dongju Kang (Seoul National University), Won Bo Lee (Seoul National University), Jonggeol Na (Ewha Womans University)</p>
<p>Abstract: The goal of most materials discovery is to discover materials that are superior to those currently known. Fundamentally, this is close to extrapolation, which is a weak point for most machine learning models that learn the probability distribution of data. Herein, we develop reinforcement learning-guided combinatorial chemistry, which is a rule-based molecular designer driven by trained policy for selecting subsequent molecular fragments to get a target molecule. Since our model has the potential to generate all possible molecular structures that can be obtained from combinations of molecular fragments, unknown molecules with superior properties can be discovered. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that our model is more suitable for discovering better compounds than probability distribution-learning models. In an experiment aimed at discovering molecules that hit seven extreme target properties, our model discovered 1,315 of all target-hitting molecules and 7,629 of five target-hitting molecules out of 100,000 trials, whereas the probability distribution-learning models failed. Moreover, it has been confirmed that every molecule generated under the binding rules of molecular fragments is 100% chemically valid. To illustrate the performance in actual problems, we also demonstrate that our models work well on two practical applications: discovering protein docking molecules and HIV inhibitors.</p>

<p>Abstract: Music demixing is the task of separating different tracks from the given single audio signal into components, such as drums, bass, and vocals from the rest of the accompaniment. Separation of sources is useful for a range of areas, including entertainment and hearing aids. In this paper, we introduce two new benchmarks for the sound source separation tasks and compare popular models for sound demixing, as well as their ensembles, on these benchmarks. For the models' assessments, we provide the leaderboard at https://mvsep.com/quality_checker/, giving a comparison for a range of models. The new benchmark datasets are available for download. We also develop a novel approach for audio separation, based on the ensembling of different models that are suited best for the particular stem. The proposed solution was evaluated in the context of the Music Demixing Challenge 2023 and achieved top results in different tracks of the challenge. The code and the approach are open-sourced on GitHub.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Felix F Zimmermann, Christoph Kolbitsch, Patrick Schuenke, Andreas Kofler</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantitative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (qMRI) enables the reproducible measurement of biophysical parameters in tissue. The challenge lies in solving a nonlinear, ill-posed inverse problem to obtain the desired tissue parameter maps from acquired raw data. While various learned and non-learned approaches have been proposed, the existing learned methods fail to fully exploit the prior knowledge about the underlying MR physics, i.e. the signal model and the acquisition model. In this paper, we propose PINQI, a novel qMRI reconstruction method that integrates the knowledge about the signal, acquisition model, and learned regularization into a single end-to-end trainable neural network. Our approach is based on unrolled alternating optimization, utilizing differentiable optimization blocks to solve inner linear and non-linear optimization tasks, as well as convolutional layers for regularization of the intermediate qualitative images and parameter maps. This design enables PINQI to leverage the advantages of both the signal model and learned regularization. We evaluate the performance of our proposed network by comparing it with recently published approaches in the context of highly undersampled $T_1$-mapping, using both a simulated brain dataset, as well as real scanner data acquired from a physical phantom and in-vivo data from healthy volunteers. The results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed solution over existing methods and highlight the effectiveness of our method in real-world scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyuan Zhao, Xueying Ding, B. Aditya Prakash</p>
<p>Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a promising deep learning framework for approximating numerical solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs). However, conventional PINNs, relying on multilayer perceptrons (MLP), neglect the crucial temporal dependencies inherent in practical physics systems and thus fail to propagate the initial condition constraints globally and accurately capture the true solutions under various scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a novel Transformer-based framework, termed PINNsFormer, designed to address this limitation. PINNsFormer can accurately approximate PDE solutions by utilizing multi-head attention mechanisms to capture temporal dependencies. PINNsFormer transforms point-wise inputs into pseudo sequences and replaces point-wise PINNs loss with a sequential loss. Additionally, it incorporates a novel activation function, Wavelet, which anticipates Fourier decomposition through deep neural networks. Empirical results demonstrate that PINNsFormer achieves superior generalization ability and accuracy across various scenarios, including PINNs failure modes and high-dimensional PDEs. Moreover, PINNsFormer offers flexibility in integrating existing learning schemes for PINNs, further enhancing its performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Fischer, Tobias Ritschel</p>
<p>Abstract: Gradient-based optimization is now ubiquitous across graphics, but unfortunately can not be applied to problems with undefined or zero gradients. To circumvent this issue, the loss function can be manually replaced by a ``surrogate'' that has similar minima but is differentiable. Our proposed framework, ZeroGrads, automates this process by learning a neural approximation of the objective function, which in turn can be used to differentiate through arbitrary black-box graphics pipelines. We train the surrogate on an actively smoothed version of the objective and encourage locality, focusing the surrogate's capacity on what matters at the current training episode. The fitting is performed online, alongside the parameter optimization, and self-supervised, without pre-computed data or pre-trained models. As sampling the objective is expensive (it requires a full rendering or simulator run), we devise an efficient sampling scheme that allows for tractable run-times and competitive performance at little overhead. We demonstrate optimizing diverse non-convex, non-differentiable black-box problems in graphics, such as visibility in rendering, discrete parameter spaces in procedural modelling or optimal control in physics-driven animation. In contrast to other derivative-free algorithms, our approach scales well to higher dimensions, which we demonstrate on problems with up to 35k interlinked variables.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junhui Liang, Ying Liu, Vladimir Vlassov</p>
<p>Abstract: Fashion understanding is a hot topic in computer vision, with many applications having great business value in the market. Fashion understanding remains a difficult challenge for computer vision due to the immense diversity of garments and various scenes and backgrounds. In this work, we try removing the background from fashion images to boost data quality and increase model performance. Having fashion images of evident persons in fully visible garments, we can utilize Salient Object Detection to achieve the background removal of fashion data to our expectations. A fashion image with the background removed is claimed as the "rembg" image, contrasting with the original one in the fashion dataset. We conducted extensive comparative experiments with these two types of images on multiple aspects of model training, including model architectures, model initialization, compatibility with other training tricks and data augmentations, and target task types. Our experiments show that background removal can effectively work for fashion data in simple and shallow networks that are not susceptible to overfitting. It can improve model accuracy by up to 5% in the classification on the FashionStyle14 dataset when training models from scratch. However, background removal does not perform well in deep neural networks due to incompatibility with other regularization techniques like batch normalization, pre-trained initialization, and data augmentations introducing randomness. The loss of background pixels invalidates many existing training tricks in the model training, adding the risk of overfitting for deep models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Carlos N\'u\~nez-Molina, Masataro Asai, Pablo Mesejo, Juan Fern\'andez-Olivares</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, there has been growing interest in utilizing modern machine learning techniques to learn heuristic functions for forward search algorithms. Despite this, there has been little theoretical understanding of what they should learn, how to train them, and why we do so. This lack of understanding has resulted in the adoption of diverse training targets (suboptimal vs optimal costs vs admissible heuristics) and loss functions (e.g., square vs absolute errors) in the literature. In this work, we focus on how to effectively utilize the information provided by admissible heuristics in heuristic learning. We argue that learning from poly-time admissible heuristics by minimizing mean square errors (MSE) is not the correct approach, since its result is merely a noisy, inadmissible copy of an efficiently computable heuristic. Instead, we propose to model the learned heuristic as a truncated gaussian, where admissible heuristics are used not as training targets but as lower bounds of this distribution. This results in a different loss function from the MSE commonly employed in the literature, which implicitly models the learned heuristic as a gaussian distribution. We conduct experiments where both MSE and our novel loss function are applied to learning a heuristic from optimal plan costs. Results show that our proposed method converges faster during training and yields better heuristics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shihong Liu, Zhiqiu Lin, Samuel Yu, Ryan Lee, Tiffany Ling, Deepak Pathak, Deva Ramanan</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) pre-trained on web-scale datasets have demonstrated remarkable capabilities on downstream tasks when fine-tuned with minimal data. However, many VLMs rely on proprietary data and are not open-source, which restricts the use of white-box approaches for fine-tuning. As such, we aim to develop a black-box approach to optimize VLMs through natural language prompts, thereby avoiding the need to access model parameters, feature embeddings, or even output logits. We propose employing chat-based LLMs to search for the best text prompt for VLMs. Specifically, we adopt an automatic hill-climbing procedure that converges to an effective prompt by evaluating the performance of current prompts and asking LLMs to refine them based on textual feedback, all within a conversational process without human-in-the-loop. In a challenging 1-shot image classification setup, our simple approach surpasses the white-box continuous prompting method (CoOp) by an average of 1.5% across 11 datasets including ImageNet. Our approach also outperforms both human-engineered and LLM-generated prompts. We highlight the advantage of conversational feedback that incorporates both positive and negative prompts, suggesting that LLMs can utilize the implicit gradient direction in textual feedback for a more efficient search. In addition, we find that the text prompts generated through our strategy are not only more interpretable but also transfer well across different VLM architectures in a black-box manner. Lastly, we apply our framework to optimize the state-of-the-art black-box VLM (DALL-E 3) for text-to-image generation, prompt inversion, and personalization.</p>

<p>Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are general-purpose artificial intelligence (AI) models that have recently enabled multiple brand-new generative AI applications. The rapid advances in FMs serve as an important contextual backdrop for the vision of next-generation wireless networks, where federated learning (FL) is a key enabler of distributed network intelligence. Currently, the exploration of the interplay between FMs and FL is still in its nascent stage. Naturally, FMs are capable of boosting the performance of FL, and FL could also leverage decentralized data and computing resources to assist in the training of FMs. However, the exceptionally high requirements that FMs have for computing resources, storage, and communication overhead would pose critical challenges to FL-enabled wireless networks. In this article, we explore the extent to which FMs are suitable for FL over wireless networks, including a broad overview of research challenges and opportunities. In particular, we discuss multiple new paradigms for realizing future intelligent networks that integrate FMs and FL. We also consolidate several broad research directions associated with these paradigms.</p>

We present a novel image-based Virtual Try-On application VTON-IT that takes an RGB image, segments desired body part, and overlays target cloth over the segmented body region. Most state-of-the-art GAN-based Virtual Try-On applications produce unaligned pixelated synthesis images on real-life test images.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cyrus Zhou, Pedro Savarese, Vaughn Richard, Zack Hassman, Xin Yuan, Michael Maire, Michael DiBrino, Yanjing Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent quantization techniques have enabled heterogeneous precisions at very fine granularity, e.g., each parameter/activation can take on a different precision, resulting in compact neural networks without sacrificing accuracy. However, there is a lack of efficient architectural support for such networks, which require additional hardware to decode the precision settings for individual variables, align the variables, and provide fine-grained mixed-precision compute capabilities. The complexity of these operations introduces high overheads. Thus, the improvements in inference latency/energy of these networks are not commensurate with the compression ratio, and may be inferior to larger quantized networks with uniform precisions.
  We present an end-to-end co-design approach encompassing computer architecture, training algorithm, and inference optimization to efficiently execute networks with fine-grained heterogeneous precisions. The key to our approach is a novel training algorithm designed to accommodate hardware constraints and inference operation requirements, outputting networks with input-channel-wise heterogeneous precisions and at most three precision levels. Combined with inference optimization techniques, existing architectures with low-cost enhancements can support such networks efficiently, yielding optimized tradeoffs between accuracy, compression ratio and inference latency/energy.
  We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach across CPU and GPU architectures. For various representative neural networks, our approach achieves >10x improvements in both compression ratio and inference latency, with negligible degradation in accuracy compared to full-precision networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qi Fan (Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot, China), Haolin Zuo (Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot, China), Rui Liu (Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot, China), Zheng Lian (Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China), Guanglai Gao (Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot, China)</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition (MER) in practical scenarios is significantly challenged by the presence of missing or incomplete data across different modalities. To overcome these challenges, researchers have aimed to simulate incomplete conditions during the training phase to enhance the system's overall robustness. Traditional methods have often involved discarding data or substituting data segments with zero vectors to approximate these incompletenesses. However, such approaches neither accurately represent real-world conditions nor adequately address the issue of noisy data availability. For instance, a blurry image cannot be simply replaced with zero vectors, and still retain information. To tackle this issue and develop a more precise MER system, we introduce a novel noise-robust MER model that effectively learns robust multimodal joint representations from noisy data. This approach includes two pivotal components: firstly, a noise scheduler that adjusts the type and level of noise in the data to emulate various realistic incomplete situations. Secondly, a Variational AutoEncoder (VAE)-based module is employed to reconstruct these robust multimodal joint representations from the noisy inputs. Notably, the introduction of the noise scheduler enables the exploration of an entirely new type of incomplete data condition, which is impossible with existing methods. Extensive experimental evaluations on the benchmark datasets IEMOCAP and CMU-MOSEI demonstrate the effectiveness of the noise scheduler and the excellent performance of our proposed model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lei Zhang, Mukesh Ghimire, Wenlong Zhang, Zhe Xu, Yi Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: Solving Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) PDEs numerically enables equilibrial feedback control in two-player differential games, yet faces the curse of dimensionality (CoD). While physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have shown promise in alleviating CoD in solving PDEs, vanilla PINNs fall short in learning discontinuous solutions due to their sampling nature, leading to poor safety performance of the resulting policies when values are discontinuous due to state or temporal logic constraints. In this study, we explore three potential solutions to this challenge: (1) a hybrid learning method that is guided by both supervisory equilibria and the HJI PDE, (2) a value-hardening method where a sequence of HJIs are solved with increasing Lipschitz constant on the constraint violation penalty, and (3) the epigraphical technique that lifts the value to a higher dimensional state space where it becomes continuous. Evaluations through 5D and 9D vehicle and 13D drone simulations reveal that the hybrid method outperforms others in terms of generalization and safety performance by taking advantage of both the supervisory equilibrium values and costates, and the low cost of PINN loss gradients.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhu Li, Dimitri Meunier, Mattes Mollenhauer, Arthur Gretton</p>
<p>Abstract: We present the first optimal rates for infinite-dimensional vector-valued ridge regression on a continuous scale of norms that interpolate between $L_2$ and the hypothesis space, which we consider as a vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert space. These rates allow to treat the misspecified case in which the true regression function is not contained in the hypothesis space. We combine standard assumptions on the capacity of the hypothesis space with a novel tensor product construction of vector-valued interpolation spaces in order to characterize the smoothness of the regression function. Our upper bound not only attains the same rate as real-valued kernel ridge regression, but also removes the assumption that the target regression function is bounded. For the lower bound, we reduce the problem to the scalar setting using a projection argument. We show that these rates are optimal in most cases and independent of the dimension of the output space. We illustrate our results for the special case of vector-valued Sobolev spaces.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuyang Sun, Runjia Li, Philip Torr, Xiuye Gu, Siyang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing open-vocabulary image segmentation methods require a fine-tuning step on mask labels and/or image-text datasets. Mask labels are labor-intensive, which limits the number of categories in segmentation datasets. Consequently, the vocabulary capacity of pre-trained VLMs is severely reduced after fine-tuning. However, without fine-tuning, VLMs trained under weak image-text supervision tend to make suboptimal mask predictions. To alleviate these issues, we introduce a novel recurrent framework that progressively filters out irrelevant texts and enhances mask quality without training efforts. The recurrent unit is a two-stage segmenter built upon a frozen VLM. Thus, our model retains the VLM's broad vocabulary space and equips it with segmentation ability. Experiments show that our method outperforms not only the training-free counterparts, but also those fine-tuned with millions of data samples, and sets the new state-of-the-art records for both zero-shot semantic and referring segmentation. Concretely, we improve the current record by 28.8, 16.0, and 6.9 mIoU on Pascal VOC, COCO Object, and Pascal Context.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alessandro Ilic Mezza, Riccardo Giampiccolo, Alberto Bernardini, Augusto Sarti</p>
<p>Abstract: In the past, the field of drum source separation faced significant challenges due to limited data availability, hindering the adoption of cutting-edge deep learning methods that have found success in other related audio applications. In this manuscript, we introduce StemGMD, a large-scale audio dataset of isolated single-instrument drum stems. Each audio clip is synthesized from MIDI recordings of expressive drums performances using ten real-sounding acoustic drum kits. Totaling 1224 hours, StemGMD is the largest audio dataset of drums to date and the first to comprise isolated audio clips for every instrument in a canonical nine-piece drum kit. We leverage StemGMD to develop LarsNet, a novel deep drum source separation model. Through a bank of dedicated U-Nets, LarsNet can separate five stems from a stereo drum mixture faster than real-time and is shown to significantly outperform state-of-the-art nonnegative spectro-temporal factorization methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tiago P. Peixoto</p>
<p>Abstract: Network reconstruction consists in determining the unobserved pairwise couplings between $N$ nodes given only observational data on the resulting behavior that is conditioned on those couplings -- typically a time-series or independent samples from a graphical model. A major obstacle to the scalability of algorithms proposed for this problem is a seemingly unavoidable quadratic complexity of $\Omega(N^2)$, corresponding to the requirement of each possible pairwise coupling being contemplated at least once, despite the fact that most networks of interest are sparse, with a number of non-zero couplings that is only $O(N)$. Here we present a general algorithm applicable to a broad range of reconstruction problems that significantly outperforms this quadratic baseline. Our algorithm relies on a stochastic second neighbor search (Dong et al., 2011) that produces the best edge candidates with high probability, thus bypassing an exhaustive quadratic search. If we rely on the conjecture that the second-neighbor search finishes in log-linear time (Baron & Darling, 2020; 2022), we demonstrate theoretically that our algorithm finishes in subquadratic time, with a data-dependent complexity loosely upper bounded by $O(N^{3/2}\log N)$, but with a more typical log-linear complexity of $O(N\log^2N)$. In practice, we show that our algorithm achieves a performance that is many orders of magnitude faster than the quadratic baseline -- in a manner consistent with our theoretical analysis -- allows for easy parallelization, and thus enables the reconstruction of networks with hundreds of thousands and even millions of nodes and edges.</p>

<p>Abstract: Supervised finetuning (SFT) on instruction datasets has played a crucial role in achieving the remarkable zero-shot generalization capabilities observed in modern large language models (LLMs). However, the annotation efforts required to produce high quality responses for instructions are becoming prohibitively expensive, especially as the number of tasks spanned by instruction datasets continues to increase. Active learning is effective in identifying useful subsets of samples to annotate from an unlabeled pool, but its high computational cost remains a barrier to its widespread applicability in the context of LLMs. To mitigate the annotation cost of SFT and circumvent the computational bottlenecks of active learning, we propose using experimental design. Experimental design techniques select the most informative samples to label, and typically maximize some notion of uncertainty and/or diversity. In our work, we implement a framework that evaluates several existing and novel experimental design techniques and find that these methods consistently yield significant gains in label efficiency with little computational overhead. On generative tasks, our methods achieve the same generalization performance with only $50\%$ of annotation cost required by random sampling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Di Chen, Hao Li, Zhicheng Jin, Huizhao Tu, Meixin Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) have the potential to prevent accidents caused by drivers errors and reduce road traffic risks. Due to the nature of heavy vehicles, whose collisions cause more serious crashes, the weights of vehicles need to be considered when making driving strategies aimed at reducing the potential risks and their consequences in the context of autonomous driving. This study develops an autonomous driving strategy based on risk anticipation, considering the weights of surrounding vehicles and using hierarchical deep reinforcement learning. A risk indicator integrating surrounding vehicles weights, based on the risk field theory, is proposed and incorporated into autonomous driving decisions. A hybrid action space is designed to allow for left lane changes, right lane changes and car-following, which enables AVs to act more freely and realistically whenever possible. To solve the above hybrid decision-making problem, a hierarchical proximal policy optimization (HPPO) algorithm with an attention mechanism (AT-HPPO) is developed, providing great advantages in maintaining stable performance with high robustness and generalization. An indicator, potential collision energy in conflicts (PCEC), is newly proposed to evaluate the performance of the developed AV driving strategy from the perspective of the consequences of potential accidents. The performance evaluation results in simulation and dataset demonstrate that our model provides driving strategies that reduce both the likelihood and consequences of potential accidents, at the same time maintaining driving efficiency. The developed method is especially meaningful for AVs driving on highways, where heavy vehicles make up a high proportion of the traffic.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shazia'Ayn Babul, Desislava Hristova, Antonio Lima, Renaud Lambiotte, Mariano Beguerisse-D\'iaz</p>
<p>Abstract: We explore the social and contextual factors that influence the outcome of person-to-person music recommendations and discovery. Specifically, we use data from Spotify to investigate how a link sent from one user to another results in the receiver engaging with the music of the shared artist. We consider several factors that may influence this process, such as the strength of the sender-receiver relationship, the user's role in the Spotify social network, their music social cohesion, and how similar the new artist is to the receiver's taste. We find that the receiver of a link is more likely to engage with a new artist when (1) they have similar music taste to the sender and the shared track is a good fit for their taste, (2) they have a stronger and more intimate tie with the sender, and (3) the shared artist is popular amongst the receiver's connections. Finally, we use these findings to build a Random Forest classifier to predict whether a shared music track will result in the receiver's engagement with the shared artist. This model elucidates which type of social and contextual features are most predictive, although peak performance is achieved when a diverse set of features are included. These findings provide new insights into the multifaceted mechanisms underpinning the interplay between music discovery and social processes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amirhosein Ghasemabadi, Muhammad Kamran Janjua, Mohammad Salameh, Chunhua Zhou, Fengyu Sun, Di Niu</p>
<p>Abstract: Image restoration tasks traditionally rely on convolutional neural networks. However, given the local nature of the convolutional operator, they struggle to capture global information. The promise of attention mechanisms in Transformers is to circumvent this problem, but it comes at the cost of intensive computational overhead. Many recent studies in image restoration have focused on solving the challenge of balancing performance and computational cost via Transformer variants. In this paper, we present CascadedGaze Network (CGNet), an encoder-decoder architecture that employs Global Context Extractor (GCE), a novel and efficient way to capture global information for image restoration. The GCE module leverages small kernels across convolutional layers to learn global dependencies, without requiring self-attention. Extensive experimental results show that our computationally efficient approach performs competitively to a range of state-of-the-art methods on synthetic image denoising and single image deblurring tasks, and pushes the performance boundary further on the real image denoising task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hamed Poursiami, Ihsen Alouani, Maryam Parsa</p>
<p>Abstract: With the mainstream integration of machine learning into security-sensitive domains such as healthcare and finance, concerns about data privacy have intensified. Conventional artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been found vulnerable to several attacks that can leak sensitive data. Particularly, model inversion (MI) attacks enable the reconstruction of data samples that have been used to train the model. Neuromorphic architectures have emerged as a paradigm shift in neural computing, enabling asynchronous and energy-efficient computation. However, little to no existing work has investigated the privacy of neuromorphic architectures against model inversion. Our study is motivated by the intuition that the non-differentiable aspect of spiking neural networks (SNNs) might result in inherent privacy-preserving properties, especially against gradient-based attacks. To investigate this hypothesis, we propose a thorough exploration of SNNs' privacy-preserving capabilities. Specifically, we develop novel inversion attack strategies that are comprehensively designed to target SNNs, offering a comparative analysis with their conventional ANN counterparts. Our experiments, conducted on diverse event-based and static datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed attack strategies and therefore questions the assumption of inherent privacy-preserving in neuromorphic architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zongbo Han, Zechen Bai, Haiyang Mei, Qianli Xu, Changqing Zhang, Mike Zheng Shou</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive capability in visual information understanding with human language. Despite these advances, LVLMs still face challenges with multimodal hallucination, such as generating text descriptions of objects that are not present in the visual information. However, the underlying fundamental reasons of multimodal hallucinations remain poorly explored. In this paper, we propose a new perspective, suggesting that the inherent biases in LVLMs might be a key factor in hallucinations. Specifically, we systematically identify a semantic shift bias related to paragraph breaks (\n\n), where the content before and after '\n\n' in the training data frequently exhibit significant semantic changes. This pattern leads the model to infer that the contents following '\n\n' should be obviously different from the preceding contents with less hallucinatory descriptions, thereby increasing the probability of hallucinatory descriptions subsequent to the '\n\n'. We have validated this hypothesis on multiple publicly available LVLMs. Besides, we find that deliberately inserting '\n\n' at the generated description can induce more hallucinations. A simple method is proposed to effectively mitigate the hallucination of LVLMs by skipping the output of '\n'.</p>

This study specifically addresses the latter, focusing on an examination of current definitions of representational harms to discern what is included and what is not. This analysis motivates our expansion beyond behavioral definitions to encompass harms to cognitive and affective states. The paper outlines high-level requirements for measurement: identifying the necessary expertise to implement this approach and illustrating it through a case study. Our work highlights the unique vulnerabilities of large language models to perpetrating representational harms, particularly when these harms go unmeasured and unmitigated. The work concludes by presenting proposed mitigations and delineating when to employ them. The overarching aim of this research is to establish a framework for broadening the definition of representational harms and to translate insights from fairness research into practical measurement and mitigation praxis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas D Swinburne, Danny Perez</p>
<p>Abstract: Bayesian regression determines model parameters by minimizing the expected loss, an upper bound to the true generalization error. However, the loss ignores misspecification, where models are imperfect. Parameter uncertainties from Bayesian regression are thus significantly underestimated and vanish in the large data limit. This is particularly problematic when building models of low- noise, or near-deterministic, calculations, as the main source of uncertainty is neglected. We analyze the generalization error of misspecified, near-deterministic surrogate models, a regime of broad relevance in science and engineering. We show posterior distributions must cover every training point to avoid a divergent generalization error and design an ansatz that respects this constraint, which for linear models incurs minimal overhead. This is demonstrated on model problems before application to thousand dimensional datasets in atomistic machine learning. Our efficient misspecification-aware scheme gives accurate prediction and bounding of test errors where existing schemes fail, allowing this important source of uncertainty to be incorporated in computational workflows.</p>

We introduce an AI-guided computational screening framework unifying linguistic reasoning with quantum-chemistry based feedback from 3D atomistic representations. Our approach formulates catalyst discovery as an uncertain environment where an agent actively searches for highly effective catalysts via the iterative combination of large language model (LLM)-derived hypotheses and atomistic graph neural network (GNN)-derived feedback. Identified catalysts in intermediate search steps undergo structural evaluation based on spatial orientation, reaction pathways, and stability. Scoring functions based on adsorption energies and barriers steer the exploration in the LLM's knowledge space toward energetically favorable, high-efficiency catalysts. We introduce planning methods that automatically guide the exploration without human input, providing competitive performance against expert-enumerated chemical descriptor-based implementations. By integrating language-guided reasoning with computational chemistry feedback, our work pioneers AI-accelerated, trustworthy catalyst discovery.</p>

<p>Abstract: Interventions targeting the representation space of language models (LMs) have emerged as an effective means to influence model behavior. Such methods are employed, for example, to eliminate or alter the encoding of demographic information such as gender within the model's representations and, in so doing, create a counterfactual representation. However, because the intervention operates within the representation space, understanding precisely what aspects of the text it modifies poses a challenge. In this paper, we give a method to convert representation counterfactuals into string counterfactuals. We demonstrate that this approach enables us to analyze the linguistic alterations corresponding to a given representation space intervention and to interpret the features utilized to encode a specific concept. Moreover, the resulting counterfactuals can be used to mitigate bias in classification through data augmentation.</p>

While traditional image features are widely utilized in such cases, their use is rapidly being supplanted by Neural Network-based techniques that often sacrifice explainability in exchange for high accuracy. To ameliorate this trade-off, we propose a synthetic data-based technique that results in explainable features. We show, using Explainable Boosting Machines (EBMs), that this method offers superior explainability without sacrificing accuracy. Specifically, we show that there is a meaningful benefit to this technique in the context of quantum dot tuning, where human intervention is necessary at the current stage of development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Orion Weller, Benjamin Chang, Sean MacAvaney, Kyle Lo, Arman Cohan, Benjamin Van Durme, Dawn Lawrie, Luca Soldaini</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern Language Models (LMs) are capable of following long and complex instructions that enable a large and diverse set of user requests. While Information Retrieval (IR) models use these LMs as the backbone of their architectures, virtually none of them allow users to provide detailed instructions alongside queries, thus limiting their ability to satisfy complex information needs. In this work, we study the use of instructions in IR systems. First, we introduce our dataset FollowIR, which contains a rigorous instruction evaluation benchmark as well as a training set for helping IR models learn to better follow real-world instructions. FollowIR repurposes detailed instructions -- also known as narratives -- developed for professional assessors to evaluate retrieval systems. In particular, we build our benchmark from three collections curated for shared tasks at the Text REtrieval Conference (TREC). These collections contains hundreds to thousands of labeled documents per query, making them suitable for our exploration. Through this process, we can measure how well IR models follow instructions, through a new pairwise evaluation framework. Our results indicate that existing retrieval models fail to correctly use instructions, using them for basic keywords and struggling to understand long-form information. However, we show that it is possible for IR models to learn to follow complex instructions: our new FollowIR-7B model has significant improvements after fine-tuning on our training set.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sadanand Modak, Noah Patton, Isil Dillig, Joydeep Biswas</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of preference learning, which aims to learn user-specific preferences (e.g., "good parking spot", "convenient drop-off location") from visual input. Despite its similarity to learning factual concepts (e.g., "red cube"), preference learning is a fundamentally harder problem due to its subjective nature and the paucity of person-specific training data. We address this problem using a new framework called Synapse, which is a neuro-symbolic approach designed to efficiently learn preferential concepts from limited demonstrations. Synapse represents preferences as neuro-symbolic programs in a domain-specific language (DSL) that operates over images, and leverages a novel combination of visual parsing, large language models, and program synthesis to learn programs representing individual preferences. We evaluate Synapse through extensive experimentation including a user case study focusing on mobility-related concepts in mobile robotics and autonomous driving. Our evaluation demonstrates that Synapse significantly outperforms existing baselines as well as its own ablations.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongyu Cai, Arjun Arunasalam, Leo Y. Lin, Antonio Bianchi, Z. Berkay Celik</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly integrated with various applications. To ensure that LLMs do not generate unsafe responses, they are aligned with safeguards that specify what content is restricted. However, such alignment can be bypassed to produce prohibited content using a technique commonly referred to as jailbreak. Different systems have been proposed to perform the jailbreak automatically. These systems rely on evaluation methods to determine whether a jailbreak attempt is successful. However, our analysis reveals that current jailbreak evaluation methods have two limitations. (1) Their objectives lack clarity and do not align with the goal of identifying unsafe responses. (2) They oversimplify the jailbreak result as a binary outcome, successful or not. In this paper, we propose three metrics, safeguard violation, informativeness, and relative truthfulness, to evaluate language model jailbreak. Additionally, we demonstrate how these metrics correlate with the goal of different malicious actors. To compute these metrics, we introduce a multifaceted approach that extends the natural language generation evaluation method after preprocessing the response. We evaluate our metrics on a benchmark dataset produced from three malicious intent datasets and three jailbreak systems. The benchmark dataset is labeled by three annotators. We compare our multifaceted approach with three existing jailbreak evaluation methods. Experiments demonstrate that our multifaceted evaluation outperforms existing methods, with F1 scores improving on average by 17% compared to existing baselines. Our findings motivate the need to move away from the binary view of the jailbreak problem and incorporate a more comprehensive evaluation to ensure the safety of the language model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Ali Labbaf Khaniki, Mohammad Manthouri</p>
<p>Abstract: Lung segmentation in chest X-ray images is of paramount importance as it plays a crucial role in the diagnosis and treatment of various lung diseases. This paper presents a novel approach for lung segmentation in chest X-ray images by integrating U-net with attention mechanisms. The proposed method enhances the U-net architecture by incorporating a Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), which unifies three distinct attention mechanisms: channel attention, spatial attention, and pixel attention. The channel attention mechanism enables the model to concentrate on the most informative features across various channels. The spatial attention mechanism enhances the model's precision in localization by focusing on significant spatial locations. Lastly, the pixel attention mechanism empowers the model to focus on individual pixels, further refining the model's focus and thereby improving the accuracy of segmentation. The adoption of the proposed CBAM in conjunction with the U-net architecture marks a significant advancement in the field of medical imaging, with potential implications for improving diagnostic precision and patient outcomes. The efficacy of this method is validated against contemporary state-of-the-art techniques, showcasing its superiority in segmentation performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Machine learning has the potential to revolutionize passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) for ecological assessments. However, high annotation and compute costs limit the field's efficacy. Generalizable pretrained networks can overcome these costs, but high-quality pretraining requires vast annotated libraries, limiting its current applicability primarily to bird taxa. Here, we identify the optimum pretraining strategy for a data-deficient domain using coral reef bioacoustics. We assemble ReefSet, a large annotated library of reef sounds, though modest compared to bird libraries at 2% of the sample count. Through testing few-shot transfer learning performance, we observe that pretraining on bird audio provides notably superior generalizability compared to pretraining on ReefSet or unrelated audio alone. However, our key findings show that cross-domain mixing which leverages bird, reef and unrelated audio during pretraining maximizes reef generalizability. SurfPerch, our pretrained network, provides a strong foundation for automated analysis of marine PAM data with minimal annotation and compute costs.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17589">An Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning Algorithm Customized for Multi-Task Fusion in Large-Scale Recommender Systems</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Peng Liu, Cong Xu, Ming Zhao, Jiawei Zhu, Bin Wang, Yi Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: As the last critical stage of RSs, Multi-Task Fusion (MTF) is responsible for combining multiple scores outputted by Multi-Task Learning (MTL) into a final score to maximize user satisfaction, which determines the ultimate recommendation results. Recently, to optimize long-term user satisfaction within a recommendation session, Reinforcement Learning (RL) is used for MTF in the industry. However, the off-policy RL algorithms used for MTF so far have the following severe problems: 1) to avoid out-of-distribution (OOD) problem, their constraints are overly strict, which seriously damage their performance; 2) they are unaware of the exploration policy used for producing training data and never interact with real environment, so only suboptimal policy can be learned; 3) the traditional exploration policies are inefficient and hurt user experience. To solve the above problems, we propose a novel method named IntegratedRL-MTF customized for MTF in large-scale RSs. IntegratedRL-MTF integrates off-policy RL model with our online exploration policy to relax overstrict and complicated constraints, which significantly improves its performance. We also design an extremely efficient exploration policy, which eliminates low-value exploration space and focuses on exploring potential high-value state-action pairs. Moreover, we adopt progressive training mode to further enhance our model's performance with the help of our exploration policy. We conduct extensive offline and online experiments in the short video channel of Tencent News. The results demonstrate that our model outperforms other models remarkably. IntegratedRL-MTF has been fully deployed in our RS and other large-scale RSs in Tencent, which have achieved significant improvements.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00285">iMTSP: Solving Min-Max Multiple Traveling Salesman Problem with Imperative Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Guo, Zhongqiang Ren, Chen Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper considers a Min-Max Multiple Traveling Salesman Problem (MTSP), where the goal is to find a set of tours, one for each agent, to collectively visit all the cities while minimizing the length of the longest tour. Though MTSP has been widely studied, obtaining near-optimal solutions for large-scale problems is still challenging due to its NP-hardness. Recent efforts in data-driven methods face challenges of the need for hard-to-obtain supervision and issues with high variance in gradient estimations, leading to slow convergence and highly suboptimal solutions. We address these issues by reformulating MTSP as a bilevel optimization problem, using the concept of imperative learning (IL). This involves introducing an allocation network that decomposes the MTSP into multiple single-agent traveling salesman problems (TSPs). The longest tour from these TSP solutions is then used to self-supervise the allocation network, resulting in a new self-supervised, bilevel, end-to-end learning framework, which we refer to as imperative MTSP (iMTSP). Additionally, to tackle the high-variance gradient issues during the optimization, we introduce a control variate-based gradient estimation algorithm. Our experiments showed that these innovative designs enable our gradient estimator to converge 20% faster than the advanced reinforcement learning baseline and find up to 80% shorter tour length compared with Google OR-Tools MTSP solver, especially in large-scale problems (e.g. 1000 cities and 15 agents).</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01015">Network reconstruction via the minimum description length principle</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Tiago P. Peixoto</p>
<p>Abstract: A fundamental problem associated with the task of network reconstruction from dynamical or behavioral data consists in determining the most appropriate model complexity in a manner that prevents overfitting, and produces an inferred network with a statistically justifiable number of edges. The status quo in this context is based on $L_{1}$ regularization combined with cross-validation. However, besides its high computational cost, this commonplace approach unnecessarily ties the promotion of sparsity with weight "shrinkage". This combination forces a trade-off between the bias introduced by shrinkage and the network sparsity, which often results in substantial overfitting even after cross-validation. In this work, we propose an alternative nonparametric regularization scheme based on hierarchical Bayesian inference and weight quantization, which does not rely on weight shrinkage to promote sparsity. Our approach follows the minimum description length (MDL) principle, and uncovers the weight distribution that allows for the most compression of the data, thus avoiding overfitting without requiring cross-validation. The latter property renders our approach substantially faster to employ, as it requires a single fit to the complete data. As a result, we have a principled and efficient inference scheme that can be used with a large variety of generative models, without requiring the number of edges to be known in advance. We also demonstrate that our scheme yields systematically increased accuracy in the reconstruction of both artificial and empirical networks. We highlight the use of our method with the reconstruction of interaction networks between microbial communities from large-scale abundance samples involving in the order of $10^{4}$ to $10^{5}$ species, and demonstrate how the inferred model can be used to predict the outcome of interventions in the system.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01975">Introducing a microstructure-embedded autoencoder approach for reconstructing high-resolution solution field data from a reduced parametric space</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Rasoul Najafi Koopas, Shahed Rezaei, Natalie Rauter, Richard Ostwald, Rolf Lammering</p>
<p>Abstract: In this study, we develop a novel multi-fidelity deep learning approach that transforms low-fidelity solution maps into high-fidelity ones by incorporating parametric space information into a standard autoencoder architecture. This method's integration of parametric space information significantly reduces the need for training data to effectively predict high-fidelity solutions from low-fidelity ones. In this study, we examine a two-dimensional steady-state heat transfer analysis within a highly heterogeneous materials microstructure. The heat conductivity coefficients for two different materials are condensed from a 101 x 101 grid to smaller grids. We then solve the boundary value problem on the coarsest grid using a pre-trained physics-informed neural operator network known as Finite Operator Learning (FOL). The resulting low-fidelity solution is subsequently upscaled back to a 101 x 101 grid using a newly designed enhanced autoencoder. The novelty of the developed enhanced autoencoder lies in the concatenation of heat conductivity maps of different resolutions to the decoder segment in distinct steps. Hence the developed algorithm is named microstructure-embedded autoencoder (MEA). We compare the MEA outcomes with those from finite element methods, the standard U-Net, and various other upscaling techniques, including interpolation functions and feedforward neural networks (FFNN). Our analysis shows that MEA outperforms these methods in terms of computational efficiency and error on test cases. As a result, the MEA serves as a potential supplement to neural operator networks, effectively upscaling low-fidelity solutions to high fidelity while preserving critical details often lost in traditional upscaling methods, particularly at sharp interfaces like those seen with interpolation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziqi Gao, Tao Feng, Jiaxuan You, Chenyi Zi, Yan Zhou, Chen Zhang, Jia Li</p>
<p>Abstract: AlphaFold can be used for both single-chain and multi-chain protein structure prediction, while the latter becomes extremely challenging as the number of chains increases. In this work, by taking each chain as a node and assembly actions as edges, we show that an acyclic undirected connected graph can be used to predict the structure of multi-chain protein complexes (a.k.a., protein complex modelling, PCM). However, there are still two challenges: 1) The huge combinatorial optimization space of $N^{N-2}$ ($N$ is the number of chains) for the PCM problem can easily lead to high computational cost. 2) The scales of protein complexes exhibit distribution shift due to variance in chain numbers, which calls for the generalization in modelling complexes of various scales. To address these challenges, we propose GAPN, a Generative Adversarial Policy Network powered by domain-specific rewards and adversarial loss through policy gradient for automatic PCM prediction. Specifically, GAPN learns to efficiently search through the immense assembly space and optimize the direct docking reward through policy gradient. Importantly, we design an adversarial reward function to enhance the receptive field of our model. In this way, GAPN will simultaneously focus on a specific batch of complexes and the global assembly rules learned from complexes with varied chain numbers. Empirically, we have achieved both significant accuracy (measured by RMSD and TM-Score) and efficiency improvements compared to leading PCM softwares.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02968">CoverLib: Classifiers-equipped Experience Library by Iterative Problem Distribution Coverage Maximization for Domain-tuned Motion Planning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hirokazu Ishida, Naoki Hiraoka, Kei Okada, Masayuki Inaba</p>
<p>Abstract: Library-based methods are known to be very effective for fast motion planning by adapting an experience retrieved from a precomputed library. This article presents CoverLib, a principled approach for constructing and utilizing such a library. CoverLib iteratively adds an experience-classifier-pair to the library, where each classifier corresponds to an adaptable region of the experience within the problem space. This iterative process is an active procedure, as it selects the next experience based on its ability to effectively cover the uncovered region. During the query phase, these classifiers are utilized to select an experience that is expected to be adaptable for a given problem. Experimental results demonstrate that CoverLib effectively mitigates the trade-off between plannability and speed observed in global (e.g. sampling-based) and local (e.g. optimization-based) methods. As a result, it achieves both fast planning and high success rates over the problem domain. Moreover, due to its adaptation-algorithm-agnostic nature, CoverLib seamlessly integrates with various adaptation methods, including nonlinear programming-based and sampling-based algorithms.</p>
