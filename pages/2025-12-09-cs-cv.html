<p><b>Authors:</b> Hokin Deng</p>
<p>Abstract: We show that video generation models could reason now. Testing on tasks such as chess, maze, Sudoku, mental rotation, and Raven's Matrices, leading models such as Sora-2 achieve sixty percent success rates. We establish a robust experimental paradigm centered on the "Task Pair" design. We build a code framework, with 39 models available already, that supports this paradigm and allows for easy scaling - users can add models and tasks efficiently. We show our automated evaluation strongly correlates with human judgment, and therefore this paradigm is highly scalable. We see an opportunity, given the availability of our paradigm, to do reinforcement learning for improving reasoning in video models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenyue Yu, Jianyu Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of storage and communication costs for large-scale datasets in resource-constrained edge devices by proposing a novel dataset quantization approach to reduce intra-sample redundancy. Unlike traditional dataset pruning and distillation methods that focus on inter-sample redundancy, the proposed method compresses each image by reducing redundant or less informative content within samples while preserving essential features. It first applies linear symmetric quantization to obtain an initial quantization range and scale for each sample. Then, an adaptive quantization allocation algorithm is introduced to distribute different quantization ratios for samples with varying precision requirements, maintaining a constant total compression ratio. The main contributions include: (1) being the first to use limited bits to represent datasets for storage reduction; (2) introducing a dataset-level quantization algorithm with adaptive ratio allocation; and (3) validating the method's effectiveness through extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-1K. Results show that the method maintains model training performance while achieving significant dataset compression, outperforming traditional quantization and dataset pruning baselines under the same compression ratios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junho Kim, Seongwon Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating a coherent 3D scene representation from multi-view images is a fundamental yet challenging task. Existing methods often struggle with multi-view fusion, leading to fragmented 3D representations and sub-optimal performance. To address this, we introduce VG3T, a novel multi-view feed-forward network that predicts a 3D semantic occupancy via a 3D Gaussian representation. Unlike prior methods that infer Gaussians from single-view images, our model directly predicts a set of semantically attributed Gaussians in a joint, multi-view fashion. This novel approach overcomes the fragmentation and inconsistency inherent in view-by-view processing, offering a unified paradigm to represent both geometry and semantics. We also introduce two key components, Grid-Based Sampling and Positional Refinement, to mitigate the distance-dependent density bias common in pixel-aligned Gaussian initialization methods. Our VG3T shows a notable 1.7%p improvement in mIoU while using 46% fewer primitives than the previous state-of-the-art on the nuScenes benchmark, highlighting its superior efficiency and performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chang Liu, Tianjiao Jing, Chengcheng Ma, Xuanqi Zhou, Zhengxuan Lian, Qin Jin, Hongliang Yuan, Shi-Sheng Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent photo-realistic 3D talking head via 3D Gaussian Splatting still has significant shortcoming in emotional expression manipulation, especially for fine-grained and expansive dynamics emotional editing using multi-modal control. This paper introduces a new editable 3D Gaussian talking head, i.e. EmoDiffTalk. Our key idea is a novel Emotion-aware Gaussian Diffusion, which includes an action unit (AU) prompt Gaussian diffusion process for fine-grained facial animator, and moreover an accurate text-to-AU emotion controller to provide accurate and expansive dynamic emotional editing using text input. Experiments on public EmoTalk3D and RenderMe-360 datasets demonstrate superior emotional subtlety, lip-sync fidelity, and controllability of our EmoDiffTalk over previous works, establishing a principled pathway toward high-quality, diffusion-driven, multimodal editable 3D talking-head synthesis. To our best knowledge, our EmoDiffTalk is one of the first few 3D Gaussian Splatting talking-head generation framework, especially supporting continuous, multimodal emotional editing within the AU-based expression space.</p>

<p>Abstract: Foundation models have transformed computational pathology by providing generalizable representations from large-scale histology datasets. However, existing models are predominantly trained on surgical pathology data, which is enriched for non-nervous tissue and overrepresents neoplastic, inflammatory, metabolic, and other non-neurological diseases. Neuropathology represents a markedly different domain of histopathology, characterized by unique cell types (neurons, glia, etc.), distinct cytoarchitecture, and disease-specific pathological features including neurofibrillary tangles, amyloid plaques, Lewy bodies, and pattern-specific neurodegeneration. This domain mismatch may limit the ability of general-purpose foundation models to capture the morphological patterns critical for interpreting neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and cerebellar ataxias. To address this gap, we developed NeuroFM, a foundation model trained specifically on whole-slide images of brain tissue spanning diverse neurodegenerative pathologies. NeuroFM demonstrates superior performance compared to general-purpose models across multiple neuropathology-specific downstream tasks, including mixed dementia disease classification, hippocampal region segmentation, and neurodegenerative ataxia identification encompassing cerebellar essential tremor and spinocerebellar ataxia subtypes. This work establishes that domain-specialized foundation models trained on brain tissue can better capture neuropathology-specific features than models trained on general surgical pathology datasets. By tailoring foundation models to the unique morphological landscape of neurodegenerative diseases, NeuroFM enables more accurate and reliable AI-based analysis for brain disease diagnosis and research, setting a precedent for domain-specific model development in specialized areas of digital pathology.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Liu, Jingyu Song, Vedanth Kallakuri, Katherine A. Skinner</p>
<p>Abstract: Analyzing underwater fish imagery is critical for ecological monitoring but remains difficult due to visual degradation and costly annotations. We introduce FishDetector-R1, a unified MLLM-based framework for fish detection, segmentation, and counting under weak supervision. On the DeepFish dataset, our framework achieves substantial gains over baselines, improving AP by 20% and mIoU by 10%, while reducing MAE by 30% and GAME by 35%. These improvements stem from two key components: a novel detect-to-count prompt that enforces spatially consistent detections and counts, and Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Reward (RLVR) with a complementary scalable paradigm leveraging sparse point labels. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of this reward design. Moreover, the improvement generalizes well to other underwater datasets, confirming strong cross-domain robustness. Overall, FishDetector-R1 provides a reliable and scalable solution for accurate marine visual understanding via weak supervision.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ramin Sharifi, Pouya Shiri, Amirali Baniasadi</p>
<p>Abstract: Capsule Networks (CapsNets) are a generation of image classifiers with proven advantages over Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Better robustness to affine transformation and overlapping image detection are some of the benefits associated with CapsNets. However, CapsNets cannot be classified as resource-efficient deep learning architecture due to the high number of Primary Capsules (PCs). In addition, CapsNets' training and testing are slow and resource hungry. This paper investigates the possibility of Primary Capsules pruning in CapsNets on MNIST handwritten digits, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN datasets. We show that a pruned version of CapsNet performs up to 9.90 times faster than the conventional architecture by removing 95 percent of Capsules without a loss of accuracy. Also, our pruned architecture saves on more than 95.36 percent of floating-point operations in the dynamic routing stage of the architecture. Moreover, we provide insight into why some datasets benefit significantly from pruning while others fall behind.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b>  Xuefei (Julie),  Wang, Kai A. Horstmann, Ethan Lin, Jonathan Chen, Alexander R. Farhang, Sophia Stiles, Atharva Sehgal, Jonathan Light, David Van Valen, Yisong Yue, Jennifer J. Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Adapting production-level computer vision tools to bespoke scientific datasets is a critical "last mile" bottleneck. Current solutions are impractical: fine-tuning requires large annotated datasets scientists often lack, while manual code adaptation costs scientists weeks to months of effort. We consider using AI agents to automate this manual coding, and focus on the open question of optimal agent design for this targeted task. We introduce a systematic evaluation framework for agentic code optimization and use it to study three production-level biomedical imaging pipelines. We demonstrate that a simple agent framework consistently generates adaptation code that outperforms human-expert solutions. Our analysis reveals that common, complex agent architectures are not universally beneficial, leading to a practical roadmap for agent design. We open source our framework and validate our approach by deploying agent-generated functions into a production pipeline, demonstrating a clear pathway for real-world impact.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06010">Fast and Flexible Robustness Certificates for Semantic Segmentation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas Massena (IRIT-MISFIT, DTIPG - SNCF, UT3), Corentin Friedrich (IRIT-MISFIT), Franck Mamalet (IRIT-MISFIT), Mathieu Serrurier (IRIT-MISFIT)</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep Neural Networks are vulnerable to small perturbations that can drastically alter their predictions for perceptually unchanged inputs. The literature on adversarially robust Deep Learning attempts to either enhance the robustness of neural networks (e.g, via adversarial training) or to certify their decisions up to a given robustness level (e.g, by using randomized smoothing, formal methods or Lipschitz bounds). These studies mostly focus on classification tasks and few efficient certification procedures currently exist for semantic segmentation. In this work, we introduce a new class of certifiably robust Semantic Segmentation networks with built-in Lipschitz constraints that are efficiently trainable and achieve competitive pixel accuracy on challenging datasets such as Cityscapes. Additionally, we provide a novel framework that generalizes robustness certificates for semantic segmentation tasks, where we showcase the flexibility and computational efficiency of using Lipschitz networks. Our approach unlocks real-time compatible certifiably robust semantic segmentation for the first time. Moreover, it allows the computation of worst-case performance under $\ell_2$ attacks of radius $\epsilon$ across a wide range of performance measures. Crucially, we benchmark the runtime of our certification process and find our approach to be around 600 times faster than randomized smoothing methods at inference with comparable certificates on an NVIDIA A100 GPU. Finally, we evaluate the tightness of our worstcase certificates against state-of-the-art adversarial attacks to further validate the performance of our method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emmanuel Akeweje, Conall Kirk, Chi-Wai Chan, Denis Dowling, Mimi Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Selective Laser Melting (SLM) is a powder-bed additive manufacturing technique whose part quality depends critically on feedstock morphology. However, conventional powder characterization methods are low-throughput and qualitative, failing to capture the heterogeneity of industrial-scale batches. We present an automated, machine learning framework that couples high-throughput imaging with shape extraction and clustering to profile metallic powder morphology at scale. We develop and evaluate three clustering pipelines: an autoencoder pipeline, a shape-descriptor pipeline, and a functional-data pipeline. Across a dataset of approximately 126,000 powder images (0.5-102 micrometer diameter), internal validity metrics identify the Fourier-descriptor + k-means pipeline as the most effective, achieving the lowest Davies-Bouldin index and highest Calinski-Harabasz score while maintaining sub-millisecond runtime per particle on a standard desktop workstation. Although the present work focuses on establishing the morphological-clustering framework, the resulting shape groups form a basis for future studies examining their relationship to flowability, packing density, and SLM part quality. Overall, this unsupervised learning framework enables rapid, automated assessment of powder morphology and supports tracking of shape evolution across reuse cycles, offering a path toward real-time feedstock monitoring in SLM workflows.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenhao Li, Chengwei Ma, Weixin Mao</p>
<p>Abstract: In robot learning, Vision Transformers (ViTs) are standard for visual perception, yet most methods discard valuable information by using only the final layer's features. We argue this provides an insufficient representation and propose the Vision Action Transformer (VAT), a novel architecture that is extended from ViT and unlocks the full feature hierarchy of ViT. VAT processes specialized action tokens with visual features across all transformer layers, enabling a deep and progressive fusion of perception and action generation. On a suite of simulated manipulation tasks, VAT achieves a 98.15\% average success rate across four LIBERO benchmarks, establishing a new state-of-the-art by outperforming prior methods like OpenVLA-OFT. Our work presents not only a powerful model for imitation learning but also demonstrates the critical importance of leveraging the complete ''representation trajectory'' of vision models to advance robotic policy.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiho Shin, Dominic Marshall, Matthieu Komorowski</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent foundation models have demonstrated strong performance in medical image representation learning, yet their comparative behaviour across datasets remains underexplored. This work benchmarks two large-scale chest X-ray (CXR) embedding models (CXR-Foundation (ELIXR v2.0) and MedImagelnsight) on public MIMIC-CR and NIH ChestX-ray14 datasets. Each model was evaluated using a unified preprocessing pipeline and fixed downstream classifiers to ensure reproducible comparison. We extracted embeddings directly from pre-trained encoders, trained lightweight LightGBM classifiers on multiple disease labels, and reported mean AUROC, and F1-score with 95% confidence intervals. MedImageInsight achieved slightly higher performance across most tasks, while CXR-Foundation exhibited strong cross-dataset stability. Unsupervised clustering of MedImageIn-sight embeddings further revealed a coherent disease-specific structure consistent with quantitative results. The results highlight the need for standardised evaluation of medical foundation models and establish reproducible baselines for future multimodal and clinical integration studies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenyi Mo, Tianyu Zhang, Yalong Bai, Ligong Han, Ying Ba, Dimitris N. Metaxas</p>
<p>Abstract: Preference-conditioned image generation seeks to adapt generative models to individual users, producing outputs that reflect personal aesthetic choices beyond the given textual prompt. Despite recent progress, existing approaches either fail to capture nuanced user preferences or lack effective mechanisms to encode personalized visual signals. In this work, we propose a multimodal framework that leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to extract rich user representations and inject them into diffusion-based image generation. We train the MLLM with a preference-oriented visual question answering task to capture fine-grained semantic cues. To isolate preference-relevant features, we introduce two complementary probing tasks: inter-user discrimination to distinguish between different users, and intra-user discrimination to separate liked from disliked content. To ensure compatibility with diffusion text encoders, we design a maximum mean discrepancy-based alignment loss that bridges the modality gap while preserving multimodal structure. The resulting embeddings are used to condition the generator, enabling faithful adherence to both prompts and user preferences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms strong baselines in both image quality and preference alignment, highlighting the effectiveness of representation extraction and alignment for personalized generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiabin Liu, Zihao Zhou, Jialei Yan, Anxin Guo, Alvise Benetazzo, Hui Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Precise three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of wave free surfaces and associated velocity fields is essential for developing a comprehensive understanding of ocean physics. To address the high computational cost of dense visual reconstruction in long-term ocean wave observation tasks and the challenges introduced by persistent visual occlusions, we propose an wave free surface visual reconstruction neural network, which is designed as an attention-augmented pyramid architecture tailored to the multi-scale and temporally continuous characteristics of wave motions. Using physics-based constraints, we perform time-resolved reconstruction of nonlinear 3D velocity fields from the evolving free-surface boundary. Experiments under real-sea conditions demonstrate millimetre-level wave elevation prediction in the central region, dominant-frequency errors below 0.01 Hz, precise estimation of high-frequency spectral power laws, and high-fidelity 3D reconstruction of nonlinear velocity fields, while enabling dense reconstruction of two million points in only 1.35 s. Built on a stereo-vision dataset, the model outperforms conventional visual reconstruction approaches and maintains strong generalization in occluded conditions, owing to its global multi-scale attention and its learned encoding of wave propagation dynamics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ranjan Sapkota, Konstantinos I. Roumeliotis, Manoj Karkee</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates the fundamental discontinuity between the latest two Segment Anything Models: SAM2 and SAM3. We explain why the expertise in prompt-based segmentation of SAM2 does not transfer to the multimodal concept-driven paradigm of SAM3. SAM2 operates through spatial prompts points, boxes, and masks yielding purely geometric and temporal segmentation. In contrast, SAM3 introduces a unified vision-language architecture capable of open-vocabulary reasoning, semantic grounding, contrastive alignment, and exemplar-based concept understanding. We structure this analysis through five core components: (1) a Conceptual Break Between Prompt-Based and Concept-Based Segmentation, contrasting spatial prompt semantics of SAM2 with multimodal fusion and text-conditioned mask generation of SAM3; (2) Architectural Divergence, detailing pure vision-temporal design of SAM2 versus integration of vision-language encoders, geometry and exemplar encoders, fusion modules, DETR-style decoders, object queries, and ambiguity-handling via Mixture-of-Experts in SAM3; (3) Dataset and Annotation Differences, contrasting SA-V video masks with multimodal concept-annotated corpora of SAM3; (4) Training and Hyperparameter Distinctions, showing why SAM2 optimization knowledge does not apply to SAM3; and (5) Evaluation, Metrics, and Failure Modes, outlining the transition from geometric IoU metrics to semantic, open-vocabulary evaluation. Together, these analyses establish SAM3 as a new class of segmentation foundation model and chart future directions for the emerging concept-driven segmentation era.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siming Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid advancement of technology, 3D data acquisition and utilization have become increasingly prevalent across various fields, including computer vision, robotics, and geospatial analysis. 3D data, captured through methods such as 3D scanners, LiDARs, and RGB-D cameras, provides rich geometric, shape, and scale information. When combined with 2D images, 3D data offers machines a comprehensive understanding of their environment, benefiting applications like autonomous driving, robotics, remote sensing, and medical treatment. This dissertation focuses on three main areas: supervised representation learning for point cloud primitive segmentation, self-supervised learning methods, and transfer learning from 2D to 3D. Our approach, which integrates pre-trained 2D models to support 3D network training, significantly improves 3D understanding without merely transforming 2D data. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our methods, showcasing their potential to advance point cloud representation learning by effectively integrating 2D knowledge.</p>

<p>Abstract: We study instruction-guided editing of egocentric videos for interactive AR applications. While recent AI video editors perform well on third-person footage, egocentric views present unique challenges - including rapid egomotion and frequent hand-object interactions - that create a significant domain gap. Moreover, existing offline editing pipelines suffer from high latency, limiting real-time interaction. To address these issues, we present a complete ecosystem for egocentric video editing. First, we construct EgoEditData, a carefully designed and manually curated dataset specifically designed for egocentric editing scenarios, featuring rich hand-object interactions, while explicitly preserving hands. Second, we develop EgoEdit, an instruction-following egocentric video editor that supports real-time streaming inference on a single GPU. Finally, we introduce EgoEditBench, an evaluation suite targeting instruction faithfulness, hand and interaction preservation, and temporal stability under egomotion. Across both egocentric and general editing tasks, EgoEdit produces temporally stable, instruction-faithful results with interactive latency. It achieves clear gains on egocentric editing benchmarks-where existing methods struggle-while maintaining performance comparable to the strongest baselines on general editing tasks. EgoEditData and EgoEditBench will be made public for the research community. See our website at https://snap-research.github.io/EgoEdit</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tzofi Klinghoffer, Siddharth Somasundaram, Xiaoyu Xiang, Yuchen Fan, Christian Richardt, Akshat Dave, Ramesh Raskar, Rakesh Ranjan</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D scene reconstruction from a single measurement is challenging, especially in the presence of occluded regions and specular materials, such as mirrors. We address these challenges by leveraging single-photon lidars. These lidars estimate depth from light that is emitted into the scene and reflected directly back to the sensor. However, they can also measure light that bounces multiple times in the scene before reaching the sensor. This multi-bounce light contains additional information that can be used to recover dense depth, occluded geometry, and material properties. Prior work with single-photon lidar, however, has only demonstrated these use cases when a laser sequentially illuminates one scene point at a time. We instead focus on the more practical - and challenging - scenario of illuminating multiple scene points simultaneously. The complexity of light transport due to the combined effects of multiplexed illumination, two-bounce light, shadows, and specular reflections is challenging to invert analytically. Instead, we propose a data-driven method to invert light transport in single-photon lidar. To enable this approach, we create the first large-scale simulated dataset of ~100k lidar transients for indoor scenes. We use this dataset to learn a prior on complex light transport, enabling measured two-bounce light to be decomposed into the constituent contributions from each laser spot. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate how this decomposed light can be used to infer 3D geometry in scenes with occlusions and mirrors from a single measurement. Our code and dataset are released at https://shoot-bounce-3d.github.io.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Karthik Mohan, Sonam Singh, Amit Arvind Kale</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid development of Vision-Language models (VLMs) and Multimodal Language Models (MLLMs) in autonomous driving research has significantly reshaped the landscape by enabling richer scene understanding, context-aware reasoning, and more interpretable decision-making. However, a lot of existing work often relies on either single-view encoders that fail to exploit the spatial structure of multi-camera systems or operate on aggregated multi-view features, which lack a unified spatial representation, making it more challenging to reason about ego-centric directions, object relations, and the wider context. We thus present BeLLA, an end-to-end architecture that connects unified 360{\deg} BEV representations with a large language model for question answering in autonomous driving. We primarily evaluate our work using two benchmarks - NuScenes-QA and DriveLM, where BeLLA consistently outperforms existing approaches on questions that require greater spatial reasoning, such as those involving relative object positioning and behavioral understanding of nearby objects, achieving up to +9.3% absolute improvement in certain tasks. In other categories, BeLLA performs competitively, demonstrating the capability of handling a diverse range of questions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Raghavendra Ramachandra, Sushma Venkatesh</p>
<p>Abstract: Iris recognition is widely recognized as one of the most accurate biometric modalities. However, its growing deployment in real-world applications raises significant concerns regarding its vulnerability to Presentation Attacks (PAs). Effective Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) is therefore critical to ensure the integrity and security of iris-based biometric systems. While conventional iris recognition systems predominantly operate in the near-infrared (NIR) spectrum, multispectral imaging across multiple NIR bands provides complementary reflectance information that can enhance the generalizability of PAD methods. In this work, we propose \textbf{SpectraIrisPAD}, a novel deep learning-based framework for robust multispectral iris PAD. The SpectraIrisPAD leverages a DINOv2 Vision Transformer (ViT) backbone equipped with learnable spectral positional encoding, token fusion, and contrastive learning to extract discriminative, band-specific features that effectively distinguish bona fide samples from various spoofing artifacts. Furthermore, we introduce a new comprehensive dataset Multispectral Iris PAD (\textbf{MSIrPAD}) with diverse PAIs, captured using a custom-designed multispectral iris sensor operating at five distinct NIR wavelengths (800\,nm, 830\,nm, 850\,nm, 870\,nm, and 980\,nm). The dataset includes 18,848 iris images encompassing eight diverse PAI categories, including five textured contact lenses, print attacks, and display-based attacks. We conduct comprehensive experiments under unseen attack evaluation protocols to assess the generalization capability of the proposed method. SpectraIrisPAD consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines across all performance metrics, demonstrating superior robustness and generalizability in detecting a wide range of presentation attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junwen Zheng, Xinran Xu, Li Rong Wang, Chang Cai, Lucinda Siyun Tan, Dingyuan Wang, Hong Liang Tey, Xiuyi Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning has demonstrated expert-level performance in melanoma classification, positioning it as a powerful tool in clinical dermatology. However, model opacity and the lack of interpretability remain critical barriers to clinical adoption, as clinicians often struggle to trust the decision-making processes of black-box models. To address this gap, we present a Cross-modal Explainable Framework for Melanoma (CEFM) that leverages contrastive learning as the core mechanism for achieving interpretability. Specifically, CEFM maps clinical criteria for melanoma diagnosis-namely Asymmetry, Border, and Color (ABC)-into the Vision Transformer embedding space using dual projection heads, thereby aligning clinical semantics with visual features. The aligned representations are subsequently translated into structured textual explanations via natural language generation, creating a transparent link between raw image data and clinical interpretation. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate 92.79% accuracy and an AUC of 0.961, along with significant improvements across multiple interpretability metrics. Qualitative analyses further show that the spatial arrangement of the learned embeddings aligns with clinicians' application of the ABC rule, effectively bridging the gap between high-performance classification and clinical trust.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Su Sun, Cheng Zhao, Himangi Mittal, Gaurav Mittal, Rohith Kukkala, Yingjie Victor Chen, Mei Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating dynamic 4D objects from sparse inputs is difficult because it demands joint preservation of appearance and motion coherence across views and time while suppressing artifacts and temporal drift. We hypothesize that the view discrepancy arises from supervision limited to pixel- or latent-space video-diffusion losses, which lack explicitly temporally aware, feature-level tracking guidance. We present \emph{Track4DGen}, a two-stage framework that couples a multi-view video diffusion model with a foundation point tracker and a hybrid 4D Gaussian Splatting (4D-GS) reconstructor. The central idea is to explicitly inject tracker-derived motion priors into intermediate feature representations for both multi-view video generation and 4D-GS. In Stage One, we enforce dense, feature-level point correspondences inside the diffusion generator, producing temporally consistent features that curb appearance drift and enhance cross-view coherence. In Stage Two, we reconstruct a dynamic 4D-GS using a hybrid motion encoding that concatenates co-located diffusion features (carrying Stage-One tracking priors) with Hex-plane features, and augment them with 4D Spherical Harmonics for higher-fidelity dynamics modeling. \emph{Track4DGen} surpasses baselines on both multi-view video generation and 4D generation benchmarks, yielding temporally stable, text-editable 4D assets. Lastly, we curate \emph{Sketchfab28}, a high-quality dataset for benchmarking object-centric 4D generation and fostering future research.</p>

<p>Abstract: Shearography is an interferometric technique sensitive to surface displacement gradients, providing high sensitivity for detecting subsurface defects in safety-critical components. A key limitation to industrial adoption is the lack of high-quality annotated datasets, since manual labeling remains labor-intensive, subjective, and difficult to standardize. We introduce an automated workflow that generates defect annotations from shearography measurements using deep learning, producing high-resolution segmentation and bounding-box labels. Evaluation against expert-labeled data demonstrates sufficient accuracy to enable weakly supervised training, reducing manual effort and supporting scalable dataset creation for robust defect detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shilin Hu, Jingyi Xu, Akshat Dave, Dimitris Samaras, Hieu Le</p>
<p>Abstract: Shadow generation aims to produce photorealistic shadows that are visually consistent with object geometry and scene illumination. In the physics of shadow formation, the occluder blocks some light rays casting from the light source that would otherwise arrive at the surface, creating a shadow that follows the silhouette of the occluder. However, such explicit physical modeling has rarely been used in deep-learning-based shadow generation. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that embeds explicit physical modeling - geometry and illumination - into deep-learning-based shadow generation. First, given a monocular RGB image, we obtain approximate 3D geometry in the form of dense point maps and predict a single dominant light direction. These signals allow us to recover fairly accurate shadow location and shape based on the physics of shadow formation. We then integrate this physics-based initial estimate into a diffusion framework that refines the shadow into a realistic, high-fidelity appearance while ensuring consistency with scene geometry and illumination. Trained on DESOBAV2, our model produces shadows that are both visually realistic and physically coherent, outperforming existing approaches, especially in scenes with complex geometry or ambiguous lighting.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06179">Physics-Grounded Attached Shadow Detection Using Approximate 3D Geometry and Light Direction</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shilin Hu, Jingyi Xu, Sagnik Das, Dimitris Samaras, Hieu Le</p>
<p>Abstract: Attached shadows occur on the surface of the occluder where light cannot reach because of self-occlusion. They are crucial for defining the three-dimensional structure of objects and enhancing scene understanding. Yet existing shadow detection methods mainly target cast shadows, and there are no dedicated datasets or models for detecting attached shadows. To address this gap, we introduce a framework that jointly detects cast and attached shadows by reasoning about their mutual relationship with scene illumination and geometry. Our system consists of a shadow detection module that predicts both shadow types separately, and a light estimation module that infers the light direction from the detected shadows. The estimated light direction, combined with surface normals, allows us to derive a geometry-consistent partial map that identifies regions likely to be self-occluded. This partial map is then fed back to refine shadow predictions, forming a closed-loop reasoning process that iteratively improves both shadow segmentation and light estimation. In order to train our method, we have constructed a dataset of 1,458 images with separate annotations for cast and attached shadows, enabling training and quantitative evaluation of both. Experimental results demonstrate that this iterative geometry-illumination reasoning substantially improves the detection of attached shadows, with at least 33% BER reduction, while maintaining strong full and cast shadow performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ankit Gupta (Michigan State University), Christoph Adami (Michigan State University), Emily Dolson (Michigan State University)</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) excel across image recognition tasks, yet continue to exhibit overconfidence on inputs that bear no resemblance to natural images. Revisiting the "fooling images" work introduced by Nguyen et al. (2015), we re-implement both CPPN-based and direct-encoding-based evolutionary fooling attacks on modern architectures, including convolutional and transformer classifiers. Our re-implementation confirm that high-confidence fooling persists even in state-of-the-art networks, with transformer-based ViT-B/16 emerging as the most susceptible--achieving near-certain misclassifications with substantially fewer queries than convolution-based models. We then introduce SPOOF, a minimalist, consistent, and more efficient black-box attack generating high-confidence fooling images. Despite its simplicity, SPOOF generates unrecognizable fooling images with minimal pixel modifications and drastically reduced compute. Furthermore, retraining with fooling images as an additional class provides only partial resistance, as SPOOF continues to fool consistently with slightly higher query budgets--highlighting persistent fragility of modern deep classifiers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shichen Li, Ahmadreza Eslaminia, Chenhui Shao</p>
<p>Abstract: Food drying is widely used to reduce moisture content, ensure safety, and extend shelf life. Color evolution of food samples is an important indicator of product quality in food drying. Although existing studies have examined color changes under different drying conditions, current approaches primarily rely on low-dimensional color features and cannot fully capture the complex, dynamic color trajectories of food samples. Moreover, existing modeling approaches lack the ability to generalize to unseen process conditions. To address these limitations, we develop a novel multi-modal color-trajectory prediction method that integrates high-dimensional temporal color information with drying process parameters to enable accurate and data-efficient color trajectory prediction. Under unseen drying conditions, the model attains RMSEs of 2.12 for cookie drying and 1.29 for apple drying, reducing errors by over 90% compared with baseline models. These experimental results demonstrate the model's superior accuracy, robustness, and broad applicability.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present the design and results of the MICCAI Federated Tumor Segmentation (FeTS) Challenge 2024, which focuses on federated learning (FL) for glioma sub-region segmentation in multi-parametric MRI and evaluates new weight aggregation methods aimed at improving robustness and efficiency. Six participating teams were evaluated using a standardized FL setup and a multi-institutional dataset derived from the BraTS glioma benchmark, consisting of 1,251 training cases, 219 validation cases, and 570 hidden test cases with segmentations for enhancing tumor (ET), tumor core (TC), and whole tumor (WT). Teams were ranked using a cumulative scoring system that considered both segmentation performance, measured by Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and the 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance (HD95), and communication efficiency assessed through the convergence score. A PID-controller-based method achieved the top overall ranking, obtaining mean DSC values of 0.733, 0.761, and 0.751 for ET, TC, and WT, respectively, with corresponding HD95 values of 33.922 mm, 33.623 mm, and 32.309 mm, while also demonstrating the highest communication efficiency with a convergence score of 0.764. These findings advance the state of federated learning for medical imaging, surpassing top-performing methods from previous challenge iterations and highlighting PID controllers as effective mechanisms for stabilizing and optimizing weight aggregation in FL.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alena Makarova</p>
<p>Abstract: This work presents an independent reproducibility study of a lossy image compression technique that integrates singular value decomposition (SVD) and wavelet difference reduction (WDR). The original paper claims that combining SVD and WDR yields better visual quality and higher compression ratios than JPEG2000 and standalone WDR. I re-implemented the proposed method, carefully examined missing implementation details, and replicated the original experiments as closely as possible. I then conducted additional experiments on new images and evaluated performance using PSNR and SSIM. In contrast to the original claims, my results indicate that the SVD+WDR technique generally does not surpass JPEG2000 or WDR in terms of PSNR, and only partially improves SSIM relative to JPEG2000. The study highlights ambiguities in the original description (e.g., quantization and threshold initialization) and illustrates how such gaps can significantly impact reproducibility and reported performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pranav Balakrishnan, Sidisha Barik, Sean M. O'Rourke, Benjamin M. Marlin</p>
<p>Abstract: Much recent research on multi-target tracking has focused on multi-hypothesis approaches leveraging random finite sets. Of particular interest are labeled random finite set methods that maintain temporally coherent labels for each object. While these methods enjoy important theoretical properties as closed-form solutions to the multi-target Bayes filter, the maintenance of multiple hypotheses under the standard measurement model is highly computationally expensive, even when hypothesis pruning approximations are applied. In this work, we focus on the Generalized Labeled Multi-Bernoulli (GLMB) filter as an example of this class of methods. We investigate a variant of the filter that allows multiple detections per object from the same sensor, a critical capability when deploying tracking in the context of distributed networks of machine learning-based virtual sensors. We show that this breaks the inter-detection dependencies in the filter updates of the standard GLMB filter, allowing updates with significantly improved parallel scalability and enabling efficient deployment on GPU hardware. We report the results of a preliminary analysis of a GPU-accelerated implementation of our proposed GLMB tracker, with a focus on run time scalability with respect to the number of objects and the maximum number of retained hypotheses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ellen Su, Solim Legris, Todd M. Gureckis, Mengye Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: Humans expertly navigate the world by building rich internal models founded on an intuitive understanding of physics. Meanwhile, despite training on vast quantities of internet video data, state-of-the-art deep learning models still fall short of human-level performance on intuitive physics benchmarks. This work investigates whether data distribution, rather than volume, is the key to learning these principles. We pretrain a Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA) model on SAYCam, a developmentally realistic, egocentric video dataset partially capturing three children's everyday visual experiences. We find that training on this dataset, which represents 0.01% of the data volume used to train SOTA models, does not lead to significant performance improvements on the IntPhys2 benchmark. Our results suggest that merely training on a developmentally realistic dataset is insufficient for current architectures to learn representations that support intuitive physics. We conclude that varying visual data volume and distribution alone may not be sufficient for building systems with artificial intuitive physics.</p>

<p>Abstract: Partially Supervised Multi-Task Learning (PS-MTL) aims to leverage knowledge across tasks when annotations are incomplete. Existing approaches, however, have largely focused on the simpler setting of homogeneous, dense prediction tasks, leaving the more realistic challenge of learning from structurally diverse tasks unexplored. To this end, we introduce NexusFlow, a novel, lightweight, and plug-and-play framework effective in both settings. NexusFlow introduces a set of surrogate networks with invertible coupling layers to align the latent feature distributions of tasks, creating a unified representation that enables effective knowledge transfer. The coupling layers are bijective, preserving information while mapping features into a shared canonical space. This invertibility avoids representational collapse and enables alignment across structurally different tasks without reducing expressive capacity. We first evaluate NexusFlow on the core challenge of domain-partitioned autonomous driving, where dense map reconstruction and sparse multi-object tracking are supervised in different geographic regions, creating both structural disparity and a strong domain gap. NexusFlow sets a new state-of-the-art result on nuScenes, outperforming strong partially supervised baselines. To demonstrate generality, we further test NexusFlow on NYUv2 using three homogeneous dense prediction tasks, segmentation, depth, and surface normals, as a representative N-task PS-MTL scenario. NexusFlow yields consistent gains across all tasks, confirming its broad applicability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shijie Wang, Xin Yu, Yadan Luo, Zijian Wang, Pengfei Zhang, Zi Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing fine-grained image retrieval (FGIR) methods learn discriminative embeddings by adopting semantically sparse one-hot labels derived from category names as supervision. While effective on seen classes, such supervision overlooks the rich semantics encoded in category names, hindering the modeling of comparability among cross-category details and, in turn, limiting generalization to unseen categories. To tackle this, we introduce LaFG, a Language-driven framework for Fine-Grained Retrieval that converts class names into attribute-level supervision using large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs). Treating each name as a semantic anchor, LaFG prompts an LLM to generate detailed, attribute-oriented descriptions. To mitigate attribute omission in these descriptions, it leverages a frozen VLM to project them into a vision-aligned space, clustering them into a dataset-wide attribute vocabulary while harvesting complementary attributes from related categories. Leveraging this vocabulary, a global prompt template selects category-relevant attributes, which are aggregated into category-specific linguistic prototypes. These prototypes supervise the retrieval model to steer</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chaoyang Wang, Yangfan He, Yiyang Zhou, Yixuan Wang, Jiaqi Liu, Peng Xia, Zhengzhong Tu, Mohit Bansal, Huaxiu Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: We reveal a critical yet underexplored flaw in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs): even when these models know the correct answer, they frequently arrive there through incorrect reasoning paths. The core issue is not a lack of knowledge, but a path selection bias within the vast reasoning search space. Although LVLMs are often capable of sampling correct solution trajectories, they disproportionately favor unstable or logically inconsistent ones, leading to erratic and unreliable outcomes. The substantial disparity between Pass@K (with large K) and Pass@1 across numerous models provides compelling evidence that such failures primarily stem from misreasoning rather than ignorance. To systematically investigate and address this issue, we propose PSO (Path-Select Optimization), a two-stage post-training framework designed to enhance both the reasoning performance and stability of existing LVLMs. In the first stage, we employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with template and answer-based rewards to cultivate structured, step-by-step reasoning. In the second stage, we conduct online preference optimization, where the model samples reasoning paths from GRPO-generated data, self-evaluates them, and aligns itself toward the preferred trajectories. Incorrect or suboptimal paths are concurrently stored in a Negative Replay Memory (NRM) as hard negatives, which are periodically revisited to prevent the model from repeating prior mistakes and to facilitate continual reasoning refinement. Extensive experiments show that PSO effectively prunes invalid reasoning paths, substantially enhances reasoning accuracy (with 7.4% improvements on average), and yields more stable and consistent chains of thought.

<p>Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting is crucial for real-time novel view synthesis due to its efficiency and ability to render photorealistic images. However, building a 3D Gaussian is guided solely by photometric loss, which can result in inconsistencies in reconstruction. This under-constrained process often results in "floater" artifacts and unstructured geometry, preventing the extraction of high-fidelity surfaces. To address this issue, our paper introduces a novel method that improves reconstruction by enforcing global geometry consistency through constrained multi-view triangulation. Our approach aims to achieve a consensus on 3D representation in the physical world by utilizing various estimated views. We optimize this process by penalizing the deviation of a rendered 3D point from a robust consensus point, which is re-triangulated from a bundle of neighboring views in a self-supervised fashion. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across multiple datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results. On the DTU dataset, our method attains a mean Chamfer Distance of 0.50 mm, outperforming comparable explicit methods. We will make our code open-source to facilitate community validation and ensure reproducibility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kegang Wang, Jiankai Tang, Yuntao Wang, Xin Liu, Yuxuan Fan, Jiatong Ji, Yuanchun Shi, Daniel McDuff</p>
<p>Abstract: Vital sign measurement using cameras presents opportunities for comfortable, ubiquitous health monitoring. Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG), a foundational technology, enables cardiac measurement through minute changes in light reflected from the skin. However, practical deployment is limited by the computational constraints of performing analysis on front-end devices and the accuracy degradation of transmitting data through compressive channels that reduce signal quality. We propose a memory efficient rPPG algorithm - \emph{FacePhys} - built on temporal-spatial state space duality, which resolves the trilemma of model scalability, cross-dataset generalization, and real-time operation. Leveraging a transferable heart state, FacePhys captures subtle periodic variations across video frames while maintaining a minimal computational overhead, enabling training on extended video sequences and supporting low-latency inference. FacePhys establishes a new state-of-the-art, with a substantial 49\% reduction in error. Our solution enables real-time inference with a memory footprint of 3.6 MB and per-frame latency of 9.46 ms -- surpassing existing methods by 83\% to 99\%. These results translate into reliable real-time performance in practical deployments, and a live demo is available at https://www.facephys.com/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyi Gao, Hao Li, Han Fang, Xin Wei, Xiaodong Dong, Hongbo Sun, Ye Yuan, Zhongjiang He, Jinglin Xu, Jingmin Xin, Hao Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) is a vision-language task that localizes a specific image region based on a textual description. Existing REC benchmarks primarily evaluate perceptual capabilities and lack interpretable scoring mechanisms, which cannot reveal the grounding capability of Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) across different cognitive abilities. To address this limitation, we introduce RefBench-PRO, a comprehensive REC benchmark, which decomposes referring expressions into two core dimensions, i.e., perception and reasoning, and further subdivides them into six progressively challenging tasks, such as attribute, position, interaction, commonsense, relation and reject. We also develop a fully automated data-generation pipeline that produces diverse referring expressions across these six sub-dimensions. Furthermore, We propose Ref-R1, an RL-based learning scheme, which incorporates Dynamic IoU-based GRPO to improve localization accuracy under increasingly complex reasoning conditions, establishing a stronger baseline for REC. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our RefBench-PRO enables interpretable evaluation of MLLM on referring expression comprehension, presenting greater challenges in both perception and reasoning.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06281">Unleashing the Intrinsic Visual Representation Capability of Multimodal Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hengzhuang Li, Xinsong Zhang, Qiming Peng, Bin Luo, Han Hu, Dengyang Jiang, Han-Jia Ye, Teng Zhang, Hai Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in multimodal tasks. Despite their impressive performance, MLLMs suffer from the modality imbalance issue, where visual information is often underutilized compared to textual representations in deeper layers, leading to degraded visual performance or hallucinations. This issue stems from the predominant reliance on next-text-token-prediction during training, which fails to provide direct visual supervisory signals, resulting in progressive homogenization of visual representations throughout the layers. To this end, we propose Latent Visual Reconstruction (LaVer), a novel training framework that facilitates MLLMs in learning more discriminative visual representations via masked image modeling in the joint latent semantic space of LLM. Our method offers direct visual activation to MLLMs, which exhibit increased visual attention allocation, indicating enhanced utilization of visual information. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks prove the superiority of our approach in various scenarios, especially those requiring dense visual capabilities. Code of LaVer is available at https://github.com/Fir-lat/LaVer.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lyn Chao-ling Chen, Kuan-Wen Chen, Yi-Ping Hung</p>
<p>Abstract: For quantitative evaluation of sleep disturbances, a noninvasive monitoring system is developed by introducing an event-based method. We observe sleeping in home context and classify the sleep disturbances into three types of events: motion events, light-on/off events and noise events. A device with an infrared depth sensor, a RGB camera, and a four-microphone array is used in sleep monitoring in an environment with barely light sources. One background model is established in depth signals for measuring magnitude of movements. Because depth signals cannot observe lighting changes, another background model is established in color images for measuring magnitude of lighting effects. An event detection algorithm is used to detect occurrences of events from the processed data of the three types of sensors. The system was tested in sleep condition and the experiment result validates the system reliability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiheng Huang, Shuang She, Zewei Wei, Jianmin Lin, Ming Yang, Wenyin Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Stroke classification remains challenging due to variations in writing style, ambiguous content, and dynamic writing positions. The core challenge in stroke classification is modeling the semantic relationships between strokes. Our observations indicate that stroke interactions are typically localized, making it difficult for existing deep learning methods to capture such fine-grained relationships. Although viewing strokes from a point-level perspective can address this issue, it introduces redundancy. However, by selecting reference points and using their sequential order to represent strokes in a fine-grained manner, this problem can be effectively solved. This insight inspired StrokeNet, a novel network architecture encoding strokes as reference pair representations (points + feature vectors), where reference points enable spatial queries and features mediate interaction modeling. Specifically, we dynamically select reference points for each stroke and sequence them, employing an Inline Sequence Attention (ISA) module to construct contextual features. To capture spatial feature interactions, we devised a Cross-Ellipse Query (CEQ) mechanism that clusters reference points and extracts features across varying spatial scales. Finally, a joint optimization framework simultaneously predicts stroke categories via reference points regression and adjacent stroke semantic transition modeling through an Auxiliary Branch (Aux-Branch). Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple public online handwritten datasets. Notably, on the CASIA-onDo dataset, the accuracy improves from 93.81$\%$ to 95.54$\%$, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoxian Zhou, Chuanzhi Xu, Langyi Chen, Haodong Chen, Yuk Ying Chung, Qiang Qu, Xaoming Chen, Weidong Cai</p>
<p>Abstract: Human pose estimation focuses on predicting body keypoints to analyze human motion. Event cameras provide high temporal resolution and low latency, enabling robust estimation under challenging conditions. However, most existing methods convert event streams into dense event frames, which adds extra computation and sacrifices the high temporal resolution of the event signal. In this work, we aim to exploit the spatiotemporal properties of event streams based on point cloud-based framework, designed to enhance human pose estimation performance. We design Event Temporal Slicing Convolution module to capture short-term dependencies across event slices, and combine it with Event Slice Sequencing module for structured temporal modeling. We also apply edge enhancement in point cloud-based event representation to enhance spatial edge information under sparse event conditions to further improve performance. Experiments on the DHP19 dataset show our proposed method consistently improves performance across three representative point cloud backbones: PointNet, DGCNN, and Point Transformer.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahao Li, Yusheng Luo, Yunzhong Lou, Xiangdong Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: We present ReCAD, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that bootstraps pretrained large models (PLMs) to generate precise parametric computer-aided design (CAD) models from multimodal inputs by leveraging their inherent generative capabilities. With just access to simple functional interfaces (e.g., point coordinates), our approach enables the emergence of complex CAD operations (e.g., pattern replication and mirror). This stands in contrast to previous methods, which typically rely on knowledge injected through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), offer limited support for editability, and fail to exploit the strong generative priors of PLMs. Specifically, the ReCAD framework begins by fine-tuning vision-language models (VLMs) to equip them with basic CAD model generation capabilities, where we rewrite CAD scripts into parameterized code that is leveraged to generate accurate textual descriptions for supervision. Then, we propose a novel RL strategy that incorporates parameterized code as guidance to enhance the model's reasoning on challenging questions. Furthermore, we employ a hierarchical primitive learning process to progressively teach structured and compositional skills under a unified reward function that ensures both geometric accuracy and semantic fidelity. ReCAD sets a new state-of-the-art in both text-to-CAD and image-to-CAD tasks, significantly improving geometric accuracy across in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings. In the image-to-CAD task, for instance, it reduces the mean Chamfer Distance from 73.47 to 29.61 (in-distribution) and from 272.06 to 80.23 (out-of-distribution), outperforming existing baselines by a substantial margin.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyu Zhang, Junhan Luo, Yugang Cao, Siran Peng, Jie Huang,  Liangjian-Deng</p>
<p>Abstract: Pansharpening fuses a high-resolution PAN image with a low-resolution multispectral (LRMS) image to produce an HRMS image. A key difficulty is that jointly processing PAN and MS often entangles spatial detail with spectral fidelity. We propose S2WMamba, which explicitly disentangles frequency information and then performs lightweight cross-modal interaction. Concretely, a 2D Haar DWT is applied to PAN to localize spatial edges and textures, while a channel-wise 1D Haar DWT treats each pixel's spectrum as a 1D signal to separate low/high-frequency components and limit spectral distortion. The resulting Spectral branch injects wavelet-extracted spatial details into MS features, and the Spatial branch refines PAN features using spectra from the 1D pyramid; the two branches exchange information through Mamba-based cross-modulation that models long-range dependencies with linear complexity. A multi-scale dynamic gate (multiplicative + additive) then adaptively fuses branch outputs.On WV3, GF2, and QB, S2WMamba matches or surpasses recent strong baselines (FusionMamba, CANNet, U2Net, ARConv), improving PSNR by up to 0.23 dB and reaching HQNR 0.956 on full-resolution WV3. Ablations justify the choice of 2D/1D DWT placement, parallel dual branches, and the fusion gate. Our code is available at https://github.com/KagUYa66/S2WMamba.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeffrey Gu, Minkyu Jeon, Ambri Ma, Serena Yeung-Levy, Ellen D. Zhong</p>
<p>Abstract: Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is an indispensable technique for determining the 3D structures of dynamic biomolecular complexes. While typically applied to image a single molecular species, cryo-EM has the potential for structure determination of many targets simultaneously in a high-throughput fashion. However, existing methods typically focus on modeling conformational heterogeneity within a single or a few structures and are not designed to resolve compositional heterogeneity arising from mixtures of many distinct molecular species. To address this challenge, we propose CryoHype, a transformer-based hypernetwork for cryo-EM reconstruction that dynamically adjusts the weights of an implicit neural representation. Using CryoHype, we achieve state-of-the-art results on a challenging benchmark dataset containing 100 structures. We further demonstrate that CryoHype scales to the reconstruction of 1,000 distinct structures from unlabeled cryo-EM images in the fixed-pose setting.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06344">Beyond Hallucinations: A Multimodal-Guided Task-Aware Generative Image Compression for Ultra-Low Bitrate</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaile Wang, Lijun He, Haisheng Fu, Haixia Bi, Fan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative image compression has recently shown impressive perceptual quality, but often suffers from semantic deviations caused by generative hallucinations at ultra-low bitrate (bpp < 0.05), limiting its reliable deployment in bandwidth-constrained 6G semantic communication scenarios. In this work, we reassess the positioning and role of of multimodal guidance, and propose a Multimodal-Guided Task-Aware Generative Image Compression (MTGC) framework. Specifically, MTGC integrates three guidance modalities to enhance semantic consistency: a concise but robust text caption for global semantics, a highly compressed image (HCI) retaining low-level visual information, and Semantic Pseudo-Words (SPWs) for fine-grained task-relevant semantics. The SPWs are generated by our designed Task-Aware Semantic Compression Module (TASCM), which operates in a task-oriented manner to drive the multi-head self-attention mechanism to focus on and extract semantics relevant to the generation task while filtering out redundancy. Subsequently, to facilitate the synergistic guidance of these modalities, we design a Multimodal-Guided Diffusion Decoder (MGDD) employing a dual-path cooperative guidance mechanism that synergizes cross-attention and ControlNet additive residuals to precisely inject these three guidance into the diffusion process, and leverages the diffusion model's powerful generative priors to reconstruct the image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MTGC consistently improves semantic consistency (e.g., DISTS drops by 10.59% on the DIV2K dataset) while also achieving remarkable gains in perceptual quality and pixel-level fidelity at ultra-low bitrate.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite the success of convolution- and attention-based models in vision tasks, their rigid receptive fields and complex architectures limit their ability to model irregular spatial patterns and hinder interpretability, therefore posing challenges for tasks requiring high model transparency. Clustering paradigms offer promising interpretability and flexible semantic modeling, but suffer from limited accuracy, low efficiency, and gradient vanishing during training. To address these issues, we propose CLUster attEntion Network (CLUENet), an transparent deep architecture for visual semantic understanding. We propose three key innovations include (i) a Global Soft Aggregation and Hard Assignment with a Temperature-Scaled Cosin Attention and gated residual connections for enhanced local modeling, (ii) inter-block Hard and Shared Feature Dispatching, and (iii) an improved cluster pooling strategy. These enhancements significantly improve both classification performance and visual interpretability. Experiments on CIFAR-100 and Mini-ImageNet demonstrate that CLUENet outperforms existing clustering methods and mainstream visual models, offering a compelling balance of accuracy, efficiency, and transparency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaicheng Yang, Kaisen Yang, Baiting Wu, Xun Zhang, Qianrui Yang, Haotong Qin, He Zhang, Yulun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have emerged as a highly scalable and effective backbone for image generation, outperforming U-Net architectures in both scalability and performance. However, their real-world deployment remains challenging due to high computational and memory demands. Mixed-Precision Quantization (MPQ), designed to push the limits of quantization, has demonstrated remarkable success in advancing U-Net quantization to sub-4bit settings while significantly reducing computational and memory overhead. Nevertheless, its application to DiT architectures remains limited and underexplored. In this work, we propose TreeQ, a unified framework addressing key challenges in DiT quantization. First, to tackle inefficient search and proxy misalignment, we introduce Tree Structured Search (TSS). This DiT-specific approach leverages the architecture's linear properties to traverse the solution space in O(n) time while improving objective accuracy through comparison-based pruning. Second, to unify optimization objectives, we propose Environmental Noise Guidance (ENG), which aligns Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) and Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) configurations using a single hyperparameter. Third, to mitigate information bottlenecks in ultra-low-bit regimes, we design the General Monarch Branch (GMB). This structured sparse branch prevents irreversible information loss, enabling finer detail generation. Through extensive experiments, our TreeQ framework demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on DiT-XL/2 under W3A3 and W4A4 PTQ/PEFT settings. Notably, our work is the first to achieve near-lossless 4-bit PTQ performance on DiT models. The code and models will be available at https://github.com/racoonykc/TreeQ</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingjia Li, Jin Hu, Hainuo Wang, Qiming Hu, Jiarui Wang, Xiaojie Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Single-image reflection removal is a highly ill-posed problem, where existing methods struggle to reason about the composition of corrupted regions, causing them to fail at recovery and generalization in the wild. This work reframes an editing-purpose latent diffusion model to effectively perceive and process highly ambiguous, layered image inputs, yielding high-quality outputs. We argue that the challenge of this conversion stems from a critical yet overlooked issue, i.e., the latent space of semantic encoders lacks the inherent structure to interpret a composite image as a linear superposition of its constituent layers. Our approach is built on three synergistic components, including a reflection-equivariant VAE that aligns the latent space with the linear physics of reflection formation, a learnable task-specific text embedding for precise guidance that bypasses ambiguous language, and a depth-guided early-branching sampling strategy to harness generative stochasticity for promising results. Extensive experiments reveal that our model achieves new SOTA performance on multiple benchmarks and generalizes well to challenging real-world cases.</p>

<p>Abstract: Real-world face recognition systems are vulnerable to both physical presentation attacks (PAs) and digital forgery attacks (DFs). We aim to achieve comprehensive protection of biometric data by implementing a unified physical-digital defense framework with advanced detection. Existing approaches primarily employ CLIP with regularization constraints to enhance model generalization across both tasks. However, these methods suffer from conflicting optimization directions between physical and digital attack detection under same category prompt spaces. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Spoofing-aware Prompt Learning for Unified Attack Detection (SPL-UAD) framework, which decouples optimization branches for physical and digital attacks in the prompt space. Specifically, we construct a learnable parallel prompt branch enhanced with adaptive Spoofing Context Prompt Generation, enabling independent control of optimization for each attack type. Furthermore, we design a Cues-awareness Augmentation that leverages the dual-prompt mechanism to generate challenging sample mining tasks on data, significantly enhancing the model's robustness against unseen attack types. Extensive experiments on the large-scale UniAttackDataPlus dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves significant performance improvements in unified attack detection tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Monocular dynamic video reconstruction faces significant challenges in dynamic human scenes due to geometric inconsistencies and resolution degradation issues. Existing methods lack 3D human structural understanding, producing geometrically inconsistent results with distorted limb proportions and unnatural human-object fusion, while memory-constrained downsampling causes human boundary drift toward background geometry. To address these limitations, we propose to incorporate hybrid geometric priors that combine SMPL human body models with monocular depth estimation. Our approach leverages structured human priors to maintain surface consistency while capturing fine-grained geometric details in human regions. We introduce Human3R, featuring a hierarchical pipeline with refinement components that processes full-resolution images for overall scene geometry, then applies strategic cropping and cross-attention fusion for human-specific detail enhancement. The method integrates SMPL priors through a Feature Fusion Module to ensure geometrically plausible reconstruction while preserving fine-grained human boundaries. Extensive experiments on TUM Dynamics and GTA-IM datasets demonstrate superior performance in dynamic human reconstruction.</p>

<p>Abstract: Tool-integrated visual reasoning (TiVR) has demonstrated great potential in enhancing multimodal problem-solving. However, existing TiVR paradigms mainly focus on integrating various visual tools through reinforcement learning, while neglecting to design effective response mechanisms for handling unreliable or erroneous tool outputs. This limitation is particularly pronounced in referring and grounding tasks, where inaccurate detection tool predictions often mislead TiVR models into generating hallucinated reasoning. To address this issue, we propose the VG-Refiner, the first framework aiming at the tool-refined referring grounded reasoning. Technically, we introduce a two-stage think-rethink mechanism that enables the model to explicitly analyze and respond to tool feedback, along with a refinement reward that encourages effective correction in response to poor tool results. In addition, we propose two new metrics and establish fair evaluation protocols to systematically measure the refinement ability of current models. We adopt a small amount of task-specific data to enhance the refinement capability of VG-Refiner, achieving a significant improvement in accuracy and correction ability on referring and reasoning grounding benchmarks while preserving the general capabilities of the pretrained model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinhao Xiang, Abhijeet Rastogi, Jiawei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent text-to-video models have enabled the generation of high-resolution driving scenes from natural language prompts. These AI-generated driving videos (AIGVs) offer a low-cost, scalable alternative to real or simulator data for autonomous driving (AD). But a key question remains: can such videos reliably support training and evaluation of AD models? We present a diagnostic framework that systematically studies this question. First, we introduce a taxonomy of frequent AIGV failure modes, including visual artifacts, physically implausible motion, and violations of traffic semantics, and demonstrate their negative impact on object detection, tracking, and instance segmentation. To support this analysis, we build ADGV-Bench, a driving-focused benchmark with human quality annotations and dense labels for multiple perception tasks. We then propose ADGVE, a driving-aware evaluator that combines static semantics, temporal cues, lane obedience signals, and Vision-Language Model(VLM)-guided reasoning into a single quality score for each clip. Experiments show that blindly adding raw AIGVs can degrade perception performance, while filtering them with ADGVE consistently improves both general video quality assessment metrics and downstream AD models, and turns AIGVs into a beneficial complement to real-world data. Our study highlights both the risks and the promise of AIGVs, and provides practical tools for safely leveraging large-scale video generation in future AD pipelines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Huo, Yun Ge</p>
<p>Abstract: Current FER (Facial Expression Recognition) dataset is mostly labeled by emotion categories, such as happy, angry, sad, fear, disgust, surprise, and neutral which are limited in expressiveness. However, future affective computing requires more comprehensive and precise emotion metrics which could be measured by VAD(Valence-Arousal-Dominance) multidimension parameters. To address this, AffectNet has tried to add VA (Valence and Arousal) information, but still lacks D(Dominance). Thus, the research introduces VAD annotation on FER2013 dataset, takes the initiative to label D(Dominance) dimension. Then, to further improve network capacity, it enforces orthogonalized convolution on it, which extracts more diverse and expressive features and will finally increase the prediction accuracy. Experiment results show that D dimension could be measured but is difficult to obtain compared with V and A dimension no matter in manual annotation or regression network prediction. Secondly, the ablation test by introducing orthogonal convolution verifies that better VAD prediction could be obtained in the configuration of orthogonal convolution. Therefore, the research provides an initiative labelling for D dimension on FER dataset, and proposes a better prediction network for VAD prediction through orthogonal convolution. The newly built VAD annotated FER2013 dataset could act as a benchmark to measure VAD multidimensional emotions, while the orthogonalized regression network based on ResNet could act as the facial expression recognition baseline for VAD emotion prediction.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Huo, Lei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, online learning is very popular, especially under the global epidemic of COVID-19. Besides knowledge distribution, emotion interaction is also very important. It can be obtained by employing Facial Expression Recognition (FER). Since the FER accuracy is substantial in assisting teachers to acquire the emotional situation, the project explores a series of FER methods and finds that few works engage in exploiting the orthogonality of convolutional matrix. Therefore, it enforces orthogonality on kernels by a regularizer, which extracts features with more diversity and expressiveness, and delivers OCFER-Net. Experiments are carried out on FER-2013, which is a challenging dataset. Results show superior performance over baselines by 1.087. The code of the research project is publicly available on https://github.com/YeeHoran/OCFERNet.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jing Tao, Yonghong Zong, Banglei Guana, Pengju Sun, Taihang Lei, Yang Shanga, Qifeng Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: In photogrammetry, accurately fusing infrared (IR) and visible (VIS) spectra while preserving the geometric fidelity of visible features and incorporating thermal radiation is a significant challenge, particularly under extreme conditions. Existing methods often compromise visible imagery quality, impacting measurement accuracy. To solve this, we propose a region perception-based fusion framework that combines multi-exposure and multi-modal imaging using a spatially varying exposure (SVE) camera. This framework co-fuses multi-modal and multi-exposure data, overcoming single-exposure method limitations in extreme environments. The framework begins with region perception-based feature fusion to ensure precise multi-modal registration, followed by adaptive fusion with contrast enhancement. A structural similarity compensation mechanism, guided by regional saliency maps, optimizes IR-VIS spectral integration. Moreover, the framework adapts to single-exposure scenarios for robust fusion across different conditions. Experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate superior image clarity and improved performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, as evidenced by both quantitative and visual evaluations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gengze Zhou, Chongjian Ge, Hao Tan, Feng Liu, Yicong Hong</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in autoregressive (AR) generative models have produced increasingly powerful systems for media synthesis. Among them, next-scale prediction has emerged as a popular paradigm, where models generate images in a coarse-to-fine manner. However, scale-wise AR models suffer from exposure bias, which undermines generation quality. We identify two primary causes of this issue: (1) train-test mismatch, where the model must rely on its own imperfect predictions during inference, and (2) imbalance in scale-wise learning difficulty, where certain scales exhibit disproportionately higher optimization complexity. Through a comprehensive analysis of training dynamics, we propose Self-Autoregressive Refinement (SAR) to address these limitations. SAR introduces a Stagger-Scale Rollout (SSR) mechanism that performs lightweight autoregressive rollouts to expose the model to its own intermediate predictions, thereby aligning train-test patterns, and a complementary Contrastive Student-Forcing Loss (CSFL) that provides adequate supervision for self-generated contexts to ensure stable training. Experimental results show that applying SAR to pretrained AR models consistently improves generation quality with minimal computational overhead. For instance, SAR yields a 5.2% FID reduction on FlexVAR-d16 trained on ImageNet 256 within 10 epochs (5 hours on 32xA100 GPUs). Given its efficiency, scalability, and effectiveness, we expect SAR to serve as a reliable post-training method for visual autoregressive generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chunwei Tian, Jingyuan Xie, Lingjun Li, Wangmeng Zuo, Yanning Zhang, David Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can automatically learn data patterns to express face images for facial expression recognition (FER). However, they may ignore effect of facial segmentation of FER. In this paper, we propose a perception CNN for FER as well as PCNN. Firstly, PCNN can use five parallel networks to simultaneously learn local facial features based on eyes, cheeks and mouth to realize the sensitive capture of the subtle changes in FER. Secondly, we utilize a multi-domain interaction mechanism to register and fuse between local sense organ features and global facial structural features to better express face images for FER. Finally, we design a two-phase loss function to restrict accuracy of obtained sense information and reconstructed face images to guarantee performance of obtained PCNN in FER. Experimental results show that our PCNN achieves superior results on several lab and real-world FER benchmarks: CK+, JAFFE, FER2013, FERPlus, RAF-DB and Occlusion and Pose Variant Dataset.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianshan Zhang, Zeyu Zhang, Hao Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: While generative models have excelled at creating static 3D content, the pursuit of systems that understand how objects move and respond to interactions remains a fundamental challenge. Current methods for articulated motion lie at a crossroads: they are either physically consistent but too slow for real-time use, or generative but violate basic kinematic constraints. We present DragMesh, a robust framework for real-time interactive 3D articulation built around a lightweight motion generation core. Our core contribution is a novel decoupled kinematic reasoning and motion generation framework. First, we infer the latent joint parameters by decoupling semantic intent reasoning (which determines the joint type) from geometric regression (which determines the axis and origin using our Kinematics Prediction Network (KPP-Net)). Second, to leverage the compact, continuous, and singularity-free properties of dual quaternions for representing rigid body motion, we develop a novel Dual Quaternion VAE (DQ-VAE). This DQ-VAE receives these predicted priors, along with the original user drag, to generate a complete, plausible motion trajectory. To ensure strict adherence to kinematics, we inject the joint priors at every layer of the DQ-VAE's non-autoregressive Transformer decoder using FiLM (Feature-wise Linear Modulation) conditioning. This persistent, multi-scale guidance is complemented by a numerically-stable cross-product loss to guarantee axis alignment. This decoupled design allows DragMesh to achieve real-time performance and enables plausible, generative articulation on novel objects without retraining, offering a practical step toward generative 3D intelligence.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nzakiese Mbongo, Kailash A. Hambarde, Hugo Proen\c{c}a</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate gender recognition from extreme long-range imagery remains a challenging problem due to limited spatial resolution, viewpoint variability, and loss of facial cues. For such purpose, we present a dual-path transformer framework that leverages CLIP to jointly model visual and attribute-driven cues for gender recognition at a distance. The framework integrates two complementary streams: (1) a direct visual path that refines a pre-trained CLIP image encoder through selective fine-tuning of its upper layers, and (2) an attribute-mediated path that infers gender from a set of soft-biometric prompts (e.g., hairstyle, clothing, accessories) aligned in the CLIP text-image space. Spatial channel attention modules further enhance discriminative localization under occlusion and low resolution. To support large-scale evaluation, we construct U-DetAGReID, a unified long-range gender dataset derived from DetReIDx and AG-ReID.v2, harmonized under a consistent ternary labeling scheme (Male, Female, Unknown). Extensive experiments suggest that the proposed solution surpasses state-of-the-art person-attribute and re-identification baselines across multiple metrics (macro-F1, accuracy, AUC), with consistent robustness to distance, angle, and height variations. Qualitative attention visualizations confirm interpretable attribute localization and responsible abstention behavior. Our results show that language-guided dual-path learning offers a principled, extensible foundation for responsible gender recognition in unconstrained long-range scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lucas R. Mareque, Ricardo L. Armentano, Leandro J. Cymberknop</p>
<p>Abstract: Preparticipation cardiovascular examination (PPCE) aims to prevent sudden cardiac death (SCD) by identifying athletes with structural or electrical cardiac abnormalities. Anthropometric measurements, such as waist circumference, limb lengths, and torso proportions to detect Marfan syndrome, can indicate elevated cardiovascular risk. Traditional manual methods are labor-intensive, operator-dependent, and challenging to scale. We present a fully automated deep-learning approach to estimate five key anthropometric measurements from 2D synthetic human body images. Using a dataset of 100,000 images derived from 3D body meshes, we trained and evaluated VGG19, ResNet50, and DenseNet121 with fully connected layers for regression. All models achieved sub-centimeter accuracy, with ResNet50 performing best, achieving a mean MAE of 0.668 cm across all measurements. Our results demonstrate that deep learning can deliver accurate anthropometric data at scale, offering a practical tool to complement athlete screening protocols. Future work will validate the models on real-world images to extend applicability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ramazan Fazylov, Sergey Zagoruyko, Aleksandr Parkin, Stamatis Lefkimmiatis, Ivan Laptev</p>
<p>Abstract: The generation of high-fidelity, animatable 3D human avatars remains a core challenge in computer graphics and vision, with applications in VR, telepresence, and entertainment. Existing approaches based on implicit representations like NeRFs suffer from slow rendering and dynamic inconsistencies, while 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods are typically limited to static head generation, lacking dynamic control. We bridge this gap by introducing AGORA, a novel framework that extends 3DGS within a generative adversarial network to produce animatable avatars. Our key contribution is a lightweight, FLAME-conditioned deformation branch that predicts per-Gaussian residuals, enabling identity-preserving, fine-grained expression control while allowing real-time inference. Expression fidelity is enforced via a dual-discriminator training scheme leveraging synthetic renderings of the parametric mesh. AGORA generates avatars that are not only visually realistic but also precisely controllable. Quantitatively, we outperform state-of-the-art NeRF-based methods on expression accuracy while rendering at 250+ FPS on a single GPU, and, notably, at $\sim$9 FPS under CPU-only inference - representing, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of practical CPU-only animatable 3DGS avatar synthesis. This work represents a significant step toward practical, high-performance digital humans. Project website: https://ramazan793.github.io/AGORA/</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiuyi Chen, Mingkui Tan, Haifeng Lu, Qiuna Xu, Zhihua Wang, Runhao Zeng, Xiping Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Depression poses serious public health risks, including suicide, underscoring the urgency of timely and scalable screening. Multimodal automatic depression detection (ADD) offers a promising solution; however, widely studied audio- and video-based ADD methods lack a unified, generalizable framework for diverse depression recognition scenarios and show limited stability to missing modalities, which are common in real-world data. In this work, we propose a unified framework for Stable Cross-Domain Depression Recognition based on Multimodal Large Language Model (SCD-MLLM). The framework supports the integration and processing of heterogeneous depression-related data collected from varied sources while maintaining stability in the presence of incomplete modality inputs. Specifically, SCD-MLLM introduces two key components: (i) Multi-Source Data Input Adapter (MDIA), which employs masking mechanism and task-specific prompts to transform heterogeneous depression-related inputs into uniform token sequences, addressing inconsistency across diverse data sources; (ii) Modality-Aware Adaptive Fusion Module (MAFM), which adaptively integrates audio and visual features via a shared projection mechanism, enhancing resilience under missing modality conditions. e conduct comprehensive experiments under multi-dataset joint training settings on five publicly available and heterogeneous depression datasets from diverse scenarios: CMDC, AVEC2014, DAIC-WOZ, DVlog, and EATD. Across both complete and partial modality settings, SCD-MLLM outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) models as well as leading commercial LLMs (Gemini and GPT), demonstrating superior cross-domain generalization, enhanced ability to capture multimodal cues of depression, and strong stability to missing modality cases in real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kush Revankar, Shreyas Deshpande, Araham Sayeed, Ansh Tandale, Sarika Bobde</p>
<p>Abstract: Communication between deaf users, visually im paired users, and the general hearing population often relies on tools that support only one direction of interaction. To address this limitation, this work presents Sanvaad, a lightweight multimodal accessibility framework designed to support real time, two-way communication. For deaf users, Sanvaad includes an ISL recognition module built on MediaPipe landmarks. MediaPipe is chosen primarily for its efficiency and low computational load, enabling the system to run smoothly on edge devices without requiring dedicated hardware. Spoken input from a phone can also be translated into sign representations through a voice-to-sign component that maps detected speech to predefined phrases and produces corresponding GIFs or alphabet-based visualizations. For visually impaired users, the framework provides a screen free voice interface that integrates multilingual speech recognition, text summarization, and text-to-speech generation. These components work together through a Streamlit-based interface, making the system usable on both desktop and mobile environments. Overall, Sanvaad aims to offer a practical and accessible pathway for inclusive communication by combining lightweight computer vision and speech processing tools within a unified framework.</p>

<p>Abstract: The subject of this research is the development of an intelligent, integrated framework for the automated inspection of photovoltaic (PV) infrastructure that addresses the critical shortcomings of conventional methods, including thermal palette bias, data redundancy, and high communication bandwidth requirements. The goal of this study is to design, develop, and validate a comprehensive, multi-modal system that fully automates the monitoring workflow, from data acquisition to the generation of actionable, geo-located maintenance alerts, thereby enhancing plant safety and operational efficiency. The methods employed involve a synergistic architecture that begins with a palette-invariant thermal embedding, learned by enforcing representational consistency, which is fused with a contrast-normalized RGB stream via a gated mechanism. This is supplemented by a closed-loop, adaptive re-acquisition controller that uses Rodrigues-based updates for targeted confirmation of ambiguous anomalies and a geospatial deduplication module that clusters redundant alerts using DBSCAN over the haversine distance. In conclusion, this study establishes a powerful new paradigm for proactive PV inspection, with the proposed system achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of 0.903 on the public PVF-10 benchmark, a significant 12-15% improvement over single-modality baselines. Field validation confirmed the system's readiness, achieving 96% recall, while the de-duplication process reduced duplicate-induced false positives by 15-20%, and relevance-only telemetry cut airborne data transmission by 60-70%.</p>

<p>Abstract: The continuous growth of the global human population is leading to the expansion of human habitats, resulting in decreasing wildlife spaces and increasing human-wildlife interactions. These interactions can range from minor disturbances, such as raccoons in urban waste bins, to more severe consequences, including species extinction. As a result, the monitoring of wildlife is gaining significance in various contexts. Artificial intelligence (AI) offers a solution by automating the recognition of animals in images and videos, thereby reducing the manual effort required for wildlife monitoring. Traditional AI training involves three main stages: image collection, labelling, and model training. However, the variability, for example, in the landscape (e.g., mountains, open fields, forests), weather (e.g., rain, fog, sunshine), lighting (e.g., day, night), and camera-animal distances presents significant challenges to model robustness and adaptability in real-world scenarios.
  In this work, we propose a unified framework, called ShadowWolf, designed to address these challenges by integrating and optimizing the stages of AI model training and evaluation. The proposed framework enables dynamic model retraining to adjust to changes in environmental conditions and application requirements, thereby reducing labelling efforts and allowing for on-site model adaptation. This adaptive and unified approach enhances the accuracy and efficiency of wildlife monitoring systems, promoting more effective and scalable conservation efforts.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent work has established learned k-space acquisition patterns as a promising direction for improving reconstruction quality in accelerated Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Despite encouraging results, most existing research focuses on acquisition patterns optimized for a single dataset or modality, with limited consideration of their transferability across imaging domains. In this work, we demonstrate that the benefits of learned k-space sampling can extend beyond the training domain, enabling superior reconstruction performance under domain shifts. Our study presents two main contributions. First, through systematic evaluation across datasets and acquisition paradigms, we show that models trained with learned sampling patterns exhibitimproved generalization under cross-domain settings. Second, we propose a novel method that enhances domain robustness by introducing acquisition uncertainty during training-stochastically perturbing k-space trajectories to simulate variability across scanners and imaging conditions. Our results highlight the importance of treating kspace trajectory design not merely as an acceleration mechanism, but as an active degree of freedom for improving domain generalization in MRI reconstruction.</p>

<p>Abstract: Brain tumors pose a significant threat to human life, therefore it is very much necessary to detect them accurately in the early stages for better diagnosis and treatment. Brain tumors can be detected by the radiologist manually from the MRI scan images of the patients. However, the incidence of brain tumors has risen amongst children and adolescents in recent years, resulting in a substantial volume of data, as a result, it is time-consuming and difficult to detect manually. With the emergence of Artificial intelligence in the modern world and its vast application in the medical field, we can make an approach to the CAD (Computer Aided Diagnosis) system for the early detection of Brain tumors automatically. All the existing models for this task are not completely generalized and perform poorly on the validation data. So, we have proposed two novel Deep Learning Architectures - (a) SAETCN (Self-Attention Enhancement Tumor Classification Network) for the classification of different kinds of brain tumors. We have achieved an accuracy of 99.38% on the validation dataset making it one of the few Novel Deep learning-based architecture that is capable of detecting brain tumors accurately. We have trained the model on the dataset, which contains images of 3 types of tumors (glioma, meningioma, and pituitary tumors) and non-tumor cases. and (b) SAS-Net (Self-Attentive Segmentation Network) for the accurate segmentation of brain tumors. We have achieved an overall pixel accuracy of 99.23%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dalia Alzu'bi, A. Ben Hamza</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a fundamental task in computer-aided diagnosis, requiring models that balance segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency. However, existing segmentation models often struggle to effectively capture local and global contextual information, leading to boundary pixel loss and segmentation errors. In this paper, we propose U-CycleMLP, a novel U-shaped encoder-decoder network designed to enhance segmentation performance while maintaining a lightweight architecture. The encoder learns multiscale contextual features using position attention weight excitation blocks, dense atrous blocks, and downsampling operations, effectively capturing both local and global contextual information. The decoder reconstructs high-resolution segmentation masks through upsampling operations, dense atrous blocks, and feature fusion mechanisms, ensuring precise boundary delineation. To further refine segmentation predictions, channel CycleMLP blocks are incorporated into the decoder along the skip connections, enhancing feature integration while maintaining linear computational complexity relative to input size. Experimental results, both quantitative and qualitative, across three benchmark datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of U-CycleMLP in comparison with state-of-the-art methods, achieving better segmentation accuracy across all datasets, capturing fine-grained anatomical structures, and demonstrating robustness across different medical imaging modalities. Ablation studies further highlight the importance of the model's core architectural components in enhancing segmentation accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in 3D-aware generative models have enabled high-fidelity image synthesis of human identities. However, this progress raises urgent questions around user consent and the ability to remove specific individuals from a model's output space. We address this by introducing SUGAR, a framework for scalable generative unlearning that enables the removal of many identities (simultaneously or sequentially) without retraining the entire model. Rather than projecting unwanted identities to unrealistic outputs or relying on static template faces, SUGAR learns a personalized surrogate latent for each identity, diverting reconstructions to visually coherent alternatives while preserving the model's quality and diversity. We further introduce a continual utility preservation objective that guards against degradation as more identities are forgotten. SUGAR achieves state-of-the-art performance in removing up to 200 identities, while delivering up to a 700% improvement in retention utility compared to existing baselines.

Results confirm the effectiveness of GAGM and SEVector in enhancing feature discriminability and reducing false negatives, particularly for malignant cases. In our experiments, however, the Feature Smoothing Loss did not yield measurable improvements under mammography classification conditions, suggesting that its effectiveness may depend on specific architectural and computational assumptions. Beyond validation, our contribution extends the original framework through multi metric evaluation (macro F1, per class recall variance, ROC/AUC), feature interpretability analysis (Grad CAM), and the development of an interactive dashboard for clinical exploration. As a perspective, we highlight the need to explore alternative approaches to improve intra class compactness and inter class separability, with the specific goal of enhancing the distinction between malignant and benign cases in mammography classification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhao Su, Anwesa Choudhuri, Zhongpai Gao, Benjamin Planche, Van Nguyen Nguyen, Meng Zheng, Yuhan Shen, Arun Innanje, Terrence Chen, Ehsan Elhamifar, Ziyan Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large vision-language models struggle with medical video understanding, where spatial precision, temporal reasoning, and clinical semantics are critical. To address this, we first introduce \textbf{MedVidBench}, a large-scale benchmark of 531,850 video-instruction pairs across 8 medical sources spanning video, segment, and frame-level tasks, curated through a rigorous quality assurance pipeline with expert-guided prompting and dual-model validation. While supervised fine-tuning on MedVidBench yields noticeable gains, standard Reinforcement Learning (RL) fails due to imbalanced reward scales across datasets, which destabilizes optimization and leads to training collapse. To overcome this, we introduce \textbf{MedGRPO}, a novel RL framework for balanced multi-dataset training with two key innovations: (1) \emph{cross-dataset reward normalization} that maps each dataset's median performance to a common reward value, ensuring fair optimization regardless of difficulty, and (2) a \emph{medical LLM judge} that evaluates caption quality on five clinical dimensions through comparative similarity scoring. Supervised fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL-7B on MedVidBench substantially outperforms GPT-4.1 and Gemini-2.5-Flash across all tasks, demonstrating MedVidBench's efficacy, while our MedGRPO framework further improves upon the SFT baseline across grounding and captioning tasks. Our work establishes a foundational benchmark and robust training methodology for advancing vision-language models in medical domains.

<p>Abstract: Cyanobacterial Harmful Algal Blooms (CyanoHABs) pose significant threats to aquatic ecosystems and public health globally. Lake Champlain is particularly vulnerable to recurring CyanoHAB events, especially in its northern segment: Missisquoi Bay, St. Albans Bay, and Northeast Arm, due to nutrient enrichment and climatic variability. Remote sensing provides a scalable solution for monitoring and forecasting these events, offering continuous coverage where in situ observations are sparse or unavailable. In this study, we present a remote sensing only forecasting framework that combines Transformers and BiLSTM to predict CyanoHAB intensities up to 14 days in advance. The system utilizes Cyanobacterial Index data from the Cyanobacterial Assessment Network and temperature data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellites to capture long range dependencies and sequential dynamics in satellite time series. The dataset is very sparse, missing more than 30% of the Cyanobacterial Index data and 90% of the temperature data. A two stage preprocessing pipeline addressed data gaps by applying forward fill and weighted temporal imputation at the pixel level, followed by smoothing to reduce the discontinuities of CyanoHAB events. The raw dataset is transformed into meaningful features through equal frequency binning for the Cyanobacterial Index values and extracted temperature statistics. Transformer BiLSTM model demonstrates strong forecasting performance across multiple horizons, achieving F1 scores of 89.5%, 86.4%, and 85.5% at one, two, and three-day forecasts, respectively, and maintaining an F1 score of 78.9% with an AUC of 82.6% at the 14-day horizon. These results confirm the model's ability to capture complex spatiotemporal dynamics from sparse satellite data and to provide reliable early warning for CyanoHABs management.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kazuya Nishimura, Haruka Hirose, Ryoma Bise, Kaito Shiku, Yasuhiro Kojima</p>
<p>Abstract: Gene expression estimation from pathology images has the potential to reduce the RNA sequencing cost. Point-wise loss functions have been widely used to minimize the discrepancy between predicted and absolute gene expression values. However, due to the complexity of the sequencing techniques and intrinsic variability across cells, the observed gene expression contains stochastic noise and batch effects, and estimating the absolute expression values accurately remains a significant challenge. To mitigate this, we propose a novel objective of learning relative expression patterns rather than absolute levels. We assume that the relative expression levels of genes exhibit consistent patterns across independent experiments, even when absolute expression values are affected by batch effects and stochastic noise in tissue samples. Based on the assumption, we model the relation and propose a novel loss function called STRank that is robust to noise and batch effects. Experiments using synthetic datasets and real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The code is available at https://github.com/naivete5656/STRank.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06613">Hierarchical Deep Learning for Diatom Image Classification: A Multi-Level Taxonomic Approach</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yueying Ke</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate taxonomic identification of diatoms is essential for aquatic ecosystem monitoring, yet conventional methods depend heavily on expert taxonomists. Recent deep learning approaches improve automation, but most treat diatom recognition as flat classification predicting only one taxonomic rank. We investigate whether embedding taxonomic hierarchy into neural network architectures can improve both accuracy and error locality.
  We introduce a hierarchical convolutional network with five cascaded heads that jointly predict class, order, family, genus, and species. Each head receives shared backbone features and probability distributions from higher levels, with binary masks restricting predictions to valid descendants during training and inference. Using a filtered dataset of 1,456 diatom images covering 82 species, we compare hierarchical and flat models under identical settings.
  The hierarchical model matches flat baselines at species level (69.4% accuracy) while outperforming at all upper taxonomic levels. When species predictions fail, errors remain taxonomically local: 92.5 % of misclassified species are correctly predicted at genus level, versus 67.2% for flat baselines. The hierarchical model reduces mean taxonomic distance by 38.2% (1.209 vs. 1.955).
  Progressive training reveals bidirectional mechanisms: hierarchical constraint masks operate top-down to constrain prediction space, while gradients from fine-grained levels propagate bottom-up through the shared backbone, refining features. This improves class accuracy from 96.2% to 99.5% and yields 6-8% gains at upper levels, producing more robust, interpretable, and biologically aligned predictions for multi-level taxonomic classification.</p>

<p>Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing can reveal the influence of dark-matter substructure in galaxies, but analyzing these effects from noisy, low-resolution images poses a significant challenge. In this work, we propose a masked autoencoder (MAE) pretraining strategy on simulated strong-lensing images from the DeepLense ML4SCI benchmark to learn generalizable representations for two downstream tasks: (i) classifying the underlying dark matter model (cold dark matter, axion-like, or no substructure) and (ii) enhancing low-resolution lensed images via super-resolution. We pretrain a Vision Transformer encoder using a masked image modeling objective, then fine-tune the encoder separately for each task. Our results show that MAE pretraining, when combined with appropriate mask ratio tuning, yields a shared encoder that matches or exceeds a ViT trained from scratch. Specifically, at a 90% mask ratio, the fine-tuned classifier achieves macro AUC of 0.968 and accuracy of 88.65%, compared to the scratch baseline (AUC 0.957, accuracy 82.46%). For super-resolution (16x16 to 64x64), the MAE-pretrained model reconstructs images with PSNR ~33 dB and SSIM 0.961, modestly improving over scratch training. We ablate the MAE mask ratio, revealing a consistent trade-off: higher mask ratios improve classification but slightly degrade reconstruction fidelity. Our findings demonstrate that MAE pretraining on physics-rich simulations provides a flexible, reusable encoder for multiple strong-lensing analysis tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiyan Zhao, Yue Yan, Da-Han Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: In scene text detection, Transformer-based methods have addressed the global feature extraction limitations inherent in traditional convolution neural network-based methods. However, most directly rely on native Transformer attention layers as encoders without evaluating their cross-domain limitations and inherent shortcomings: forgetting important information or focusing on irrelevant representations when modeling long-range dependencies for text detection. The recently proposed state space model Mamba has demonstrated better long-range dependencies modeling through a linear complexity selection mechanism. Therefore, we propose a novel scene text detector based on Mamba that integrates the selection mechanism with attention layers, enhancing the encoder's ability to extract relevant information from long sequences. We adopt the Top\_k algorithm to explicitly select key information and reduce the interference of irrelevant information in Mamba modeling. Additionally, we design a dual-scale feed-forward network and an embedding pyramid enhancement module to facilitate high-dimensional hidden state interactions and multi-scale feature fusion. Our method achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance on various benchmarks, with F-measures of 89.7\%, 89.2\%, and 78.5\% on CTW1500, TotalText, and ICDAR19ArT, respectively.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruoyu Xue, Hieu Le, Jingyi Xu, Sounak Mondal, Abe Leite, Gregory Zelinsky, Minh Hoai, Dimitris Samaras</p>
<p>Abstract: People can view the same image differently: they focus on different regions, objects, and details in varying orders and describe them in distinct linguistic styles. This leads to substantial variability in image descriptions. However, existing models for personalized image description focus on linguistic style alone, with no prior work leveraging individual viewing patterns. We address this gap by explicitly modeling personalized viewing behavior as a core factor in description generation. Our method, DEPER (DEscription-PERception persona encoder), learns a subject embedding that captures both linguistic style and viewing behavior, guided by an auxiliary attention-prediction task. A lightweight adapter aligns these embeddings with a frozen vision-language model, enabling few-shot personalization without retraining. Across four datasets spanning diverse viewing tasks and both short and detailed descriptions, DEPER achieves a 24% average improvement, showing that modeling personalized attention produces more human-aligned and high-quality descriptions. We posit that understanding how people see helps predict what they say; modeling human diversity in perception can improve both performance and human alignment in multimodal systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Qi, Yumeng Zhang, Chenting Gong, Xiao Tan, Weiming Zhang, Wei Zhang, Jingdong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in a broad range of vision-language tasks, such as general visual question answering and optical character recognition (OCR). However, their performance on perception-centric tasks -- such as object detection, semantic segmentation, and depth estimation -- remains significantly inferior to that of task-specific expert models. For example, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct achieves only 19% mAP on COCO2017 val, particularly struggling with dense scenes and small object recall. In this work, we introduce Chain-of-Thought for Detection (CoT4Det), a simple but efficient strategy that reformulates perception tasks into three interpretable steps: classification, counting, and grounding -- each more naturally aligned with the reasoning capabilities of LVLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves perception performance without compromising general vision language capabilities. With a standard Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, CoT4Det boosts mAP from 19.0% to 33.0% on COCO2017 val and achieves competitive results across a variety of perception benchmarks, outperforming baselines by +2% on RefCOCO series and 19% on Flickr30k entities.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06673">1 + 1 &gt; 2: Detector-Empowered Video Large Language Model for Spatio-Temporal Grounding and Reasoning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shida Gao, Feng Xue, Xiangfeng Wang, Anlong Ming, Teng Long, Yihua Shao, Haozhe Wang, Zhaowen Lin, Wei Wang, Nicu Sebe</p>
<p>Abstract: Spatio-temporal grounding and reasoning aims to locate the temporal segment and spatial region of an event in a video given a user query, while also reasoning about semantics such as causality, temporal order, and action relationships. To achieve this, current MLLMs primarily treats bounding boxes as text tokens and generates them autoregressively. However, such autoregressive spatial decoding leads to very-long output sequences, causing spatial errors to accumulated over time and the localization results to progressively drift across a video. To address this, we present a Detector-Empowered Video LLM, short for DEViL, which couples a Video LLM with an open-vocabulary detector (OVD). Specifically, the MLLM and detector are connected via a reference-semantic token (RST) that distills the user query into a rich semantic representation. Unlike tokens that merely serve as spatial prompts or segmentor switches, the RST functions as both a control signal and a replacement for the OVD's text embedding, enabling end-to-end learning of both referential understanding and spatial localization. Furthermore, we propose a tube-mined temporal regularization (TTReg) within OVD, which drives the OVD to generate temporally-consistent queries for target objects, thereby ensuring effective temporal association. Experiments demonstrate that DEViL achieves strong performance across various fine-grained video understanding tasks, particularly STVG and GroundedVQA.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Songping Wang, Rufan Qian, Yueming Lyu, Qinglong Liu, Linzhuang Zou, Jie Qin, Songhua Liu, Caifeng Shan</p>
<p>Abstract: Image-to-Video (I2V) generation synthesizes dynamic visual content from image and text inputs, providing significant creative control. However, the security of such multimodal systems, particularly their vulnerability to jailbreak attacks, remains critically underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose RunawayEvil, the first multimodal jailbreak framework for I2V models with dynamic evolutionary capability. Built on a "Strategy-Tactic-Action" paradigm, our framework exhibits self-amplifying attack through three core components: (1) Strategy-Aware Command Unit that enables the attack to self-evolve its strategies through reinforcement learning-driven strategy customization and LLM-based strategy exploration; (2) Multimodal Tactical Planning Unit that generates coordinated text jailbreak instructions and image tampering guidelines based on the selected strategies; (3) Tactical Action Unit that executes and evaluates the multimodal coordinated attacks. This self-evolving architecture allows the framework to continuously adapt and intensify its attack strategies without human intervention. Extensive experiments demonstrate RunawayEvil achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates on commercial I2V models, such as Open-Sora 2.0 and CogVideoX. Specifically, RunawayEvil outperforms existing methods by 58.5 to 79 percent on COCO2017. This work provides a critical tool for vulnerability analysis of I2V models, thereby laying a foundation for more robust video generation systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yumeng He, Zanwei Zhou, Yekun Zheng, Chen Liang, Yunbo Wang, Xiaokang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Volume electron microscopy (vEM) enables nanoscale 3D imaging of biological structures but remains constrained by acquisition trade-offs, leading to anisotropic volumes with limited axial resolution. Existing deep learning methods seek to restore isotropy by leveraging lateral priors, yet their assumptions break down for morphologically anisotropic structures. We present EMGauss, a general framework for 3D reconstruction from planar scanned 2D slices with applications in vEM, which circumvents the inherent limitations of isotropy-based approaches. Our key innovation is to reframe slice-to-3D reconstruction as a 3D dynamic scene rendering problem based on Gaussian splatting, where the progression of axial slices is modeled as the temporal evolution of 2D Gaussian point clouds. To enhance fidelity in data-sparse regimes, we incorporate a Teacher-Student bootstrapping mechanism that uses high-confidence predictions on unobserved slices as pseudo-supervisory signals. Compared with diffusion- and GAN-based reconstruction methods, EMGauss substantially improves interpolation quality, enables continuous slice synthesis, and eliminates the need for large-scale pretraining. Beyond vEM, it potentially provides a generalizable slice-to-3D solution across diverse imaging domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jisoo Park, Seonghak Lee, Guisik Kim, Taewoo Kim, Junseok Kwon</p>
<p>Abstract: Speech Enhancement (SE) and Speech Separation (SS) have traditionally been treated as distinct tasks in speech processing. However, real-world audio often involves both background noise and overlapping speakers, motivating the need for a unified solution. While recent approaches have attempted to integrate SE and SS within multi-stage architectures, these approaches typically involve complex, parameter-heavy models and rely on supervised training, limiting scalability and generalization. In this work, we propose UniVoiceLite, a lightweight and unsupervised audio-visual framework that unifies SE and SS within a single model. UniVoiceLite leverages lip motion and facial identity cues to guide speech extraction and employs Wasserstein distance regularization to stabilize the latent space without requiring paired noisy-clean data. Experimental results demonstrate that UniVoiceLite achieves strong performance in both noisy and multi-speaker scenarios, combining efficiency with robust generalization.

Building on these findings, we introduce ECVGPO (Entropy Control Visual Grounding Policy Optimization), an interpretable algorithm designed for effective entropy regulation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaxing Fan, Jiaojiao Liu, Wenkong Wang, Yang Zhang, Xin Ma, Jichen Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Most stroke patients experience upper limb motor dysfunction. Compensatory movements are prevalent during rehabilitation training, which is detrimental to patients' long-term recovery. Therefore, detecting compensatory movements is of great significance. In this study, a Graph Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory Attention Network (GCN-LSTM-ATT) based on skeleton data is proposed for the detection of compensatory movements after stroke. Sixteen stroke patients were selected in the research. The skeleton data of the patients performing specific rehabilitation movements were collected using the Kinect depth camera. After data processing, detection models were constructed respectively using the GCN-LSTM-ATT model, the Support Vector Machine(SVM), the K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm(KNN), and the Random Forest(RF). The results show that the detection accuracy of the GCN-LSTM-ATT model reaches 0.8580, which is significantly higher than that of traditional machine learning algorithms. Ablation experiments indicate that each component of the model contributes significantly to the performance improvement. These findings provide a more precise and powerful tool for the detection of compensatory movements after stroke, and are expected to facilitate the optimization of rehabilitation training strategies for stroke patients.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> M Yashwanth, Sampath Koti, Arunabh Singh, Shyam Marjit, Anirban Chakraborty</p>
<p>Abstract: We address the Federated source-Free Domain Adaptation (FFreeDA) problem, with clients holding unlabeled data with significant inter-client domain gaps. The FFreeDA setup constrains the FL frameworks to employ only a pre-trained server model as the setup restricts access to the source dataset during the training rounds. Often, this source domain dataset has a distinct distribution to the clients' domains. To address the challenges posed by the FFreeDA setup, adaptation of the Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) methods to FL struggles with client-drift in real-world scenarios due to extreme data heterogeneity caused by the aforementioned domain gaps, resulting in unreliable pseudo-labels. In this paper, we introduce FedSCAl, an FL framework leveraging our proposed Server-Client Alignment (SCAl) mechanism to regularize client updates by aligning the clients' and server model's predictions. We observe an improvement in the clients' pseudo-labeling accuracy post alignment, as the SCAl mechanism helps to mitigate the client-drift. Further, we present extensive experiments on benchmark vision datasets showcasing how FedSCAl consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FL methods in the FFreeDA setup for classification tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruoxin Chen, Jiahui Gao, Kaiqing Lin, Keyue Zhang, Yandan Zhao, Isabel Guan, Taiping Yao, Shouhong Ding</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly adopted for AI-generated images (AIGI) detection, yet converting VLMs into detectors requires substantial resource, while the resulting models still exhibit severe hallucinations. To probe the core issue, we conduct an empirical analysis and observe two characteristic behaviors: (i) fine-tuning VLMs on high-level semantic supervision strengthens semantic discrimination and well generalize to unseen data; (ii) fine-tuning VLMs on low-level pixel-artifact supervision yields poor transfer. We attribute VLMs' underperformance to task-model misalignment: semantics-oriented VLMs inherently lack sensitivity to fine-grained pixel artifacts, and semantically non-discriminative pixel artifacts thus exceeds their inductive biases. In contrast, we observe that conventional pixel-artifact detectors capture low-level pixel artifacts yet exhibit limited semantic awareness relative to VLMs, highlighting that distinct models are better matched to distinct tasks. In this paper, we formalize AIGI detection as two complementary tasks--semantic consistency checking and pixel-artifact detection--and show that neglecting either induces systematic blind spots. Guided by this view, we introduce the Task-Model Alignment principle and instantiate it as a two-branch detector, AlignGemini, comprising a VLM fine-tuned exclusively with pure semantic supervision and a pixel-artifact expert trained exclusively with pure pixel-artifact supervision. By enforcing orthogonal supervision on two simplified datasets, each branch trains to its strengths, producing complementary discrimination over semantic and pixel cues. On five in-the-wild benchmarks, AlignGemini delivers a +9.5 gain in average accuracy, supporting task-model alignment as an effective path to generalizable AIGI detection.</p>

<p>Abstract: Image quality assessment (IQA) and image restoration are fundamental problems in low-level vision. Although IQA and restoration are closely connected conceptually, most existing work treats them in isolation. Recent advances in unified multimodal understanding-generation models demonstrate promising results and indicate that stronger understanding can improve generative performance. This motivates a single model that unifies IQA and restoration and explicitly studies how IQA can guide restoration, a setting that remains largely underexplored yet highly valuable. In this paper, we propose UARE, to our knowledge the first Unified vision-language model for image quality Assessment, Restoration, and Enhancement. Built on pretrained unified understanding and generation models, we introduce a two-stage training framework. First, a progressive, easy-to-hard schedule expands from single-type distortions to higher-order mixed degradations, enabling UARE to handle multiple degradations. Second, we perform unified fine-tuning of quality understanding and restoration with interleaved text-image data, aligning IQA signals with restoration objectives. Through multi-task co-training, UARE leverages IQA to boost restoration and enhancement performance. Extensive experiments across IQA, restoration, and enhancement tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of UARE. The code and models will be available at https://github.com/lwq20020127/UARE.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenbo Lyu, Yingjun Du, Jinglin Zhao, Xianton Zhen, Ling Shao</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding multi-image, multi-turn scenarios is a critical yet underexplored capability for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Existing benchmarks predominantly focus on static or horizontal comparisons -- e.g., spotting visual differences or assessing appropriateness -- while relying heavily on language cues. Such settings overlook progressive, context-dependent reasoning and the challenge of visual-to-visual inference. To bridge this gap, we present VisChainBench, a large-scale benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate LVLMs' ability to perform multi-step visual reasoning across sequential, interdependent tasks with minimal language guidance. VisChainBench contains 1,457 tasks spanning over 20,000 images across three diverse domains (e.g., daily scenarios, engineering troubleshooting), structured to mimic real-world decision-making processes. Uniquely, the benchmark is constructed using a multi-agent generation pipeline, ensuring high visual diversity and controlled language bias. All the benchmark data and code for benchmark construction are available for viewing and download via following Link: https://huggingface.co/datasets/eyehole/VisChainBench</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengyang Yan, Mitch Bryson, Donald G. Dansereau</p>
<p>Abstract: The quality of captured images strongly influences the performance of downstream perception tasks. Recent works on co-designing camera systems with perception tasks have shown improved task performance. However, most prior approaches focus on optimising fixed camera parameters set at manufacturing, while many parameters, such as exposure settings, require adaptive control at runtime. This paper introduces a method that jointly optimises camera hardware and adaptive camera control algorithms with downstream vision tasks. We present a unified optimisation framework that integrates gradient-based and derivative-free methods, enabling support for both continuous and discrete parameters, non-differentiable image formation processes, and neural network-based adaptive control algorithms. To address non-differentiable effects such as motion blur, we propose DF-Grad, a hybrid optimisation strategy that trains adaptive control networks using signals from a derivative-free optimiser alongside unsupervised task-driven learning. Experiments show that our method outperforms baselines that optimise static and dynamic parameters separately, particularly under challenging conditions such as low light and fast motion. These results demonstrate that jointly optimising hardware parameters and adaptive control algorithms improves perception performance and provides a unified approach to task-driven camera system design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hang Yin, Xiaomin He, PeiWen Yuan, Yiwei Li, Jiayi Shi, Wenxiao Fan, Shaoxiong Feng, Kan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing vision-language models often suffer from spatial hallucinations, i.e., generating incorrect descriptions about the relative positions of objects in an image. We argue that this problem mainly stems from the asymmetric properties between images and text. To enrich the spatial understanding ability of vision-language models, we propose a simple, annotation-free, plug-and-play method named $\text{Stitch and Tell}$ (abbreviated as SiTe), which injects structured spatial supervision into data. It constructs stitched image-text pairs by stitching images along a spatial axis and generating spatially-aware captions or question answer pairs based on the layout of stitched image, without relying on costly advanced models or human involvement. We evaluate SiTe across three architectures including LLaVA-v1.5-7B, LLaVA-Qwen2-1.5B and HALVA-7B, two training datasets, and eight benchmarks. Experiments show that SiTe improves spatial understanding tasks such as $\text{MME}_{\text{Position}}$ (+5.50%) and Spatial-MM (+4.19%), while maintaining or improving performance on general vision-language benchmarks including COCO-QA (+1.02%) and MMBench (+4.76%). Our findings suggest that explicitly injecting spatially-aware structure into training data offers an effective way to mitigate spatial hallucinations and improve spatial understanding, while preserving general vision-language capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Longjie Zhao, Ziming Hong, Zhenyang Ren, Runnan Chen, Mingming Gong, Tongliang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled the creation of digital assets and downstream applications, underscoring the need for robust copyright protection via digital watermarking. However, existing 3DGS watermarking methods remain highly vulnerable to diffusion-based editing, which can easily erase embedded provenance. This challenge highlights the urgent need for 3DGS watermarking techniques that are intrinsically resilient to diffusion-based editing. In this paper, we introduce RDSplat, a Robust watermarking paradigm against Diffusion editing for 3D Gaussian Splatting. RDSplat embeds watermarks into 3DGS components that diffusion-based editing inherently preserve, achieved through (i) proactively targeting low-frequency Gaussians and (ii) adversarial training with a diffusion proxy. Specifically, we introduce a multi-domain framework that operates natively in 3DGS space and embeds watermarks into diffusion-editing-preserved low-frequency Gaussians via coordinated covariance regularization and 2D filtering. In addition, we exploit the low-pass filtering behavior of diffusion-based editing by using Gaussian blur as an efficient training surrogate, enabling adversarial fine-tuning that further enhances watermark robustness against diffusion-based editing. Empirically, comprehensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that RDSplat not only maintains superior robustness under diffusion-based editing, but also preserves watermark invisibility, achieving state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Applications providing automated coaching for physical training are increasing in popularity, for example physical therapy. These applications rely on accurate and robust pose estimation using monocular video streams. State-of-the-art models like BlazePose excel in real-time pose tracking, but their lack of anatomical constraints indicates improvement potential by including physical knowledge. We present a real-time post-processing algorithm fusing the strengths of BlazePose 3D and 2D estimations using a weighted optimization, penalizing deviations from expected bone length and biomechanical models. Bone length estimations are refined to the individual anatomy using a Kalman filter with adapting measurement trust. Evaluation using the Physio2.2M dataset shows a 10.2 percent reduction in 3D MPJPE and a 16.6 percent decrease in errors of angles between body segments compared to BlazePose 3D estimation. Our method provides a robust, anatomically consistent pose estimation based on a computationally efficient video-to-3D pose estimation, suitable for automated physiotherapy, healthcare, and sports coaching on consumer-level laptops and mobile devices. The refinement runs on the backend with anonymized data only.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaxin Liu, Gangwei Xu, Xianqi Wang, Chengliang Zhang, Xin Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-time stereo matching methods primarily focus on enhancing in-domain performance but often overlook the critical importance of generalization in real-world applications. In contrast, recent stereo foundation models leverage monocular foundation models (MFMs) to improve generalization, but typically suffer from substantial inference latency. To address this trade-off, we propose Generalized Geometry Encoding Volume (GGEV), a novel real-time stereo matching network that achieves strong generalization. We first extract depth-aware features that encode domain-invariant structural priors as guidance for cost aggregation. Subsequently, we introduce a Depth-aware Dynamic Cost Aggregation (DDCA) module that adaptively incorporates these priors into each disparity hypothesis, effectively enhancing fragile matching relationships in unseen scenes. Both steps are lightweight and complementary, leading to the construction of a generalized geometry encoding volume with strong generalization capability. Experimental results demonstrate that our GGEV surpasses all existing real-time methods in zero-shot generalization capability, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI 2012, KITTI 2015, and ETH3D benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yutong Wang, Haiyu Zhang, Tianfan Xue, Yu Qiao, Yaohui Wang, Chang Xu, Xinyuan Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid development of generative models has significantly advanced image and video applications. Among these, video creation, aimed at generating videos under various conditions, has gained substantial attention. However, existing video creation models either focus solely on a few specific conditions or suffer from excessively long generation times due to complex model inference, making them impractical for real-world applications. To mitigate these issues, we propose an efficient unified video creation model, named VDOT. Concretely, we model the training process with the distribution matching distillation (DMD) paradigm. Instead of using the Kullback-Leibler (KL) minimization, we additionally employ a novel computational optimal transport (OT) technique to optimize the discrepancy between the real and fake score distributions. The OT distance inherently imposes geometric constraints, mitigating potential zero-forcing or gradient collapse issues that may arise during KL-based distillation within the few-step generation scenario, and thus, enhances the efficiency and stability of the distillation process. Further, we integrate a discriminator to enable the model to perceive real video data, thereby enhancing the quality of generated videos. To support training unified video creation models, we propose a fully automated pipeline for video data annotation and filtering that accommodates multiple video creation tasks. Meanwhile, we curate a unified testing benchmark, UVCBench, to standardize evaluation. Experiments demonstrate that our 4-step VDOT outperforms or matches other baselines with 100 denoising steps.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yueqian Wang, Songxiang Liu, Disong Wang, Nuo Xu, Guanglu Wan, Huishuai Zhang, Dongyan Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in video multimodal large language models (Video MLLMs) have significantly enhanced video understanding and multi-modal interaction capabilities. While most existing systems operate in a turn-based manner where the model can only reply after user turns, proactively deciding when to reply during video playback presents a promising yet challenging direction for real-time applications. In this work, we propose a novel text-to-text approach to proactive interaction, where the model autonomously determines whether to respond or remain silent at each turn based on dialogue history and visual context up to current frame of an streaming video. To overcome difficulties in previous methods such as manually tuning response decision thresholds and annotating precise reply times, we introduce a multi-turn RL based training method that encourages timely and accurate responses without requiring precise response time annotations. We train our model MMDuet2 on a dataset of 52k videos with two types of dialogues via SFT and RL. Experimental results demonstrate that MMDuet2 outperforms existing proactive Video MLLM baselines in response timing and quality, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the ProactiveVideoQA benchmark.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06811">RMAdapter: Reconstruction-based Multi-Modal Adapter for Vision-Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiang Lin, Weixin Li, Shu Guo, Lihong Wang, Di Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs), \textit{e.g.} CLIP, have become essential tools in multimodal transfer learning. However, fine-tuning VLMs in few-shot scenarios poses significant challenges in balancing task-specific adaptation and generalization in the obtained model. Meanwhile, current researches have predominantly focused on prompt-based adaptation methods, leaving adapter-based approaches underexplored and revealing notable performance gaps. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel Reconstruction-based Multimodal Adapter (RMAdapter), which leverages a dual-branch architecture. Unlike conventional single-branch adapters, RMAdapter consists of: (1) an adaptation branch that injects task-specific knowledge through parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and (2) a reconstruction branch that preserves general knowledge by reconstructing latent space features back into the original feature space. This design facilitates a dynamic balance between general and task-specific knowledge. Importantly, although RMAdapter introduces an additional reconstruction branch, it is carefully optimized to remain lightweight. By computing reconstruction loss locally at each layer and sharing projection modules, the overall computational overhead is kept minimal. A consistency constraint is also incorporated to better regulate the trade-off between discriminability and generalization. We comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of RMAdapter on three representative tasks: generalization to new categories, generalization to new target datasets, and domain generalization. Without relying on data augmentation or duplicate prompt designs, our RMAdapter consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across all evaluation metrics.</p>

However, their point-based representations remain incompatible with mesh-based pipelines that power AR/VR and game engines. We present MeshSplatting, a mesh-based reconstruction approach that jointly optimizes geometry and appearance through differentiable rendering. By enforcing connectivity via restricted Delaunay triangulation and refining surface consistency, MeshSplatting creates end-to-end smooth, visually high-quality meshes that render efficiently in real-time 3D engines. On Mip-NeRF360, it boosts PSNR by +0.69 dB over the current state-of-the-art MiLo for mesh-based novel view synthesis, while training 2x faster and using 2x less memory, bridging neural rendering and interactive 3D graphics for seamless real-time scene interaction.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahao Wang, Zhongwei Jiang, Wenchao Sun, Jiaru Zhong, Haibao Yu, Yuner Zhang, Chenyang Lu, Chuang Zhang, Lei He, Shaobing Xu, Jianqiang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Cooperative perception is critical for autonomous driving, overcoming the inherent limitations of a single vehicle, such as occlusions and constrained fields-of-view. However, current approaches sharing dense Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) features are constrained by quadratically-scaling communication costs and the lack of flexibility and interpretability for precise alignment across asynchronous or disparate viewpoints. While emerging sparse query-based methods offer an alternative, they often suffer from inadequate geometric representations, suboptimal fusion strategies, and training instability. In this paper, we propose SparseCoop, a fully sparse cooperative perception framework for 3D detection and tracking that completely discards intermediate BEV representations. Our framework features a trio of innovations: a kinematic-grounded instance query that uses an explicit state vector with 3D geometry and velocity for precise spatio-temporal alignment; a coarse-to-fine aggregation module for robust fusion; and a cooperative instance denoising task to accelerate and stabilize training. Experiments on V2X-Seq and Griffin datasets show SparseCoop achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, it delivers this with superior computational efficiency, low transmission cost, and strong robustness to communication latency.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Satoshi Hashimoto, Tatsuya Konishi, Tomoya Kaichi, Kazunori Matsumoto, Mori Kurokawa</p>
<p>Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) has long been studied as a crucial problem in public security and crime prevention. In recent years, weakly-supervised VAD (WVAD) have attracted considerable attention due to their easy annotation process and promising research results. While existing WVAD methods tackle mainly on static datasets, the possibility that the domain of data can vary has been neglected. To adapt such domain-shift, the continual learning (CL) perspective is required because otherwise additional training only with new coming data could easily cause performance degradation for previous data, i.e., forgetting. Therefore, we propose a brand-new approach, called Continual Anomaly Detection with Ensembles (CADE) that is the first work combining CL and WVAD viewpoints. Specifically, CADE uses the Dual-Generator(DG) to address data imbalance and label uncertainty in WVAD. We also found that forgetting exacerbates the "incompleteness'' where the model becomes biased towards certain anomaly modes, leading to missed detections of various anomalies. To address this, we propose to ensemble Multi-Discriminator (MD) that capture missed anomalies in past scenes due to forgetting, using multiple models. Extensive experiments show that CADE significantly outperforms existing VAD methods on the common multi-scene VAD datasets, such as ShanghaiTech and Charlotte Anomaly datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Satoshi Hashimoto, Hitoshi Nishimura, Yanan Wang, Mori Kurokawa</p>
<p>Abstract: Deploying video anomaly detection in practice is hampered by the scarcity and collection cost of real abnormal footage. We address this by training without any real abnormal videos while evaluating under the standard weakly supervised split, and we introduce PA-VAD, a generation-driven approach that learns a detector from synthesized pseudo-abnormal videos paired with real normal videos, using only a small set of real normal images to drive synthesis. For synthesis, we select class-relevant initial images with CLIP and refine textual prompts with a vision-language model to improve fidelity and scene consistency before invoking a video diffusion model. For training, we mitigate excessive spatiotemporal magnitude in synthesized anomalies by an domain-aligned regularized module that combines domain alignment and memory usage-aware updates. Extensive experiments show that our approach reaches 98.2% on ShanghaiTech and 82.5% on UCF-Crime, surpassing the strongest real-abnormal method on ShanghaiTech by +0.6% and outperforming the UVAD state-of-the-art on UCF-Crime by +1.9%. The results demonstrate that high-accuracy anomaly detection can be obtained without collecting real anomalies, providing a practical path toward scalable deployment.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate segmentation of vertebral metastasis in CT is clinically important yet difficult to scale, as voxel-level annotations are scarce and both lytic and blastic lesions often resemble benign degenerative changes. We introduce a weakly supervised method trained solely on vertebra-level healthy/malignant labels, without any lesion masks. The method combines a Diffusion Autoencoder (DAE) that produces a classifier-guided healthy edit of each vertebra with pixel-wise difference maps that propose candidate lesion regions. To determine which regions truly reflect malignancy, we introduce Hide-and-Seek Attribution: each candidate is revealed in turn while all others are hidden, the edited image is projected back to the data manifold by the DAE, and a latent-space classifier quantifies the isolated malignant contribution of that component. High-scoring regions form the final lytic or blastic segmentation. On held-out radiologist annotations, we achieve strong blastic/lytic performance despite no mask supervision (F1: 0.91/0.85; Dice: 0.87/0.78), exceeding baselines (F1: 0.79/0.67; Dice: 0.74/0.55). These results show that vertebra-level labels can be transformed into reliable lesion masks, demonstrating that generative editing combined with selective occlusion supports accurate weakly supervised segmentation in CT.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel task termed Omni-Referring Image Segmentation (OmniRIS) towards highly generalized image segmentation. Compared with existing unimodally conditioned segmentation tasks, such as RIS and visual RIS, OmniRIS supports the input of text instructions and reference images with masks, boxes or scribbles as omni-prompts. This property makes it can well exploit the intrinsic merits of both text and visual modalities, i.e., granular attribute referring and uncommon object grounding, respectively. Besides, OmniRIS can also handle various segmentation settings, such as one v.s. many and many v.s. many, further facilitating its practical use. To promote the research of OmniRIS, we also rigorously design and construct a large dataset termed OmniRef, which consists of 186,939 omni-prompts for 30,956 images, and establish a comprehensive evaluation system. Moreover, a strong and general baseline termed OmniSegNet is also proposed to tackle the key challenges of OmniRIS, such as omni-prompt encoding. The extensive experiments not only validate the capability of OmniSegNet in following omni-modal instructions, but also show the superiority of OmniRIS for highly generalized image segmentation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Video Instance Segmentation (VIS) faces significant annotation challenges due to its dual requirements of pixel-level masks and temporal consistency labels. While recent unsupervised methods like VideoCutLER eliminate optical flow dependencies through synthetic data, they remain constrained by the synthetic-to-real domain gap. We present AutoQ-VIS, a novel unsupervised framework that bridges this gap through quality-guided self-training. Our approach establishes a closed-loop system between pseudo-label generation and automatic quality assessment, enabling progressive adaptation from synthetic to real videos. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with 52.6 $\text{AP}_{50}$ on YouTubeVIS-2019 $\texttt{val}$ set, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art VideoCutLER by 4.4%, while requiring no human annotations. This demonstrates the viability of quality-aware self-training for unsupervised VIS. We will release the code at https://github.com/wcbup/AutoQ-VIS.</p>

<p>Abstract: Existing autonomous driving systems rely on onboard sensors (cameras, LiDAR, IMU, etc) for environmental perception. However, this paradigm is limited by the drive-time perception horizon and often fails under limited view scope, occlusion or extreme conditions such as darkness and rain. In contrast, human drivers are able to recall road structure even under poor visibility. To endow models with this ``recall" ability, we propose the spatial retrieval paradigm, introducing offline retrieved geographic images as an additional input. These images are easy to obtain from offline caches (e.g, Google Maps or stored autonomous driving datasets) without requiring additional sensors, making it a plug-and-play extension for existing AD tasks.
  For experiments, we first extend the nuScenes dataset with geographic images retrieved via Google Maps APIs and align the new data with ego-vehicle trajectories. We establish baselines across five core autonomous driving tasks: object detection, online mapping, occupancy prediction, end-to-end planning, and generative world modeling. Extensive experiments show that the extended modality could enhance the performance of certain tasks. We will open-source dataset curation code, data, and benchmarks for further study of this new autonomous driving paradigm.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) have achieved remarkable video understanding capabilities, yet face critical efficiency bottlenecks due to quadratic computational growth with lengthy visual token sequences of long videos. While existing keyframe sampling methods can improve temporal modeling efficiency, additional computational cost is introduced before feature encoding, and the binary frame selection paradigm is found suboptimal. Therefore, in this work, we propose Dynamic Token compression via LLM-guided Keyframe prior (DyToK), a training-free paradigm that enables dynamic token compression by harnessing VLLMs' inherent attention mechanisms. Our analysis reveals that VLLM attention layers naturally encoding query-conditioned keyframe priors, by which DyToK dynamically adjusts per-frame token retention ratios, prioritizing semantically rich frames while suppressing redundancies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DyToK achieves state-of-the-art efficiency-accuracy tradeoffs. DyToK shows plug-and-play compatibility with existing compression methods, such as VisionZip and FastV, attaining 4.3x faster inference while preserving accuracy across multiple VLLMs, such as LLaVA-OneVision and Qwen2.5-VL.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06870">Towards Robust Pseudo-Label Learning in Semantic Segmentation: An Encoding Perspective</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Wangkai Li, Rui Sun, Zhaoyang Li, Tianzhu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Pseudo-label learning is widely used in semantic segmentation, particularly in label-scarce scenarios such as unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) and semisupervised learning (SSL). Despite its success, this paradigm can generate erroneous pseudo-labels, which are further amplified during training due to utilization of one-hot encoding. To address this issue, we propose ECOCSeg, a novel perspective for segmentation models that utilizes error-correcting output codes (ECOC) to create a fine-grained encoding for each class. ECOCSeg offers several advantages. First, an ECOC-based classifier is introduced, enabling model to disentangle classes into attributes and handle partial inaccurate bits, improving stability and generalization in pseudo-label learning. Second, a bit-level label denoising mechanism is developed to generate higher-quality pseudo-labels, providing adequate and robust supervision for unlabeled images. ECOCSeg can be easily integrated with existing methods and consistently demonstrates significant improvements on multiple UDA and SSL benchmarks across different segmentation architectures.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammed Q. Alkhatib, Ali Jamali, Swalpa Kumar Roy</p>
<p>Abstract: Remote sensing scene classification plays a key role in Earth observation by enabling the automatic identification of land use and land cover (LULC) patterns from aerial and satellite imagery. Despite recent progress with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs), the task remains challenging due to variations in spatial resolution, viewpoint, orientation, and background conditions, which often reduce the generalization ability of existing models. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a lightweight architecture based on the convolutional mixer paradigm. The model alternates between spatial mixing through depthwise convolutions at multiple scales and channel mixing through pointwise operations, enabling efficient extraction of both local and contextual information while keeping the number of parameters and computations low. Extensive experiments were conducted on the AID and EuroSAT benchmarks. The proposed model achieved overall accuracy, average accuracy, and Kappa values of 74.7%, 74.57%, and 73.79 on the AID dataset, and 93.90%, 93.93%, and 93.22 on EuroSAT, respectively. These results demonstrate that the proposed approach provides a good balance between accuracy and efficiency compared with widely used CNN- and transformer-based models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Zhu, Naoya Chiba, Koichi Hashimoto</p>
<p>Abstract: Reliable 3D segmentation is critical for understanding complex scenes with dense layouts and multi-scale objects, as commonly seen in industrial environments. In such scenarios, heavy occlusion weakens geometric boundaries between objects, and large differences in object scale will cause end-to-end models fail to capture both coarse and fine details accurately. Existing 3D point-based methods require costly annotations, while image-guided methods often suffer from semantic inconsistencies across views. To address these challenges, we propose a hierarchical image-guided 3D segmentation framework that progressively refines segmentation from instance-level to part-level. Instance segmentation involves rendering a top-view image and projecting SAM-generated masks prompted by YOLO-World back onto the 3D point cloud. Part-level segmentation is subsequently performed by rendering multi-view images of each instance obtained from the previous stage and applying the same 2D segmentation and back-projection process at each view, followed by Bayesian updating fusion to ensure semantic consistency across views. Experiments on real-world factory data demonstrate that our method effectively handles occlusion and structural complexity, achieving consistently high per-class mIoU scores. Additional evaluations on public dataset confirm the generalization ability of our framework, highlighting its robustness, annotation efficiency, and adaptability to diverse 3D environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wancheng Feng, Chen An, Zhenliang He, Meina Kan, Shiguang Shan, Lukun Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Panorama generation has recently attracted growing interest in the research community, with two core tasks, text-to-panorama and view-to-panorama generation. However, existing methods still face two major challenges: their U-Net-based architectures constrain the visual quality of the generated panoramas, and they usually treat the two core tasks independently, which leads to modeling redundancy and inefficiency. To overcome these challenges, we propose a joint-face panorama (JoPano) generation approach that unifies the two core tasks within a DiT-based model. To transfer the rich generative capabilities of existing DiT backbones learned from natural images to the panorama domain, we propose a Joint-Face Adapter built on the cubemap representation of panoramas, which enables a pretrained DiT to jointly model and generate different views of a panorama. We further apply Poisson Blending to reduce seam inconsistencies that often appear at the boundaries between cube faces. Correspondingly, we introduce Seam-SSIM and Seam-Sobel metrics to quantitatively evaluate the seam consistency. Moreover, we propose a condition switching mechanism that unifies text-to-panorama and view-to-panorama tasks within a single model. Comprehensive experiments show that JoPano can generate high-quality panoramas for both text-to-panorama and view-to-panorama generation tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on FID, CLIP-FID, IS, and CLIP-Score metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wangkai Li, Rui Sun, Bohao Liao, Zhaoyang Li, Tianzhu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for semantic segmentation aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Despite the effectiveness of self-training techniques in UDA, they struggle to learn each class in a balanced manner due to inherent class imbalance and distribution shift in both data and label space between domains. To address this issue, we propose Balanced Learning for Domain Adaptation (BLDA), a novel approach to directly assess and alleviate class bias without requiring prior knowledge about the distribution shift. First, we identify over-predicted and under-predicted classes by analyzing the distribution of predicted logits. Subsequently, we introduce a post-hoc approach to align the logits distributions across different classes using shared anchor distributions. To further consider the network's need to generate unbiased pseudo-labels during self-training, we estimate logits distributions online and incorporate logits correction terms into the loss function. Moreover, we leverage the resulting cumulative density as domain-shared structural knowledge to connect the source and target domains. Extensive experiments on two standard UDA semantic segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that BLDA consistently improves performance, especially for under-predicted classes, when integrated into various existing methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liyang Song, Hardik Bishnoi, Sai Kumar Reddy Manne, Sarah Ostadabbas, Briana J. Taylor, Michael Wan</p>
<p>Abstract: The development of contactless respiration monitoring for infants could enable advances in the early detection and treatment of breathing irregularities, which are associated with neurodevelopmental impairments and conditions like sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). But while respiration estimation for adults is supported by a robust ecosystem of computer vision algorithms and video datasets, only one small public video dataset with annotated respiration data for infant subjects exists, and there are no reproducible algorithms which are effective for infants. We introduce the annotated infant respiration dataset of 400 videos (AIR-400), contributing 275 new, carefully annotated videos from 10 recruited subjects to the public corpus. We develop the first reproducible pipelines for infant respiration estimation, based on infant-specific region-of-interest detection and spatiotemporal neural processing enhanced by optical flow inputs. We establish, through comprehensive experiments, the first reproducible benchmarks for the state-of-the-art in vision-based infant respiration estimation. We make our dataset, code repository, and trained models available for public use.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reference-to-video (R2V) generation aims to synthesize videos that align with a text prompt while preserving the subject identity from reference images. However, current R2V methods are hindered by the reliance on explicit reference image-video-text triplets, whose construction is highly expensive and difficult to scale. We bypass this bottleneck by introducing Saber, a scalable zero-shot framework that requires no explicit R2V data. Trained exclusively on video-text pairs, Saber employs a masked training strategy and a tailored attention-based model design to learn identity-consistent and reference-aware representations. Mask augmentation techniques are further integrated to mitigate copy-paste artifacts common in reference-to-video generation. Moreover, Saber demonstrates remarkable generalization capabilities across a varying number of references and achieves superior performance on the OpenS2V-Eval benchmark compared to methods trained with R2V data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyang Song, Zelin Zang, Xiaofan Ye, Boqiang Xu, Long Bai, Jinlin Wu, Hongliang Ren, Hongbin Liu, Jiebo Luo, Zhen Lei</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown significant potential in surgical video understanding. With improved zero-shot performance and more effective human-machine interaction, they provide a strong foundation for advancing surgical education and assistance. However, existing research and datasets primarily focus on understanding surgical procedures and workflows, while paying limited attention to the critical role of anatomical comprehension. In clinical practice, surgeons rely heavily on precise anatomical understanding to interpret, review, and learn from surgical videos. To fill this gap, we introduce the Neurosurgical Anatomy Benchmark (NeuroABench), the first multimodal benchmark explicitly created to evaluate anatomical understanding in the neurosurgical domain. NeuroABench consists of 9 hours of annotated neurosurgical videos covering 89 distinct procedures and is developed using a novel multimodal annotation pipeline with multiple review cycles. The benchmark evaluates the identification of 68 clinical anatomical structures, providing a rigorous and standardized framework for assessing model performance. Experiments on over 10 state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal significant limitations, with the best-performing model achieving only 40.87% accuracy in anatomical identification tasks. To further evaluate the benchmark, we extract a subset of the dataset and conduct an informative test with four neurosurgical trainees. The results show that the best-performing student achieves 56% accuracy, with the lowest scores of 28% and an average score of 46.5%. While the best MLLM performs comparably to the lowest-scoring student, it still lags significantly behind the group's average performance. This comparison underscores both the progress of MLLMs in anatomical understanding and the substantial gap that remains in achieving human-level performance.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06949">Can We Go Beyond Visual Features? Neural Tissue Relation Modeling for Relational Graph Analysis in Non-Melanoma Skin Histology</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shravan Venkatraman, Muthu Subash Kavitha, Joe Dhanith P R, V Manikandarajan, Jia Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Histopathology image segmentation is essential for delineating tissue structures in skin cancer diagnostics, but modeling spatial context and inter-tissue relationships remains a challenge, especially in regions with overlapping or morphologically similar tissues. Current convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approaches operate primarily on visual texture, often treating tissues as independent regions and failing to encode biological context. To this end, we introduce Neural Tissue Relation Modeling (NTRM), a novel segmentation framework that augments CNNs with a tissue-level graph neural network to model spatial and functional relationships across tissue types. NTRM constructs a graph over predicted regions, propagates contextual information via message passing, and refines segmentation through spatial projection. Unlike prior methods, NTRM explicitly encodes inter-tissue dependencies, enabling structurally coherent predictions in boundary-dense zones. On the benchmark Histopathology Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer Segmentation Dataset, NTRM outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a robust Dice similarity coefficient that is 4.9\% to 31.25\% higher than the best-performing models among the evaluated approaches. Our experiments indicate that relational modeling offers a principled path toward more context-aware and interpretable histological segmentation, compared to local receptive-field architectures that lack tissue-level structural awareness.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuemin Wang, Ian Stavness</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a novel self-supervised learning method for semantic segmentation using selective masking image reconstruction as the pretraining task. Our proposed method replaces the random masking augmentation used in most masked image modelling pretraining methods. The proposed selective masking method selectively masks image patches with the highest reconstruction loss by breaking the image reconstruction pretraining into iterative steps to leverage the trained model's knowledge. We show on two general datasets (Pascal VOC and Cityscapes) and two weed segmentation datasets (Nassar 2020 and Sugarbeets 2016) that our proposed selective masking method outperforms the traditional random masking method and supervised ImageNet pretraining on downstream segmentation accuracy by 2.9% for general datasets and 2.5% for weed segmentation datasets. Furthermore, we found that our selective masking method significantly improves accuracy for the lowest-performing classes. Lastly, we show that using the same pretraining and downstream dataset yields the best result for low-budget self-supervised pretraining. Our proposed Selective Masking Image Reconstruction method provides an effective and practical solution to improve end-to-end semantic segmentation workflows, especially for scenarios that require limited model capacity to meet inference speed and computational resource requirements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tuan-Anh Vu, Hai Nguyen-Truong, Ziqiang Zheng, Binh-Son Hua, Qing Guo, Ivor Tsang, Sai-Kit Yeung</p>
<p>Abstract: Glass is a prevalent material among solid objects in everyday life, yet segmentation methods struggle to distinguish it from opaque materials due to its transparency and reflection. While it is known that human perception relies on boundary and reflective-object features to distinguish glass objects, the existing literature has not yet sufficiently captured both properties when handling transparent objects. Hence, we propose incorporating both of these powerful visual cues via the Boundary Feature Enhancement and Reflection Feature Enhancement modules in a mutually beneficial way. Our proposed framework, TransCues, is a pyramidal transformer encoder-decoder architecture to segment transparent objects. We empirically show that these two modules can be used together effectively, improving overall performance across various benchmark datasets, including glass object semantic segmentation, mirror object semantic segmentation, and generic segmentation datasets. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art by a large margin, achieving +4.2% mIoU on Trans10K-v2, +5.6% mIoU on MSD, +10.1% mIoU on RGBD-Mirror, +13.1% mIoU on TROSD, and +8.3% mIoU on Stanford2D3D, showing the effectiveness of our method against glass objects.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Josep M. Rocafort, Shaolin Su, Javier Vazquez-Corral, Alexandra Gomez-Villa</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent image Super-Resolution (SR) models are achieving impressive effects in reconstructing details and delivering visually pleasant outputs. However, the overpowering generative ability can sometimes hallucinate and thus change the image content despite gaining high visual quality. This type of high-level change can be easily identified by humans yet not well-studied in existing low-level image quality metrics. In this paper, we establish the importance of measuring high-level fidelity for SR models as a complementary criterion to reveal the reliability of generative SR models. We construct the first annotated dataset with fidelity scores from different SR models, and evaluate how state-of-the-art (SOTA) SR models actually perform in preserving high-level fidelity. Based on the dataset, we then analyze how existing image quality metrics correlate with fidelity measurement, and further show that this high-level task can be better addressed by foundation models. Finally, by fine-tuning SR models based on our fidelity feedback, we show that both semantic fidelity and perceptual quality can be improved, demonstrating the potential value of our proposed criteria, both in model evaluation and optimization. We will release the dataset, code, and models upon acceptance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a pivotal role in automated diagnostic and treatment planning systems. In this work, we present DAUNet, a novel lightweight UNet variant that integrates Deformable V2 Convolutions and Parameter-Free Attention (SimAM) to improve spatial adaptability and context-aware feature fusion without increasing model complexity.

Extensive evaluations on two challenging datasets, FH-PS-AoP (fetal head and pubic symphysis ultrasound) and FUMPE (CT-based pulmonary embolism detection), demonstrate that DAUNet outperforms state-of-the-art models in Dice score, HD95, and ASD, while maintaining superior parameter efficiency. Ablation studies highlight the individual contributions of deformable convolutions and SimAM attention. DAUNet's robustness to missing context and low-contrast regions establishes its suitability for deployment in real-time and resource-constrained clinical environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in neural scene representations have transformed immersive multimedia, with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enabling real-time photorealistic rendering. Despite its efficiency, 3DGS suffers from large memory requirements and costly training procedures, motivating efforts toward compression. Existing approaches, however, operate at fixed rates, limiting adaptability to varying bandwidth and device constraints. In this work, we propose a flexible compression scheme for 3DGS that supports interpolation at any rate between predefined bounds. Our method is computationally lightweight, requires no retraining for any rate, and preserves rendering quality across a broad range of operating points. Experiments demonstrate that the approach achieves efficient, high-quality compression while offering dynamic rate control, making it suitable for practical deployment in immersive applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Changliang Xia, Chengyou Jia, Minnan Luo, Zhuohang Dang, Xin Shen, Bowen Ping</p>
<p>Abstract: Although diffusion models with strong visual priors have emerged as powerful dense prediction backboens, they overlook a core limitation: the stochastic noise at the core of diffusion sampling is inherently misaligned with dense prediction that requires a deterministic mapping from image to geometry. In this paper, we show that this stochastic noise corrupts fine-grained spatial cues and pushes the model toward timestep-specific noise objectives, consequently destroying meaningful geometric structure mappings. To address this, we introduce $\mathrm{D}^{\mathrm{3}}$-Predictor, a noise-free deterministic framework built by reformulating a pretrained diffusion model without stochasticity noise. Instead of relying on noisy inputs to leverage diffusion priors, $\mathrm{D}^{\mathrm{3}}$-Predictor views the pretrained diffusion network as an ensemble of timestep-dependent visual experts and self-supervisedly aggregates their heterogeneous priors into a single, clean, and complete geometric prior. Meanwhile, we utilize task-specific supervision to seamlessly adapt this noise-free prior to dense prediction tasks. Extensive experiments on various dense prediction tasks demonstrate that $\mathrm{D}^{\mathrm{3}}$-Predictor achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance in diverse scenarios. In addition, it requires less than half the training data previously used and efficiently performs inference in a single step.

This method allows the image to be compressed and reformed while ensuring that meaningful data can be differentiated. Our experimental results show a level of compression comparable to that of using JPEG using six different metrics. The end goal of persistent homology-guided frequency filtration is its potential to improve performance in binary classification tasks (when augmenting a Convolutional Neural Network) compared to traditional feature extraction and compression methods. These findings highlight a useful end result: enhancing the reliability of image compression under noisy conditions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Camouflage is primarily context-dependent yet current metrics for camouflaged scenarios overlook this critical factor. Instead, these metrics are originally designed for evaluating general or salient objects, with an inherent assumption of uncorrelated spatial context. In this paper, we propose a new contextualized evaluation paradigm, Context-measure, built upon a probabilistic pixel-aware correlation framework. By incorporating spatial dependencies and pixel-wise camouflage quantification, our measure better aligns with human perception. Extensive experiments across three challenging camouflaged object segmentation datasets show that Context-measure delivers more reliability than existing context-independent metrics. Our measure can provide a foundational evaluation benchmark for various computer vision applications involving camouflaged patterns, such as agricultural, industrial, and medical scenarios.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bo Gao, Jingcheng Tong, Xingsheng Chen, Han Yu, Zichen Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting small objects in UAV remote sensing images and identifying surface defects in industrial inspection remain difficult tasks. These applications face common obstacles: features are sparse and weak, backgrounds are cluttered, and object scales vary dramatically. Current transformer-based detectors, while powerful, struggle with three critical issues. First, features degrade severely as networks downsample progressively. Second, spatial convolutions cannot capture long-range dependencies effectively. Third, standard upsampling methods inflate feature maps unnecessarily.
  We introduce DFIR-DETR to tackle these problems through dynamic feature aggregation combined with frequency-domain processing. Our architecture builds on three novel components. The DCFA module uses dynamic K-sparse attention, cutting complexity from O(N2) down to O(NK), and employs spatial gated linear units for better nonlinear modeling. The DFPN module applies amplitude-normalized upsampling to prevent feature inflation and uses dual-path shuffle convolution to retain spatial details across scales. The FIRC3 module operates in the frequency domain, achieving global receptive fields without sacrificing efficiency.
  We tested our method extensively on NEU-DET and VisDrone datasets. Results show mAP50 scores of 92.9% and 51.6% respectively-both state-of-the-art. The model stays lightweight with just 11.7M parameters and 41.2 GFLOPs. Strong performance across two very different domains confirms that DFIR-DETR generalizes well and works effectively in resource-limited settings for cross-scene small object detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaeyoon Lee, Hojoon Jung, Sungtae Hwang, Jihyong Oh, Jongwon Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: We present COREA, the first unified framework that jointly learns relightable 3D Gaussians and a Signed Distance Field (SDF) for accurate geometry reconstruction and faithful relighting. While recent 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods have extended toward mesh reconstruction and physically-based rendering (PBR), their geometry is still learned from 2D renderings, leading to coarse surfaces and unreliable BRDF-lighting decomposition. To address these limitations, COREA introduces a coarse-to-fine bidirectional 3D-to-3D alignment strategy that allows geometric signals to be learned directly in 3D space. Within this strategy, depth provides coarse alignment between the two representations, while depth gradients and normals refine fine-scale structure, and the resulting geometry supports stable BRDF-lighting decomposition. A density-control mechanism further stabilizes Gaussian growth, balancing geometric fidelity with memory efficiency. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that COREA achieves superior performance in novel-view synthesis, mesh reconstruction, and PBR within a unified framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liangwei Jiang, Jinluo Xie, Yecheng Huang, Hua Zhang, Hongyu Yang, Di Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Copy-move image forgery aims to duplicate certain objects or to hide specific contents with copy-move operations, which can be achieved by a sequence of manual manipulations as well as up-to-date deep generative network-based swapping. Its detection is becoming increasingly challenging for the complex transformations and fine-tuned operations on the tampered regions. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stream model, namely Multi-directional Similarity Network (MSN), to accurate and efficient copy-move forgery detection. It addresses the two major limitations of existing deep detection models in \textbf{representation} and \textbf{localization}, respectively. In representation, an image is hierarchically encoded by a multi-directional CNN network, and due to the diverse augmentation in scales and rotations, the feature achieved better measures the similarity between sampled patches in two streams. In localization, we design a 2-D similarity matrix based decoder, and compared with the current 1-D similarity vector based one, it makes full use of spatial information in the entire image, leading to the improvement in detecting tampered regions. Beyond the method, a new forgery database generated by various deep neural networks is presented, as a new benchmark for detecting the growing deep-synthesized copy-move. Extensive experiments are conducted on two classic image forensics benchmarks, \emph{i.e.} CASIA CMFD and CoMoFoD, and the newly presented one. The state-of-the-art results are reported, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shengjie Lu, Zhibin Wan, Jiejie Liu, Quan Zhang, Mingjie Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: VTON (Virtual Try-ON) aims at synthesizing the target clothing on a certain person, preserving the details of the target clothing while keeping the rest of the person unchanged. Existing methods suffer from the discrepancies between the generated clothing results and the target ones, in terms of the patterns, textures and boundaries. Therefore, we propose to use an energy function to impose constraints on the attention map extracted through the generation process. Thus, at each generation step, the attention can be more focused on the clothing region of interest, thereby influencing the generation results to be more consistent with the target clothing details. Furthermore, to address the limitation that existing evaluation metrics concentrate solely on image realism and overlook the alignment with target elements, we design a new metric, Virtual Try-on Inception Distance (VTID), to bridge this gap and ensure a more comprehensive assessment. On the VITON-HD and DressCode datasets, our approach has outperformed the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by 1.4%, 2.3%, 12.3%, and 5.8% in the traditional metrics of LPIPS, FID, KID, and the new VTID metrics, respectively. Additionally, by applying the generated data to downstream Clothing-Change Re-identification (CC-Reid) methods, we have achieved performance improvements of 2.5%, 1.1%, and 1.6% on the LTCC, PRCC, VC-Clothes datasets in the metrics of Rank-1.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chau Truong, Hieu Ta Quang, Dung D. Le</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language models like CLIP show impressive ability to align images and text, but their training on short, concise captions makes them struggle with lengthy, detailed descriptions. Recent advances mitigate this challenge by leveraging region-proposal information to map visual regions with corresponding sentences from lengthy captions, yet incurring notable deployment costs. We introduce MulCLIP, a novel end-to-end multi-level alignment framework that bridges natural long-text structures with image components. MulCLIP first preserves global contrastive alignment between images and both summary and long captions, while extending positional embeddings for longer text sequences. To further enhance fine-grained understanding, we propose two novel strategies: (1) a token reconstruction alignment over locally calibrated features to strengthen semantic connections between words and image patches, and (2) a subcaption-aggregated patch alignment that automatically extracts and aggregates context-rich patches for each subcaption. Experimental results across diverse benchmarks demonstrate our method consistently improves downstream performance, while ablation studies confirm its multi-scale alignment is the key factor driving better fine-grained capability than region-proposal-assisted approaches, making it particularly suitable for diverse real-world applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Current autonomous driving systems often favor end-to-end frameworks, which take sensor inputs like images and learn to map them into trajectory space via neural networks. Previous work has demonstrated that models can achieve better planning performance when provided with a prior distribution of possible trajectories. However, these approaches often overlook two critical aspects: 1) The appropriate trajectory prior can vary significantly across different driving scenarios. 2) Their trajectory evaluation mechanism lacks policy-driven refinement, remaining constrained by the limitations of one-stage supervised training. To address these issues, we explore improvements in two key areas. For problem 1, we employ MoE to apply different trajectory priors tailored to different scenarios. For problem 2, we utilize Reinforcement Learning to fine-tune the trajectory scoring mechanism. Additionally, we integrate models with different perception backbones to enhance perceptual features. Our integrated model achieved a score of 51.08 on the navsim ICCV benchmark, securing third place.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal human action recognition (HAR) leverages complementary sensors for activity classification. Beyond recognition, recent advances in large language models (LLMs) enable detailed descriptions and causal reasoning, motivating new tasks: human action understanding (HAU) and human action reasoning (HARn). However, most LLMs, especially large vision language models (LVLMs), struggle with non-RGB modalities such as depth, IMU, and mmWave due to the lack of large-scale data-caption resources. Existing HAR datasets mainly provide coarse data-label annotations, which are insufficient to capture fine-grained action dynamics needed for HAU and HARn. We consider two ground-truth pair types: (1) data label (discrete category) and (2) data caption (textual description). Naively generating captions from labels often lacks logical and spatiotemporal consistency. We introduce CUHK-X, a large-scale multimodal dataset and benchmark suite for HAR, HAU, and HARn. CUHK-X contains 58,445 samples covering 40 actions performed by 30 participants across two indoor environments. To improve caption consistency, we propose a prompt-based scene creation method that leverages LLMs to generate logically connected activity sequences, followed by human validation. CUHK-X includes three benchmarks with six evaluation tasks. Experiments report average accuracies of 76.52% (HAR), 40.76% (HAU), and 70.25% (HARn). CUHK-X aims to enable the community to apply and develop data-intensive learning methods for robust, multimodal human activity analysis.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fenghua Weng, Chaochao Lu, Xia Hu, Wenqi Shao, Wenjie Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: As multimodal reasoning improves the overall capabilities of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs), recent studies have begun to explore safety-oriented reasoning, aiming to enhance safety awareness by analyzing potential safety risks during the reasoning process before generating the final response. Although such approaches improve safety awareness and interpretability, this single-pass think-then-answer paradigm remains vulnerable to contextual or visual jailbreak attacks. This reveals a critical flaw: single-pass reasoning may overlook explicit harmful content in its own output. Our key insight is to exploit this wasted signal through reflection, which can effectively leverage the malicious content revealed in the first-pass reasoning to enable genuine self-correction and prevent unsafe generations. Motivated by this, we propose Think-Reflect-Revise (TRR), a three-stage training framework designed to enhance the safety alignment of LVLMs through policy-guided self-reflection. We first build a Reflective Safety Reasoning (ReSafe) dataset with 5,000 examples that follow a think-reflect-revise process. We then fine-tune the target model using the ReSafe dataset to initialize reflective behavior, and finally reinforce policy-guided reflection through reinforcement learning. Experimental results show that TRR substantially improves the safety performance of LVLMs across both safety-awareness benchmarks and jailbreak attack evaluations, increasing the overall safe response rate from 42.8% to 87.7% on Qwen2.5-VL-7B, while preserving stable performance on general benchmarks such as MMMU and MMStar.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dahyeon Kye, Jeahun Sung, MinKyu Jeon, Jihyong Oh</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models exhibit remarkable generative ability, yet achieving smooth and semantically consistent image morphing remains a challenge. Existing approaches often yield abrupt transitions or over-saturated appearances due to the lack of adaptive structural and semantic alignments. We propose CHIMERA, a zero-shot diffusion-based framework that formulates morphing as a cached inversion-guided denoising process. To handle large semantic and appearance disparities, we propose Adaptive Cache Injection and Semantic Anchor Prompting. Adaptive Cache Injection (ACI) caches down, mid, and up blocks features from both inputs during DDIM inversion and re-injects them adaptively during denoising, enabling spatial and semantic alignment in depth- and time-adaptive manners and enabling natural feature fusion and smooth transitions. Semantic Anchor Prompting (SAP) leverages a vision-language model to generate a shared anchor prompt that serves as a semantic anchor, bridging dissimilar inputs and guiding the denoising process toward coherent results. Finally, we introduce the Global-Local Consistency Score (GLCS), a morphing-oriented metric that simultaneously evaluates the global harmonization of the two inputs and the smoothness of the local morphing transition. Extensive experiments and user studies show that CHIMERA achieves smoother and more semantically aligned transitions than existing methods, establishing a new state of the art in image morphing. The code and project page will be publicly released.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muyu Xu, Fangneng Zhan, Xiaoqin Zhang, Ling Shao, Shijian Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Sparse-view 3D Gaussian splatting seeks to render high-quality novel views of 3D scenes from a limited set of input images. While recent pose-free feed-forward methods leveraging pre-trained 3D priors have achieved impressive results, most of them rely on full fine-tuning of large Vision Transformer (ViT) backbones and incur substantial GPU costs. In this work, we introduce MuSASplat, a novel framework that dramatically reduces the computational burden of training pose-free feed-forward 3D Gaussian splats models with little compromise of rendering quality. Central to our approach is a lightweight Multi-Scale Adapter that enables efficient fine-tuning of ViT-based architectures with only a small fraction of training parameters. This design avoids the prohibitive GPU overhead associated with previous full-model adaptation techniques while maintaining high fidelity in novel view synthesis, even with very sparse input views. In addition, we introduce a Feature Fusion Aggregator that integrates features across input views effectively and efficiently. Unlike widely adopted memory banks, the Feature Fusion Aggregator ensures consistent geometric integration across input views and meanwhile mitigates the memory usage, training complexity, and computational costs significantly. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets show that MuSASplat achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality but has significantly reduced parameters and training resource requirements as compared with existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siyuan Xu, Yibing Liu, Peilin Chen, Yung-Hui Li, Shiqi Wang, Sam Kwong</p>
<p>Abstract: Privacy leakage in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has long been an intractable problem. Existing studies, though effectively obscure private information in MLLMs, often overlook the evaluation of the authenticity and recovery quality of user privacy. To this end, this work uniquely focuses on the critical challenge of how to restore surrogate-driven protected data in diverse MLLM scenarios. We first bridge this research gap by contributing the SPPE (Surrogate Privacy Protected Editable) dataset, which includes a wide range of privacy categories and user instructions to simulate real MLLM applications. This dataset offers protected surrogates alongside their various MLLM-edited versions, thus enabling the direct assessment of privacy recovery quality. By formulating privacy recovery as a guided generation task conditioned on complementary multimodal signals, we further introduce a unified approach that reliably reconstructs private content while preserving the fidelity of MLLM-generated edits. The experiments on both SPPE and InstructPix2Pix further show that our approach generalizes well across diverse visual content and editing tasks, achieving a strong balance between privacy protection and MLLM usability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiayang Li, Chengjie Jiang, Junjun Jiang, Pengwei Liang, Jiayi Ma, Liqiang Nie</p>
<p>Abstract: Image fusion aims to blend complementary information from multiple sensing modalities, yet existing approaches remain limited in robustness, adaptability, and controllability. Most current fusion networks are tailored to specific tasks and lack the ability to flexibly incorporate user intent, especially in complex scenarios involving low-light degradation, color shifts, or exposure imbalance. Moreover, the absence of ground-truth fused images and the small scale of existing datasets make it difficult to train an end-to-end model that simultaneously understands high-level semantics and performs fine-grained multimodal alignment. We therefore present DiTFuse, instruction-driven Diffusion-Transformer (DiT) framework that performs end-to-end, semantics-aware fusion within a single model. By jointly encoding two images and natural-language instructions in a shared latent space, DiTFuse enables hierarchical and fine-grained control over fusion dynamics, overcoming the limitations of pre-fusion and post-fusion pipelines that struggle to inject high-level semantics. The training phase employs a multi-degradation masked-image modeling strategy, so the network jointly learns cross-modal alignment, modality-invariant restoration, and task-aware feature selection without relying on ground truth images. A curated, multi-granularity instruction dataset further equips the model with interactive fusion capabilities. DiTFuse unifies infrared-visible, multi-focus, and multi-exposure fusion-as well as text-controlled refinement and downstream tasks-within a single architecture. Experiments on public IVIF, MFF, and MEF benchmarks confirm superior quantitative and qualitative performance, sharper textures, and better semantic retention. The model also supports multi-level user control and zero-shot generalization to other multi-image fusion scenarios, including instruction-conditioned segmentation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shravan Venkatraman, Rakesh Raj Madavan, Pavan Kumar S, Muthu Subash Kavitha</p>
<p>Abstract: Underwater image restoration is essential for marine applications ranging from ecological monitoring to archaeological surveys, but effectively addressing the complex and spatially varying nature of underwater degradations remains a challenge. Existing methods typically apply uniform restoration strategies across the entire image, struggling to handle multiple co-occurring degradations that vary spatially and with water conditions. We introduce TIDE, a $\underline{t}$wo stage $\underline{i}$nverse $\underline{d}$egradation $\underline{e}$stimation framework that explicitly models degradation characteristics and applies targeted restoration through specialized prior decomposition. Our approach disentangles the restoration process into multiple specialized hypotheses that are adaptively fused based on local degradation patterns, followed by a progressive refinement stage that corrects residual artifacts. Specifically, TIDE decomposes underwater degradations into four key factors, namely color distortion, haze, detail loss, and noise, and designs restoration experts specialized for each. By generating specialized restoration hypotheses, TIDE balances competing degradation factors and produces natural results even in highly degraded regions. Extensive experiments across both standard benchmarks and challenging turbid water conditions show that TIDE achieves competitive performance on reference based fidelity metrics while outperforming state of the art methods on non reference perceptual quality metrics, with strong improvements in color correction and contrast enhancement.

<p>Abstract: Chart understanding is crucial for deploying multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in real-world scenarios such as analyzing scientific papers and technical reports. Unlike natural images, charts pair a structured visual layout (spatial property) with an underlying data representation (textual property) -- grasping both is essential for precise, fine-grained chart reasoning. Motivated by this observation, we propose START, the Spatial and Textual learning for chART understanding. Specifically, we introduce (i) chart-element grounding and (ii) chart-to-code generation to strengthen an MLLM's understanding of both chart visual layout and data details. To facilitate spatial and textual learning, we propose the START-Dataset generated with a novel data-generation pipeline that first leverages an MLLM to translate real chart images into executable chart code, recovering the underlying data representation while preserving the visual distribution of real-world charts. We then evolve the code with a Large Language Model (LLM) to ascertain the positions of chart elements that capture the chart's visual structure, addressing challenges that existing methods cannot handle. To evaluate a model's ability to understand chart spatial structures, we propose the Chart Spatial understanding Benchmark (CS-Bench), filling a critical gap in comprehensive chart understanding evaluation. Leveraging spatial and textual learning, START delivers consistent gains across model sizes and benchmarks over the base models and surpasses prior state-of-the-art by a clear margin. Code, data and models will be publicly available.</p>

<p>Abstract: Modern deep neural networks have shown remarkable performance in medical image classification. However, such networks either emphasize pixel-intensity features instead of fundamental anatomical structures (e.g., those encoded by topological invariants), or they capture only simple topological features via single-parameter persistence. In this paper, we propose a new topology-guided classification framework that extracts multi-scale and multi-filtration persistent topological features and integrates them into vision classification backbones. For an input image, we first compute cubical persistence diagrams (PDs) across multiple image resolutions/scales. We then develop a ``vineyard'' algorithm that consolidates these PDs into a single, stable diagram capturing signatures at varying granularities, from global anatomy to subtle local irregularities that may indicate early-stage disease. To further exploit richer topological representations produced by multiple filtrations, we design a cross-attention-based neural network that directly processes the consolidated final PDs. The resulting topological embeddings are fused with feature maps from CNNs or Transformers. By integrating multi-scale and multi-filtration topologies into an end-to-end architecture, our approach enhances the model's capacity to recognize complex anatomical structures. Evaluations on three public datasets show consistent, considerable improvements over strong baselines and state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating the value of our comprehensive topological perspective for robust and interpretable medical image classification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenqi Zhao, Jiacheng Sang, Fenghua Cheng, Yonglu Shu, Dong Li, Xiaofeng Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical image segmentation remains challenging due to intensity inhomogeneity, noise, blurred boundaries, and irregular structures. Traditional level set methods, while effective in certain cases, often depend on approximate bias field estimations and therefore struggle under severe non-uniform imaging conditions. To address these limitations, we propose a novel variational Reflectance-based Level Set Model (RefLSM), which explicitly integrates Retinex-inspired reflectance decomposition into the segmentation framework. By decomposing the observed image into reflectance and bias field components, RefLSM directly segments the reflectance, which is invariant to illumination and preserves fine structural details. Building on this foundation, we introduce two key innovations for enhanced precision and robustness. First, a linear structural prior steers the smoothed reflectance gradients toward a data-driven reference, providing reliable geometric guidance in noisy or low-contrast scenes. Second, a relaxed binary level-set is embedded in RefLSM and enforced via convex relaxation and sign projection, yielding stable evolution and avoiding reinitialization-induced diffusion. The resulting variational problem is solved efficiently using an ADMM-based optimization scheme. Extensive experiments on multiple medical imaging datasets demonstrate that RefLSM achieves superior segmentation accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art level set methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Niu Yi, Xu Tianyi, Ma Mingming, Wang Xinkun</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative learned image compression methods using Vector Quantization (VQ) have recently shown impressive potential in balancing distortion and perceptual quality. However, these methods typically estimate the entropy of VQ indices using a static, global probability distribution, which fails to adapt to the specific content of each image. This non-adaptive approach leads to untapped bitrate potential and challenges in achieving flexible rate control. To address this challenge, we introduce a Controllable Generative Image Compression framework based on a VQ Hyperprior, termed HVQ-CGIC. HVQ-CGIC rigorously derives the mathematical foundation for introducing a hyperprior to the VQ indices entropy model. Based on this foundation, through novel loss design, to our knowledge, this framework is the first to introduce RD balance and control into vector quantization-based Generative Image Compression. Cooperating with a lightweight hyper-prior estimation network, HVQ-CGIC achieves a significant advantage in rate-distortion (RD) performance compared to current state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative compression methods. On the Kodak dataset, we achieve the same LPIPS as Control-GIC, CDC and HiFiC with an average of 61.3% fewer bits. We posit that HVQ-CGIC has the potential to become a foundational component for VQGAN-based image compression, analogous to the integral role of the HyperPrior framework in neural image compression.</p>

However, its practical use is hindered by the massive memory and computational demands required to store and render millions of Gaussians. These challenges become even more severe in 4D dynamic scenes. To address these issues, the field of Efficient Gaussian Splatting has rapidly evolved, proposing methods that reduce redundancy while preserving reconstruction quality. This survey provides the first unified overview of efficient 3D and 4D Gaussian Splatting techniques. For both 3D and 4D settings, we systematically categorize existing methods into two major directions, Parameter Compression and Restructuring Compression, and comprehensively summarize the core ideas and methodological trends within each category. We further cover widely used datasets, evaluation metrics, and representative benchmark comparisons. Finally, we discuss current limitations and outline promising research directions toward scalable, compact, and real-time Gaussian Splatting for both static and dynamic 3D scene representation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiujie Song, Qi Jia, Shota Watanabe, Xiaoyi Pang, Ruijie Chen, Mengyue Wu, Kenny Q. Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: An image can convey a compelling story by presenting rich, logically connected visual clues. These connections form Chains-of-Reasoning (CoRs) within the image, enabling viewers to infer events, causal relationships, and other information, thereby understanding the underlying story. In this paper, we focus on these semantically rich images and define them as Storytelling Images. Such images have diverse applications beyond illustration creation and cognitive screening, leveraging their ability to convey multi-layered information visually and inspire active interpretation. However, due to their complex semantic nature, Storytelling Images are inherently challenging to create, and thus remain relatively scarce. To address this challenge, we introduce the Storytelling Image Generation task, which explores how generative AI models can be leveraged to create such images. Specifically, we propose a two-stage pipeline, StorytellingPainter, which combines the creative reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the visual synthesis capabilities of Text-to-Image (T2I) models to generate Storytelling Images. Alongside this pipeline, we develop a dedicated evaluation framework comprising three main evaluators: a Semantic Complexity Evaluator, a KNN-based Diversity Evaluator and a Story-Image Alignment Evaluator. Given the critical role of story generation in the Storytelling Image Generation task and the performance disparity between open-source and proprietary LLMs, we further explore tailored training strategies to reduce this gap, resulting in a series of lightweight yet effective models named Mini-Storytellers. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our approaches. The code is available at https://github.com/xiujiesong/StorytellingImageGeneration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cheng Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable performance in generative modeling, yet their theoretical foundations are often intricate, and the gap between mathematical formulations in papers and practical open-source implementations can be difficult to bridge. Existing tutorials primarily focus on deriving equations, offering limited guidance on how diffusion models actually operate in code. To address this, we present a concise implementation of approximately 300 lines that explains diffusion models from a code-execution perspective. Our minimal example preserves the essential components -- including forward diffusion, reverse sampling, the noise-prediction network, and the training loop -- while removing unnecessary engineering details. This technical report aims to provide researchers with a clear, implementation-first understanding of how diffusion models work in practice and how code and theory correspond.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuhui Zheng, Kang An, Ziliang Wang, Yuhang Wang, Faqiang Qian, Yichao Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal pre-training remains constrained by the descriptive bias of image-caption pairs, leading models to favor surface linguistic cues over grounded visual understanding. We introduce MMRPT, a masked multimodal reinforcement pre-training framework that strengthens visual reasoning in MLLMs. We are the first to incorporate reinforcement learning directly into the pre-training of large vision-language models, enabling learning signals that reward visual grounding rather than caption imitation. MMRPT constructs masked multimodal data by estimating sentence-level visual dependency via attention over visual tokens and masking highly vision-dependent segments; the model reconstructs these spans through vision-grounded reasoning guided by a semantic-visual reward. Experiments show consistent zero-shot gains across diverse benchmarks and substantially improved robustness under supervised fine-tuning, demonstrating that reinforcement-driven masked reasoning provides a more reliable and generalizable pre-training objective for multimodal models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boyang Pan, Zeyu Zhang, Hongyu Meng, Bin Cui, Yingying Zhang, Wenli Hou, Junhao Li, Langdi Zhong, Xiaoxiao Chen, Xiaoyu Xu, Changjin Zuo, Chao Cheng, Nan-Jie Gong</p>
<p>Abstract: Purpose: To develop a fully automated deep learning system, AutoLugano, for end-to-end lymphoma classification by performing lesion segmentation, anatomical localization, and automated Lugano staging from baseline FDG-PET/CT scans. Methods: The AutoLugano system processes baseline FDG-PET/CT scans through three sequential modules:(1) Anatomy-Informed Lesion Segmentation, a 3D nnU-Net model, trained on multi-channel inputs, performs automated lesion detection (2) Atlas-based Anatomical Localization, which leverages the TotalSegmentator toolkit to map segmented lesions to 21 predefined lymph node regions using deterministic anatomical rules; and (3) Automated Lugano Staging, where the spatial distribution of involved regions is translated into Lugano stages and therapeutic groups (Limited vs. Advanced Stage).The system was trained on the public autoPET dataset (n=1,007) and externally validated on an independent cohort of 67 patients. Performance was assessed using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1-scorefor regional involvement detection and staging agreement. Results: On the external validation set, the proposed model demonstrated robust performance, achieving an overall accuracy of 88.31%, sensitivity of 74.47%, Specificity of 94.21% and an F1-score of 80.80% for regional involvement detection,outperforming baseline models. Most notably, for the critical clinical task of therapeutic stratification (Limited vs. Advanced Stage), the system achieved a high accuracy of 85.07%, with a specificity of 90.48% and a sensitivity of 82.61%.Conclusion: AutoLugano represents the first fully automated, end-to-end pipeline that translates a single baseline FDG-PET/CT scan into a complete Lugano stage. This study demonstrates its strong potential to assist in initial staging, treatment stratification, and supporting clinical decision-making.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Frederik Hagelskj{\ae}r, Dimitrios Arapis, Steffen Madsen, Thorbj{\o}rn Mosekj{\ae}r Iversen</p>
<p>Abstract: Object pose estimation is crucial to robotic perception and typically provides a single-pose estimate. However, a single estimate cannot capture pose uncertainty deriving from visual ambiguity, which can lead to unreliable behavior. Existing pose distribution methods rely heavily on color information, often unavailable in industrial settings.
  We propose a novel neural network-based method for estimating object pose uncertainty using only 3D colorless data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach that leverages deep learning for pose distribution estimation without relying on RGB input. We validate our method in a real-world bin picking scenario with objects of varying geometric ambiguity. Our current implementation focuses on symmetries in reflection and revolution, but the framework is extendable to full SE(3) pose distribution estimation.

<p>Abstract: Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) have revolutionized computer vision by providing rich semantic and geometric representations. This paper presents a comprehensive visual comparison between CLIP based and DINOv2 based approaches for 3D pose estimation in hand object grasping scenarios. We evaluate both models on the task of 6D object pose estimation and demonstrate their complementary strengths: CLIP excels in semantic understanding through language grounding, while DINOv2 provides superior dense geometric features. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we show that CLIP based methods achieve better semantic consistency, while DINOv2 based approaches demonstrate competitive performance with enhanced geometric precision. Our analysis provides insights for selecting appropriate vision models for robotic manipulation and grasping, picking applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hengyang Yao, Lin Li, Ke Sun, Jianing Qiu, Huiping Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: DeepFake face swapping enables highly realistic identity forgeries, posing serious privacy and security risks. A common defence embeds invisible perturbations into images, but these are fragile and often destroyed by basic transformations such as compression or resizing. In this paper, we first conduct a systematic analysis of 30 transformations across six categories and show that protection robustness is highly sensitive to the choice of training transformations, making the standard Expectation over Transformation (EOT) with uniform sampling fundamentally suboptimal. Motivated by this, we propose Expectation Over Learned distribution of Transformation (EOLT), the framework to treat transformation distribution as a learnable component rather than a fixed design choice. Specifically, EOLT employs a policy network that learns to automatically prioritize critical transformations and adaptively generate instance-specific perturbations via reinforcement learning, enabling explicit modeling of defensive bottlenecks while maintaining broad transferability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves substantial improvements over state-of-the-art approaches, with 26% higher average robustness and up to 30% gains on challenging transformation categories.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fang Zhou, Zhiqiang Chen, Martin Pavlovski, Yizhong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) faces the challenge of categorizing unlabeled data containing both known and novel classes, given only labels for known classes. Previous studies often treat each class independently, neglecting the inherent inter-class relations. Obtaining such inter-class relations directly presents a significant challenge in real-world scenarios. To address this issue, we propose ReLKD, an end-to-end framework that effectively exploits implicit inter-class relations and leverages this knowledge to enhance the classification of novel classes. ReLKD comprises three key modules: a target-grained module for learning discriminative representations, a coarse-grained module for capturing hierarchical class relations, and a distillation module for transferring knowledge from the coarse-grained module to refine the target-grained module's representation learning. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of ReLKD, particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhinav Raundhal, Gaurav Behera, P J Narayanan, Ravi Kiran Sarvadevabhatla, Makarand Tapaswi</p>
<p>Abstract: Text as signs, labels, or instructions is a critical element of real-world scenes as they can convey important contextual information. 3D representations such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) struggle to preserve fine-grained text details, while achieving high visual fidelity. Small errors in textual element reconstruction can lead to significant semantic loss. We propose STRinGS, a text-aware, selective refinement framework to address this issue for 3DGS reconstruction. Our method treats text and non-text regions separately, refining text regions first and merging them with non-text regions later for full-scene optimization. STRinGS produces sharp, readable text even in challenging configurations. We introduce a text readability measure OCR Character Error Rate (CER) to evaluate the efficacy on text regions. STRinGS results in a 63.6% relative improvement over 3DGS at just 7K iterations. We also introduce a curated dataset STRinGS-360 with diverse text scenarios to evaluate text readability in 3D reconstruction. Our method and dataset together push the boundaries of 3D scene understanding in text-rich environments, paving the way for more robust text-aware reconstruction methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Biao Chen, Lin Zuo, Mengmeng Jing, Kunbin He, Yuchen Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Dropout is a widely used regularization technique which improves the generalization ability of a model by randomly dropping neurons. In light of this, we propose Dropout Prompt Learning, which aims for applying dropout to improve the robustness of the vision-language models. Different from the vanilla dropout, we apply dropout on the tokens of the textual and visual branches, where we evaluate the token significance considering both intra-modal context and inter-modal alignment, enabling flexible dropout probabilities for each token. Moreover, to maintain semantic alignment for general knowledge transfer while encouraging the diverse representations that dropout introduces, we further propose residual entropy regularization. Experiments on 15 benchmarks show our method's effectiveness in challenging scenarios like low-shot learning, long-tail classification, and out-of-distribution generalization. Notably, our method surpasses regularization-based methods including KgCoOp by 5.10% and PromptSRC by 2.13% in performance on base-to-novel generalization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cheng Zhang, Boying Li, Meng Wei, Yan-Pei Cao, Camilo Cruz Gambardella, Dinh Phung, Jianfei Cai</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers have emerged as a universal backbone across 3D perception, video generation, and world models for autonomous driving and embodied AI, where understanding camera geometry is essential for grounding visual observations in three-dimensional space. However, existing camera encoding methods often rely on simplified pinhole assumptions, restricting generalization across the diverse intrinsics and lens distortions in real-world cameras. We introduce Relative Ray Encoding, a geometry-consistent representation that unifies complete camera information, including 6-DoF poses, intrinsics, and lens distortions. To evaluate its capability under diverse controllability demands, we adopt camera-controlled text-to-video generation as a testbed task. Within this setting, we further identify pitch and roll as two components effective for Absolute Orientation Encoding, enabling full control over the initial camera orientation. Together, these designs form UCPE (Unified Camera Positional Encoding), which integrates into a pretrained video Diffusion Transformer through a lightweight spatial attention adapter, adding less than 1% trainable parameters while achieving state-of-the-art camera controllability and visual fidelity. To facilitate systematic training and evaluation, we construct a large video dataset covering a wide range of camera motions and lens types. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of UCPE in camera-controllable video generation and highlight its potential as a general camera representation for Transformers across future multi-view, video, and 3D tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md. Srabon Chowdhury, Syeda Fahmida Tanzim, Sheekar Banerjee, Ishtiak Al Mamoon, AKM Muzahidul Islam</p>
<p>Abstract: Brain tumors are one of the most common and dangerous neurological diseases which require a timely and correct diagnosis to provide the right treatment procedures. Even with the promotion of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the process of tumor delineation is difficult and time-consuming, which is prone to inter-observer error. In order to overcome these limitations, this work proposes a hybrid deep learning model based on SqueezeNet v1 which is a lightweight model, and EfficientNet-B0, which is a high-performing model, and is enhanced with handcrafted radiomic descriptors, including Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), Local Binary Patterns (LBP), Gabor filters and Wavelet transforms. The framework was trained and tested only on publicly available Nickparvar Brain Tumor MRI dataset, which consisted of 7,023 contrast-enhanced T1-weighted axial MRI slices which were categorized into four groups: glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, and no tumor. The testing accuracy of the model was 98.93% that reached a level of 99.08% with Test Time Augmentation (TTA) showing great generalization and power. The proposed hybrid network offers a compromise between computation efficiency and diagnostic accuracy compared to current deep learning structures and only has to be trained using fewer than 2.1 million parameters and less than 1.2 GFLOPs. The handcrafted feature addition allowed greater sensitivity in texture and the EfficientNet-B0 backbone represented intricate hierarchical features. The resulting model has almost clinical reliability in automated MRI-based classification of tumors highlighting its possibility of use in clinical decision-support systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Toshinori Yamauchi, Hiroshi Kera, Kazuhiko Kawamoto</p>
<p>Abstract: Textual explanations make image classifier decisions transparent by describing the prediction rationale in natural language. Large vision-language models can generate captions but are designed for general visual understanding, not classifier-specific reasoning. Existing zero-shot explanation methods align global image features with language, producing descriptions of what is visible rather than what drives the prediction. We propose TEXTER, which overcomes this limitation by isolating decision-critical features before alignment. TEXTER identifies the neurons contributing to the prediction and emphasizes the features encoded in those neurons -- i.e., the decision-critical features. It then maps these emphasized features into the CLIP feature space to retrieve textual explanations that reflect the model's reasoning. A sparse autoencoder further improves interpretability, particularly for Transformer architectures. Extensive experiments show that TEXTER generates more faithful and interpretable explanations than existing methods. The code will be publicly released.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziming Hong, Tianyu Huang, Runnan Chen, Shanshan Ye, Mingming Gong, Bo Han, Tongliang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies have extended diffusion-based instruction-driven 2D image editing pipelines to 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), enabling faithful manipulation of 3DGS assets and greatly advancing 3DGS content creation. However, it also exposes these assets to serious risks of unauthorized editing and malicious tampering. Although imperceptible adversarial perturbations against diffusion models have proven effective for protecting 2D images, applying them to 3DGS encounters two major challenges: view-generalizable protection and balancing invisibility with protection capability. In this work, we propose the first editing safeguard for 3DGS, termed AdLift, which prevents instruction-driven editing across arbitrary views and dimensions by lifting strictly bounded 2D adversarial perturbations into 3D Gaussian-represented safeguard. To ensure both adversarial perturbations effectiveness and invisibility, these safeguard Gaussians are progressively optimized across training views using a tailored Lifted PGD, which first conducts gradient truncation during back-propagation from the editing model at the rendered image and applies projected gradients to strictly constrain the image-level perturbation. Then, the resulting perturbation is backpropagated to the safeguard Gaussian parameters via an image-to-Gaussian fitting operation. We alternate between gradient truncation and image-to-Gaussian fitting, yielding consistent adversarial-based protection performance across different viewpoints and generalizes to novel views. Empirically, qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that AdLift effectively protects against state-of-the-art instruction-driven 2D image and 3DGS editing.</p>

<p>Abstract: Image enhancement improves visual quality and helps reveal details that are hard to see in the original image. In medical imaging, it can support clinical decision-making, but current models often over-edit. This can distort organs, create false findings, and miss small tumors because these models do not understand anatomy or contrast dynamics. We propose SMILE, an anatomy-aware diffusion model that learns how organs are shaped and how they take up contrast. It enhances only clinically relevant regions while leaving all other areas unchanged. SMILE introduces three key ideas: (1) structure-aware supervision that follows true organ boundaries and contrast patterns; (2) registration-free learning that works directly with unaligned multi-phase CT scans; (3) unified inference that provides fast and consistent enhancement across all contrast phases. Across six external datasets, SMILE outperforms existing methods in image quality (14.2% higher SSIM, 20.6% higher PSNR, 50% better FID) and in clinical usefulness by producing anatomically accurate and diagnostically meaningful images. SMILE also improves cancer detection from non-contrast CT, raising the F1 score by up to 10 percent.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Handing Xu, Zhenguo Nie, Tairan Peng, Huimin Pan, Xin-Jun Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Endoscopic surgery relies on intraoperative video, making image quality a decisive factor for surgical safety and efficacy. Yet, endoscopic videos are often degraded by uneven illumination, tissue scattering, occlusions, and motion blur, which obscure critical anatomical details and complicate surgical manipulation. Although deep learning-based methods have shown promise in image enhancement, most existing approaches remain too computationally demanding for real-time surgical use. To address this challenge, we propose a degradation-aware framework for endoscopic video enhancement, which enables real-time, high-quality enhancement by propagating degradation representations across frames. In our framework, degradation representations are first extracted from images using contrastive learning. We then introduce a fusion mechanism that modulates image features with these representations to guide a single-frame enhancement model, which is trained with a cycle-consistency constraint between degraded and restored images to improve robustness and generalization. Experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves a superior balance between performance and efficiency compared with several state-of-the-art methods. These results highlight the effectiveness of degradation-aware modeling for real-time endoscopic video enhancement. Nevertheless, our method suggests that implicitly learning and propagating degradation representation offer a practical pathway for clinical application.</p>

<p>Abstract: Virtual representations of physical critical infrastructures, such as water or energy plants, are used for simulations and digital twins to ensure resilience and continuity of their services. These models usually require 3D point clouds from laser scanners that are expensive to acquire and require specialist knowledge to use. In this article, we present a graph generation pipeline based on photogrammetry. The pipeline detects relevant objects and predicts their relation using RGB images and depth data generated by a stereo camera. This more cost-effective approach uses deep learning for object detection and instance segmentation of the objects, and employs user-defined heuristics or rules to infer their relations. Results of two hydraulic systems show that this strategy can produce graphs close to the ground truth while its flexibility allows the method to be tailored to specific applications and its transparency qualifies it to be used in the high stakes decision-making that is required for critical infrastructures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhi Rao, Yucheng Zhou, Benjia Zhou, Yiqing Huang, Sergio Escalera, Jun Wan</p>
<p>Abstract: Gloss-free sign language translation (SLT) is hindered by two key challenges: **inadequate sign representation** that fails to capture nuanced visual cues, and **sentence-level semantic misalignment** in current LLM-based methods, which limits translation quality. To address these issues, we propose a three-stage **r**einforcing **v**ision-**l**anguage **f**ramework (**RVLF**). We build a large vision-language model (LVLM) specifically designed for sign language, and then combine it with reinforcement learning (RL) to adaptively enhance translation performance. First, for a sufficient representation of sign language, RVLF introduces an effective semantic representation learning mechanism that fuses skeleton-based motion cues with semantically rich visual features extracted via DINOv2, followed by instruction tuning to obtain a strong SLT-SFT baseline. Then, to improve sentence-level semantic misalignment, we introduce a GRPO-based optimization strategy that fine-tunes the SLT-SFT model with a reward function combining translation fidelity (BLEU) and sentence completeness (ROUGE), yielding the optimized model termed SLT-GRPO. Our conceptually simple framework yields substantial gains under the gloss-free SLT setting without pre-training on any external large-scale sign language datasets, improving BLEU-4 scores by +5.1, +1.11, +1.4, and +1.61 on the CSL-Daily, PHOENIX-2014T, How2Sign, and OpenASL datasets, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to incorporate GRPO into SLT. Extensive experiments and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of GRPO-based optimization in enhancing both translation quality and semantic consistency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siyu Wang, Hua Wang, Huiyu Li, Fan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In the field of healthcare, precise skin lesion segmentation is crucial for the early detection and accurate diagnosis of skin diseases. Despite significant advances in deep learning for image processing, existing methods have yet to effectively address the challenges of irregular lesion shapes and low contrast. To address these issues, this paper proposes an innovative encoder-decoder network architecture based on multi-scale residual structures, capable of extracting rich feature information from different receptive fields to effectively identify lesion areas. By introducing a Multi-Resolution Multi-Channel Fusion (MRCF) module, our method captures cross-scale features, enhancing the clarity and accuracy of the extracted information. Furthermore, we propose a Cross-Mix Attention Module (CMAM), which redefines the attention scope and dynamically calculates weights across multiple contexts, thus improving the flexibility and depth of feature capture and enabling deeper exploration of subtle features. To overcome the information loss caused by skip connections in traditional U-Net, an External Attention Bridge (EAB) is introduced, facilitating the effective utilization of information in the decoder and compensating for the loss during upsampling. Extensive experimental evaluations on several skin lesion segmentation datasets demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms existing transformer and convolutional neural network-based models, showcasing exceptional segmentation accuracy and robustness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mai Tsujimoto, Junjue Wang, Weihao Xuan, Naoto Yokoya</p>
<p>Abstract: Three-dimensional geospatial analysis is critical to applications in urban planning, climate adaptation, and environmental assessment. Current methodologies depend on costly, specialized sensors (e.g., LiDAR and multispectral), which restrict global accessibility. Existing sensor-based and rule-driven methods further struggle with tasks requiring the integration of multiple 3D cues, handling diverse queries, and providing interpretable reasoning. We hereby present Geo3DVQA, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating vision-language models (VLMs) in height-aware, 3D geospatial reasoning using RGB-only remote sensing imagery. Unlike conventional sensor-based frameworks, Geo3DVQA emphasizes realistic scenarios that integrate elevation, sky view factors, and land cover patterns. The benchmark encompasses 110k curated question-answer pairs spanning 16 task categories across three complexity levels: single-feature inference, multi-feature reasoning, and application-level spatial analysis. The evaluation of ten state-of-the-art VLMs highlights the difficulty of RGB-to-3D reasoning. GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5-Flash achieved only 28.6% and 33.0% accuracy respectively, while domain-specific fine-tuning of Qwen2.5-VL-7B achieved 49.6% (+24.8 points). These results reveal both the limitations of current VLMs and the effectiveness of domain adaptation. Geo3DVQA introduces new challenge frontiers for scalable, accessible, and holistic 3D geospatial analysis.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07302">Towards Accurate UAV Image Perception: Guiding Vision-Language Models with Stronger Task Prompts</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingning Guo, Mengwei Wu, Shaoxian Li, Haifeng Li, Chao Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing image perception methods based on VLMs generally follow a paradigm wherein models extract and analyze image content based on user-provided textual task prompts. However, such methods face limitations when applied to UAV imagery, which presents challenges like target confusion, scale variations, and complex backgrounds. These challenges arise because VLMs' understanding of image content depends on the semantic alignment between visual and textual tokens. When the task prompt is simplistic and the image content is complex, achieving effective alignment becomes difficult, limiting the model's ability to focus on task-relevant information. To address this issue, we introduce AerialVP, the first agent framework for task prompt enhancement in UAV image perception. AerialVP proactively extracts multi-dimensional auxiliary information from UAV images to enhance task prompts, overcoming the limitations of traditional VLM-based approaches. Specifically, the enhancement process includes three stages: (1) analyzing the task prompt to identify the task type and enhancement needs, (2) selecting appropriate tools from the tool repository, and (3) generating enhanced task prompts based on the analysis and selected tools. To evaluate AerialVP, we introduce AerialSense, a comprehensive benchmark for UAV image perception that includes Aerial Visual Reasoning, Aerial Visual Question Answering, and Aerial Visual Grounding tasks. AerialSense provides a standardized basis for evaluating model generalization and performance across diverse resolutions, lighting conditions, and both urban and natural scenes. Experimental results demonstrate that AerialVP significantly enhances task prompt guidance, leading to stable and substantial performance improvements in both open-source and proprietary VLMs. Our work will be available at https://github.com/lostwolves/AerialVP.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study revisits the findings of Carl et al., who evaluated the pre-trained Google Inception-ResNet-v2 model for automated detection of European wild mammal species in camera trap images. To assess the reproducibility and generalizability of their approach, we reimplemented the experiment from scratch using openly available resources and a different dataset consisting of 900 images spanning 90 species. After minimal preprocessing, we obtained an overall classification accuracy of 62%, closely aligning with the 71% reported in the original work despite differences in datasets. As in the original study, per-class performance varied substantially, as indicated by a macro F1 score of 0.28,highlighting limitations in generalization when labels do not align directly with ImageNet classes. Our results confirm that pretrained convolutional neural networks can provide a practical baseline for wildlife species identification but also reinforce the need for species-specific adaptation or transfer learning to achieve consistent, high-quality predictions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyang Mai, Yu-Wing Tai</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) generation has advanced rapidly, yet maintaining consistent character identities across scenes remains a major challenge. Existing personalization methods often focus on facial identity but fail to preserve broader contextual cues such as hairstyle, outfit, and body shape, which are critical for visual coherence. We propose \textbf{ContextAnyone}, a context-aware diffusion framework that achieves character-consistent video generation from text and a single reference image. Our method jointly reconstructs the reference image and generates new video frames, enabling the model to fully perceive and utilize reference information. Reference information is effectively integrated into a DiT-based diffusion backbone through a novel Emphasize-Attention module that selectively reinforces reference-aware features and prevents identity drift across frames. A dual-guidance loss combines diffusion and reference reconstruction objectives to enhance appearance fidelity, while the proposed Gap-RoPE positional embedding separates reference and video tokens to stabilize temporal modeling. Experiments demonstrate that ContextAnyone outperforms existing reference-to-video methods in identity consistency and visual quality, generating coherent and context-preserving character videos across diverse motions and scenes.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kanishk Awadhiya</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) lack the hierarchical inductive biases inherent to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), theoretically allowing them to maintain high-dimensional representations throughout all layers. However, recent observations suggest ViTs often spontaneously manifest a "U-shaped" entropy profile-compressing information in middle layers before expanding it for the final classification. In this work, we demonstrate that this "Inductive Bottleneck" is not an architectural artifact, but a data-dependent adaptation. By analyzing the layer-wise Effective Encoding Dimension (EED) of DINO-trained ViTs across datasets of varying compositional complexity (UC Merced, Tiny ImageNet, and CIFAR-100), we show that the depth of the bottleneck correlates strongly with the semantic abstraction required by the task. We find that while texture-heavy datasets preserve high-rank representations throughout, object-centric datasets drive the network to dampen high-frequency information in middle layers, effectively "learning" a bottleneck to isolate semantic features.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07338">Generalized Referring Expression Segmentation on Aerial Photos</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Lu\'is Marnoto, Alexandre Bernardino, Bruno Martins</p>
<p>Abstract: Referring expression segmentation is a fundamental task in computer vision that integrates natural language understanding with precise visual localization of target regions. Considering aerial imagery (e.g., modern aerial photos collected through drones, historical photos from aerial archives, high-resolution satellite imagery, etc.) presents unique challenges because spatial resolution varies widely across datasets, the use of color is not consistent, targets often shrink to only a few pixels, and scenes contain very high object densities and objects with partial occlusions. This work presents Aerial-D, a new large-scale referring expression segmentation dataset for aerial imagery, comprising 37,288 images with 1,522,523 referring expressions that cover 259,709 annotated targets, spanning across individual object instances, groups of instances, and semantic regions covering 21 distinct classes that range from vehicles and infrastructure to land coverage types. The dataset was constructed through a fully automatic pipeline that combines systematic rule-based expression generation with a Large Language Model (LLM) enhancement procedure that enriched both the linguistic variety and the focus on visual details within the referring expressions. Filters were additionally used to simulate historic imaging conditions for each scene. We adopted the RSRefSeg architecture, and trained models on Aerial-D together with prior aerial datasets, yielding unified instance and semantic segmentation from text for both modern and historical images. Results show that the combined training achieves competitive performance on contemporary benchmarks, while maintaining strong accuracy under monochrome, sepia, and grainy degradations that appear in archival aerial photography.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07345">Debiasing Diffusion Priors via 3D Attention for Consistent Gaussian Splatting</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shilong Jin, Haoran Duan, Litao Hua, Wentao Huang, Yuan Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Versatile 3D tasks (e.g., generation or editing) that distill from Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models have attracted significant research interest for not relying on extensive 3D training data. However, T2I models exhibit limitations resulting from prior view bias, which produces conflicting appearances between different views of an object. This bias causes subject-words to preferentially activate prior view features during cross-attention (CA) computation, regardless of the target view condition. To overcome this limitation, we conduct a comprehensive mathematical analysis to reveal the root cause of the prior view bias in T2I models. Moreover, we find different UNet layers show different effects of prior view in CA. Therefore, we propose a novel framework, TD-Attn, which addresses multi-view inconsistency via two key components: (1) the 3D-Aware Attention Guidance Module (3D-AAG) constructs a view-consistent 3D attention Gaussian for subject-words to enforce spatial consistency across attention-focused regions, thereby compensating for the limited spatial information in 2D individual view CA maps; (2) the Hierarchical Attention Modulation Module (HAM) utilizes a Semantic Guidance Tree (SGT) to direct the Semantic Response Profiler (SRP) in localizing and modulating CA layers that are highly responsive to view conditions, where the enhanced CA maps further support the construction of more consistent 3D attention Gaussians. Notably, HAM facilitates semantic-specific interventions, enabling controllable and precise 3D editing. Extensive experiments firmly establish that TD-Attn has the potential to serve as a universal plugin, significantly enhancing multi-view consistency across 3D tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyu Wei, Kangrui Cen, Hongyang Wei, Zhen Guo, Bairui Li, Zeqing Wang, Jinrui Zhang, Lei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In controllable image generation, synthesizing coherent and consistent images from multiple reference inputs, i.e., Multi-Image Composition (MICo), remains a challenging problem, partly hindered by the lack of high-quality training data. To bridge this gap, we conduct a systematic study of MICo, categorizing it into 7 representative tasks and curate a large-scale collection of high-quality source images and construct diverse MICo prompts. Leveraging powerful proprietary models, we synthesize a rich amount of balanced composite images, followed by human-in-the-loop filtering and refinement, resulting in MICo-150K, a comprehensive dataset for MICo with identity consistency. We further build a Decomposition-and-Recomposition (De&Re) subset, where 11K real-world complex images are decomposed into components and recomposed, enabling both real and synthetic compositions. To enable comprehensive evaluation, we construct MICo-Bench with 100 cases per task and 300 challenging De&Re cases, and further introduce a new metric, Weighted-Ref-VIEScore, specifically tailored for MICo evaluation. Finally, we fine-tune multiple models on MICo-150K and evaluate them on MICo-Bench. The results show that MICo-150K effectively equips models without MICo capability and further enhances those with existing skills. Notably, our baseline model, Qwen-MICo, fine-tuned from Qwen-Image-Edit, matches Qwen-Image-2509 in 3-image composition while supporting arbitrary multi-image inputs beyond the latter's limitation. Our dataset, benchmark, and baseline collectively offer valuable resources for further research on Multi-Image Composition.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sayeem Been Zaman, Wasimul Karim, Arefin Ittesafun Abian, Reem E. Mohamed, Md Rafiqul Islam, Asif Karim, Sami Azam</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing use of synthetic media, particularly deepfakes, is an emerging challenge for digital content verification. Although recent studies use both audio and visual information, most integrate these cues within a single model, which remains vulnerable to modality mismatches, noise, and manipulation. To address this gap, we propose DeepAgent, an advanced multi-agent collaboration framework that simultaneously incorporates both visual and audio modalities for the effective detection of deepfakes. DeepAgent consists of two complementary agents. Agent-1 examines each video with a streamlined AlexNet-based CNN to identify the symbols of deepfake manipulation, while Agent-2 detects audio-visual inconsistencies by combining acoustic features, audio transcriptions from Whisper, and frame-reading sequences of images through EasyOCR. Their decisions are fused through a Random Forest meta-classifier that improves final performance by taking advantage of the different decision boundaries learned by each agent. This study evaluates the proposed framework using three benchmark datasets to demonstrate both component-level and fused performance. Agent-1 achieves a test accuracy of 94.35% on the combined Celeb-DF and FakeAVCeleb datasets. On the FakeAVCeleb dataset, Agent-2 and the final meta-classifier attain accuracies of 93.69% and 81.56%, respectively. In addition, cross-dataset validation on DeepFakeTIMIT confirms the robustness of the meta-classifier, which achieves a final accuracy of 97.49%, and indicates a strong capability across diverse datasets. These findings confirm that hierarchy-based fusion enhances robustness by mitigating the weaknesses of individual modalities and demonstrate the effectiveness of a multi-agent approach in addressing diverse types of manipulations in deepfakes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiming Huang, Hao Ai, Jianbo Jiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Benefiting from the inductive biases learned from large-scale datasets, open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) leverages the power of vision-language models, such as CLIP, to achieve remarkable progress without requiring task-specific training. However, due to CLIP's pre-training nature on image-text pairs, it tends to focus on global semantic alignment, resulting in suboptimal performance when associating fine-grained visual regions with text. This leads to noisy and inconsistent predictions, particularly in local areas. We attribute this to a dispersed bias stemming from its contrastive training paradigm, which is difficult to alleviate using CLIP features alone. To address this, we propose a structure-aware feature rectification approach that incorporates instance-specific priors derived directly from the image. Specifically, we construct a region adjacency graph (RAG) based on low-level features (e.g., colour and texture) to capture local structural relationships and use it to refine CLIP features by enhancing local discrimination. Extensive experiments show that our method effectively suppresses segmentation noise, improves region-level consistency, and achieves strong performance on multiple open-vocabulary segmentation benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper investigates and develops methods for detecting small objects in large-scale aerial images. Current approaches for detecting small objects in aerial images often involve image cropping and modifications to detector network architectures. Techniques such as sliding window cropping and architectural enhancements, including higher-resolution feature maps and attention mechanisms, are commonly employed. Given the growing importance of aerial imagery in various critical and industrial applications, the need for robust frameworks for small object detection becomes imperative. To address this need, we adopted the base SW-YOLO approach to enhance speed and accuracy in small object detection by refining cropping dimensions and overlap in sliding window usage and subsequently enhanced it through architectural modifications. we propose a novel model by modifying the base model architecture, including advanced feature extraction modules in the neck for feature map enhancement, integrating CBAM in the backbone to preserve spatial and channel information, and introducing a new head to boost small object detection accuracy. Finally, we compared our method with SAHI, one of the most powerful frameworks for processing large-scale images, and CZDet, which is also based on image cropping, achieving significant improvements in accuracy. The proposed model achieves significant accuracy gains on the VisDrone2019 dataset, outperforming baseline YOLOv5L detection by a substantial margin. Specifically, the final proposed model elevates the mAP .5.5 accuracy on the VisDrone2019 dataset from the base accuracy of 35.5 achieved by the YOLOv5L detector to 61.2. Notably, the accuracy of CZDet, which is another classic method applied to this dataset, is 58.36. This research demonstrates a significant improvement, achieving an increase in accuracy from 35.5 to 61.2.</p>

<p>Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) enables highly photorealistic scene reconstruction from posed image sequences but struggles with viewpoint extrapolation due to its anisotropic nature, leading to overfitting and poor generalization, particularly in sparse-view and dynamic scene reconstruction. We propose Tessellation GS, a structured 2D GS approach anchored on mesh faces, to reconstruct dynamic scenes from a single continuously moving or static camera. Our method constrains 2D Gaussians to localized regions and infers their attributes via hierarchical neural features on mesh faces. Gaussian subdivision is guided by an adaptive face subdivision strategy driven by a detail-aware loss function. Additionally, we leverage priors from a reconstruction foundation model to initialize Gaussian deformations, enabling robust reconstruction of general dynamic objects from a single static camera, previously extremely challenging for optimization-based methods. Our method outperforms previous SOTA method, reducing LPIPS by 29.1% and Chamfer distance by 49.2% on appearance and mesh reconstruction tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) provide a basis for semantic abstractions within a neural network architecture. Such models have primarily been seen through the lens of interpretability so far, wherein they offer transparency by inferring predictions as a linear combination of semantic concepts. However, a linear combination is inherently limiting. So we propose the enhancement of concept-based learning models through propositional logic. We introduce a logic module that is carefully designed to connect the learned concepts from CBMs through differentiable logic operations, such that our proposed LogicCBM can go beyond simple weighted combinations of concepts to leverage various logical operations to yield the final predictions, while maintaining end-to-end learnability. Composing concepts using a set of logic operators enables the model to capture inter-concept relations, while simultaneously improving the expressivity of the model in terms of logic operations. Our empirical studies on well-known benchmarks and synthetic datasets demonstrate that these models have better accuracy, perform effective interventions and are highly interpretable.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chunhui Zhang, Li Liu, Zhipeng Zhang, Yong Wang, Hao Wen, Xi Zhou, Shiming Ge, Yanfeng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) offer wide-ranging applications but also pose significant safety and privacy violation risks in areas like airport and infrastructure inspection, spurring the rapid development of Anti-UAV technologies in recent years. However, current Anti-UAV research primarily focuses on RGB, infrared (IR), or RGB-IR videos captured by fixed ground cameras, with little attention to tracking target UAVs from another moving UAV platform. To fill this gap, we propose a new multi-modal visual tracking task termed UAV-Anti-UAV, which involves a pursuer UAV tracking a target adversarial UAV in the video stream. Compared to existing Anti-UAV tasks, UAV-Anti-UAV is more challenging due to severe dual-dynamic disturbances caused by the rapid motion of both the capturing platform and the target. To advance research in this domain, we construct a million-scale dataset consisting of 1,810 videos, each manually annotated with bounding boxes, a language prompt, and 15 tracking attributes. Furthermore, we propose MambaSTS, a Mamba-based baseline method for UAV-Anti-UAV tracking, which enables integrated spatial-temporal-semantic learning. Specifically, we employ Mamba and Transformer models to learn global semantic and spatial features, respectively, and leverage the state space model's strength in long-sequence modeling to establish video-level long-term context via a temporal token propagation mechanism. We conduct experiments on the UAV-Anti-UAV dataset to validate the effectiveness of our method. A thorough experimental evaluation of 50 modern deep tracking algorithms demonstrates that there is still significant room for improvement in the UAV-Anti-UAV domain.

<p><b>Authors:</b> {\DJ}or{\dj}e Nedeljkovi\'c</p>
<p>Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have proven highly effective for edge and mobile vision tasks due to their computational efficiency. While many recent works seek to enhance CNNs with global contextual understanding via self-attention-based Vision Transformers, these approaches often introduce significant computational overhead. In this work, we demonstrate that it is possible to retain strong global perception without relying on computationally expensive components. We present GlimmerNet, an ultra-lightweight convolutional network built on the principle of separating receptive field diversity from feature recombination. GlimmerNet introduces Grouped Dilated Depthwise Convolutions(GDBlocks), which partition channels into groups with distinct dilation rates, enabling multi-scale feature extraction at no additional parameter cost. To fuse these features efficiently, we design a novel Aggregator module that recombines cross-group representations using grouped pointwise convolution, significantly lowering parameter overhead. With just 31K parameters and 29% fewer FLOPs than the most recent baseline, GlimmerNet achieves a new state-of-the-art weighted F1-score of 0.966 on the UAV-focused AIDERv2 dataset. These results establish a new accuracy-efficiency trade-off frontier for real-time emergency monitoring on resource-constrained UAV platforms.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhifan Zhu, Siddhant Bansal, Shashank Tripathi, Dima Damen</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce the task of Reconstructing Objects along Hand Interaction Timelines (ROHIT). We first define the Hand Interaction Timeline (HIT) from a rigid object's perspective. In a HIT, an object is first static relative to the scene, then is held in hand following contact, where its pose changes. This is usually followed by a firm grip during use, before it is released to be static again w.r.t. to the scene. We model these pose constraints over the HIT, and propose to propagate the object's pose along the HIT enabling superior reconstruction using our proposed Constrained Optimisation and Propagation (COP) framework. Importantly, we focus on timelines with stable grasps - i.e. where the hand is stably holding an object, effectively maintaining constant contact during use. This allows us to efficiently annotate, study, and evaluate object reconstruction in videos without 3D ground truth. We evaluate our proposed task, ROHIT, over two egocentric datasets, HOT3D and in-the-wild EPIC-Kitchens. In HOT3D, we curate 1.2K clips of stable grasps. In EPIC-Kitchens, we annotate 2.4K clips of stable grasps including 390 object instances across 9 categories from videos of daily interactions in 141 environments. Without 3D ground truth, we utilise 2D projection error to assess the reconstruction. Quantitatively, COP improves stable grasp reconstruction by 6.2-11.3% and HIT reconstruction by up to 24.5% with constrained pose propagation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bin Li, Ruichi Zhang, Han Liang, Jingyan Zhang, Juze Zhang, Xin Chen, Lan Xu, Jingyi Yu, Jingya Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Humanoid agents are expected to emulate the complex coordination inherent in human social behaviors. However, existing methods are largely confined to single-agent scenarios, overlooking the physically plausible interplay essential for multi-agent interactions. To bridge this gap, we propose InterAgent, the first end-to-end framework for text-driven physics-based multi-agent humanoid control. At its core, we introduce an autoregressive diffusion transformer equipped with multi-stream blocks, which decouples proprioception, exteroception, and action to mitigate cross-modal interference while enabling synergistic coordination. We further propose a novel interaction graph exteroception representation that explicitly captures fine-grained joint-to-joint spatial dependencies to facilitate network learning. Additionally, within it we devise a sparse edge-based attention mechanism that dynamically prunes redundant connections and emphasizes critical inter-agent spatial relations, thereby enhancing the robustness of interaction modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InterAgent consistently outperforms multiple strong baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance. It enables producing coherent, physically plausible, and semantically faithful multi-agent behaviors from only text prompts. Our code and data will be released to facilitate future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gabriele Galatolo, Mirco Nanni</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding the movement behaviours of individuals and the way they react to the external world is a key component of any problem that involves the modelling of human dynamics at a physical level. In particular, it is crucial to capture the influence that the presence of an individual can have on the others. Important examples of applications include crowd simulation and emergency management, where the simulation of the mass of people passes through the simulation of the individuals, taking into consideration the others as part of the general context. While existing solutions basically start from some preconceived behavioural model, in this work we propose an approach that starts directly from the data, adopting a data mining perspective. Our method searches the mobility events in the data that might be possible evidences of mutual interactions between individuals, and on top of them looks for complex, persistent patterns and time evolving configurations of events. The study of these patterns can provide new insights on the mechanics of mobility interactions between individuals, which can potentially help in improving existing simulation models. We instantiate the general methodology on two real case studies, one on cars and one on pedestrians, and a full experimental evaluation is performed, both in terms of performances, parameter sensitivity and interpretation of sample results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Karel Moens, Matthew B. Blaschko, Tinne Tuytelaars, Bart Diricx, Jonas De Vylder, Mustafa Yousif</p>
<p>Abstract: Whole slide image (WSI) normalization remains a vital preprocessing step in computational pathology. Increasingly driven by deep learning, these models learn to approximate data distributions from training examples. This often results in outputs that gravitate toward the average, potentially masking diagnostically important features. More critically, they can introduce hallucinated content, artifacts that appear realistic but are not present in the original tissue, posing a serious threat to downstream analysis. These hallucinations are nearly impossible to detect visually, and current evaluation practices often overlook them. In this work, we demonstrate that the risk of hallucinations is real and underappreciated. While many methods perform adequately on public datasets, we observe a concerning frequency of hallucinations when these same models are retrained and evaluated on real-world clinical data. To address this, we propose a novel image comparison measure designed to automatically detect hallucinations in normalized outputs. Using this measure, we systematically evaluate several well-cited normalization methods retrained on real-world data, revealing significant inconsistencies and failures that are not captured by conventional metrics. Our findings underscore the need for more robust, interpretable normalization techniques and stricter validation protocols in clinical deployment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangpeng Yang, Ji Xie, Yiyuan Yang, Yan Huang, Min Xu, Qiang Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing video editing methods face a critical trade-off: expert models offer precision but rely on task-specific priors like masks, hindering unification; conversely, unified temporal in-context learning models are mask-free but lack explicit spatial cues, leading to weak instruction-to-region mapping and imprecise localization. To resolve this conflict, we propose VideoCoF, a novel Chain-of-Frames approach inspired by Chain-of-Thought reasoning. VideoCoF enforces a ``see, reason, then edit" procedure by compelling the video diffusion model to first predict reasoning tokens (edit-region latents) before generating the target video tokens. This explicit reasoning step removes the need for user-provided masks while achieving precise instruction-to-region alignment and fine-grained video editing. Furthermore, we introduce a RoPE alignment strategy that leverages these reasoning tokens to ensure motion alignment and enable length extrapolation beyond the training duration. We demonstrate that with a minimal data cost of only 50k video pairs, VideoCoF achieves state-of-the-art performance on VideoCoF-Bench, validating the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Naifu Xue, Zhaoyang Jia, Jiahao Li, Bin Li, Zihan Zheng, Yuan Zhang, Yan Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: While traditional and neural video codecs (NVCs) have achieved remarkable rate-distortion performance, improving perceptual quality at low bitrates remains challenging. Some NVCs incorporate perceptual or adversarial objectives but still suffer from artifacts due to limited generation capacity, whereas others leverage pretrained diffusion models to improve quality at the cost of heavy sampling complexity. To overcome these challenges, we propose S2VC, a Single-Step diffusion based Video Codec that integrates a conditional coding framework with an efficient single-step diffusion generator, enabling realistic reconstruction at low bitrates with reduced sampling cost. Recognizing the importance of semantic conditioning in single-step diffusion, we introduce Contextual Semantic Guidance to extract frame-adaptive semantics from buffered features. It replaces text captions with efficient, fine-grained conditioning, thereby improving generation realism. In addition, Temporal Consistency Guidance is incorporated into the diffusion U-Net to enforce temporal coherence across frames and ensure stable generation. Extensive experiments show that S2VC delivers state-of-the-art perceptual quality with an average 52.73% bitrate saving over prior perceptual methods, underscoring the promise of single-step diffusion for efficient, high-quality video compression.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chih-Chung Hsu, Shao-Ning Chen, Chia-Ming Lee, Yi-Fang Wang, Yi-Shiuan Chou</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring the authenticity of video content remains challenging as DeepFake generation becomes increasingly realistic and robust against detection. Most existing detectors implicitly assume temporally consistent and clean facial sequences, an assumption that rarely holds in real-world scenarios where compression artifacts, occlusions, and adversarial attacks destabilize face detection and often lead to invalid or misdetected faces. To address these challenges, we propose a Laplacian-Regularized Graph Convolutional Network (LR-GCN) that robustly detects DeepFakes from noisy or unordered face sequences, while being trained only on clean facial data. Our method constructs an Order-Free Temporal Graph Embedding (OF-TGE) that organizes frame-wise CNN features into an adaptive sparse graph based on semantic affinities. Unlike traditional methods constrained by strict temporal continuity, OF-TGE captures intrinsic feature consistency across frames, making it resilient to shuffled, missing, or heavily corrupted inputs. We further impose a dual-level sparsity mechanism on both graph structure and node features to suppress the influence of invalid faces. Crucially, we introduce an explicit Graph Laplacian Spectral Prior that acts as a high-pass operator in the graph spectral domain, highlighting structural anomalies and forgery artifacts, which are then consolidated by a low-pass GCN aggregation. This sequential design effectively realizes a task-driven spectral band-pass mechanism that suppresses background information and random noise while preserving manipulation cues. Extensive experiments on FF++, Celeb-DFv2, and DFDC demonstrate that LR-GCN achieves state-of-the-art performance and significantly improved robustness under severe global and local disruptions, including missing faces, occlusions, and adversarially perturbed face detections.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yao Teng, Zhihuan Jiang, Han Shi, Xian Liu, Xuefei Ning, Guohao Dai, Yu Wang, Zhenguo Li, Xihui Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large autoregressive models can generate high-quality, high-resolution images but suffer from slow generation speed, because these models require hundreds to thousands of sequential forward passes for next-token prediction during inference. To accelerate autoregressive text-to-image generation, we propose Speculative Jacobi Decoding++ (SJD++), a training-free probabilistic parallel decoding algorithm. Unlike traditional next-token prediction, SJD++ performs multi-token prediction in each forward pass, drastically reducing generation steps. Specifically, it integrates the iterative multi-token prediction mechanism from Jacobi decoding, with the probabilistic drafting-and-verification mechanism from speculative sampling. More importantly, for further acceleration, SJD++ reuses high-confidence draft tokens after each verification phase instead of resampling them all. We conduct extensive experiments on several representative autoregressive text-to-image generation models and demonstrate that SJD++ achieves $2\times$ to $3\times$ inference latency reduction and $2\times$ to $7\times$ step compression, while preserving visual quality with no observable degradation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ryota Okumura, Kaede Shiohara, Toshihiko Yamasaki</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent text-to-image models, such as Stable Diffusion, have achieved impressive visual quality, yet they often suffer from geometric inconsistencies that undermine the structural realism of generated scenes. One prominent issue is vanishing point inconsistency, where projections of parallel lines fail to converge correctly in 2D space. This leads to structurally implausible geometry that degrades spatial realism, especially in architectural scenes. We propose ControlVP, a user-guided framework for correcting vanishing point inconsistencies in generated images. Our approach extends a pre-trained diffusion model by incorporating structural guidance derived from building contours. We also introduce geometric constraints that explicitly encourage alignment between image edges and perspective cues. Our method enhances global geometric consistency while maintaining visual fidelity comparable to the baselines. This capability is particularly valuable for applications that require accurate spatial structure, such as image-to-3D reconstruction.

<p>Abstract: Meshes serve as a primary representation for 3D assets. Autoregressive mesh generators serialize faces into sequences and train on truncated segments with sliding-window inference to cope with memory limits. However, this mismatch breaks long-range geometric dependencies, producing holes and fragmented components. To address this critical limitation, we introduce MeshRipple, which expands a mesh outward from an active generation frontier, akin to a ripple on a surface.MeshRipple rests on three key innovations: a frontier-aware BFS tokenization that aligns the generation order with surface topology; an expansive prediction strategy that maintains coherent, connected surface growth; and a sparse-attention global memory that provides an effectively unbounded receptive field to resolve long-range topological dependencies.This integrated design enables MeshRipple to generate meshes with high surface fidelity and topological completeness, outperforming strong recent baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fei Yu, Yu Liu, Luyang Tang, Mingchao Sun, Zengye Ge, Rui Bu, Yuchao Jin, Haisen Zhao, He Sun, Yangyan Li, Mu Xu, Wenzheng Chen, Baoquan Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: City-scale 3D reconstruction from satellite imagery presents the challenge of extreme viewpoint extrapolation, where our goal is to synthesize ground-level novel views from sparse orbital images with minimal parallax. This requires inferring nearly $90^\circ$ viewpoint gaps from image sources with severely foreshortened facades and flawed textures, causing state-of-the-art reconstruction engines such as NeRF and 3DGS to fail.
  To address this problem, we propose two design choices tailored for city structures and satellite inputs. First, we model city geometry as a 2.5D height map, implemented as a Z-monotonic signed distance field (SDF) that matches urban building layouts from top-down viewpoints. This stabilizes geometry optimization under sparse, off-nadir satellite views and yields a watertight mesh with crisp roofs and clean, vertically extruded facades. Second, we paint the mesh appearance from satellite images via differentiable rendering techniques. While the satellite inputs may contain long-range, blurry captures, we further train a generative texture restoration network to enhance the appearance, recovering high-frequency, plausible texture details from degraded inputs.
  Our method's scalability and robustness are demonstrated through extensive experiments on large-scale urban reconstruction. For example, in our teaser figure, we reconstruct a $4\,\mathrm{km}^2$ real-world region from only a few satellite images, achieving state-of-the-art performance in synthesizing photorealistic ground views. The resulting models are not only visually compelling but also serve as high-fidelity, application-ready assets for downstream tasks like urban planning and simulation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) frequently generate hallucinated content plausible but incorrect claims about image content. We propose a training-free self-correction framework enabling VLMs to iteratively refine responses through uncertainty-guided visual re-attention. Our method combines multidimensional uncertainty quantification (token entropy, attention dispersion, semantic consistency, claim confidence) with attention-guided cropping of under-explored regions. Operating entirely with frozen, pretrained VLMs, our framework requires no gradient updates. We validate our approach on the POPE and MMHAL BENCH benchmarks using the Qwen2.5-VL-7B [23] architecture. Experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces hallucination rates by 9.8 percentage points compared to the baseline, while improving object existence accuracy by 4.7 points on adversarial splits. Furthermore, qualitative analysis confirms that uncertainty-guided re-attention successfully grounds corrections in visual evidence where standard decoding fails. We validate our approach on Qwen2.5-VL-7B [23], with plans to extend validation across diverse architectures in future versions. We release our code and methodology to facilitate future research in trustworthy multimodal systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuecheng Li, Weikuan Jia, Alisher Kurbonaliev, Qurbonaliev Alisher, Khudzhamkulov Rustam, Ismoilov Shuhratjon, Eshmatov Javhariddin, Yuanjie Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Cross-modal learning has become a fundamental paradigm for integrating heterogeneous information sources such as images, text, and structured attributes. However, multimodal representations often suffer from modality dominance, redundant information coupling, and spurious cross-modal correlations, leading to suboptimal generalization and limited interpretability. In particular, high-variance modalities tend to overshadow weaker but semantically important signals, while na\"ive fusion strategies entangle modality-shared and modality-specific factors in an uncontrolled manner. This makes it difficult to understand which modality actually drives a prediction and to maintain robustness when some modalities are noisy or missing. To address these challenges, we propose a Dual-Stream Residual Semantic Decorrelation Network (DSRSD-Net), a simple yet effective framework that disentangles modality-specific and modality-shared information through residual decomposition and explicit semantic decorrelation constraints. DSRSD-Net introduces: (1) a dual-stream representation learning module that separates intra-modal (private) and inter-modal (shared) latent factors via residual projection; (2) a residual semantic alignment head that maps shared factors from different modalities into a common space using a combination of contrastive and regression-style objectives; and (3) a decorrelation and orthogonality loss that regularizes the covariance structure of the shared space while enforcing orthogonality between shared and private streams, thereby suppressing cross-modal redundancy and preventing feature collapse. Experimental results on two large-scale educational benchmarks demonstrate that DSRSD-Net consistently improves next-step prediction and final outcome prediction over strong single-modality, early-fusion, late-fusion, and co-attention baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yahong Wang, Juncheng Wu, Zhangkai Ni, Longzhen Yang, Yihang Liu, Chengmei Yang, Ying Wen, Xianfeng Tang, Hui Liu, Yuyin Zhou, Lianghua He</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) incur high computational costs due to their reliance on hundreds of visual tokens to represent images. While token pruning offers a promising solution for accelerating inference, this paper, however, identifies a key observation: in deeper layers (e.g., beyond the 20th), existing training-free pruning methods perform no better than random pruning. We hypothesize that this degradation is caused by "vanishing token information", where visual tokens progressively lose their salience with increasing network depth. To validate this hypothesis, we quantify a token's information content by measuring the change in the model output probabilities upon its removal. Using this proposed metric, our analysis of the information of visual tokens across layers reveals three key findings: (1) As layers deepen, the information of visual tokens gradually becomes uniform and eventually vanishes at an intermediate layer, which we term as "information horizon", beyond which the visual tokens become redundant; (2) The position of this horizon is not static; it extends deeper for visually intensive tasks, such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR), compared to more general tasks like Visual Question Answering (VQA); (3) This horizon is also strongly correlated with model capacity, as stronger VLLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL) employ deeper visual tokens than weaker models (e.g., LLaVA-1.5). Based on our findings, we show that simple random pruning in deep layers efficiently balances performance and efficiency. Moreover, integrating random pruning consistently enhances existing methods. Using DivPrune with random pruning achieves state-of-the-art results, maintaining 96.9% of Qwen-2.5-VL-7B performance while pruning 50% of visual tokens.

<p>Abstract: We introduce LongCat-Image, a pioneering open-source and bilingual (Chinese-English) foundation model for image generation, designed to address core challenges in multilingual text rendering, photorealism, deployment efficiency, and developer accessibility prevalent in current leading models. 1) We achieve this through rigorous data curation strategies across the pre-training, mid-training, and SFT stages, complemented by the coordinated use of curated reward models during the RL phase. This strategy establishes the model as a new state-of-the-art (SOTA), delivering superior text-rendering capabilities and remarkable photorealism, and significantly enhancing aesthetic quality. 2) Notably, it sets a new industry standard for Chinese character rendering. By supporting even complex and rare characters, it outperforms both major open-source and commercial solutions in coverage, while also achieving superior accuracy. 3) The model achieves remarkable efficiency through its compact design. With a core diffusion model of only 6B parameters, it is significantly smaller than the nearly 20B or larger Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures common in the field. This ensures minimal VRAM usage and rapid inference, significantly reducing deployment costs. Beyond generation, LongCat-Image also excels in image editing, achieving SOTA results on standard benchmarks with superior editing consistency compared to other open-source works. 4) To fully empower the community, we have established the most comprehensive open-source ecosystem to date. We are releasing not only multiple model versions for text-to-image and image editing, including checkpoints after mid-training and post-training stages, but also the entire toolchain of training procedure. We believe that the openness of LongCat-Image will provide robust support for developers and researchers, pushing the frontiers of visual content creation.</p>

<p>Abstract: To address the challenge of segmenting noisy images with blurred or fragmented boundaries, this paper presents a robust version of Variational Model Based Tailored UNet (VM_TUNet), a hybrid framework that integrates variational methods with deep learning. The proposed approach incorporates physical priors, an edge detector and a mean curvature term, into a modified Cahn-Hilliard equation, aiming to combine the interpretability and boundary-smoothing advantages of variational partial differential equations (PDEs) with the strong representational ability of deep neural networks. The architecture consists of two collaborative modules: an F module, which conducts efficient frequency domain preprocessing to alleviate poor local minima, and a T module, which ensures accurate and stable local computations, backed by a stability estimate. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets indicate that the proposed method achieves a balanced trade-off between performance and computational efficiency, which yields competitive quantitative results and improved visual quality compared to pure convolutional neural network (CNN) based models, while achieving performance close to that of transformer-based method with reasonable computational expense.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenzhen Dong, Jieming Yu, Yiming Huang, Hongqiu Wang, Lei Zhu, Albert C. S. Chung, Hongliang Ren, Long Bai</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent Segment Anything Model (SAM) 3 has introduced significant advancements over its predecessor, SAM 2, particularly with the integration of language-based segmentation and enhanced 3D perception capabilities. SAM 3 supports zero-shot segmentation across a wide range of prompts, including point, bounding box, and language-based prompts, allowing for more flexible and intuitive interactions with the model. In this empirical evaluation, we assess the performance of SAM 3 in robot-assisted surgery, benchmarking its zero-shot segmentation with point and bounding box prompts and exploring its effectiveness in dynamic video tracking, alongside its newly introduced language prompt segmentation. While language prompts show potential, their performance in the surgical domain is currently suboptimal, highlighting the need for further domain-specific training. Additionally, we investigate SAM 3's 3D reconstruction abilities, demonstrating its capacity to process surgical scene data and reconstruct 3D anatomical structures from 2D images. Through comprehensive testing on the MICCAI EndoVis 2017 and EndoVis 2018 benchmarks, SAM 3 shows clear improvements over SAM and SAM 2 in both image and video segmentation under spatial prompts, while zero-shot evaluations on SCARED, StereoMIS, and EndoNeRF indicate strong monocular depth estimation and realistic 3D instrument reconstruction, yet also reveal remaining limitations in complex, highly dynamic surgical scenes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanshi Wang, Zijian Cai, Jin Gao, Yiwei Zhang, Weiming Hu, Ke Wang, Zhipeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Online, real-time, and fine-grained 3D segmentation constitutes a fundamental capability for embodied intelligent agents to perceive and comprehend their operational environments. Recent advancements employ predefined object queries to aggregate semantic information from Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) outputs that are lifted into 3D point clouds, facilitating spatial information propagation through inter-query interactions. Nevertheless, perception is an inherently dynamic process, rendering temporal understanding a critical yet overlooked dimension within these prevailing query-based pipelines. Therefore, to further unlock the temporal environmental perception capabilities of embodied agents, our work reconceptualizes online 3D segmentation as an instance tracking problem (AutoSeg3D). Our core strategy involves utilizing object queries for temporal information propagation, where long-term instance association promotes the coherence of features and object identities, while short-term instance update enriches instant observations. Given that viewpoint variations in embodied robotics often lead to partial object visibility across frames, this mechanism aids the model in developing a holistic object understanding beyond incomplete instantaneous views. Furthermore, we introduce spatial consistency learning to mitigate the fragmentation problem inherent in VFMs, yielding more comprehensive instance information for enhancing the efficacy of both long-term and short-term temporal learning. The temporal information exchange and consistency learning facilitated by these sparse object queries not only enhance spatial comprehension but also circumvent the computational burden associated with dense temporal point cloud interactions. Our method establishes a new state-of-the-art, surpassing ESAM by 2.8 AP on ScanNet200 and delivering consistent gains on ScanNet, SceneNN, and 3RScan datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingna Qiu, Frauke Wilm, Mathias \"Ottl, Jonas Utz, Maja Schlereth, Moritz Schillinger, Marc Aubreville, Katharina Breininger</p>
<p>Abstract: Active learning improves annotation efficiency by selecting the most informative samples for annotation and model training. While most prior work has focused on selecting informative images for classification tasks, we investigate the more challenging setting of dense prediction, where annotations are more costly and time-intensive, especially in medical imaging. Region-level annotation has been shown to be more efficient than image-level annotation for these tasks. However, existing methods for representative annotation region selection suffer from high computational and memory costs, irrelevant region choices, and heavy reliance on uncertainty sampling. We propose decomposition sampling (DECOMP), a new active learning sampling strategy that addresses these limitations. It enhances annotation diversity by decomposing images into class-specific components using pseudo-labels and sampling regions from each class. Class-wise predictive confidence further guides the sampling process, ensuring that difficult classes receive additional annotations. Across ROI classification, 2-D segmentation, and 3-D segmentation, DECOMP consistently surpasses baseline methods by better sampling minority-class regions and boosting performance on these challenging classes.

<p>Abstract: Compositionality is critical for 3D object and scene generation, but existing part-aware 3D generation methods suffer from poor scalability due to quadratic global attention costs when increasing the number of components. In this work, we present MoCA, a compositional 3D generative model with two key designs: (1) importance-based component routing that selects top-k relevant components for sparse global attention, and (2) unimportant components compression that preserve contextual priors of unselected components while reducing computational complexity of global attention. With these designs, MoCA enables efficient, fine-grained compositional 3D asset creation with scalable number of components. Extensive experiments show MoCA outperforms baselines on both compositional object and scene generation tasks. Project page: https://lizhiqi49.github.io/MoCA</p>

<p>Abstract: Liver fibrosis represents a significant global health burden, necessitating accurate staging for effective clinical management. This report introduces the LiQA (Liver Fibrosis Quantification and Analysis) dataset, established as part of the CARE 2024 challenge. Comprising $440$ patients with multi-phase, multi-center MRI scans, the dataset is curated to benchmark algorithms for Liver Segmentation (LiSeg) and Liver Fibrosis Staging (LiFS) under complex real-world conditions, including domain shifts, missing modalities, and spatial misalignment. We further describe the challenge's top-performing methodology, which integrates a semi-supervised learning framework with external data for robust segmentation, and utilizes a multi-view consensus approach with Class Activation Map (CAM)-based regularization for staging. Evaluation of this baseline demonstrates that leveraging multi-source data and anatomical constraints significantly enhances model robustness in clinical settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hamad Almazrouei, Mariam Al Nasseri, Maha Alzaabi</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional sea exploration faces significant challenges due to extreme conditions, limited visibility, and high costs, resulting in vast unexplored ocean regions. This paper presents an innovative AI-powered Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) system designed to overcome these limitations by automating underwater object detection, analysis, and reporting. The system integrates YOLOv12 Nano for real-time object detection, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) (ResNet50) for feature extraction, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, and K-Means++ clustering for grouping marine objects based on visual characteristics. Furthermore, a Large Language Model (LLM) (GPT-4o Mini) is employed to generate structured reports and summaries of underwater findings, enhancing data interpretation. The system was trained and evaluated on a combined dataset of over 55,000 images from the DeepFish and OzFish datasets, capturing diverse Australian marine environments. Experimental results demonstrate the system's capability to detect marine objects with a mAP@0.5 of 0.512, a precision of 0.535, and a recall of 0.438. The integration of PCA effectively reduced feature dimensionality while preserving 98% variance, facilitating K-Means clustering which successfully grouped detected objects based on visual similarities. The LLM integration proved effective in generating insightful summaries of detections and clusters, supported by location data. This integrated approach significantly reduces the risks associated with human diving, increases mission efficiency, and enhances the speed and depth of underwater data analysis, paving the way for more effective scientific research and discovery in challenging marine environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiaho Li, Naisheng Ye, Tianyu Li, Kashyap Chitta, Tuo An, Peng Su, Boyang Wang, Haiou Liu, Chen Lv, Hongyang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Realistic and diverse multi-agent driving scenes are crucial for evaluating autonomous vehicles, but safety-critical events which are essential for this task are rare and underrepresented in driving datasets. Data-driven scene generation offers a low-cost alternative by synthesizing complex traffic behaviors from existing driving logs. However, existing models often lack controllability or yield samples that violate physical or social constraints, limiting their usability. We present OMEGA, an optimization-guided, training-free framework that enforces structural consistency and interaction awareness during diffusion-based sampling from a scene generation model. OMEGA re-anchors each reverse diffusion step via constrained optimization, steering the generation towards physically plausible and behaviorally coherent trajectories. Building on this framework, we formulate ego-attacker interactions as a game-theoretic optimization in the distribution space, approximating Nash equilibria to generate realistic, safety-critical adversarial scenarios. Experiments on nuPlan and Waymo show that OMEGA improves generation realism, consistency, and controllability, increasing the ratio of physically and behaviorally valid scenes from 32.35% to 72.27% for free exploration capabilities, and from 11% to 80% for controllability-focused generation. Our approach can also generate $5\times$ more near-collision frames with a time-to-collision under three seconds while maintaining the overall scene realism.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ronan John, Aditya Kesari, Vincenzo DiMatteo, Kristin Dana</p>
<p>Abstract: We address the challenge of predicting human visual attention during real-world navigation by measuring and modeling egocentric pedestrian eye gaze in an outdoor campus setting. We introduce the EgoCampus dataset, which spans 25 unique outdoor paths over 6 km across a university campus with recordings from more than 80 distinct human pedestrians, resulting in a diverse set of gaze-annotated videos. The system used for collection, Meta's Project Aria glasses, integrates eye tracking, front-facing RGB cameras, inertial sensors, and GPS to provide rich data from the human perspective. Unlike many prior egocentric datasets that focus on indoor tasks or exclude eye gaze information, our work emphasizes visual attention while subjects walk in outdoor campus paths. Using this data, we develop EgoCampusNet, a novel method to predict eye gaze of navigating pedestrians as they move through outdoor environments. Our contributions provide both a new resource for studying real-world attention and a resource for future work in gaze prediction models for navigation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mehmet Yigit Avci, Pedro Borges, Virginia Fernandez, Paul Wright, Mehmet Yigitsoy, Sebastien Ourselin, Jorge Cardoso</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning holds immense promise for transforming medical image analysis, yet its clinical generalization remains profoundly limited. A major barrier is data heterogeneity. This is particularly true in Magnetic Resonance Imaging, where scanner hardware differences, diverse acquisition protocols, and varying sequence parameters introduce substantial domain shifts that obscure underlying biological signals. Data harmonization methods aim to reduce these instrumental and acquisition variability, but existing approaches remain insufficient. When applied to imaging data, image-based harmonization approaches are often restricted by the need for target images, while existing text-guided methods rely on simplistic labels that fail to capture complex acquisition details or are typically restricted to datasets with limited variability, failing to capture the heterogeneity of real-world clinical environments. To address these limitations, we propose DIST-CLIP (Disentangled Style Transfer with CLIP Guidance), a unified framework for MRI harmonization that flexibly uses either target images or DICOM metadata for guidance. Our framework explicitly disentangles anatomical content from image contrast, with the contrast representations being extracted using pre-trained CLIP encoders. These contrast embeddings are then integrated into the anatomical content via a novel Adaptive Style Transfer module. We trained and evaluated DIST-CLIP on diverse real-world clinical datasets, and showed significant improvements in performance when compared against state-of-the-art methods in both style translation fidelity and anatomical preservation, offering a flexible solution for style transfer and standardizing MRI data. Our code and weights will be made publicly available upon publication.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding articulated objects is a fundamental challenge in robotics and digital twin creation. To effectively model such objects, it is essential to recover both part segmentation and the underlying joint parameters. Despite the importance of this task, previous work has largely focused on setups like multi-view systems, object scanning, or static cameras. In this paper, we present the first data-driven approach that jointly predicts part segmentation and joint parameters from monocular video captured with a freely moving camera. Trained solely on synthetic data, our method demonstrates strong generalization to real-world objects, offering a scalable and practical solution for articulated object understanding. Our approach operates directly on casually recorded video, making it suitable for real-time applications in dynamic environments. Project webpage: https://aartykov.github.io/sim2art/</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07702">Guiding What Not to Generate: Automated Negative Prompting for Text-Image Alignment</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sangha Park, Eunji Kim, Yeongtak Oh, Jooyoung Choi, Sungroh Yoon</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite substantial progress in text-to-image generation, achieving precise text-image alignment remains challenging, particularly for prompts with rich compositional structure or imaginative elements. To address this, we introduce Negative Prompting for Image Correction (NPC), an automated pipeline that improves alignment by identifying and applying negative prompts that suppress unintended content. We begin by analyzing cross-attention patterns to explain why both targeted negatives-those directly tied to the prompt's alignment error-and untargeted negatives-tokens unrelated to the prompt but present in the generated image-can enhance alignment. To discover useful negatives, NPC generates candidate prompts using a verifier-captioner-proposer framework and ranks them with a salient text-space score, enabling effective selection without requiring additional image synthesis. On GenEval++ and Imagine-Bench, NPC outperforms strong baselines, achieving 0.571 vs. 0.371 on GenEval++ and the best overall performance on Imagine-Bench. By guiding what not to generate, NPC provides a principled, fully automated route to stronger text-image alignment in diffusion models. Code is released at https://github.com/wiarae/NPC.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leo Fillioux, Enzo Ferrante, Paul-Henry Courn\`ede, Maria Vakalopoulou, Stergios Christodoulidis</p>
<p>Abstract: Large foundation models have emerged in the last years and are pushing performance boundaries for a variety of tasks. Training or even finetuning such models demands vast datasets and computational resources, which are often scarce and costly. Adaptation methods provide a computationally efficient solution to address these limitations by allowing such models to be finetuned on small amounts of data and computing power. This is achieved by appending new trainable modules to frozen backbones with only a fraction of the trainable parameters and fitting only these modules on novel tasks. Recently, the VeRA adapter was shown to excel in parameter-efficient adaptations by utilizing a pair of frozen random low-rank matrices shared across all layers. In this paper, we propose PVeRA, a probabilistic version of the VeRA adapter, which modifies the low-rank matrices of VeRA in a probabilistic manner. This modification naturally allows handling inherent ambiguities in the input and allows for different sampling configurations during training and testing. A comprehensive evaluation was performed on the VTAB-1k benchmark and seven adapters, with PVeRA outperforming VeRA and other adapters. Our code for training models with PVeRA and benchmarking all adapters is available https://github.com/leofillioux/pvera.</p>

<p>Abstract: Animal tracking and pose estimation systems, such as STEP (Simultaneous Tracking and Pose Estimation) and ViTPose, experience substantial performance drops when processing images and videos with cage structures and systematic occlusions. We present a three-stage preprocessing pipeline that addresses this limitation through: (1) cage segmentation using a Gabor-enhanced ResNet-UNet architecture with tunable orientation filters, (2) cage inpainting using CRFill for content-aware reconstruction of occluded regions, and (3) evaluation of pose estimation and tracking on the uncaged frames. Our Gabor-enhanced segmentation model leverages orientation-aware features with 72 directional kernels to accurately identify and segment cage structures that severely impair the performance of existing methods. Experimental validation demonstrates that removing cage occlusions through our pipeline enables pose estimation and tracking performance comparable to that in environments without occlusions. We also observe significant improvements in keypoint detection accuracy and trajectory consistency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fan Yang, Heyuan Li, Peihao Li, Weihao Yuan, Lingteng Qiu, Chaoyue Song, Cheng Chen, Yisheng He, Shifeng Zhang, Xiaoguang Han, Steven Hoi, Guosheng Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating high-fidelity upper-body 3D avatars from one-shot input image remains a significant challenge. Current 3D avatar generation methods, which rely on large reconstruction models, are fast and capable of producing stable body structures, but they often suffer from artifacts such as blurry textures and stiff, unnatural motion. In contrast, generative video models show promising performance by synthesizing photorealistic and dynamic results, but they frequently struggle with unstable behavior, including body structural errors and identity drift. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach that combines the strengths of both paradigms. Our framework employs a 3D reconstruction model to provide robust structural and appearance priors, which in turn guides a real-time autoregressive video diffusion model for rendering. This process enables the model to synthesize high-frequency, photorealistic details and fluid dynamics in real time, effectively reducing texture blur and motion stiffness while preventing the structural inconsistencies common in video generation methods. By uniting the geometric stability of 3D reconstruction with the generative capabilities of video models, our method produces high-fidelity digital avatars with realistic appearance and dynamic, temporally coherent motion. Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces artifacts and achieves substantial improvements in visual quality over leading methods, providing a robust and efficient solution for real-time applications such as gaming and virtual reality.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07729">Improving action classification with brain-inspired deep networks</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Aidas Aglinskas, Stefano Anzellotti</p>
<p>Abstract: Action recognition is also key for applications ranging from robotics to healthcare monitoring. Action information can be extracted from the body pose and movements, as well as from the background scene. However, the extent to which deep neural networks (DNNs) make use of information about the body and information about the background remains unclear. Since these two sources of information may be correlated within a training dataset, DNNs might learn to rely predominantly on one of them, without taking full advantage of the other. Unlike DNNs, humans have domain-specific brain regions selective for perceiving bodies, and regions selective for perceiving scenes. The present work tests whether humans are thus more effective at extracting information from both body and background, and whether building brain-inspired deep network architectures with separate domain-specific streams for body and scene perception endows them with more human-like performance. We first demonstrate that DNNs trained using the HAA500 dataset perform almost as accurately on versions of the stimuli that show both body and background and on versions of the stimuli from which the body was removed, but are at chance-level for versions of the stimuli from which the background was removed. Conversely, human participants (N=28) can recognize the same set of actions accurately with all three versions of the stimuli, and perform significantly better on stimuli that show only the body than on stimuli that show only the background. Finally, we implement and test a novel architecture patterned after domain specificity in the brain with separate streams to process body and background information. We show that 1) this architecture improves action recognition performance, and 2) its accuracy across different versions of the stimuli follows a pattern that matches more closely the pattern of accuracy observed in human participants.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sangha Park, Seungryong Yoo, Jisoo Mok, Sungroh Yoon</p>
<p>Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have advanced substantially, they remain vulnerable to object hallucination caused by language priors and visual information loss. To address this, we propose SAVE (Sparse Autoencoder-Driven Visual Information Enhancement), a framework that mitigates hallucination by steering the model along Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) latent features. A binary object-presence question-answering probe identifies the SAE features most indicative of the model's visual information processing, referred to as visual understanding features. Steering the model along these identified features reinforces grounded visual understanding and effectively reduces hallucination. With its simple design, SAVE outperforms state-of-the-art training-free methods on standard benchmarks, achieving a 10\%p improvement in CHAIR\_S and consistent gains on POPE and MMHal-Bench. Extensive evaluations across multiple models and layers confirm the robustness and generalizability of our approach. Further analysis reveals that steering along visual understanding features suppresses the generation of uncertain object tokens and increases attention to image tokens, mitigating hallucination.

To address the lack of fine-grained reward supervision in longhorizontal reasoning tasks, we propose Geometric Policy Optimization (GeoPO), which introduces tree-structured sampling and step-level reward estimation with geometric consistency constraints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SpatialDreamer delivers highly competitive results across multiple challenging benchmarks, signifying a critical advancement in human-like active spatial mental simulation for MLLMs.</p>

Given a video-question pair, a base multimodal model first generates multiple candidate answers, which are then reranked using a model trained with a novel Masked Pointer Cross-Entropy Loss with Rank Weights. This objective integrates pointer-based candidate selection, rank-dependent weighting, and masked cross-entropy under vocabulary restriction, enabling stable and interpretable listwise optimization. By bridging generative modeling with discriminative ranking, our method produces coherent, fine-grained answer lists.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jialv Zou, Shaoyu Chen, Bencheng Liao, Zhiyu Zheng, Yuehao Song, Lefei Zhang, Qian Zhang, Wenyu Liu, Xinggang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative diffusion models for end-to-end autonomous driving often suffer from mode collapse, tending to generate conservative and homogeneous behaviors. While DiffusionDrive employs predefined anchors representing different driving intentions to partition the action space and generate diverse trajectories, its reliance on imitation learning lacks sufficient constraints, resulting in a dilemma between diversity and consistent high quality. In this work, we propose DiffusionDriveV2, which leverages reinforcement learning to both constrain low-quality modes and explore for superior trajectories. This significantly enhances the overall output quality while preserving the inherent multimodality of its core Gaussian Mixture Model. First, we use scale-adaptive multiplicative noise, ideal for trajectory planning, to promote broad exploration. Second, we employ intra-anchor GRPO to manage advantage estimation among samples generated from a single anchor, and inter-anchor truncated GRPO to incorporate a global perspective across different anchors, preventing improper advantage comparisons between distinct intentions (e.g., turning vs. going straight), which can lead to further mode collapse. DiffusionDriveV2 achieves 91.2 PDMS on the NAVSIM v1 dataset and 85.5 EPDMS on the NAVSIM v2 dataset in closed-loop evaluation with an aligned ResNet-34 backbone, setting a new record. Further experiments validate that our approach resolves the dilemma between diversity and consistent high quality for truncated diffusion models, achieving the best trade-off.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shihao Zhao, Yitong Chen, Zeyinzi Jiang, Bojia Zi, Shaozhe Hao, Yu Liu, Chaojie Mao, Kwan-Yee K. Wong</p>
<p>Abstract: Unified understanding and generation is a highly appealing research direction in multimodal learning. There exist two approaches: one trains a transformer via an auto-regressive paradigm, and the other adopts a two-stage scheme connecting pre-trained understanding and generative models for alignment fine-tuning. The former demands massive data and computing resources unaffordable for ordinary researchers. Though the latter requires a lower training cost, existing works often suffer from limited task coverage or poor generation quality. Both approaches lack the ability to parse input meta-information (such as task type, image resolution, video duration, etc.) and require manual parameter configuration that is tedious and non-intelligent. In this paper, we propose Unison which adopts the two-stage scheme while preserving the capabilities of the pre-trained models well. With an extremely low training cost, we cover a variety of multimodal understanding tasks, including text, image, and video understanding, as well as diverse generation tasks, such as text-to-visual content generation, editing, controllable generation, and IP-based reference generation. We also equip our model with the ability to automatically parse user intentions, determine the target task type, and accurately extract the meta-information required for the corresponding task. This enables full automation of various multimodal tasks without human intervention. Experiments demonstrate that, under a low-cost setting of only 500k training samples and 50 GPU hours, our model can accurately and automatically identify tasks and extract relevant parameters, and achieve superior performance across a variety of understanding and generation tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mayank Anand, Ujair Alam, Surya Prakash, Priya Shukla, Gora Chand Nandi, Domenec Puig</p>
<p>Abstract: Clinical ultrasound acquisition is highly operator-dependent, where rapid probe motion and brightness fluctuations often lead to reconstruction errors that reduce trust and clinical utility. We present UltrasODM, a dual-stream framework that assists sonographers during acquisition through calibrated per-frame uncertainty, saliency-based diagnostics, and actionable prompts. UltrasODM integrates (i) a contrastive ranking module that groups frames by motion similarity, (ii) an optical-flow stream fused with Dual-Mamba temporal modules for robust 6-DoF pose estimation, and (iii) a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) layer combining Bayesian uncertainty, clinician-calibrated thresholds, and saliency maps highlighting regions of low confidence. When uncertainty exceeds the threshold, the system issues unobtrusive alerts suggesting corrective actions such as re-scanning highlighted regions or slowing the sweep. Evaluated on a clinical freehand ultrasound dataset, UltrasODM reduces drift by 15.2%, distance error by 12.1%, and Hausdorff distance by 10.1% relative to UltrasOM, while producing per-frame uncertainty and saliency outputs. By emphasizing transparency and clinician feedback, UltrasODM improves reconstruction reliability and supports safer, more trustworthy clinical workflows.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Menglin Wang, Xiaojin Gong, Jiachen Li, Genlin Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised visible-infrared person re-identification (USVI-ReID) aims to match individuals across visible and infrared cameras without relying on any annotation. Given the significant gap across visible and infrared modality, estimating reliable cross-modality association becomes a major challenge in USVI-ReID. Existing methods usually adopt optimal transport to associate the intra-modality clusters, which is prone to propagating the local cluster errors, and also overlooks global instance-level relations. By mining and attending to the visible-infrared modality bias, this paper focuses on addressing cross-modality learning from two aspects: bias-mitigated global association and modality-invariant representation learning. Motivated by the camera-aware distance rectification in single-modality re-ID, we propose modality-aware Jaccard distance to mitigate the distance bias caused by modality discrepancy, so that more reliable cross-modality associations can be estimated through global clustering. To further improve cross-modality representation learning, a `split-and-contrast' strategy is designed to obtain modality-specific global prototypes. By explicitly aligning these prototypes under global association guidance, modality-invariant yet ID-discriminative representation learning can be achieved. While conceptually simple, our method obtains state-of-the-art performance on benchmark VI-ReID datasets and outperforms existing methods by a significant margin, validating its effectiveness.</p>

<p>Abstract: Monitoring critically endangered western lowland gorillas is currently hampered by the immense manual effort required to re-identify individuals from vast archives of camera trap footage. The primary obstacle to automating this process has been the lack of large-scale, "in-the-wild" video datasets suitable for training robust deep learning models. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark with three novel datasets: Gorilla-SPAC-Wild, the largest video dataset for wild primate re-identification to date; Gorilla-Berlin-Zoo, for assessing cross-domain re-identification generalization; and Gorilla-SPAC-MoT, for evaluating multi-object tracking in camera trap footage. Building on these datasets, we present GorillaWatch, an end-to-end pipeline integrating detection, tracking, and re-identification. To exploit temporal information, we introduce a multi-frame self-supervised pretraining strategy that leverages consistency in tracklets to learn domain-specific features without manual labels. To ensure scientific validity, a differentiable adaptation of AttnLRP verifies that our model relies on discriminative biometric traits rather than background correlations. Extensive benchmarking subsequently demonstrates that aggregating features from large-scale image backbones outperforms specialized video architectures. Finally, we address unsupervised population counting by integrating spatiotemporal constraints into standard clustering to mitigate over-segmentation. We publicly release all code and datasets to facilitate scalable, non-invasive monitoring of endangered species</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sen Ye, Jianning Pei, Mengde Xu, Shuyang Gu, Chunyu Wang, Liwei Wang, Han Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Most visual generative models compress images into a latent space before applying diffusion or autoregressive modelling. Yet, existing approaches such as VAEs and foundation model aligned encoders implicitly constrain the latent space without explicitly shaping its distribution, making it unclear which types of distributions are optimal for modeling. We introduce \textbf{Distribution-Matching VAE} (\textbf{DMVAE}), which explicitly aligns the encoder's latent distribution with an arbitrary reference distribution via a distribution matching constraint. This generalizes beyond the Gaussian prior of conventional VAEs, enabling alignment with distributions derived from self-supervised features, diffusion noise, or other prior distributions. With DMVAE, we can systematically investigate which latent distributions are more conducive to modeling, and we find that SSL-derived distributions provide an excellent balance between reconstruction fidelity and modeling efficiency, reaching gFID equals 3.2 on ImageNet with only 64 training epochs. Our results suggest that choosing a suitable latent distribution structure (achieved via distribution-level alignment), rather than relying on fixed priors, is key to bridging the gap between easy-to-model latents and high-fidelity image synthesis.

<p>Abstract: Storytelling in real-world videos often unfolds through multiple shots -- discontinuous yet semantically connected clips that together convey a coherent narrative. However, existing multi-shot video generation (MSV) methods struggle to effectively model long-range cross-shot context, as they rely on limited temporal windows or single keyframe conditioning, leading to degraded performance under complex narratives. In this work, we propose OneStory, enabling global yet compact cross-shot context modeling for consistent and scalable narrative generation. OneStory reformulates MSV as a next-shot generation task, enabling autoregressive shot synthesis while leveraging pretrained image-to-video (I2V) models for strong visual conditioning. We introduce two key modules: a Frame Selection module that constructs a semantically-relevant global memory based on informative frames from prior shots, and an Adaptive Conditioner that performs importance-guided patchification to generate compact context for direct conditioning. We further curate a high-quality multi-shot dataset with referential captions to mirror real-world storytelling patterns, and design effective training strategies under the next-shot paradigm. Finetuned from a pretrained I2V model on our curated 60K dataset, OneStory achieves state-of-the-art narrative coherence across diverse and complex scenes in both text- and image-conditioned settings, enabling controllable and immersive long-form video storytelling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gyeongjin Kang, Seungkwon Yang, Seungtae Nam, Younggeun Lee, Jungwoo Kim, Eunbyung Park</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose Multi-view Pyramid Transformer (MVP), a scalable multi-view transformer architecture that directly reconstructs large 3D scenes from tens to hundreds of images in a single forward pass. Drawing on the idea of ``looking broader to see the whole, looking finer to see the details," MVP is built on two core design principles: 1) a local-to-global inter-view hierarchy that gradually broadens the model's perspective from local views to groups and ultimately the full scene, and 2) a fine-to-coarse intra-view hierarchy that starts from detailed spatial representations and progressively aggregates them into compact, information-dense tokens. This dual hierarchy achieves both computational efficiency and representational richness, enabling fast reconstruction of large and complex scenes. We validate MVP on diverse datasets and show that, when coupled with 3D Gaussian Splatting as the underlying 3D representation, it achieves state-of-the-art generalizable reconstruction quality while maintaining high efficiency and scalability across a wide range of view configurations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shai Krakovsky, Gal Fiebelman, Sagie Benaim, Hadar Averbuch-Elor</p>
<p>Abstract: Embedding a language field in a 3D representation enables richer semantic understanding of spatial environments by linking geometry with descriptive meaning. This allows for a more intuitive human-computer interaction, enabling querying or editing scenes using natural language, and could potentially improve tasks like scene retrieval, navigation, and multimodal reasoning. While such capabilities could be transformative, in particular for large-scale scenes, we find that recent feature distillation approaches cannot effectively learn over massive Internet data due to challenges in semantic feature misalignment and inefficiency in memory and runtime. To this end, we propose a novel approach to address these challenges. First, we introduce extremely low-dimensional semantic bottleneck features as part of the underlying 3D Gaussian representation. These are processed by rendering and passing them through a multi-resolution, feature-based, hash encoder. This significantly improves efficiency both in runtime and GPU memory. Second, we introduce an Attenuated Downsampler module and propose several regularizations addressing the semantic misalignment of ground truth 2D features. We evaluate our method on the in-the-wild HolyScenes dataset and demonstrate that it surpasses existing approaches in both performance and efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaoheng Fang, Hanwen Jiang, Yunpeng Bai, Niloy J. Mitra, Qixing Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent video generators achieve striking photorealism, yet remain fundamentally inconsistent in 3D. We present WorldReel, a 4D video generator that is natively spatio-temporally consistent. WorldReel jointly produces RGB frames together with 4D scene representations, including pointmaps, camera trajectory, and dense flow mapping, enabling coherent geometry and appearance modeling over time. Our explicit 4D representation enforces a single underlying scene that persists across viewpoints and dynamic content, yielding videos that remain consistent even under large non-rigid motion and significant camera movement. We train WorldReel by carefully combining synthetic and real data: synthetic data providing precise 4D supervision (geometry, motion, and camera), while real videos contribute visual diversity and realism. This blend allows WorldReel to generalize to in-the-wild footage while preserving strong geometric fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WorldReel sets a new state-of-the-art for consistent video generation with dynamic scenes and moving cameras, improving metrics of geometric consistency, motion coherence, and reducing view-time artifacts over competing methods. We believe that WorldReel brings video generation closer to 4D-consistent world modeling, where agents can render, interact, and reason about scenes through a single and stable spatiotemporal representation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyang He, Jie Wang, Jiangning Zhang, Zhucun Xue, Xingyuan Bu, Qiangpeng Yang, Shilei Wen, Lei Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: The quality and diversity of instruction-based image editing datasets are continuously increasing, yet large-scale, high-quality datasets for instruction-based video editing remain scarce. To address this gap, we introduce OpenVE-3M, an open-source, large-scale, and high-quality dataset for instruction-based video editing. It comprises two primary categories: spatially-aligned edits (Global Style, Background Change, Local Change, Local Remove, Local Add, and Subtitles Edit) and non-spatially-aligned edits (Camera Multi-Shot Edit and Creative Edit). All edit types are generated via a meticulously designed data pipeline with rigorous quality filtering. OpenVE-3M surpasses existing open-source datasets in terms of scale, diversity of edit types, instruction length, and overall quality. Furthermore, to address the lack of a unified benchmark in the field, we construct OpenVE-Bench, containing 431 video-edit pairs that cover a diverse range of editing tasks with three key metrics highly aligned with human judgment. We present OpenVE-Edit, a 5B model trained on our dataset that demonstrates remarkable efficiency and effectiveness by setting a new state-of-the-art on OpenVE-Bench, outperforming all prior open-source models including a 14B baseline.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07829">One Layer Is Enough: Adapting Pretrained Visual Encoders for Image Generation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuan Gao, Chen Chen, Tianrong Chen, Jiatao Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual generative models (e.g., diffusion models) typically operate in compressed latent spaces to balance training efficiency and sample quality. In parallel, there has been growing interest in leveraging high-quality pre-trained visual representations, either by aligning them inside VAEs or directly within the generative model. However, adapting such representations remains challenging due to fundamental mismatches between understanding-oriented features and generation-friendly latent spaces. Representation encoders benefit from high-dimensional latents that capture diverse hypotheses for masked regions, whereas generative models favor low-dimensional latents that must faithfully preserve injected noise. This discrepancy has led prior work to rely on complex objectives and architectures. In this work, we propose FAE (Feature Auto-Encoder), a simple yet effective framework that adapts pre-trained visual representations into low-dimensional latents suitable for generation using as little as a single attention layer, while retaining sufficient information for both reconstruction and understanding. The key is to couple two separate deep decoders: one trained to reconstruct the original feature space, and a second that takes the reconstructed features as input for image generation. FAE is generic; it can be instantiated with a variety of self-supervised encoders (e.g., DINO, SigLIP) and plugged into two distinct generative families: diffusion models and normalizing flows. Across class-conditional and text-to-image benchmarks, FAE achieves strong performance. For example, on ImageNet 256x256, our diffusion model with CFG attains a near state-of-the-art FID of 1.29 (800 epochs) and 1.70 (80 epochs). Without CFG, FAE reaches the state-of-the-art FID of 1.48 (800 epochs) and 2.08 (80 epochs), demonstrating both high quality and fast learning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent video generation models demonstrate impressive synthesis capabilities but remain limited by single-modality conditioning, constraining their holistic world understanding. This stems from insufficient cross-modal interaction and limited modal diversity for comprehensive world knowledge representation. To address these limitations, we introduce UnityVideo, a unified framework for world-aware video generation that jointly learns across multiple modalities (segmentation masks, human skeletons, DensePose, optical flow, and depth maps) and training paradigms. Our approach features two core components: (1) dynamic noising to unify heterogeneous training paradigms, and (2) a modality switcher with an in-context learner that enables unified processing via modular parameters and contextual learning. We contribute a large-scale unified dataset with 1.3M samples. Through joint optimization, UnityVideo accelerates convergence and significantly enhances zero-shot generalization to unseen data. We demonstrate that UnityVideo achieves superior video quality, consistency, and improved alignment with physical world constraints.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thao Nguyen, Sicheng Mo, Krishna Kumar Singh, Yilin Wang, Jing Shi, Nicholas Kolkin, Eli Shechtman, Yong Jae Lee, Yuheng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Humans do not just see attribute similarity -- we also see relational similarity. An apple is like a peach because both are reddish fruit, but the Earth is also like a peach: its crust, mantle, and core correspond to the peach's skin, flesh, and pit. This ability to perceive and recognize relational similarity, is arguable by cognitive scientist to be what distinguishes humans from other species. Yet, all widely used visual similarity metrics today (e.g., LPIPS, CLIP, DINO) focus solely on perceptual attribute similarity and fail to capture the rich, often surprising relational similarities that humans perceive. How can we go beyond the visible content of an image to capture its relational properties? How can we bring images with the same relational logic closer together in representation space? To answer these questions, we first formulate relational image similarity as a measurable problem: two images are relationally similar when their internal relations or functions among visual elements correspond, even if their visual attributes differ. We then curate 114k image-caption dataset in which the captions are anonymized -- describing the underlying relational logic of the scene rather than its surface content. Using this dataset, we finetune a Vision-Language model to measure the relational similarity between images. This model serves as the first step toward connecting images by their underlying relational structure rather than their visible appearance. Our study shows that while relational similarity has a lot of real-world applications, existing image similarity models fail to capture it -- revealing a critical gap in visual computing.</p>

<p>Abstract: Voxel art is a distinctive stylization widely used in games and digital media, yet automated generation from 3D meshes remains challenging due to conflicting requirements of geometric abstraction, semantic preservation, and discrete color coherence. Existing methods either over-simplify geometry or fail to achieve the pixel-precise, palette-constrained aesthetics of voxel art. We introduce Voxify3D, a differentiable two-stage framework bridging 3D mesh optimization with 2D pixel art supervision. Our core innovation lies in the synergistic integration of three components: (1) orthographic pixel art supervision that eliminates perspective distortion for precise voxel-pixel alignment; (2) patch-based CLIP alignment that preserves semantics across discretization levels; (3) palette-constrained Gumbel-Softmax quantization enabling differentiable optimization over discrete color spaces with controllable palette strategies. This integration addresses fundamental challenges: semantic preservation under extreme discretization, pixel-art aesthetics through volumetric rendering, and end-to-end discrete optimization. Experiments show superior performance (37.12 CLIP-IQA, 77.90\% user preference) across diverse characters and controllable abstraction (2-8 colors, 20x-50x resolutions).

<p>Abstract: Temporal single-photon (TSP-) LiDAR presents a promising solution for imaging-free target recognition over long distances with reduced size, cost, and power consumption. However, existing TSP-LiDAR approaches are ineffective in handling open-set scenarios where unknown targets emerge, and they suffer significant performance degradation under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and short acquisition times (fewer photons). Here, inspired by semantic communication, we propose a semantic TSP-LiDAR based on a self-updating semantic knowledge base (SKB), in which the target recognition processing of TSP-LiDAR is formulated as a semantic communication. The results, both simulation and experiment, demonstrate that our approach surpasses conventional methods, particularly under challenging conditions of low SNR and limited acquisition time. More importantly, our self-updating SKB mechanism can dynamically update the semantic features of newly encountered targets in the SKB, enabling continuous adaptation without the need for extensive retraining of the neural network. In fact, a recognition accuracy of 89% is achieved on nine types of unknown targets in real-world experiments, compared to 66% without the updating mechanism. These findings highlight the potential of our framework for adaptive and robust target recognition in complex and dynamic environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hochul Hwang, Soowan Yang, Jahir Sadik Monon, Nicholas A Giudice, Sunghoon Ivan Lee, Joydeep Biswas, Donghyun Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: While commendable progress has been made in user-centric research on mobile assistive systems for blind and low-vision (BLV) individuals, references that directly inform robot navigation design remain rare. To bridge this gap, we conducted a comprehensive human study involving interviews with 26 guide dog handlers, four white cane users, nine guide dog trainers, and one O\&M trainer, along with 15+ hours of observing guide dog-assisted walking. After de-identification, we open-sourced the dataset to promote human-centered development and informed decision-making for assistive systems for BLV people. Building on insights from this formative study, we developed GuideNav, a vision-only, teach-and-repeat navigation system. Inspired by how guide dogs are trained and assist their handlers, GuideNav autonomously repeats a path demonstrated by a sighted person using a robot. Specifically, the system constructs a topological representation of the taught route, integrates visual place recognition with temporal filtering, and employs a relative pose estimator to compute navigation actions - all without relying on costly, heavy, power-hungry sensors such as LiDAR. In field tests, GuideNav consistently achieved kilometer-scale route following across five outdoor environments, maintaining reliability despite noticeable scene variations between teach and repeat runs. A user study with 3 guide dog handlers and 1 guide dog trainer further confirmed the system's feasibility, marking (to our knowledge) the first demonstration of a quadruped mobile system retrieving a path in a manner comparable to guide dogs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaojun Jia, Jie Liao, Qi Guo, Teng Ma, Simeng Qin, Ranjie Duan, Tianlin Li, Yihao Huang, Zhitao Zeng, Dongxian Wu, Yiming Li, Wenqi Ren, Xiaochun Cao, Yang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled unified perception-reasoning capabilities, yet these systems remain highly vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that bypass safety alignment and induce harmful behaviors. Existing benchmarks such as JailBreakV-28K, MM-SafetyBench, and HADES provide valuable insights into multi-modal vulnerabilities, but they typically focus on limited attack scenarios, lack standardized defense evaluation, and offer no unified, reproducible toolbox. To address these gaps, we introduce OmniSafeBench-MM, which is a comprehensive toolbox for multi-modal jailbreak attack-defense evaluation. OmniSafeBench-MM integrates 13 representative attack methods, 15 defense strategies, and a diverse dataset spanning 9 major risk domains and 50 fine-grained categories, structured across consultative, imperative, and declarative inquiry types to reflect realistic user intentions. Beyond data coverage, it establishes a three-dimensional evaluation protocol measuring (1) harmfulness, distinguished by a granular, multi-level scale ranging from low-impact individual harm to catastrophic societal threats, (2) intent alignment between responses and queries, and (3) response detail level, enabling nuanced safety-utility analysis. We conduct extensive experiments on 10 open-source and 8 closed-source MLLMs to reveal their vulnerability to multi-modal jailbreak. By unifying data, methodology, and evaluation into an open-source, reproducible platform, OmniSafeBench-MM provides a standardized foundation for future research.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tongda Xu, Wendi Zheng, Jiajun He, Jose Miguel Hernandez-Lobato, Yan Wang, Ya-Qin Zhang, Jie Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Vector quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE) is a discrete auto-encoder that compresses images into discrete tokens. It is difficult to train due to discretization. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective technique, dubbed Gaussian Quant (GQ), that converts a Gaussian VAE with certain constraint into a VQ-VAE without training. GQ generates random Gaussian noise as a codebook and finds the closest noise to the posterior mean. Theoretically, we prove that when the logarithm of the codebook size exceeds the bits-back coding rate of the Gaussian VAE, a small quantization error is guaranteed. Practically, we propose a heuristic to train Gaussian VAE for effective GQ, named target divergence constraint (TDC). Empirically, we show that GQ outperforms previous VQ-VAEs, such as VQGAN, FSQ, LFQ, and BSQ, on both UNet and ViT architectures. Furthermore, TDC also improves upon previous Gaussian VAE discretization methods, such as TokenBridge. The source code is provided in https://github.com/tongdaxu/VQ-VAE-from-Gaussian-VAE.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruicheng Zhang, Mingyang Zhang, Jun Zhou, Zhangrui Guo, Xiaofan Liu, Zunnan Xu, Zhizhou Zhong, Puxin Yan, Haocheng Luo, Xiu Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Embodied imitation learning is constrained by the scarcity of diverse, long-horizon robotic manipulation data. Existing video generation models for this domain are limited to synthesizing short clips of simple actions and often rely on manually defined trajectories. To this end, we introduce MIND-V, a hierarchical framework designed to synthesize physically plausible and logically coherent videos of long-horizon robotic manipulation. Inspired by cognitive science, MIND-V bridges high-level reasoning with pixel-level synthesis through three core components: a Semantic Reasoning Hub (SRH) that leverages a pre-trained vision-language model for task planning; a Behavioral Semantic Bridge (BSB) that translates abstract instructions into domain-invariant representations; and a Motor Video Generator (MVG) for conditional video rendering. MIND-V employs Staged Visual Future Rollouts, a test-time optimization strategy to enhance long-horizon robustness. To align the generated videos with physical laws, we introduce a GRPO reinforcement learning post-training phase guided by a novel Physical Foresight Coherence (PFC) reward. PFC leverages the V-JEPA world model to enforce physical plausibility by aligning the predicted and actual dynamic evolutions in the feature space. MIND-V demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in long-horizon robotic manipulation video generation, establishing a scalable and controllable paradigm for embodied data synthesis.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06648">Financial Fraud Identification and Interpretability Study for Listed Companies Based on Convolutional Neural Network</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiao Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Since the emergence of joint-stock companies, financial fraud by listed firms has repeatedly undermined capital markets. Fraud is difficult to detect because of covert tactics and the high labor and time costs of audits. Traditional statistical models are interpretable but struggle with nonlinear feature interactions, while machine learning models are powerful but often opaque. In addition, most existing methods judge fraud only for the current year based on current year data, limiting timeliness.
  This paper proposes a financial fraud detection framework for Chinese A-share listed companies based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We design a feature engineering scheme that transforms firm-year panel data into image like representations, enabling the CNN to capture cross-sectional and temporal patterns and to predict fraud in advance. Experiments show that the CNN outperforms logistic regression and LightGBM in accuracy, robustness, and early-warning performance, and that proper tuning of the classification threshold is crucial in high-risk settings.
  To address interpretability, we analyze the model along the dimensions of entity, feature, and time using local explanation techniques. We find that solvency, ratio structure, governance structure, and internal control are general predictors of fraud, while environmental indicators matter mainly in high-pollution industries. Non-fraud firms share stable feature patterns, whereas fraud firms exhibit heterogeneous patterns concentrated in short time windows. A case study of Guanong Shares in 2022 shows that cash flow analysis, social responsibility, governance structure, and per-share indicators are the main drivers of the model's fraud prediction, consistent with the company's documented misconduct.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Camellia Zakaria, Aryan Sadeghi, Weaam Jaafar, Junshi Xu, Alex Mariakakis, Marianne Hatzopoulou</p>
<p>Abstract: Black carbon (BC) emissions in urban areas are primarily driven by traffic, with hotspots near major roads disproportionately affecting marginalized communities. Because BC monitoring is typically performed using costly and specialized instruments. there is little to no available data on BC from local traffic sources that could help inform policy interventions targeting local factors. By contrast, traffic monitoring systems are widely deployed in cities around the world, highlighting the imbalance between what we know about traffic conditions and what do not know about their environmental consequences. To bridge this gap, we propose a machine learning-driven system that extracts visual information from traffic video to capture vehicles behaviors and conditions. Combining these features with weather data, our model estimates BC at street level, achieving an R-squared value of 0.72 and RMSE of 129.42 ng/m3 (nanogram per cubic meter). From a sustainability perspective, this work leverages resources already supported by urban infrastructure and established modeling techniques to generate information relevant to traffic emission. Obtaining BC concentration data provides actionable insights to support pollution reduction, urban planning, public health, and environmental justice at the local municipal level.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper studies the robustness of feature attribution methods for deep neural networks. It challenges the current notion of attributional robustness that largely ignores the difference in the model's outputs and introduces a new way of evaluating the robustness of attribution methods. Specifically, we propose a new definition of similar inputs, a new robustness metric, and a novel method based on generative adversarial networks to generate these inputs. In addition, we present a comprehensive evaluation with existing metrics and state-of-the-art attribution methods. Our findings highlight the need for a more objective metric that reveals the weaknesses of an attribution method rather than that of the neural network, thus providing a more accurate evaluation of the robustness of attribution methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lin Yang, Xiang Li, Xin Ma, Xinxin Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Patients with motor dysfunction show low subjective engagement in rehabilitation training. Traditional SSVEP-based brain-computer interface (BCI) systems rely heavily on external visual stimulus equipment, limiting their practicality in real-world settings. This study proposes an augmented reality steady-state visually evoked potential (AR-SSVEP) system to address the lack of patient initiative and the high workload on therapists. Firstly, we design four HoloLens 2-based EEG classes and collect EEG data from seven healthy subjects for analysis. Secondly, we build upon the conventional CNN-BiLSTM architecture by integrating a multi-head attention mechanism (MACNN-BiLSTM). We extract ten temporal-spectral EEG features and feed them into a CNN to learn high-level representations. Then, we use BiLSTM to model sequential dependencies and apply a multi-head attention mechanism to highlight motor-intention-related patterns. Finally, the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) method is applied to visualize EEG feature contributions to the neural network's decision-making process, enhancing the model's interpretability. These findings enhance real-time motor intention recognition and support recovery in patients with motor impairments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikhil Verma, Joonas Linnosmaa, Espinosa-Leal Leonardo, Napat Vajragupta</p>
<p>Abstract: The paper presents the formulation, implementation, and evaluation of the ArcGD optimiser. The evaluation is conducted initially on a non-convex benchmark function and subsequently on a real-world ML dataset. The initial comparative study using the Adam optimiser is conducted on a stochastic variant of the highly non-convex and notoriously challenging Rosenbrock function, renowned for its narrow, curved valley, across dimensions ranging from 2D to 1000D and an extreme case of 50,000D. Two configurations were evaluated to eliminate learning-rate bias: (i) both using ArcGD's effective learning rate and (ii) both using Adam's default learning rate. ArcGD consistently outperformed Adam under the first setting and, although slower under the second, achieved super ior final solutions in most cases. In the second evaluation, ArcGD is evaluated against state-of-the-art optimizers (Adam, AdamW, Lion, SGD) on the CIFAR-10 image classification dataset across 8 diverse MLP architectures ranging from 1 to 5 hidden layers. ArcGD achieved the highest average test accuracy (50.7%) at 20,000 iterations, outperforming AdamW (46.6%), Adam (46.8%), SGD (49.6%), and Lion (43.4%), winning or tying on 6 of 8 architectures. Notably, while Adam and AdamW showed strong early convergence at 5,000 iterations, but regressed with extended training, whereas ArcGD continued improving, demonstrating generalization and resistance to overfitting without requiring early stopping tuning. Strong performance on geometric stress tests and standard deep-learning benchmarks indicates broad applicability, highlighting the need for further exploration. Moreover, it is also shown that a variant of ArcGD can be interpreted as a special case of the Lion optimiser, highlighting connections between the inherent mechanisms of such optimisation methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sepyan Purnama Kristanto, Lutfi Hakim,  Hermansyah</p>
<p>Abstract: Evidence from many low and middle income regions shows that microbial contamination in small scale drinking water systems often fluctuates rapidly, yet existing monitoring tools capture only fragments of this behaviour. Microscopic imaging provides organism level visibility, whereas physicochemical sensors reveal shortterm changes in water chemistry; in practice, operators must interpret these streams separately, making realtime decision-making unreliable. This study introduces AquaFusionNet, a lightweight cross-modal framework that unifies both information sources inside a single edge deployable model. Unlike prior work that treats microscopic detection and water quality prediction as independent tasks, AquaFusionNet learns the statistical dependencies between microbial appearance and concurrent sensor dynamics through a gated crossattention mechanism designed specifically for lowpower hardware. The framework is trained on AquaMicro12K, a new dataset comprising 12,846 annotated 1000 micrographs curated for drinking water contexts, an area where publicly accessible microscopic datasets are scarce. Deployed for six months across seven facilities in East Java, Indonesia, the system processed 1.84 million frames and consistently detected contamination events with 94.8% mAP@0.5 and 96.3% anomaly prediction accuracy, while operating at 4.8 W on a Jetson Nano. Comparative experiments against representative lightweight detectors show that AquaFusionNet provides higher accuracy at comparable or lower power, and field results indicate that cross-modal coupling reduces common failure modes of unimodal detectors, particularly under fouling, turbidity spikes, and inconsistent illumination. All models, data, and hardware designs are released openly to facilitate replication and adaptation in decentralized water safety infrastructures.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reliable incremental estimation of camera poses and 3D reconstruction is key to enable various applications including robotics, interactive visualization, and augmented reality. However, this task is particularly challenging in dynamic natural environments, where scene dynamics can severely deteriorate camera pose estimation accuracy. In this work, we propose a novel monocular visual SLAM system that can robustly estimate camera poses in dynamic scenes. To this end, we leverage the complementary strengths of geometric patch-based online bundle adjustment and recent feed-forward reconstruction models. Specifically, we propose a feed-forward reconstruction model to precisely filter out dynamic regions, while also utilizing its depth prediction to enhance the robustness of the patch-based visual SLAM. By aligning depth prediction with estimated patches from bundle adjustment, we robustly handle the inherent scale ambiguities of the batch-wise application of the feed-forward reconstruction model.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generalization in robot manipulation is essential for deploying robots in open-world environments and advancing toward artificial general intelligence. While recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models leverage large pre-trained understanding models for perception and instruction following, their ability to generalize to novel tasks, objects, and settings remains limited. In this work, we present VideoVLA, a simple approach that explores the potential of transforming large video generation models into robotic VLA manipulators. Given a language instruction and an image, VideoVLA predicts an action sequence as well as the future visual outcomes. Built on a multi-modal Diffusion Transformer, VideoVLA jointly models video, language, and action modalities, using pre-trained video generative models for joint visual and action forecasting. Our experiments show that high-quality imagined futures correlate with reliable action predictions and task success, highlighting the importance of visual imagination in manipulation. VideoVLA demonstrates strong generalization, including imitating other embodiments' skills and handling novel objects. This dual-prediction strategy - forecasting both actions and their visual consequences - explores a paradigm shift in robot learning and unlocks generalization capabilities in manipulation systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Currently, there is a noticeable lack of AI in the medical field to support doctors in treating heterogenous brain tumors such as Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM), the deadliest human cancer in the world with a five-year survival rate of just 5.1%. This project develops an AI system offering the only end-to-end solution by aiding doctors with both diagnosis and treatment planning. In the diagnosis phase, a sequential decision-making framework consisting of 4 classification models (Convolutional Neural Networks and Support Vector Machine) are used. Each model progressively classifies the patient's brain into increasingly specific categories, with the final step being named diagnosis. For treatment planning, an RL system consisting of 3 generative models is used. First, the resection model (diffusion model) analyzes the diagnosed GBM MRI and predicts a possible resection outcome. Second, the radiotherapy model (Spatio-Temporal Vision Transformer) generates an MRI of the brain's progression after a user-defined number of weeks. Third, the chemotherapy model (Diffusion Model) produces the post-treatment MRI. A survival rate calculator (Convolutional Neural Network) then checks if the generated post treatment MRI has a survival rate within 15% of the user defined target. If not, a feedback loop using proximal policy optimization iterates over this system until an optimal resection location is identified. When compared to existing solutions, this project found 3 key findings: (1) Using a sequential decision-making framework consisting of 4 small diagnostic models reduced computing costs by 22.28x, (2) Transformers regression capabilities decreased tumor progression inference time by 113 hours, and (3) Applying Augmentations resembling Real-life situations improved overall DICE scores by 2.9%. These results project to increase survival rates by 0.9%, potentially saving approximately 2,250 lives.</p>

<p>Abstract: Complex biological networks are fundamental to biomedical science, capturing interactions among molecules, cells, genes, and tissues. Deciphering these networks is critical for understanding health and disease, yet their scale and complexity represent a daunting challenge for current computational methods. Traditional biological network analysis methods, including deep learning approaches, while powerful, face inherent challenges such as limited scalability, oversmoothing long-range dependencies, difficulty in multimodal integration, expressivity bounds, and poor interpretability. We present Graph2Image, a framework that transforms large biological networks into sets of two-dimensional images by spatially arranging representative network nodes on a 2D grid. This transformation decouples the nodes as images, enabling the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with global receptive fields and multi-scale pyramids, thus overcoming limitations of existing biological network analysis methods in scalability, memory efficiency, and long-range context capture. Graph2Image also facilitates seamless integration with other imaging and omics modalities and enhances interpretability through direct visualization of node-associated images. When applied to several large-scale biological network datasets, Graph2Image improved classification accuracy by up to 67.2% over existing methods and provided interpretable visualizations that revealed biologically coherent patterns. It also allows analysis of very large biological networks (nodes > 1 billion) on a personal computer. Graph2Image thus provides a scalable, interpretable, and multimodal-ready approach for biological network analysis, offering new opportunities for disease diagnosis and the study of complex biological systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has emerged as a pivotal direction in the field of autonomous systems. Recent works have demonstrated impressive performance by incorporating high-level guidance signals to steer low-level trajectory planners. However, their potential is often constrained by inaccurate high-level guidance and the computational overhead of complex guidance modules. To address these limitations, we propose Mimir, a novel hierarchical dual-system framework capable of generating robust trajectories relying on goal points with uncertainty estimation: (1) Unlike previous approaches that deterministically model, we estimate goal point uncertainty with a Laplace distribution to enhance robustness; (2) To overcome the slow inference speed of the guidance system, we introduce a multi-rate guidance mechanism that predicts extended goal points in advance. Validated on challenging Navhard and Navtest benchmarks, Mimir surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods with a 20% improvement in the driving score EPDMS, while achieving 1.6 times improvement in high-level module inference speed without compromising accuracy. The code and models will be released soon to promote reproducibility and further development. The code is available at https://github.com/ZebinX/Mimir-Uncertainty-Driving</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nithin Sivakumaran, Justin Chih-Yao Chen, David Wan, Yue Zhang, Jaehong Yoon, Elias Stengel-Eskin, Mohit Bansal</p>
<p>Abstract: Specialized visual tools can augment large language models or vision language models with expert knowledge (e.g., grounding, spatial reasoning, medical knowledge, etc.), but knowing which tools to call (and when to call them) can be challenging. We introduce DART, a multi-agent framework that uses disagreements between multiple debating visual agents to identify useful visual tools (e.g., object detection, OCR, spatial reasoning, etc.) that can resolve inter-agent disagreement. These tools allow for fruitful multi-agent discussion by introducing new information, and by providing tool-aligned agreement scores that highlight agents in agreement with expert tools, thereby facilitating discussion. We utilize an aggregator agent to select the best answer by providing the agent outputs and tool information. We test DART on four diverse benchmarks and show that our approach improves over multi-agent debate as well as over single agent tool-calling frameworks, beating the next-strongest baseline (multi-agent debate with a judge model) by 3.4% and 2.4% on A-OKVQA and MMMU respectively. We also find that DART adapts well to new tools in applied domains, with a 1.3% improvement on the M3D medical dataset over other strong tool-calling, single agent, and multi-agent baselines. Additionally, we measure text overlap across rounds to highlight the rich discussion in DART compared to existing multi-agent methods. Finally, we study the tool call distribution, finding that diverse tools are reliably used to help resolve disagreement.</p>

However, state-of-the-art methods of drawing these tickets, like Lottery Ticket Rewinding (LTR), are computationally prohibitive, while more efficient saliency-based Pruning-at-Initialization (PaI) techniques suffer from a significant accuracy-sparsity trade-off and fail basic sanity checks. In this work, we argue that PaI's reliance on first-order saliency metrics, which ignore inter-weight dependencies, contributes substantially to this performance gap, especially in the sparse regime. To address this, we introduce Concrete Ticket Search (CTS), an algorithm that frames subnetwork discovery as a holistic combinatorial optimization problem. By leveraging a Concrete relaxation of the discrete search space and a novel gradient balancing scheme (GRADBALANCE) to control sparsity, CTS efficiently identifies high-performing subnetworks near initialization without requiring sensitive hyperparameter tuning. Motivated by recent works on lottery ticket training dynamics, we further propose a knowledge distillation-inspired family of pruning objectives, finding that minimizing the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence between sparse and dense network outputs (CTS-KL) is particularly effective. Experiments on varying image classification tasks show that CTS produces subnetworks that robustly pass sanity checks and achieve accuracy comparable to or exceeding LTR, while requiring only a small fraction of the computation. For example, on ResNet-20 on CIFAR10, it reaches 99.3% sparsity with 74.0% accuracy in 7.9 minutes, while LTR attains the same sparsity with 68.3% accuracy in 95.2 minutes. CTS's subnetworks outperform saliency-based methods across all sparsities, but its advantage over LTR is most pronounced in the highly sparse regime.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonghyun Park, Jong Chul Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep generative models have become powerful priors for solving inverse problems, and various training-free methods have been developed. However, when applied to latent flow models, existing methods often fail to converge to the posterior mode or suffer from manifold deviation within latent spaces. To mitigate this, here we introduce a novel training-free framework, FlowLPS, that solves inverse problems with pretrained flow models via a Langevin Proximal Sampling (LPS) strategy. Our method integrates Langevin dynamics for manifold-consistent exploration with proximal optimization for precise mode seeking, achieving a superior balance between reconstruction fidelity and perceptual quality across multiple inverse tasks on FFHQ and DIV2K, outperforming state of the art inverse solvers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyi Ren, Daniel Low, Pittra Jaengprajak, Juampablo Heras Rivera, Jacob Ruzevick, Mehmet Kurt</p>
<p>Abstract: Segmentation is the identification of anatomical regions of interest, such as organs, tissue, and lesions, serving as a fundamental task in computer-aided diagnosis in medical imaging. Although deep learning models have achieved remarkable performance in medical image segmentation, the need for explainability remains critical for ensuring their acceptance and integration in clinical practice, despite the growing research attention in this area. Our approach explored the use of contrast-level Shapley values, a systematic perturbation of model inputs to assess feature importance. While other studies have investigated gradient-based techniques through identifying influential regions in imaging inputs, Shapley values offer a broader, clinically aligned approach, explaining how model performance is fairly attributed to certain imaging contrasts over others. Using the BraTS 2024 dataset, we generated rankings for Shapley values for four MRI contrasts across four model architectures. Two metrics were proposed from the Shapley ranking: agreement between model and ``clinician" imaging ranking, and uncertainty quantified through Shapley ranking variance across cross-validation folds. Higher-performing cases (Dice \textgreater0.6) showed significantly greater agreement with clinical rankings. Increased Shapley ranking variance correlated with decreased performance (U-Net: $r=-0.581$). These metrics provide clinically interpretable proxies for model reliability, helping clinicians better understand state-of-the-art segmentation models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tharindu Wickremasinghe, Marco F. Duarte</p>
<p>Abstract: Image tile-based approaches are popular in many image processing applications such as denoising (e.g., non-local means). A key step in their use is grouping the images into clusters, which usually proceeds iteratively splitting the images into clusters and fitting a model for the images in each cluster. Linear subspaces have emerged as a suitable model for tile clusters; however, they are not well matched to images patches given that images are non-negative and thus not distributed around the origin in the tile vector space. We study the use of affine subspace models for the clusters to better match the geometric structure of the image tile vector space. We also present a simple denoising algorithm that relies on the affine subspace clustering model using least squares projection. We review several algorithmic approaches to solve the affine subspace clustering problem and show experimental results that highlight the performance improvements in clustering and denoising.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexandre Rocchi--Henry, Thomas Fel, Gianni Franchi</p>
<p>Abstract: Two traditions of interpretability have evolved side by side but seldom spoken to each other: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs), which prescribe what a concept should be, and Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), which discover what concepts emerge. While CBMs use supervision to align activations with human-labeled concepts, SAEs rely on sparse coding to uncover emergent ones. We show that both paradigms instantiate the same geometric structure: each learns a set of linear directions in activation space whose nonnegative combinations form a concept cone. Supervised and unsupervised methods thus differ not in kind but in how they select this cone. Building on this view, we propose an operational bridge between the two paradigms. CBMs provide human-defined reference geometries, while SAEs can be evaluated by how well their learned cones approximate or contain those of CBMs. This containment framework yields quantitative metrics linking inductive biases -- such as SAE type, sparsity, or expansion ratio -- to emergence of plausible\footnote{We adopt the terminology of \citet{jacovi2020towards}, who distinguish between faithful explanations (accurately reflecting model computations) and plausible explanations (aligning with human intuition and domain knowledge). CBM concepts are plausible by construction -- selected or annotated by humans -- though not necessarily faithful to the true latent factors that organise the data manifold.} concepts. Using these metrics, we uncover a ``sweet spot'' in both sparsity and expansion factor that maximizes both geometric and semantic alignment with CBM concepts. Overall, our work unifies supervised and unsupervised concept discovery through a shared geometric framework, providing principled metrics to measure SAE progress and assess how well discovered concept align with plausible human concepts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gilhyun Nam, Taewon Kim, Joonhyun Jeong, Eunho Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) enables efficient adaptation of deployed models, yet it often leads to poorly calibrated predictive uncertainty - a critical issue in high-stakes domains such as autonomous driving, finance, and healthcare. Existing calibration methods typically assume fixed models or static distributions, resulting in degraded performance under real-world, dynamic test conditions. To address these challenges, we introduce Style Invariance as a Correctness Likelihood (SICL), a framework that leverages style-invariance for robust uncertainty estimation. SICL estimates instance-wise correctness likelihood by measuring prediction consistency across style-altered variants, requiring only the model's forward pass. This makes it a plug-and-play, backpropagation-free calibration module compatible with any TTA method. Comprehensive evaluations across four baselines, five TTA methods, and two realistic scenarios with three model architecture demonstrate that SICL reduces calibration error by an average of 13 percentage points compared to conventional calibration approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haidong Kang, Jun Du, Lihong Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Mixed-Precision Quantization (MPQ) liberates the Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) from the Out-Of-Memory (OOM) bottleneck, which garnered increasing research attention. However, conventional methods either searched from costly differentiable optimization, which is neither efficient nor flexible, or learned a quantized DNN from the proxy (i.e., HAWQ) manually designed by human experts, which is labor-intensive and requires huge expert knowledge. Can we design a proxy without involving any human experts and training? In this paper, we provide an affirmative answer by proposing a novel Large Language Models (LLMs)-driven Training-free Automatic Proxy (dubbed TAP) discovery framework, which reforms the design paradigm of MPQ by utilizing LLMs to find superior TAP tailored for MPQ, automatically. In addition, to bridge the gap between black-box LLMs and the tough MPQ task, we ingeniously propose simple Direct Policy Optimization (DPO) based reinforcement learning to enhance LLMs' reasoning by optimizing prompts, which can construct a positive feedback loop between the LLM and the MPQ task, enabling LLMs to generate better TAP in the next evolution. Extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks demonstrate that TAP achieves state-of-the-art performance. Finally, we truly believe that our TAP will significantly contribute to the MPQ community by providing a new perspective on LLM-driven design algorithms.</p>

<p>Abstract: DreamerV3 is a state-of-the-art online model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) algorithm known for remarkable sample efficiency. Concurrently, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have emerged as a promising alternative to Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), offering superior parameter efficiency and interpretability. To mitigate KANs' computational overhead, variants like FastKAN leverage Radial Basis Functions (RBFs) to accelerate inference. In this work, we investigate integrating KAN architectures into the DreamerV3 framework. We introduce KAN-Dreamer, replacing specific MLP and convolutional components of DreamerV3 with KAN and FastKAN layers. To ensure efficiency within the JAX-based World Model, we implement a tailored, fully vectorized version with simplified grid management. We structure our investigation into three subsystems: Visual Perception, Latent Prediction, and Behavior Learning. Empirical evaluations on the DeepMind Control Suite (walker_walk) analyze sample efficiency, training time, and asymptotic performance. Experimental results demonstrate that utilizing our adapted FastKAN as a drop-in replacement for the Reward and Continue predictors yields performance on par with the original MLP-based architecture, maintaining parity in both sample efficiency and training speed. This report serves as a preliminary study for future developments in KAN-based world models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangjun Tang, Biao Zhang, Peter Wonka</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating realistic human geometry animations remains a challenging task, as it requires modeling natural clothing dynamics with fine-grained geometric details under limited data. To address these challenges, we propose two novel designs. First, we propose a compact distribution-based latent representation that enables efficient and high-quality geometry generation. We improve upon previous work by establishing a more uniform mapping between SMPL and avatar geometries. Second, we introduce a generative animation model that fully exploits the diversity of limited motion data. We focus on short-term transitions while maintaining long-term consistency through an identity-conditioned design. These two designs formulate our method as a two-stage framework: the first stage learns a latent space, while the second learns to generate animations within this latent space. We conducted experiments on both our latent space and animation model. We demonstrate that our latent space produces high-fidelity human geometry surpassing previous methods ($90\%$ lower Chamfer Dist.). The animation model synthesizes diverse animations with detailed and natural dynamics ($2.2 \times$ higher user study score), achieving the best results across all evaluation metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikita Gabdullin</p>
<p>Abstract: The overall neural network (NN) performance is closely related to the properties of its embedding distribution in latent space (LS). It has recently been shown that predefined vector systems, specifically An root system vectors, can be used as targets for latent space configurations (LSC) to ensure the desired LS structure. One of the main LSC advantage is the possibility of training classifier NNs without classification layers, which facilitates training NNs on datasets with extremely large numbers of classes. This paper provides a more general overview of possible vector systems for NN training along with their properties and methods for vector system construction. These systems are used to configure LS of encoders and visual transformers to significantly speed up ImageNet-1K and 50k-600k classes LSC training. It is also shown that using the minimum number of LS dimensions for a specific number of classes results in faster convergence. The latter has potential advantages for reducing the size of vector databases used to store NN embeddings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shimin Zhang, Xianwei Chen, Yufan Shen, Ziyuan Ye, Jibin Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently demonstrated remarkable potential in enhancing the reasoning capability of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). However, RLVR often leads to entropy collapse, resulting in premature policy convergence and performance saturation. While manipulating token-level entropy has proven effective for promoting policy exploration, we argue that the latent dynamics underlying token generation encode a far richer computational structure for steering policy optimization toward a more effective exploration-exploitation tradeoff. To enable tractable analysis and intervention of the latent dynamics of LRMs, we leverage Koopman operator theory to obtain a linearized representation of their hidden-state dynamics. This enables us to introduce Dynamic Spectral Dispersion (DSD), a new metric to quantify the heterogeneity of the model's latent dynamics, serving as a direct indicator of policy exploration. Building upon these foundations, we propose Reasoning with Latent eXploration (ReLaX), a paradigm that explicitly incorporates latent dynamics to regulate exploration and exploitation during policy optimization. Comprehensive experiments across a wide range of multimodal and text-only reasoning benchmarks show that ReLaX significantly mitigates premature convergence and consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuecheng Li, Weikuan Jia, Komildzhon Sharipov, Alimov Ruslan, Lutfuloev Mazbutdzhon, Ismoilov Shuhratjon, Yuanjie Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate three-dimensional delineation of liver tumors on contrast-enhanced CT is a prerequisite for treatment planning, navigation and response assessment, yet manual contouring is slow, observer-dependent and difficult to standardise across centres. Automatic segmentation is complicated by low lesion-parenchyma contrast, blurred or incomplete boundaries, heterogeneous enhancement patterns, and confounding structures such as vessels and adjacent organs. We propose a hybrid framework that couples an attention-enhanced cascaded U-Net with handcrafted radiomics and voxel-wise 3D CNN refinement for joint liver and liver-tumor segmentation. First, a 2.5D two-stage network with a densely connected encoder, sub-pixel convolution decoders and multi-scale attention gates produces initial liver and tumor probability maps from short stacks of axial slices. Inter-slice temporal consistency is then enforced by a simple three-slice refinement rule along the cranio-caudal direction, which restores thin and tiny lesions while suppressing isolated noise. Next, 728 radiomic descriptors spanning intensity, texture, shape, boundary and wavelet feature groups are extracted from candidate lesions and reduced to 20 stable, highly informative features via multi-strategy feature selection; a random forest classifier uses these features to reject false-positive regions. Finally, a compact 3D patch-based CNN derived from AlexNet operates in a narrow band around the tumor boundary to perform voxel-level relabelling and contour smoothing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuecheng Li, Weikuan Jia, Komildzhon Sharipov, Sharipov Hotam Beknazarovich, Farzona S. Ataeva, Qurbonaliev Alisher, Yuanjie Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate segmentation of spinal structures in X-ray images is a prerequisite for quantitative scoliosis assessment, including Cobb angle measurement, vertebral translation estimation and curvature classification. In routine practice, clinicians acquire coronal, left-bending and right-bending radiographs to jointly evaluate deformity severity and spinal flexibility. However, the segmentation step remains heavily manual, time-consuming and non-reproducible, particularly in low-contrast images and in the presence of rib shadows or overlapping tissues. To address these limitations, this paper proposes R2MF-Net, a recurrent residual multi-path encoder--decoder network tailored for automatic segmentation of multi-directional spine X-ray images. The overall design consists of a coarse segmentation network and a fine segmentation network connected in cascade. Both stages adopt an improved Inception-style multi-branch feature extractor, while a recurrent residual jump connection (R2-Jump) module is inserted into skip paths to gradually align encoder and decoder semantics. A multi-scale cross-stage skip (MC-Skip) mechanism allows the fine network to reuse hierarchical representations from multiple decoder levels of the coarse network, thereby strengthening the stability of segmentation across imaging directions and contrast conditions. Furthermore, a lightweight spatial-channel squeeze-and-excitation block (SCSE-Lite) is employed at the bottleneck to emphasize spine-related activations and suppress irrelevant structures and background noise. We evaluate R2MF-Net on a clinical multi-view radiograph dataset comprising 228 sets of coronal, left-bending and right-bending spine X-ray images with expert annotations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in vision-language understanding tasks. While these models often produce linguistically coherent output, they often suffer from hallucinations, generating descriptions that are factually inconsistent with the visual content, potentially leading to adverse consequences. Therefore, the assessment of hallucinations in MLLM has become increasingly crucial in the model development process. Contemporary methodologies predominantly depend on external LLM evaluators, which are themselves susceptible to hallucinations and may present challenges in terms of domain adaptation. In this study, we propose the hypothesis that hallucination manifests as measurable irregularities within the internal layer dynamics of MLLMs, not merely due to distributional shifts but also in the context of layer-wise analysis of specific assumptions. By incorporating such modifications, \textsc{\textsc{HalluShift++}} broadens the efficacy of hallucination detection from text-based large language models (LLMs) to encompass multimodal scenarios.

<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers have achieved many successes in image classification in recent years. It has been consistently demonstrated that best practice for image classification is when large deep models can be trained on abundant labelled data. However there are many real world scenarios where the requirement for large amounts of training data to get the best performance cannot be met. In these scenarios transfer learning can help improve performance. To date there have been no surveys that comprehensively review deep transfer learning as it relates to image classification overall. However, several recent general surveys of deep transfer learning and ones that relate to particular specialised target image classification tasks have been published. We believe it is important for the future progress in the field that all current knowledge is collated and the overarching patterns analysed and discussed. In this survey we formally define deep transfer learning and the problem it attempts to solve in relation to image classification. We survey the current state of the field and identify where recent progress has been made. We show where the gaps in current knowledge are and make suggestions for how to progress the field to fill in these knowledge gaps. We present a new taxonomy of the applications of transfer learning for image classification. This taxonomy makes it easier to see overarching patterns of where transfer learning has been effective and, where it has failed to fulfill its potential. This also allows us to suggest where the problems lie and how it could be used more effectively. We show that under this new taxonomy, many of the applications where transfer learning has been shown to be ineffective or even hinder performance are to be expected when taking into account the source and target datasets and the techniques used.</p>

<p>Abstract: Object segmentation for robotic grasping under dynamic conditions often faces challenges such as occlusion, low light conditions, motion blur and object size variance. To address these challenges, we propose a Deep Learning network that fuses two types of visual signals, event-based data and RGB frame data. The proposed Bimodal SegNet network has two distinct encoders, one for each signal input and a spatial pyramidal pooling with atrous convolutions. Encoders capture rich contextual information by pooling the concatenated features at different resolutions while the decoder obtains sharp object boundaries. The evaluation of the proposed method undertakes five unique image degradation challenges including occlusion, blur, brightness, trajectory and scale variance on the Event-based Segmentation (ESD) Dataset. The evaluation results show a 6-10\% segmentation accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art methods in terms of mean intersection over the union and pixel accuracy.

<p>Abstract: Image restoration (IR) has been an indispensable and challenging task in the low-level vision field, which strives to improve the subjective quality of images distorted by various forms of degradation. Recently, the diffusion model has achieved significant advancements in the visual generation of AIGC, thereby raising an intuitive question, "whether diffusion model can boost image restoration". To answer this, some pioneering studies attempt to integrate diffusion models into the image restoration task, resulting in superior performances than previous GAN-based methods. Despite that, a comprehensive and enlightening survey on diffusion model-based image restoration remains scarce. In this paper, we are the first to present a comprehensive review of recent diffusion model-based methods on image restoration, encompassing the learning paradigm, conditional strategy, framework design, modeling strategy, and evaluation. Concretely, we first introduce the background of the diffusion model briefly and then present two prevalent workflows that exploit diffusion models in image restoration. Subsequently, we classify and emphasize the innovative designs using diffusion models for both IR and blind/real-world IR, intending to inspire future development. To evaluate existing methods thoroughly, we summarize the commonly-used dataset, implementation details, and evaluation metrics. Additionally, we present the objective comparison for open-sourced methods across three tasks, including image super-resolution, deblurring, and inpainting. Ultimately, informed by the limitations in existing works, we propose five potential and challenging directions for the future research of diffusion model-based IR, including sampling efficiency, model compression, distortion simulation and estimation, distortion invariant learning, and framework design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yechi Ma, Yanan Li, Wei Hua, Shu Kong</p>
<p>Abstract: Roadside monocular 3D detection requires detecting objects of predefined classes in an RGB frame and predicting their 3D attributes, such as bird's-eye-view (BEV) locations. It has broad applications in traffic control, vehicle-vehicle communication, and vehicle-infrastructure cooperative perception. To address this task, we introduce Promptable 3D Detector (Pro3D), a novel detector design that leverages 2D detections as prompts. We build our Pro3D upon two key insights. First, compared to a typical 3D detector, a 2D detector is ``easier'' to train due to fewer loss terms and performs significantly better at localizing objects w.r.t 2D metrics. Second, once 2D detections precisely locate objects in the image, a 3D detector can focus on lifting these detections into 3D BEV, especially when fixed camera pose or scene geometry provide an informative prior. To encode and incorporate 2D detections, we explore three methods: (a) concatenating features from both 2D and 3D detectors, (b) attentively fusing 2D and 3D detector features, and (c) encoding properties of predicted 2D bounding boxes \{$x$, $y$, width, height, label\} and attentively fusing them with the 3D detector feature. Interestingly, the third method significantly outperforms the others, underscoring the effectiveness of 2D detections as prompts that offer precise object targets and allow the 3D detector to focus on lifting them into 3D. Pro3D is adaptable for use with a wide range of 2D and 3D detectors with minimal modifications. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our Pro3D significantly enhances existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results on two contemporary benchmarks.</p>

The parameters of the GNN, and hence, the tracker, are learned end-to-end on a training set of example ground-truth tracks and detections. Specifically, learning takes the form of bilevel optimization guided by our novel loss function. We evaluate our algorithm on simulated scenarios to understand its sensitivity to scenario aspects and model hyperparameters. Across varied scenario complexities, our method compares favorably to a strong baseline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Farzaneh Jafari, Stefano Berretti, Anup Basu</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, the talking head generation has become a focal point for researchers. Considerable effort is being made to refine lip-sync motion, capture expressive facial expressions, generate natural head poses, and achieve high-quality video. However, no single model has yet achieved equivalence across all quantitative and qualitative metrics. We introduce Jamba, a hybrid Transformer-Mamba model, to animate a 3D face. Mamba, a pioneering Structured State Space Model (SSM) architecture, was developed to overcome the limitations of conventional Transformer architectures, particularly in handling long sequences. This challenge has constrained traditional models. Jamba combines the advantages of both the Transformer and Mamba approaches, offering a comprehensive solution. Based on the foundational Jamba block, we present JambaTalk to enhance motion variety and lip sync through multimodal integration. Extensive experiments reveal that our method achieves performance comparable or superior to state-of-the-art models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siqi Luo, Yi Xin, Yuntao Du, Tao Tan, Guangtao Zhai, Xiaohong Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks often encounter significant performance drops while facing with domain shifts between training (source) and test (target) data. To address this issue, Test Time Adaptation (TTA) methods have been proposed to adapt pre-trained source model to handle out-of-distribution streaming target data. Although these methods offer some relief, they lack a reliable mechanism for domain shift correction, which can often be erratic in real-world applications. In response, we develop Few-Shot Test Time Adaptation (FS-TTA), a novel and practical setting that utilizes a few-shot support set on top of TTA. Adhering to the principle of few inputs, big gains, FS-TTA reduces blind exploration in unseen target domains. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage framework to tackle FS-TTA, including (i) fine-tuning the pre-trained source model with few-shot support set, along with using feature diversity augmentation module to avoid overfitting, (ii) implementing test time adaptation based on prototype memory bank guidance to produce high quality pseudo-label for model adaptation. Through extensive experiments on three cross-domain classification benchmarks, we demonstrate the superior performance and reliability of our FS-TTA and framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minseung Lee, Seokha Moon, Seung Joon Lee, Reza Mahjourian, Jinkyu Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: In autonomous driving scenarios, accurate perception is becoming an even more critical task for safe navigation. While LiDAR provides precise spatial data, its inherent sparsity makes it difficult to detect small or distant objects. Existing methods try to address this by generating additional points within a Region of Interest (RoI), but relying on LiDAR alone often leads to false positives and a failure to recover meaningful structures. To address these limitations, we propose Image-Guided Semantic Pseudo-LiDAR Point Generation model, called ImagePG, a novel framework that leverages rich RGB image features to generate dense and semantically meaningful 3D points. Our framework includes an Image-Guided RoI Points Generation (IG-RPG) module, which creates pseudo-points guided by image features, and an Image-Aware Occupancy Prediction Network (I-OPN), which provides spatial priors to guide point placement. A multi-stage refinement (MR) module further enhances point quality and detection robustness. To the best of our knowledge, ImagePG is the first method to directly leverage image features for point generation. Extensive experiments on the KITTI and Waymo datasets demonstrate that ImagePG significantly improves the detection of small and distant objects like pedestrians and cyclists, reducing false positives by nearly 50%. On the KITTI benchmark, our framework improves mAP by +1.38%p (car), +7.91%p (pedestrian), and +5.21%p (cyclist) on the test set over the baseline, achieving state-of-the-art cyclist performance on the KITTI leaderboard.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhen Wang, Yilei Jiang, Dong Zheng, Jun Xiao, Long Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Customized Image Generation, generating customized images with user-specified concepts, has raised significant attention due to its creativity and novelty. With impressive progress achieved in subject customization, some pioneer works further explored the customization of action and interaction beyond entity (i.e., human, animal, and object) appearance. However, these approaches only focus on basic actions and interactions between two entities, and their effects are limited by insufficient ''exactly same'' reference images. To extend customized image generation to more complex scenes for general real-world applications, we propose a new task: event-customized image generation. Given a single reference image, we define the ''event'' as all specific actions, poses, relations, or interactions between different entities in the scene. This task aims at accurately capturing the complex event and generating customized images with various target entities. To solve this task, we proposed a novel training-free event customization method: FreeEvent. Specifically, FreeEvent introduces two extra paths alongside the general diffusion denoising process: 1) Entity switching path: it applies cross-attention guidance and regulation for target entity generation. 2) Event transferring path: it injects the spatial feature and self-attention maps from the reference image to the target image for event generation. To further facilitate this new task, we collected two evaluation benchmarks: SWiG-Event and Real-Event. Extensive experiments and ablations have demonstrated the effectiveness of FreeEvent.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boyuan Cao, Jiaxin Ye, Yujie Wei, Hongming Shan</p>
<p>Abstract: While latent diffusion models (LDMs), such as Stable Diffusion, are designed for high-resolution (HR) image generation, they often struggle with significant structural distortions when generating images at resolutions higher than their training one. Instead of relying on extensive retraining, a more resource-efficient approach is to reprogram the pretrained model for HR image generation; however, existing methods often result in poor image quality and long inference time. We introduce RepLDM, a novel reprogramming framework for pretrained LDMs that enables high-quality, high-efficiency, high-resolution image generation; see Fig. 1. RepLDM consists of two stages: (i) an attention guidance stage, which generates a latent representation of a higher-quality training-resolution image using a novel training-free self-attention mechanism to enhance the structural consistency; and (ii) a progressive upsampling stage, which progressively performs upsampling in pixel space to mitigate the severe artifacts caused by latent space upsampling. The effective initialization from the first stage allows for denoising at higher resolutions with significantly fewer steps, improving the efficiency. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that RepLDM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quality and efficiency for HR image generation, underscoring its advantages for real-world applications.

To address this, we propose a new Chinese calligraphy generation model 'Moyun' , which replaces the Unet in the Diffusion model with Vision Mamba and introduces the TripleLabel control mechanism to achieve controllable calligraphy generation. The model was tested on our large-scale dataset 'Mobao' of over 1.9 million images, and the results demonstrate that 'Moyun' can effectively control the generation process and produce calligraphy in the specified style. Even for calligraphy the calligrapher has not written, 'Moyun' can generate calligraphy that matches the style of the calligrapher.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shanzhi Yin, Zihan Zhang, Bolin Chen, Shiqi Wang, Yan Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a novel generative video compression framework that leverages motion pattern priors, derived from subtle dynamics in common scenes (e.g., swaying flowers or a boat drifting on water), rather than relying on video content priors (e.g., talking faces or human bodies). These compact motion priors enable a new approach to ultra-low bitrate communication while achieving high-quality reconstruction across diverse scene contents. At the encoder side, motion priors can be streamlined into compact representations via a dense-to-sparse transformation. At the decoder side, these priors facilitate the reconstruction of scene dynamics using an advanced flow-driven diffusion model. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed method can achieve superior rate-distortion-performance and outperform the state-of-the-art conventional-video codec Enhanced Compression Model (ECM) on-scene dynamics sequences.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dan He, Guofen Wang, Weisheng Li, Yucheng Shu, Wenbo Li, Lijian Yang, Yuping Huang, Feiyan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal image fusion (MMIF) integrates information from different modalities to obtain a comprehensive image, aiding downstream tasks. However, existing research focuses on complementary information fusion and training strategies, overlooking the critical role of underlying architectural components like normalization and convolution kernels. We reevaluate the UNet architecture for end-to-end MMIF, identifying that widely used batch normalization limits performance by smoothing crucial sparse features. To address this, we propose a hybrid of instance and group normalization to maintain sample independence and reinforce intrinsic feature correlations. Crucially, this strategy facilitates richer feature maps, enabling large kernel convolution to fully leverage its receptive field, enhancing detail preservation. Furthermore, the proposed multi-path adaptive fusion module dynamically calibrates features from varying scales and receptive fields, ensuring effective information transfer. Our method achieves SOTA objective performance on MSRS, M$^3$FD, TNO, and Harvard datasets, producing visually clearer salient objects and lesion areas. Notably, it improves MSRS segmentation mIoU by 8.1\% over the infrared image. This performance stems from a synergistic design of normalization and convolution kernels, which preserves critical sparse features.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaowen Ma, Zhenliang Ni, Xinghao Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Mamba has shown great potential for computer vision due to its linear complexity in modeling the global context with respect to the input length. However, existing lightweight Mamba-based backbones cannot demonstrate performance that matches Convolution or Transformer-based methods. By observing, we find that simply modifying the scanning path in the image domain is not conducive to fully exploiting the potential of vision Mamba. In this paper, we first perform comprehensive spectral and quantitative analyses, and verify that the Mamba block mainly models low-frequency information under Convolution-Mamba hybrid architecture. Based on the analyses, we introduce a novel Laplace mixer to decouple the features in terms of frequency and input only the low-frequency components into the Mamba block. In addition, considering the redundancy of the features and the different requirements for high-frequency details and low-frequency global information at different stages, we introduce a frequency ramp inception, i.e., gradually reduce the input dimensions of the high-frequency branches, so as to efficiently trade-off the high-frequency and low-frequency components at different layers. By integrating mobile-friendly convolution and efficient Laplace mixer, we build a series of tiny hybrid vision Mamba called TinyViM. The proposed TinyViM achieves impressive performance on several downstream tasks including image classification, semantic segmentation, object detection and instance segmentation. In particular, TinyViM outperforms Convolution, Transformer and Mamba-based models with similar scales, and the throughput is about 2-3 times higher than that of other Mamba-based models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinyung Hong, Yearim Kim, Keun Hee Park, Sangyu Han, Nojun Kwak, Theodore P. Pavlic</p>
<p>Abstract: Inner interpretability is a promising field aiming to uncover the internal mechanisms of AI systems through scalable, automated methods. While significant research has been conducted on large language models, limited attention has been paid to applying inner interpretability to large-scale image tasks, focusing primarily on architectural and functional levels to visualize learned concepts. In this paper, we first present a conceptual framework that supports inner interpretability and multilevel analysis for large-scale image classification tasks. Specifically, we introduce the Bi-directional Interaction between Concept and Input Embeddings (Bi-ICE) module, which facilitates interpretability across the computational, algorithmic, and implementation levels. This module enhances transparency by generating predictions based on human-understandable concepts, quantifying their contributions, and localizing them within the inputs. Finally, we showcase enhanced transparency in image classification, measuring concept contributions, and pinpointing their locations within the inputs. Our approach highlights algorithmic interpretability by demonstrating the process of concept learning and its convergence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junbo Jacob Lian, Haoran Chen, Kaichen Ouyang, Yujun Zhang, Rui Zhong, Huiling Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Twisted Convolutional Networks (TCNs) are proposed as a novel deep learning architecture for classifying one-dimensional data with arbitrary feature order and minimal spatial relationships. Unlike conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that rely on structured feature sequences, TCNs explicitly combine subsets of input features through theoretically grounded multiplicative and pairwise interaction mechanisms to create enriched representations. This feature combination strategy, formalized through polynomial feature expansions, captures high-order feature interactions that traditional convolutional approaches miss. We provide a comprehensive mathematical framework for TCNs, demonstrating how the twisted convolution operation generalizes standard convolutions while maintaining computational tractability. Through extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets from diverse domains (medical diagnostics, political science, synthetic data, chemometrics, and healthcare), we show that TCNs achieve statistically significant improvements over CNNs, Residual Networks (ResNet), Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), DeepSets, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The performance gains are validated through statistical testing. TCNs also exhibit superior training stability and generalization capabilities, highlighting their robustness for non-spatial data classification tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Toshinori Yamauchi, Hiroshi Kera, Kazuhiko Kawamoto</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual explanations for object detectors are crucial for enhancing their reliability. Object detectors identify and localize instances by assessing multiple visual features collectively. When generating explanations, overlooking these collective influences in detections may lead to missing compositional cues or capturing spurious correlations. However, existing methods typically focus solely on individual pixel contributions, neglecting the collective contribution of multiple pixels. To address this limitation, we propose a game-theoretic method based on Shapley values and interactions to explicitly capture both individual and collective pixel contributions. Our method provides explanations for both bounding box localization and class determination, highlighting regions crucial for detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method identifies important regions more accurately than state-of-the-art methods. The code will be publicly available soon.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liangwei Jiang, Ruida Li, Zhifeng Zhang, Shuo Fang, Chenguang Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper aims to bring fine-grained expression control while maintaining high-fidelity identity in portrait generation. This is challenging due to the mutual interference between expression and identity: (i) fine expression control signals inevitably introduce appearance-related semantics (e.g., facial contours, and ratio), which impact the identity of the generated portrait; (ii) even coarse-grained expression control can cause facial changes that compromise identity, since they all act on the face. These limitations remain unaddressed by previous generation methods, which primarily rely on coarse control signals or two-stage inference that integrates portrait animation. Here, we introduce EmojiDiff, the first end-to-end solution that enables simultaneous control of extremely detailed expression (RGB-level) and high-fidelity identity in portrait generation. To address the above challenges, EmojiDiff adopts a two-stage scheme involving decoupled training and fine-tuning. For decoupled training, we innovate ID-irrelevant Data Iteration (IDI) to synthesize cross-identity expression pairs by dividing and optimizing the processes of maintaining expression and altering identity, thereby ensuring stable and high-quality data generation. Training the model with this data, we effectively disentangle fine expression features in the expression template from other extraneous information (e.g., identity, skin). Subsequently, we present ID-enhanced Contrast Alignment (ICA) for further fine-tuning. ICA achieves rapid reconstruction and joint supervision of identity and expression information, thus aligning identity representations of images with and without expression control. Experimental results demonstrate that our method remarkably outperforms counterparts, achieves precise expression control with highly maintained identity, and generalizes well to various diffusion models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeqing Wang, Kangye Ji, Di Wang, Haibin Zhang, Fei Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Segment Anything Model (SAM) struggles in open-world scenarios with diverse domains. In such settings, naive fine-tuning with a well-designed learning module is inadequate and often causes catastrophic forgetting issue when learning incrementally. To address this issue, we propose a novel continual learning (CL) method for SAM, termed SAMCL. Rather than relying on a fixed learning module, our method decomposes incremental knowledge into separate modules and trains a selector to choose the appropriate one during inference. However, this intuitive design introduces two key challenges: ensuring effective module learning and selection, and managing storage as tasks accumulate. To tackle these, we introduce two components: AugModule and Module Selector. AugModule reduces the storage of the popular LoRA learning module by sharing parameters across layers while maintaining accuracy. It also employs heatmaps-generated from point prompts-to further enhance domain adaptation with minimal additional cost. Module Selector leverages the observation that SAM's embeddings can effectively distinguish domains, enabling high selection accuracy by training on low-consumed embeddings instead of raw images. Experiments show that SAMCL outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving only 0.19% forgetting and at least 2.5% gain on unseen domains. Each AugModule requires just 0.233 MB, reducing storage by at least 24.3% over other fine-tuning approaches. The buffer storage for Module Selector is further reduced by up to 256$\times$.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wangkai Li, Rui Sun, Huayu Mai, Tianzhu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Semantic segmentation suffers from significant performance degradation when the trained network is applied to a different domain. To address this issue, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has been extensively studied. Despite the effectiveness of selftraining techniques in UDA, they still overlook the explicit modeling of domain-shared feature extraction. In this paper, we propose DiDA, an unsupervised domain bridging approach for semantic segmentation. DiDA consists of two key modules: (1) Degradation-based Intermediate Domain Construction, which creates continuous intermediate domains through simple image degradation operations to encourage learning domain-invariant features as domain differences gradually diminish; (2) Semantic Shift Compensation, which leverages a diffusion encoder to disentangle and compensate for semantic shift information with degraded timesteps, preserving discriminative representations in the intermediate domains. As a plug-and-play solution, DiDA supports various degradation operations and seamlessly integrates with existing UDA methods. Extensive experiments on multiple domain adaptive semantic segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that DiDA consistently achieves significant performance improvements across all settings.

<p>Abstract: Deep learning-based discriminative classifiers, despite their remarkable success, remain vulnerable to adversarial examples that can mislead model predictions. While adversarial training can enhance robustness, it fails to address the intrinsic vulnerability stemming from the opaque nature of these black-box models. We present a deep ensemble model that combines discriminative features with generative models to achieve both high accuracy and adversarial robustness. Our approach integrates a bottom-level pre-trained discriminative network for feature extraction with a top-level generative classification network that models adversarial input distributions through a deep latent variable model. Using variational Bayes, our model achieves superior robustness against white-box adversarial attacks without adversarial training. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 demonstrate our model's superior adversarial robustness. Through evaluations using counterfactual metrics and feature interaction-based metrics, we establish correlations between model interpretability and adversarial robustness. Additionally, preliminary results on Tiny-ImageNet validate our approach's scalability to more complex datasets, offering a practical solution for developing robust image classification models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in visual understanding and reasoning, such as in Visual Question Answering (VQA), where the model is asked a question related to a visual input. Still, these models can make distinctly unnatural errors, for example, providing (wrong) answers to unanswerable VQA questions, such as questions asking about objects that do not appear in the image. To address this issue, we propose CLIP-UP: CLIP-based Unanswerable Problem detection, a novel lightweight method for equipping VLMs with the ability to withhold answers to unanswerable questions. CLIP-UP leverages CLIP-based similarity measures to extract question-image alignment information to detect unanswerability, requiring efficient training of only a few additional layers, while keeping the original VLMs' weights unchanged. Tested across several models, CLIP-UP achieves significant improvements on benchmarks assessing unanswerability in both multiple-choice and open-ended VQA, surpassing other methods, while preserving original performance on other tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large, high-quality, annotated datasets are the foundation of medical AI research, but constructing even a small, moderate-quality, annotated dataset can take years of effort from multidisciplinary teams. Although active learning can prioritize what to annotate, scaling up still requires extensive manual efforts to revise the noisy annotations. We formulate this as a missing-data problem and develop ScaleMAI, a framework that unifies data annotation and model development co-evolution through an Expectation-Maximization (EM) process. In this iterative process, the AI model automatically identifies and corrects the mistakes in annotations (Expectation), while the refined annotated data retrain the model to improve accuracy (Maximization). In addition to the classical EM algorithm, ScaleMAI brings human experts into the loop to review annotations that cannot be adequately addressed by either Expectation or Maximization step (<5%). As a result, ScaleMAI progressively creates an annotated dataset of 47,315 CT scans (4.8x larger than the largest public dataset, PanTS) including 4,163,720 per-voxel annotations for benign/malignant tumors and 88 anatomical structures.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaohan Sun, Yinghan Xu, John Dingliana, Carol O'Sullivan</p>
<p>Abstract: We present CrowdSplat, a novel approach that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting for real-time, high-quality crowd rendering. Our method utilizes 3D Gaussian functions to represent animated human characters in diverse poses and outfits, which are extracted from monocular videos. We integrate Level of Detail (LoD) rendering to optimize computational efficiency and quality. The CrowdSplat framework consists of two stages: (1) avatar reconstruction and (2) crowd synthesis. The framework is also optimized for GPU memory usage to enhance scalability. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations show that CrowdSplat achieves good levels of rendering quality, memory efficiency, and computational performance. Through the.se experiments, we demonstrate that CrowdSplat is a viable solution for dynamic, realistic crowd simulation in real-time applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxin Lin, Mengshi Qi, Liang Liu, Huadong Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel approach for solving the Visual Question Answering (VQA) task in autonomous driving by integrating Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with continual learning. In autonomous driving, VQA plays a vital role in enabling the system to understand and reason about its surroundings. However, traditional models often struggle with catastrophic forgetting when sequentially exposed to new driving tasks, such as perception, prediction, and planning, each requiring different forms of knowledge. To address this challenge, we present a novel continual learning framework that combines VLMs with selective memory replay and knowledge distillation, reinforced by task-specific projection layer regularization. The knowledge distillation allows a previously trained model to act as a "teacher" to guide the model through subsequent tasks, minimizing forgetting. Meanwhile, task-specific projection layers calculate the loss based on the divergence of feature representations, ensuring continuity in learning and reducing the shift between tasks. Evaluated on the DriveLM dataset, our framework shows substantial performance improvements, with gains ranging from 20.11% to 35.16% across various metrics. These results highlight the effectiveness of combining continual learning with VLMs in enhancing the resilience and reliability of VQA systems in autonomous driving. We will release our source code.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peizhe Zhao, Shunbo Jia</p>
<p>Abstract: Defect detection in fabrics is critical for quality control, yet existing methods often struggle with complex backgrounds and shape-specific defects. In this paper, we propose an improved fabric defect detection model based on YOLOv11. To enhance the detection of strip defects, we introduce a Strip Perception Module (SPM) that improves feature capture through multi-scale convolution. We further enhance the spatial pyramid pooling fast (SPPF) by integrating a squeeze-and-excitation mechanism, resulting in the SE-SPPF module, which better integrates spatial and channel information for more effective defect feature extraction. Additionally, we propose a novel focal enhanced complete intersection over union (FECIoU) metric with adaptive weights, addressing scale differences and class imbalance by adjusting the weights of hard-to-detect instances through focal loss. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves a 0.8-8.1% improvement in mean average precision (mAP) on the Tianchi dataset and a 1.6-13.2% improvement on our custom dataset, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bin Yang, Alexandru Paul Condurache</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D scene understanding is a critical yet challenging task in autonomous driving due to the irregularity and sparsity of LiDAR data, as well as the computational demands of processing large-scale point clouds. Recent methods leverage range-view representations to enhance efficiency, but they often adopt higher azimuth resolutions to mitigate information loss during spherical projection, where only the closest point is retained for each 2D grid. However, processing wide panoramic range-view images remains inefficient and may introduce additional distortions. Our empirical analysis shows that training with multiple range images, obtained from splitting the full point cloud, improves both segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency. However, this approach also poses new challenges of exacerbated class imbalance and increase in projection artifacts. To address these, we introduce FLARES, a novel training paradigm that incorporates two tailored data augmentation techniques and a specialized post-processing method designed for multi-range settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FLARES is highly generalizable across different architectures, yielding 2.1%~7.9% mIoU improvements on SemanticKITTI and 1.8%~3.9% mIoU on nuScenes, while delivering over 40% speed-up in inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiwen Tang, Zoey Guo, Zhuhao Wang, Ray Zhang, Qizhi Chen, Junli Liu, Delin Qu, Zhigang Wang, Dong Wang, Bin Zhao, Xuelong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Encoder-free architectures have been preliminarily explored in the 2D Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), yet it remains an open question whether they can be effectively applied to 3D understanding scenarios. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive investigation into the potential of encoder-free architectures to alleviate the challenges of encoder-based 3D LMMs. These long-standing challenges include the failure to adapt to varying point cloud resolutions during inference and the point features from the encoder not meeting the semantic needs of Large Language Models (LLMs). We identify key aspects for 3D LMMs to remove the pre-trained encoder and enable the LLM to assume the role of the 3D encoder: 1) We propose the LLM-embedded Semantic Encoding strategy in the pre-training stage, exploring the effects of various point cloud self-supervised losses. And we present the Hybrid Semantic Loss to extract high-level semantics. 2) We introduce the Hierarchical Geometry Aggregation strategy in the instruction tuning stage. This incorporates inductive bias into the LLM layers to focus on the local details of the point clouds. To the end, we present the first Encoder-free 3D LMM, ENEL. Our 7B model rivals the state-of-the-art model, PointLLM-PiSA-13B, achieving 57.91%, 61.0%, and 55.20% on the classification, captioning, and VQA tasks, respectively. Our results show that the encoder-free architecture is highly promising for replacing encoder-based architectures in the field of 3D understanding.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anthony Fuller, Yousef Yassin, Daniel G. Kyrollos, Evan Shelhamer, James R. Green</p>
<p>Abstract: ViTs are general and accurate, and address many tasks, but ViTs are slow, and are not always practical when efficiency is key. Existing methods for faster ViTs design hybrid non-ViT architectures, losing generality, or shrink their tokens, sacrificing accuracy. While many non-ViT architectures are both fast and accurate, they cannot flexibly process other input shapes, pre-train by SOTA self-supervised learning, reduce computation by dropping tokens, and more like ViTs can. We make ViTs faster by reducing patch token width while increasing global token width by adding a new Jumbo token. Our wider Jumbo token is processed by its own wider FFN to increase model capacity. Yet our Jumbo FFN is efficient: it processes a single token, for speed, and its parameters are shared across all layers, for memory. Crucially, our Jumbo is attention-only and non-hierarchical, like a plain ViT, so it is simple, scalable, flexible, and compatible with ViT methods new and old. Jumbo improves over ViT baselines with Registers from Nano to Large scales while maintaining speed/throughput on ImageNet-1K (0.1-13%). Jumbo also improves MAE pre-training (4.9% linear probing on ImageNet-1K), test-time adaptation (5.2% on ImageNet-C), and time series modeling. Our Jumbo models even achieve better speed-accuracy trade-offs than specialized non-ViT compute-efficient models, while maintaining plain-ViT compatibility for practicality.

<p>Abstract: This paper comprehensively reviews anomaly synthesis methodologies. Existing surveys focus on limited techniques, missing an overall field view and understanding method interconnections. In contrast, our study offers a unified review, covering about 40 representative methods across Hand-crafted, Distribution-hypothesis-based, Generative models (GM)-based, and Vision-language models (VLM)-based synthesis. We introduce the first industrial anomaly synthesis (IAS) taxonomy. Prior works lack formal classification or use simplistic taxonomies, hampering structured comparisons and trend identification. Our taxonomy provides a fine-grained framework reflecting methodological progress and practical implications, grounding future research. Furthermore, we explore cross-modality synthesis and large-scale VLM. Previous surveys overlooked multimodal data and VLM in anomaly synthesis, limiting insights into their advantages. Our survey analyzes their integration, benefits, challenges, and prospects, offering a roadmap to boost IAS with multimodal learning.

<p>Abstract: While cooperative perception can overcome the limitations of single-vehicle systems, the practical implementation of vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure systems is often impeded by significant economic barriers. Aerial-ground cooperation (AGC), which pairs ground vehicles with drones, presents a more economically viable and rapidly deployable alternative. However, this emerging field has been held back by a critical lack of high-quality public datasets and benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we present \textit{Griffin}, a comprehensive AGC 3D perception dataset, featuring over 250 dynamic scenes (37k+ frames). It incorporates varied drone altitudes (20-60m), diverse weather conditions, realistic drone dynamics via CARLA-AirSim co-simulation, and critical occlusion-aware 3D annotations. Accompanying the dataset is a unified benchmarking framework for cooperative detection and tracking, with protocols to evaluate communication efficiency, altitude adaptability, and robustness to communication latency, data loss and localization noise. By experiments through different cooperative paradigms, we demonstrate the effectiveness and limitations of current methods and provide crucial insights for future research.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hung Q. Vo, Pengyu Yuan, Zheng Yin, Kelvin K. Wong, Chika F. Ezeana, Son T. Ly, Stephen T. C. Wong, Hien V. Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has garnered substantial interest within the machine learning and computer vision communities. Two prominent approaches in SSL include contrastive-based learning and self-distillation utilizing cropping augmentation. Lately, masked image modeling (MIM) has emerged as a more potent SSL technique, employing image inpainting as a pretext task. MIM creates a strong inductive bias toward meaningful spatial and semantic understanding. This has opened up new opportunities for SSL to contribute not only to classification tasks but also to more complex applications like object detection and image segmentation. Building upon this progress, our research paper introduces a scalable and practical SSL approach centered around more challenging pretext tasks that facilitate the acquisition of robust features. Specifically, we leverage multi-scale image reconstruction from randomly masked input images as the foundation for feature learning. Our hypothesis posits that reconstructing high-resolution images enables the model to attend to finer spatial details, particularly beneficial for discerning subtle intricacies within medical images. The proposed SSL features help improve classification performance on the Curated Breast Imaging Subset of Digital Database for Screening Mammography (CBIS-DDSM) dataset. In pathology classification, our method demonstrates a 3\% increase in average precision (AP) and a 1\% increase in the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) when compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms. Moreover, in mass margins classification, our approach achieves a 4\% increase in AP and a 2\% increase in AUC.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shicheng Li, Lei Li, Kun Ouyang, Shuhuai Ren, Yuanxin Liu, Yuanxing Zhang, Fuzheng Zhang, Lingpeng Kong, Qi Liu, Xu Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs) have achieved significant success by adopting the paradigm of large-scale pre-training followed by supervised fine-tuning (SFT). However, existing approaches struggle with temporal reasoning due to weak temporal correspondence in the data and over-reliance on the next-token prediction paradigm}, which collectively result in the absence temporal supervision. To address these limitations, we propose TEMPLE (TEMporal Preference LEarning), a systematic framework that enhances temporal reasoning capabilities through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). To address temporal information scarcity in data, we introduce an automated pipeline for systematically constructing temporality-intensive preference pairs comprising three steps: selecting temporally rich videos, designing video-specific perturbation strategies, and evaluating model responses on clean and perturbed inputs. Complementing this data pipeline, we provide additional supervision signals via preference learning and propose a novel Progressive Pre-SFT Alignment strategy featuring two key innovations: a curriculum learning strategy which progressively increases perturbation difficulty to maximize data efficiency; and applying preference optimization before instruction tuning to incentivize fundamental temporal alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently improves Video LLM performance across multiple benchmarks with a relatively small set of self-generated DPO data. Our findings highlight TEMPLE as a scalable and efficient complement to SFT-based methods, paving the way for developing reliable Video LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiang Xu, Lingdong Kong, Hui Shuai, Wenwei Zhang, Liang Pan, Kai Chen, Ziwei Liu, Qingshan Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: LiDAR representation learning has emerged as a promising approach to reducing reliance on costly and labor-intensive human annotations. While existing methods primarily focus on spatial alignment between LiDAR and camera sensors, they often overlook the temporal dynamics critical for capturing motion and scene continuity in driving scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose SuperFlow++, a novel framework that integrates spatiotemporal cues in both pretraining and downstream tasks using consecutive LiDAR-camera pairs. SuperFlow++ introduces four key components: (1) a view consistency alignment module to unify semantic information across camera views, (2) a dense-to-sparse consistency regularization mechanism to enhance feature robustness across varying point cloud densities, (3) a flow-based contrastive learning approach that models temporal relationships for improved scene understanding, and (4) a temporal voting strategy that propagates semantic information across LiDAR scans to improve prediction consistency. Extensive evaluations on 11 heterogeneous LiDAR datasets demonstrate that SuperFlow++ outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse tasks and driving conditions. Furthermore, by scaling both 2D and 3D backbones during pretraining, we uncover emergent properties that provide deeper insights into developing scalable 3D foundation models. With strong generalizability and computational efficiency, SuperFlow++ establishes a new benchmark for data-efficient LiDAR-based perception in autonomous driving.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanpeng Sun, Shan Zhang, Wei Tang, Aotian Chen, Piotr Koniusz, Kai Zou, Yuan Xue, Anton van den Hengel</p>
<p>Abstract: Diagrams represent a form of visual language that encodes abstract concepts and relationships through structured symbols and their spatial arrangements. Unlike natural images, they are inherently symbolic, and entirely artificial. They thus pose unique challenges for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) distinct from natural image processing. Recent studies have shown that MLLMs often exhibit flawed reasoning and hallucinations when handling diagram inputs. We investigate here whether these limitations stem from shortcomings in the models' ability to interpret diagrams themselves. To this end, we develop a diagnostic test suite that isolates perception from reasoning. Our systematic evaluation reveals that MLLMs perform poorly on basic perceptual tasks, e.g., shape classification, object counting, relationship identification, and object grounding, with near-zero accuracy on fine-grained grounding. Further analysis shows that weak diagram perception leads to "blind faith in text", where models rely on textual shortcuts rather than visual understanding (that is, they are Math Blind). We hypothesize that enabling models to capture the inherent structural properties of diagrams, represented as graphs of primitives and their interrelationships, is essential for improving diagram understanding. Experiments with 7B and 32B MLLMs validate this assumption, with models trained on such representations achieving a +79% gain on the grounding task. Crucially, these gains transfer to reasoning, achieving 3-4% cross-suite improvements on three public benchmarks even without additional chain-of-thought reasoning data. Our findings demonstrate that low-level perception supports faithful high-level reasoning in mathematical MLLMs. We provide both methodological frameworks and empirical evidence to guide future research in this direction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b>  Boyang (Tony),  Yu, Yanlin Jin, Yun He, Akshat Dave, Guha Balakrishnan</p>
<p>Abstract: We present TranSplat, a method for fast and accurate object relighting for the 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) framework when transferring a 3D object from a source GS scene to a target GS scene. TranSplat is based on a theoretical radiance transfer identity for cross-scene relighting of objects with radially symmetric BRDFs that involves only taking simple products of spherical harmonic appearance coefficients of the object, source, and target environment maps without any explicit computation of scene quantities (e.g., the BRDFs themselves). TranSplat is the first method to demonstrate how this theoretical identity may be used to perform relighting within the GS framework, and furthermore, by automatically inferring unknown source and target environment maps directly from the source and target scene GS representations. We evaluated TranSplat on several synthetic and real-world scenes and objects, demonstrating comparable 3D object relighting performance to recent conventional inverse rendering-based GS methods with a fraction of their runtime. While TranSplat is theoretically best-suited for radially symmetric BRDFs, results demonstrate that TranSplat still offers perceptually realistic renderings on real scenes and opens a valuable, lightweight path forward to relighting with the GS framework.</p>

<p>Abstract: Extracting depth information from photon-limited, defocused images is challenging because depth from defocus (DfD) relies on accurate estimation of defocus blur, which is fundamentally sensitive to image noise. We present a novel approach to robustly measure object depths from photon-limited images along the defocused boundaries. It is based on a new image patch representation, Blurry-Edges, that explicitly stores and visualizes a rich set of low-level patch information, including boundaries, color, and smoothness. We develop a deep neural network architecture that predicts the Blurry-Edges representation from a pair of differently defocused images, from which depth can be calculated using a closed-form DfD relation we derive. The experimental results on synthetic and real data show that our method achieves the highest depth estimation accuracy on photon-limited images compared to a broad range of state-of-the-art DfD methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lan Sun, Songpengcheng Xia, Jiarui Yang, Ling Pei</p>
<p>Abstract: The proliferation of wearable technology has established multi-device ecosystems comprising smartphones, smartwatches, and headphones as critical enablers for ubiquitous pedestrian localization. However, traditional pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) struggles with diverse motion modes, while data-driven methods, despite improving accuracy, often lack robustness due to their reliance on a single-device setup. Therefore, a promising solution is to fully leverage existing wearable devices to form a flexiwear bodynet for robust and accurate pedestrian localization. This paper presents Suite-IN++, a deep learning framework for flexiwear bodynet-based pedestrian localization. Suite-IN++ integrates motion data from wearable devices on different body parts, using contrastive learning to separate global and local motion features. It fuses global features based on the data reliability of each device to capture overall motion trends and employs an attention mechanism to uncover cross-device correlations in local features, extracting motion details helpful for accurate localization. To evaluate our method, we construct a real-life flexiwear bodynet dataset, incorporating Apple Suite (iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods) across diverse walking modes and device configurations. Experimental results demonstrate that Suite-IN++ achieves superior localization accuracy and robustness, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art models in real-life pedestrian tracking scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sandra Bergmann, Fabian Brand, Christian Riess</p>
<p>Abstract: The JPEG standard was vastly successful. Currently, the first AI-based compression method ``JPEG AI'' will be standardized. JPEG AI brings remarkable benefits. JPEG AI images exhibit impressive image quality at bitrates that are an order of magnitude lower than images compressed with traditional JPEG. However, forensic analysis of JPEG AI has to be completely re-thought: forensic tools for traditional JPEG do not transfer to JPEG AI, and artifacts from JPEG AI are easily confused with artifacts from artificially generated images (``DeepFakes''). This creates a need for novel forensic approaches to detection and distinction of JPEG AI images. In this work, we make a first step towards a forensic JPEG AI toolset. We propose three cues for forensic algorithms for JPEG AI. These algorithms address three forensic questions: first, we show that the JPEG AI preprocessing introduces correlations in the color channels that do not occur in uncompressed images. Second, we show that repeated compression of JPEG AI images leads to diminishing distortion differences. This can be used to detect recompression, in a spirit similar to some classic JPEG forensics methods. Third, we show that the quantization of JPEG AI images in the latent space can be used to distinguish real images with JPEG AI compression from synthetically generated images. The proposed methods are interpretable for a forensic analyst, and we hope that they inspire further research in the forensics of AI-compressed images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziran Qin, Youru Lv, Mingbao Lin, Hang Guo, Zeren Zhang, Danping Zou, Weiyao Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual Autoregressive (VAR) models adopt a next-scale prediction paradigm, offering high-quality content generation with substantially fewer decoding steps. However, existing VAR models suffer from significant attention complexity and severe memory overhead due to the accumulation of key-value (KV) caches across scales. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by introducing KV cache compression into the next-scale generation paradigm. We begin with a crucial observation: attention heads in VAR models can be divided into two functionally distinct categories: Contextual Heads focus on maintaining semantic consistency, while Structural Heads are responsible for preserving spatial coherence. This structural divergence causes existing one-size-fits-all compression methods to perform poorly on VAR models. To address this, we propose HACK, a training-free Head-Aware KV cache Compression frameworK. HACK utilizes an offline classification scheme to separate head types, enabling it to apply pattern-specific compression strategies with asymmetric cache budgets for each category. By doing so, HACK effectively constrains the average KV cache length within a fixed budget $B$, reducing the theoretical attention complexity from $\mathcal{O}(n^4)$ to $\mathcal{O}(Bn^2)$. Extensive experiments on multiple VAR models across text-to-image and class-conditional tasks validate the effectiveness and generalizability of HACK. It achieves up to 70% KV cache compression without degrading output quality, resulting in memory savings and faster inference. For example, HACK provides a $1.75\times$ memory reduction and a $1.57\times$ speedup on Infinity-8B.</p>

While adaptive prompt learning enables end-to-end optimization, it often yields overlapping or redundant task representations. Conversely, explicit prompts derived from pretrained classifiers enhance discriminability but discard critical visual information needed for reconstruction. To address these limitations, we introduce Contrastive Prompt Learning (CPL), a framework that aims to improve prompt-task alignment through two complementary components: a Sparse Prompt Module (SPM) that efficiently captures degradation-aware representations while reducing redundancy, and a Contrastive Prompt Regularization (CPR) that explicitly strengthens task boundaries by incorporating negative prompt samples across different degradation types. Unlike previous approaches that focus primarily on degradation classification, CPL directly optimizes the interaction between prompts and the restoration model. Extensive experiments across five benchmarks show that CPL consistently boosts the performance of strong AiOIR baselines across diverse scenarios. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art average performance on these benchmarks, providing a general and robust solution for AiOIR. The code is available at https://github.com/Aitical/CPLIR</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tiancheng Gu, Kaicheng Yang, Ziyong Feng, Xingjun Wang, Yanzhao Zhang, Dingkun Long, Yingda Chen, Weidong Cai, Jiankang Deng</p>
<p>Abstract: The Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) framework has become a widely used approach for multimodal representation learning, particularly in image-text retrieval and clustering. However, its efficacy is constrained by three key limitations: (1) text token truncation, (2) isolated image-text encoding, and (3) deficient compositionality due to bag-of-words behavior. While recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant advances in generalized vision-language understanding, their potential for learning transferable multimodal representations remains underexplored.In this work, we present UniME (Universal Multimodal Embedding), a novel two-stage framework that leverages MLLMs to learn discriminative representations for diverse downstream tasks. In the first stage, we perform textual discriminative knowledge distillation from a powerful LLM-based teacher model to enhance the embedding capability of the MLLM\'s language component. In the second stage, we introduce hard negative enhanced instruction tuning to further advance discriminative representation learning. Specifically, we initially mitigate false negative contamination and then sample multiple hard negatives per instance within each batch, forcing the model to focus on challenging samples. This approach not only improves discriminative power but also enhances instruction-following ability in downstream tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on the MMEB benchmark and multiple retrieval tasks, including short and long caption retrieval and compositional retrieval. Results demonstrate that UniME achieves consistent performance improvement across all tasks, exhibiting superior discriminative and compositional capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gaozheng Pei, Ke Ma, Yingfei Sun, Qianqian Xu, Qingming Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: The diffusion-based adversarial purification methods attempt to drown adversarial perturbations into a part of isotropic noise through the forward process, and then recover the clean images through the reverse process. Due to the lack of distribution information about adversarial perturbations in the pixel domain, it is often unavoidable to damage normal semantics. We turn to the frequency domain perspective, decomposing the image into amplitude spectrum and phase spectrum. We find that for both spectra, the damage caused by adversarial perturbations tends to increase monotonically with frequency. This means that we can extract the content and structural information of the original clean sample from the frequency components that are less damaged. Meanwhile, theoretical analysis indicates that existing purification methods indiscriminately damage all frequency components, leading to excessive damage to the image. Therefore, we propose a purification method that can eliminate adversarial perturbations while maximizing the preservation of the content and structure of the original image. Specifically, at each time step during the reverse process, for the amplitude spectrum, we replace the low-frequency components of the estimated image's amplitude spectrum with the corresponding parts of the adversarial image. For the phase spectrum, we project the phase of the estimated image into a designated range of the adversarial image's phase spectrum, focusing on the low frequencies. Empirical evidence from extensive experiments demonstrates that our method significantly outperforms most current defense methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jian Song, Hongruixuan Chen, Naoto Yokoya</p>
<p>Abstract: Monocular height estimation (MHE) from very-high-resolution (VHR) optical imagery remains challenging due to limited structural cues and the high cost and geographic constraints of conventional elevation data such as airborne LiDAR and multi-view stereo. Although recent MHE and monocular depth estimation (MDE) models show strong performance, their robustness under varied illumination and scene conditions is still limited. We introduce a fully automated correction pipeline that integrates sparse, imperfect global LiDAR measurements from ICESat-2 with deep learning predictions to enhance accuracy and stability. The workflow relies entirely on publicly available models and data and requires only a single georeferenced optical image to produce corrected height maps, enabling low-cost and globally scalable deployment. We also establish the first benchmark for this task, evaluating two random forest based approaches, four parameter efficient fine tuning methods, and full fine tuning. Experiments across six diverse regions at 0.5 m resolution (297 km2), covering the urban cores of Tokyo, Paris, and Sao Paulo as well as suburban and forested areas, show substantial gains. The best method reduces the MHE model's mean absolute error (MAE) by 30.9 percent and improves its F1HE score by 44.2 percent. For the MDE model, MAE improves by 24.1 percent and the F1HE score by 25.1 percent. These results validate the effectiveness of our correction pipeline and demonstrate how sparse global LiDAR can systematically strengthen both MHE and MDE models, enabling scalable and widely accessible 3D height mapping.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gonglin Chen, Tianwen Fu, Haiwei Chen, Wenbin Teng, Hanyuan Xiao, Yajie Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: As a core step in structure-from-motion and SLAM, robust feature detection and description under challenging scenarios such as significant viewpoint changes remain unresolved despite their ubiquity. While recent works have identified the importance of local features in modeling geometric transformations, these methods fail to learn the visual cues present in long-range relationships. We present Robust Deformable Detector (RDD), a novel and robust keypoint detector/descriptor leveraging the deformable transformer, which captures global context and geometric invariance through deformable self-attention mechanisms. Specifically, we observed that deformable attention focuses on key locations, effectively reducing the search space complexity and modeling the geometric invariance. Furthermore, we collected an Air-to-Ground dataset for training in addition to the standard MegaDepth dataset. Our proposed method outperforms all state-of-the-art keypoint detection/description methods in sparse matching tasks and is also capable of semi-dense matching. To ensure comprehensive evaluation, we introduce two challenging benchmarks: one emphasizing large viewpoint and scale variations, and the other being an Air-to-Ground benchmark -- an evaluation setting that has recently gaining popularity for 3D reconstruction across different altitudes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anthony Fuller, Yousef Yassin, Junfeng Wen, Daniel G. Kyrollos, Tarek Ibrahim, James R. Green, Evan Shelhamer</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision transformers are ever larger, more accurate, and more expensive to compute. The expense is even more extreme at high resolution as the number of tokens grows quadratically with the image size. We turn to adaptive computation to cope with this cost by learning to predict where to compute. Our LookWhere method divides the computation between a low-resolution selector and a high-resolution extractor without ever processing the full high-resolution input. We jointly pretrain the selector and extractor without task supervision by distillation from a self-supervised teacher, in effect, learning where and what to compute simultaneously. Unlike prior token reduction methods, which pay to save by pruning already-computed tokens, and prior token selection methods, which require complex and expensive per-task optimization, LookWhere economically and accurately selects and extracts transferrable representations of images. We show that LookWhere excels at sparse recognition on high-resolution inputs (Traffic Signs), maintaining accuracy while reducing FLOPs by up to 34x and time by 6x. It also excels at standard recognition tasks that are global (ImageNet classification) or local (ADE20K segmentation), improving accuracy while reducing time by 1.36x.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianqiao Zheng, Xueqian Li, Hemanth Saratchandran, Simon Lucey</p>
<p>Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) inherently encode strong inductive biases, enabling effective generalization on small-scale datasets. In this paper, we propose integrating this inductive bias into ViTs, not through an architectural intervention but solely through initialization. The motivation here is to have a ViT that can enjoy strong CNN-like performance when data assets are small, but can still scale to ViT-like performance as the data expands. Our approach is motivated by our empirical results that random impulse filters can achieve commensurate performance to learned filters within a CNN. We improve upon current ViT initialization strategies, which typically rely on empirical heuristics such as using attention weights from pretrained models or focusing on the distribution of attention weights without enforcing structures. Empirical results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms standard ViT initialization across numerous small and medium-scale benchmarks, including Food-101, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, STL-10, Flowers, and Pets, while maintaining comparative performance on large-scale datasets such as ImageNet-1K. Moreover, our initialization strategy can be easily integrated into various transformer-based architectures such as Swin Transformer and MLP-Mixer with consistent improvements in performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaohu Huang, Jingjing Wu, Qunyi Xie, Kai Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in scene understanding have leveraged multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for 3D reasoning by capitalizing on their strong 2D pretraining. However, the lack of explicit 3D data during MLLM pretraining limits 3D representation capability. In this paper, we investigate the 3D-awareness of MLLMs by evaluating multi-view correspondence and reveal a strong positive correlation between the quality of 3D-aware representation and downstream task performance. Motivated by this, we propose 3DRS, a framework that enhances MLLM 3D representation learning by introducing supervision from pretrained 3D foundation models. Our approach aligns MLLM visual features with rich 3D knowledge distilled from 3D models, effectively improving scene understanding. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and MLLMs -- including visual grounding, captioning, and question answering -- demonstrate consistent performance gains.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gustavo Perez, Stella X. Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Classical image filters, such as those for averaging or differencing, are carefully normalized to ensure consistency, interpretability, and to avoid artifacts like intensity shifts, halos, or ringing. In contrast, convolutional filters learned end-to-end in deep networks lack such constraints. Although they may resemble wavelets and blob/edge detectors, they are not normalized in the same or any way. Consequently, when images undergo atmospheric transfer, their responses become distorted, leading to incorrect outcomes. We address this limitation by proposing filter normalization, followed by learnable scaling and shifting, akin to batch normalization. This simple yet effective modification ensures that the filters are atmosphere-equivariant, enabling co-domain symmetry. By integrating classical filtering principles into deep learning (applicable to both convolutional neural networks and convolution-dependent vision transformers), our method achieves significant improvements on artificial and natural intensity variation benchmarks. Our ResNet34 could even outperform CLIP by a large margin. Our analysis reveals that unnormalized filters degrade performance, whereas filter normalization regularizes learning, promotes diversity, and improves robustness and generalization.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep learning models have shown remarkable success in dermatological image analysis, offering potential for automated skin disease diagnosis. Previously, convolutional neural network(CNN) based architectures have achieved immense popularity and success in computer vision (CV) based task like skin image recognition, generation and video analysis. But with the emergence of transformer based models, CV tasks are now are nowadays carrying out using these models. Vision Transformers (ViTs) is such a transformer-based models that have shown success in computer vision. It uses self-attention mechanisms to achieve state-of-the-art performance across various tasks. However, their reliance on global attention mechanisms makes them susceptible to adversarial perturbations. This paper aims to investigate the susceptibility of ViTs for medical images to adversarial watermarking-a method that adds so-called imperceptible perturbations in order to fool models. By generating adversarial watermarks through Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), we examine the transferability of such attacks to CNNs and analyze the performance defense mechanism -- adversarial training. Results indicate that while performance is not compromised for clean images, ViTs certainly become much more vulnerable to adversarial attacks: an accuracy drop of as low as 27.6%. Nevertheless, adversarial training raises it up to 90.0%.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce PlayerOne, the first egocentric realistic world simulator, facilitating immersive and unrestricted exploration within vividly dynamic environments. Given an egocentric scene image from the user, PlayerOne can accurately construct the corresponding world and generate egocentric videos that are strictly aligned with the real scene human motion of the user captured by an exocentric camera. PlayerOne is trained in a coarse-to-fine pipeline that first performs pretraining on large-scale egocentric text-video pairs for coarse-level egocentric understanding, followed by finetuning on synchronous motion-video data extracted from egocentric-exocentric video datasets with our automatic construction pipeline. Besides, considering the varying importance of different components, we design a part-disentangled motion injection scheme, enabling precise control of part-level movements. In addition, we devise a joint reconstruction framework that progressively models both the 4D scene and video frames, ensuring scene consistency in the long-form video generation. Experimental results demonstrate its great generalization ability in precise control of varying human movements and worldconsistent modeling of diverse scenarios. It marks the first endeavor into egocentric real-world simulation and can pave the way for the community to delve into fresh frontiers of world modeling and its diverse applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jun Wang, Lixing Zhu, Xiaohan Yu, Abhir Bhalerao, Yulan He</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning medical visual representations from image-report pairs through joint learning has garnered increasing research attention due to its potential to alleviate the data scarcity problem in the medical domain. The primary challenges stem from the lengthy reports that feature complex discourse relations and semantic pathologies. Previous works have predominantly focused on instance-wise or token-wise cross-modal alignment, often neglecting the importance of pathological-level consistency. This paper presents a novel framework PLACE that promotes the Pathological-Level Alignment and enriches the fine-grained details via Correlation Exploration without additional human annotations. Specifically, we propose a novel pathological-level cross-modal alignment (PCMA) approach to maximize the consistency of pathology observations from both images and reports. To facilitate this, a Visual Pathology Observation Extractor is introduced to extract visual pathological observation representations from localized tokens. The PCMA module operates independently of any external disease annotations, enhancing the generalizability and robustness of our methods. Furthermore, we design a proxy task that enforces the model to identify correlations among image patches, thereby enriching the fine-grained details crucial for various downstream tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves new state-of-the-art performance on multiple downstream tasks, including classification, image-to-text retrieval, semantic segmentation, object detection and report generation.

<p>Abstract: Diffusion models are advancing autonomous driving by enabling realistic data synthesis, predictive end-to-end planning, and closed-loop simulation, with a primary focus on temporally consistent generation. However, large-scale 3D scene generation requiring spatial coherence remains underexplored. In this paper, we present X-Scene, a novel framework for large-scale driving scene generation that achieves geometric intricacy, appearance fidelity, and flexible controllability. Specifically, X-Scene supports multi-granular control, including low-level layout conditioning driven by user input or text for detailed scene composition, and high-level semantic guidance informed by user intent and LLM-enriched prompts for efficient customization. To enhance geometric and visual fidelity, we introduce a unified pipeline that sequentially generates 3D semantic occupancy and corresponding multi-view images and videos, ensuring alignment and temporal consistency across modalities. We further extend local regions into large-scale scenes via consistency-aware outpainting, which extrapolates occupancy and images from previously generated areas to maintain spatial and visual coherence. The resulting scenes are lifted into high-quality 3DGS representations, supporting diverse applications such as simulation and scene exploration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that X-Scene substantially advances controllability and fidelity in large-scale scene generation, empowering data generation and simulation for autonomous driving.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have enabled high-quality video generation, but the additional temporal dimension significantly increases computational costs, making training and inference on long videos prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we identify a phenomenon we term Spatiotemporal Energy Decay in video diffusion models: post-softmax attention scores diminish as spatial and temporal distance between tokens increase, akin to the physical decay of signal or waves over space and time in nature. Motivated by this, we propose Radial Attention, a scalable sparse attention mechanism with $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$ complexity that translates energy decay into exponentially decaying compute density, which is significantly more efficient than standard $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ dense attention and more expressive than linear attention. Specifically, Radial Attention employs a simple, static attention mask where each token attends to spatially nearby tokens, with the attention window size shrinking with temporal distance. Moreover, it allows pre-trained video diffusion models to extend their generation length with efficient LoRA-based fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that Radial Attention maintains video quality across Wan2.1-14B, HunyuanVideo, and Mochi 1, achieving up to a 1.9$\times$ speedup over the original dense attention. With minimal tuning, it enables video generation up to 4$\times$ longer while reducing training costs by up to 4.4$\times$ compared to direct fine-tuning and accelerating inference by up to 3.7$\times$ compared to dense attention inference.

<p>Abstract: The increasing realism of multimodal content has made misinformation more subtle and harder to detect, especially in news media where images are frequently paired with bilingual (e.g., Chinese-English) subtitles. Such content often includes localized image edits and cross-lingual inconsistencies that jointly distort meaning while remaining superficially plausible. We introduce BiMi, a bilingual multimodal framework that jointly performs region-level localization, cross-modal and cross-lingual consistency detection, and natural language explanation for misinformation analysis. To support generalization, BiMi integrates an online retrieval module that supplements model reasoning with up-to-date external context. We further release BiMiBench, a large-scale and comprehensive benchmark constructed by systematically editing real news images and subtitles, comprising 104,000 samples with realistic manipulations across visual and linguistic modalities. To enhance interpretability, we apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve explanation quality, marking the first use of GRPO in this domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BiMi outperforms strong baselines by up to +8.9 in classification accuracy, +15.9 in localization accuracy, and +2.5 in explanation BERTScore, advancing state-of-the-art performance in realistic, multilingual misinformation detection.

<p>Abstract: Understanding 3D scenes goes beyond simply recognizing objects; it requires reasoning about the spatial and semantic relationships between them. Current 3D scene-language models often struggle with this relational understanding, particularly when visual embeddings alone do not adequately convey the roles and interactions of objects. In this paper, we introduce Descrip3D, a novel and powerful framework that explicitly encodes the relationships between objects using natural language. Unlike previous methods that rely only on 2D and 3D embeddings, Descrip3D enhances each object with a textual description that captures both its intrinsic attributes and contextual relationships. These relational cues are incorporated into the model through a dual-level integration: embedding fusion and prompt-level injection. This allows for unified reasoning across various tasks such as grounding, captioning, and question answering, all without the need for task-specific heads or additional supervision. When evaluated on five benchmark datasets, including ScanRefer, Multi3DRefer, ScanQA, SQA3D, and Scan2Cap, Descrip3D consistently outperforms strong baseline models, demonstrating the effectiveness of language-guided relational representation for understanding complex indoor scenes.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaxuan Song, Jianan Fan, Hang Chang, Weidong Cai</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurately predicting gene expression from histopathology images offers a scalable and non-invasive approach to molecular profiling, with significant implications for precision medicine and computational pathology. However, existing methods often underutilize the cross-modal representation alignment between histopathology images and gene expression profiles across multiple representational levels, thereby limiting their prediction performance. To address this, we propose Gene-DML, a unified framework that structures latent space through Dual-pathway Multi-Level discrimination to enhance correspondence between morphological and transcriptional modalities. The multi-scale instance-level discrimination pathway aligns hierarchical histopathology representations extracted at local, neighbor, and global levels with gene expression profiles, capturing scale-aware morphological-transcriptional relationships. In parallel, the cross-level instance-group discrimination pathway enforces structural consistency between individual (image/gene) instances and modality-crossed (gene/image, respectively) groups, strengthening the alignment across modalities. By jointly modeling fine-grained and structural-level discrimination, Gene-DML is able to learn robust cross-modal representations, enhancing both predictive accuracy and generalization across diverse biological contexts. Extensive experiments on public spatial transcriptomics datasets demonstrate that Gene-DML achieves state-of-the-art performance in gene expression prediction.

<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show promise for image-based regression tasks, but current approaches face key limitations. Recent methods fine-tune MLLMs using preset output vocabularies and generic task-level prompts (e.g., "How would you rate this image?"), assuming this mimics human rating behavior. Our analysis reveals that these approaches provide no benefit over image-only training. Models using preset vocabularies and generic prompts perform equivalently to image-only models, failing to leverage semantic understanding from textual input. We propose Regression via Transformer-Based Classification (RvTC), which replaces vocabulary-constrained classification with a flexible bin-based approach. Unlike approaches that address discretization errors through complex distributional modeling, RvTC eliminates manual vocabulary crafting through straightforward bin increase, achieving state-of-the-art performance on four image assessment datasets using only images. More importantly, we demonstrate that data-specific prompts dramatically improve performance. Unlike generic task descriptions, prompts containing semantic information about specific images enable MLLMs to leverage cross-modal understanding. On the AVA dataset, adding challenge titles to prompts substantially improves our already state-of-the-art image-only baseline. We demonstrate through empirical evidence from the AVA and AGIQA-3k datasets that MLLMs benefit from semantic prompt information, surpassing mere statistical biases. We validate RvTC across two different MLLM architectures, demonstrating consistent improvements and method generalizability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simin Huo, Ning Li</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Iwin Transformer, a novel position-embedding-free hierarchical vision transformer, which can be fine-tuned directly from low to high resolution, through the collaboration of innovative interleaved window attention and depthwise separable convolution. This approach uses attention to connect distant tokens and applies convolution to link neighboring tokens, enabling global information exchange within a single module, overcoming Swin Transformer's limitation of requiring two consecutive blocks to approximate global attention. Extensive experiments on visual benchmarks demonstrate that Iwin Transformer exhibits strong competitiveness in tasks such as image classification (87.4 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K), semantic segmentation and video action recognition. We also validate the effectiveness of the core component in Iwin as a standalone module that can seamlessly replace the self-attention module in class-conditional image generation. The concepts and methods introduced by the Iwin Transformer have the potential to inspire future research, like Iwin 3D Attention in video generation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuecheng Bai, Yuxiang Wang, Boyu Hu, Qinyuan Jie, Chuanzhi Xu, Kechen Li, Hongru Xiao, Vera Chung</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-light image enhancement remains a challenging task, particularly in preserving object edge continuity and fine structural details under extreme illumination degradation. In this paper, we propose a novel model, DRWKV (Detailed Receptance Weighted Key Value), which integrates our proposed Global Edge Retinex (GER) theory, enabling effective decoupling of illumination and edge structures for enhanced edge fidelity. Secondly, we introduce Evolving WKV Attention, a spiral-scanning mechanism that captures spatial edge continuity and models irregular structures more effectively. Thirdly, we design the Bilateral Spectrum Aligner (Bi-SAB) and a tailored MS2-Loss to jointly align luminance and chrominance features, improving visual naturalness and mitigating artifacts. Extensive experiments on five LLIE benchmarks demonstrate that DRWKV achieves leading performance in PSNR, SSIM, and NIQE while maintaining low computational complexity. Furthermore, DRWKV enhances downstream performance in low-light multi-object tracking tasks, validating its generalization capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zehui Zhao, Laith Alzubaidi, Haider A. Alwzwazy, Jinglan Zhang, Yuantong Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, advanced deep learning architectures have shown strong performance in medical imaging tasks. However, the traditional centralized learning paradigm poses serious privacy risks as all data is collected and trained on a single server. To mitigate this challenge, decentralized approaches such as federated learning and swarm learning have emerged, allowing model training on local nodes while sharing only model weights. While these methods enhance privacy, they struggle with heterogeneous and imbalanced data and suffer from inefficiencies due to frequent communication and the aggregation of weights. More critically, the dynamic and complex nature of clinical environments demands scalable AI systems capable of continuously learning from diverse modalities and multilabels. Yet, both centralized and decentralized models are prone to catastrophic forgetting during system expansion, often requiring full model retraining to incorporate new data. To address these limitations, we propose VGS-ATD, a novel distributed learning framework. To validate VGS-ATD, we evaluate it in experiments spanning 30 datasets and 80 independent labels across distributed nodes, VGS-ATD achieved an overall accuracy of 92.7%, outperforming centralized learning (84.9%) and swarm learning (72.99%), while federated learning failed under these conditions due to high requirements on computational resources. VGS-ATD also demonstrated strong scalability, with only a 1% drop in accuracy on existing nodes after expansion, compared to a 20% drop in centralized learning, highlighting its resilience to catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, it reduced computational costs by up to 50% relative to both centralized and swarm learning, confirming its superior efficiency and scalability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> O\u{g}uzhan B\"uy\"uksolak, \.Ilkay \"Oks\"uz</p>
<p>Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a vital tool for diagnosing heart diseases. However, many disease patterns are derived from outdated datasets and traditional stepwise algorithms with limited accuracy. This study presents a method for direct cardiovascular disease (CVD) diagnosis from ECG images, eliminating the need for digitization. The proposed approach utilizes a two-step curriculum learning framework, beginning with the pre-training of a classification model on segmentation masks, followed by fine-tuning on grayscale, inverted ECG images. Robustness is further enhanced through an ensemble of three models with averaged outputs, achieving an AUC of 0.9534 and an F1 score of 0.7801 on the BHF ECG Challenge dataset, outperforming individual models. By effectively handling real-world artifacts and simplifying the diagnostic process, this method offers a reliable solution for automated CVD diagnosis, particularly in resource-limited settings where printed or scanned ECG images are commonly used. Such an automated procedure enables rapid and accurate diagnosis, which is critical for timely intervention in CVD cases that often demand urgent care.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinwei Liu, Xiaojun Jia, Yuan Xun, Simeng Qin, Xiaochun Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as GPT-4o now demonstrate a remarkable ability to infer users' locations from public shared images, posing a substantial risk to geoprivacy. Although adversarial perturbations offer a potential defense, current methods are ill-suited for this scenario: they often perform poorly on high-resolution images and low perturbation budgets, and may introduce irrelevant semantic content. To address these limitations, we propose GeoShield, a novel adversarial framework designed for robust geoprivacy protection in real-world scenarios. GeoShield comprises three key modules: a feature disentanglement module that separates geographical and non-geographical information, an exposure element identification module that pinpoints geo-revealing regions within an image, and a scale-adaptive enhancement module that jointly optimizes perturbations at both global and local levels to ensure effectiveness across resolutions. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks show that GeoShield consistently surpasses prior methods in black-box settings, achieving strong privacy protection with minimal impact on visual or semantic quality. To our knowledge, this work is the first to explore adversarial perturbations for defending against geolocation inference by advanced VLMs, providing a practical and effective solution to escalating privacy concerns.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fangtai Wu, Mushui Liu, Weijie He, Zhao Wang, Yunlong Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: The unified autoregressive (AR) model excels at multimodal understanding and generation. However, its full potential in the domain of customized image generation has yet to be fully realized. Existing customization approaches for unified AR models face a fundamental dilemma: adaptation-based methods suffer from overfitting and scalability bottlenecks, while concept-injection paradigms are constrained by a shallow injection strategy that leads to poor visual fidelity and impaired re-contextualization. To address this, we propose DCoAR, a novel deep concept injection framework that maintains a completely frozen pre-trained model. DCoAR deeply integrates new concepts through a Layer-wise Multimodal Context Learning (LMCL) strategy, which is stabilized by a multi-faceted regularization scheme: a Dual Prior Preservation (DPP) loss to mitigate semantic drift and a Context-Aware Self-Regularization (CASR) loss to enhance re-contextualization. The framework also enables training-free subject customization in user-provided styles. Experiments demonstrate that DCoAR significantly outperforms previous injection-based methods and achieves performance competitive with adaptation-based approaches while requiring substantially fewer trainable parameters.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zixiang Yang, Yue Ma, Yinhan Zhang, Shanhui Mo, Dongrui Liu, Linfeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual generation includes both image and video generation, training probabilistic models to create coherent, diverse, and semantically faithful content from scratch. While early research focused on unconditional sampling, practitioners now demand controllable generation that allows precise specification of layout, pose, motion, or style. While ControlNet grants precise spatial-temporal control, its auxiliary branch markedly increases latency and introduces redundant computation in both uncontrolled regions and denoising steps, especially for video. To address this problem, we introduce EVCtrl, a lightweight, plug-and-play control adapter that slashes overhead without retraining the model. Specifically, we propose a spatio-temporal dual caching strategy for sparse control information. For spatial redundancy, we first profile how each layer of DiT-ControlNet responds to fine-grained control, then partition the network into global and local functional zones. A locality-aware cache focuses computation on the local zones that truly need the control signal, skipping the bulk of redundant computation in global regions. For temporal redundancy, we selectively omit unnecessary denoising steps to improve efficiency. Extensive experiments on CogVideo-Controlnet, Wan2.1-Controlnet, and Flux demonstrate that our method is effective in image and video control generation without the need for training. For example, it achieves 2.16 and 2.05 times speedups on CogVideo-Controlnet and Wan2.1-Controlnet, respectively, with almost no degradation in generation quality.Codes are available in the supplementary materials.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sukhun Ko, Seokhyun Yoon, Dahyeon Kye, Kyle Min, Chanho Eom, Jihyong Oh</p>
<p>Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) leverage neural networks to map coordinates to corresponding signals, enabling continuous and compact representations. This paradigm has driven significant advances in various vision tasks. However, existing INRs lack frequency selectivity and spatial localization, leading to an over-reliance on redundant signal components. Consequently, they exhibit spectral bias, tending to learn low-frequency components early while struggling to capture fine high-frequency details. To address these issues, we propose FLAIR (Frequency- and Locality-Aware Implicit Neural Representations), which incorporates two key innovations. The first is Band-Localized Activation (BLA), a novel activation designed for joint frequency selection and spatial localization under the constraints of the time-frequency uncertainty principle (TFUP). Through structured frequency control and spatially localized responses, BLA effectively mitigates spectral bias and enhances training stability. The second is Wavelet-Energy-Guided Encoding (WEGE), which leverages the discrete wavelet transform to compute energy scores and explicitly guide frequency information to the network, enabling precise frequency selection and adaptive band control. Our method consistently outperforms existing INRs in 2D image representation, as well as 3D shape reconstruction and novel view synthesis.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable progress in photorealistic image synthesis, yet they remain unreliable for generating scenes with a precise number of object instances, particularly in complex and high-density settings. We present CountLoop, a training-free framework that provides diffusion models with accurate instance control through iterative structured feedback. The approach alternates between image generation and multimodal agent evaluation, where a language-guided planner and critic assess object counts, spatial arrangements, and attribute consistency. This feedback is then used to refine layouts and guide subsequent generations. To further improve separation between objects, especially in occluded scenes, we introduce instance-driven attention masking and compositional generation techniques. Experiments on COCO Count, T2I CompBench, and two new high-instance benchmarks show that CountLoop achieves counting accuracy of up to 98% while maintaining spatial fidelity and visual quality, outperforming layout-based and gradient-guided baselines with a score of 0.97.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junha Song, Yongsik Jo, So Yeon Min, Quanting Xie, Taehwan Kim, Yonatan Bisk, Jaegul Choo</p>
<p>Abstract: Systems such as video chatbots and navigation robots often depend on streaming image captioning to interpret visual inputs. Existing approaches typically employ large multimodal language models (MLLMs) for this purpose, but their substantial computational cost hinders practical application. This limitation motivates our development of a lightweight captioning model. Our investigation begins by replacing the large-scale language component in MLLMs with a compact 125M-parameter model. Surprisingly, this compact model, despite a 93x reduction in size, achieves comparable performance to MLLMs, suggesting that factual image captioning does not significantly require the complex reasoning abilities of LLMs. Despite this promising result, our lightweight model still lacks reliability. To address this, we draw inspiration from the human visual process: perceiving a global and coarse understanding of the scene before attending to finer details. Accordingly, we propose a multimodal self-refinement framework that guides the model to utilize features from salient regions, identified by referencing the previous coarse caption, and to produce a refined description. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our model in both single-sentence and detailed captioning, extending even to long-range video QA tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Feng Wang, Zihao Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has recently emerged as a powerful technique for improving image and video generation in Diffusion and Flow Matching models, specifically for enhancing output quality and alignment with prompts. A critical step for applying online RL methods on Flow Matching is the introduction of stochasticity into the deterministic framework, commonly realized by Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE). Our investigation reveals a significant drawback to this approach: SDE-based sampling introduces pronounced noise artifacts in the generated images, which we found to be detrimental to the reward learning process. A rigorous theoretical analysis traces the origin of this noise to an excess of stochasticity injected during inference. To address this, we draw inspiration from Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) to reformulate the sampling process. Our proposed method, Coefficients-Preserving Sampling (CPS), eliminates these noise artifacts. This leads to more accurate reward modeling, ultimately enabling faster and more stable convergence for reinforcement learning-based optimizers like Flow-GRPO and Dance-GRPO.

<p>Abstract: Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) is a widely used 3D imaging technique in dentistry, providing volumetric information about the anatomical structures of jaws and teeth. Accurate segmentation of these anatomies is critical for clinical applications such as diagnosis and surgical planning, but remains time-consuming and challenging. In this paper, we present U-Mamba2, a new neural network architecture designed for multi-anatomy CBCT segmentation in the context of the ToothFairy3 challenge. U-Mamba2 integrates the Mamba2 state space models into the U-Net architecture, enforcing stronger structural constraints for higher efficiency without compromising performance. In addition, we integrate interactive click prompts with cross-attention blocks, pre-train U-Mamba2 using self-supervised learning, and incorporate dental domain knowledge into the model design to address key challenges of dental anatomy segmentation in CBCT. Extensive experiments, including independent tests, demonstrate that U-Mamba2 is both effective and efficient, securing first place in both tasks of the Toothfairy3 challenge. In Task 1, U-Mamba2 achieved a mean Dice of 0.84, HD95 of 38.17 with the held-out test data, with an average inference time of 40.58s. In Task 2, U-Mamba2 achieved the mean Dice of 0.87 and HD95 of 2.15 with the held-out test data. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/zhiqin1998/UMamba2.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Point cloud data represents a crucial category of information for mathematical modeling, and surface reconstruction from such data is an important task across various disciplines. However, during the scanning process, the collected point cloud data may fail to cover the entire surface due to factors such as high light-absorption rate and occlusions, resulting in incomplete datasets. Inferring surface structures in data-missing regions and successfully reconstructing the surface poses a challenge. In this paper, we present a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) based model for surface reconstruction from incomplete point cloud data. Initially, we employ PCA to estimate the normal information of the underlying surface from the available point cloud data. This estimated normal information serves as a regularizer in our model, guiding the reconstruction of the surface, particularly in areas with missing data. Additionally, we introduce an operator-splitting method to effectively solve the proposed model. Through systematic experimentation, we demonstrate that our model successfully infers surface structures in data-missing regions and well reconstructs the underlying surfaces, outperforming existing methodologies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenbin Teng, Gonglin Chen, Haiwei Chen, Yajie Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved impressive results in world modeling tasks, including novel view generation from sparse inputs. However, most existing diffusion-based NVS methods generate target views jointly via an iterative denoising process, which makes it less straightforward to impose a strictly causal structure along a camera trajectory. In contrast, autoregressive (AR) models operate in a causal fashion, generating each token based on all previously generated tokens. In this work, we introduce ARSS, a novel framework that leverages a GPT-style decoder-only AR model to generate novel views from a single image, conditioned on a predefined camera trajectory. We employ an off-the-shelf video tokenizer to map continuous image sequences into discrete tokens and propose a camera encoder that converts camera trajectories into 3D positional guidance. Then to enhance generation quality while preserving the autoregressive structure, we propose an autoregressive transformer module that randomly permutes the spatial order of tokens while maintaining their temporal order. Qualitative and quantitative experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves overall performance comparable to state-of-the-art view synthesis approaches based on diffusion models.

<p>Abstract: 3D scene understanding is fundamental for embodied AI and robotics, supporting reliable perception for interaction and navigation. Recent approaches achieve zero-shot, open-vocabulary 3D semantic mapping by assigning embedding vectors to 2D class-agnostic masks generated via vision-language models (VLMs) and projecting these into 3D. However, these methods often produce fragmented masks and inaccurate semantic assignments due to the direct use of raw masks, limiting their effectiveness in complex environments. To address this, we leverage SemanticSAM with progressive granularity refinement to generate more accurate and numerous object-level masks, mitigating the over-segmentation commonly observed in mask generation models such as vanilla SAM, and improving downstream 3D semantic segmentation. To further enhance semantic context, we employ a context-aware CLIP encoding strategy that integrates multiple contextual views of each mask using empirically determined weighting, providing much richer visual context. We evaluate our approach on multiple 3D scene understanding tasks, including 3D semantic segmentation and object retrieval from language queries, across several benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Berenice Montalvo-Lezama, Gibran Fuentes-Pineda</p>
<p>Abstract: The limited availability of annotated data presents a major challenge for applying deep learning methods to medical image analysis. Few-shot learning methods aim to recognize new classes from only a small number of labeled examples. These methods are typically studied under the standard few-shot learning setting, where all classes in a task are new. However, medical applications such as pathology classification from chest X-rays often require learning new classes while simultaneously leveraging knowledge of previously known ones, a scenario more closely aligned with generalized few-shot classification. Despite its practical relevance, few-shot learning has been scarcely studied in this context. In this work, we present MetaChest, a large-scale dataset of 479,215 chest X-rays collected from four public databases. MetaChest includes a meta-set partition specifically designed for standard few-shot classification, as well as an algorithm for generating multi-label episodes. We conduct extensive experiments evaluating both a standard transfer learning approach and an extension of ProtoNet across a wide range of few-shot multi-label classification tasks. Our results demonstrate that increasing the number of classes per episode and the number of training examples per class improves classification performance. Notably, the transfer learning approach consistently outperforms the ProtoNet extension, despite not being tailored for few-shot learning. We also show that higher-resolution images improve accuracy at the cost of additional computation, while efficient model architectures achieve comparable performance to larger models with significantly reduced resource requirements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeongjae Lee, Jong Chul Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: While reinforcement learning has advanced the alignment of text-to-image (T2I) models, state-of-the-art policy gradient methods are still hampered by training instability and high variance, hindering convergence speed and compromising image quality. Our analysis identifies a key cause of this instability: disproportionate credit assignment, in which the mathematical structure of the generative sampler produces volatile and non-proportional feedback across timesteps. To address this, we introduce Proportionate Credit Policy Optimization (PCPO), a framework that enforces proportional credit assignment through a stable objective reformulation and a principled reweighting of timesteps. This correction stabilizes the training process, leading to significantly accelerated convergence and superior image quality. The improvement in quality is a direct result of mitigating model collapse, a common failure mode in recursive training. PCPO substantially outperforms existing policy gradient baselines on all fronts, including the state-of-the-art DanceGRPO. Code is available at https://github.com/jaylee2000/pcpo/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangrui Liu, Minghao Qin, Yan Shu, Zhengyang Liang, Yang Tian, Chen Jason Zhang, Bo Zhao, Zheng Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Identifying key temporal intervals within long videos, known as temporal grounding (TG), is important to video understanding and reasoning tasks. In this paper, we introduce a new form of the temporal grounding problem, \textbf{Task-oriented Temporal Grounding} (\textbf{ToTG}), which is driven by the requirements of downstream tasks rather than explicit time-interval descriptions. For example, a ToTG input may be "explain why the man in the video is sent to the hospital," whereas traditional TG would take an explicit temporal description such as "the moments when the man is tripped by a stone and falls to the ground." This new ToTG formulation presents significant challenges for existing TG methods, as it requires jointly performing deep task comprehension and fine-grained temporal localization within long videos. To address these challenges, we conduct a systematic set of studies. First, we construct \textbf{a new benchmark ToTG-Bench}, which comprehensively evaluates ToTG performance across diverse settings. Second, we introduce \textbf{a new temporal-ground method TimeScope}, which performs coarse-to-fine localization through a progressive reasoning process. Leveraging extensive supervised fine-tuning with carefully curated chain-of-thought (CoT) data from a variety of scenarios, TimeScope generalizes effectively across tasks and domains. Our evaluation demonstrates \textbf{TimeScope's empirical advantages} over existing baselines from three perspectives: (1) substantial improvements in grounding precision, (2) significant benefits to downstream tasks, and (3) strong generalizability across different scenarios. All models, datasets, and source code will be fully open-sourced to support future research in this area.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Changlin Song, Yunzhong Hou, Michael Randall Barnes, Rahul Shome, Dylan Campbell</p>
<p>Abstract: Extreme amodal detection is the task of inferring the 2D location of objects that are not fully visible in the input image but are visible within an expanded field-of-view. This differs from amodal detection, where the object is partially visible within the input image, but is occluded. In this paper, we consider the sub-problem of face detection, since this class provides motivating applications involving safety and privacy, but do not tailor our method specifically to this class. Existing approaches rely on image sequences so that missing detections may be interpolated from surrounding frames or make use of generative models to sample possible completions. In contrast, we consider the single-image task and propose a more efficient, sample-free approach that makes use of the contextual cues from the image to infer the presence of unseen faces. We design a heatmap-based extreme amodal object detector that addresses the problem of efficiently predicting a lot (the out-of-frame region) from a little (the image) with a selective coarse-to-fine decoder. Our method establishes strong results for this new task, even outperforming less efficient generative approaches.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haofei Xu, Daniel Barath, Andreas Geiger, Marc Pollefeys</p>
<p>Abstract: While feed-forward Gaussian splatting models offer computational efficiency and can generalize to sparse input settings, their performance is fundamentally constrained by relying on a single forward pass for inference. We propose ReSplat, a feed-forward recurrent Gaussian splatting model that iteratively refines 3D Gaussians without explicitly computing gradients. Our key insight is that the Gaussian splatting rendering error serves as a rich feedback signal, guiding the recurrent network to learn effective Gaussian updates. This feedback signal naturally adapts to unseen data distributions at test time, enabling robust generalization across datasets, view counts and image resolutions. To initialize the recurrent process, we introduce a compact reconstruction model that operates in a $16 \times$ subsampled space, producing $16 \times$ fewer Gaussians than previous per-pixel Gaussian models. This substantially reduces computational overhead and allows for efficient Gaussian updates. Extensive experiments across varying of input views (2, 8, 16, 32), resolutions ($256 \times 256$ to $540 \times 960$), and datasets (DL3DV, RealEstate10K and ACID) demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly reducing the number of Gaussians and improving the rendering speed.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tiancheng Gu, Kaicheng Yang, Kaichen Zhang, Xiang An, Ziyong Feng, Yueyi Zhang, Weidong Cai, Jiankang Deng, Lidong Bing</p>
<p>Abstract: Universal multimodal embedding models are foundational to various tasks. Existing approaches typically employ in-batch negative mining by measuring the similarity of query-candidate pairs. However, these methods often struggle to capture subtle semantic differences among candidates and lack diversity in negative samples. Moreover, the embeddings exhibit limited discriminative ability in distinguishing false and hard negatives. In this paper, we leverage the advanced understanding capabilities of MLLMs to enhance representation learning and present a novel Universal Multimodal Embedding (UniME-V2) model. Our approach first constructs a potential hard negative set through global retrieval. We then introduce the MLLM-as-a-Judge mechanism, which utilizes MLLMs to assess the semantic alignment of query-candidate pairs and generate soft semantic matching scores. These scores serve as a foundation for hard negative mining, mitigating the impact of false negatives and enabling the identification of diverse, high-quality hard negatives. Furthermore, the semantic matching scores are used as soft labels to mitigate the rigid one-to-one mapping constraint. By aligning the similarity matrix with the soft semantic matching score matrix, the model learns semantic distinctions among candidates, significantly enhancing its discriminative capacity. To further improve performance, we propose UniME-V2-Reranker, a reranking model trained on our mined hard negatives through a joint pairwise and listwise optimization approach. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the MMEB benchmark and multiple retrieval tasks, demonstrating that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on average across all tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amith Ananthram, Elias Stengel-Eskin, Lorena A. Bradford, Julia Demarest, Adam Purvis, Keith Krut, Robert Stein, Rina Elster Pantalony, Mohit Bansal, Kathleen McKeown</p>
<p>Abstract: While vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced into detailed image description, evaluation remains a challenge. Standard metrics (e.g. CIDEr, SPICE) were designed for short texts and tuned to recognize errors that are now uncommon, such as object misidentification. In contrast, long texts require sensitivity to attribute and relation attachments and scores that localize errors to particular text spans. In this work, we introduce PoSh, a metric for detailed image description that uses scene graphs as structured rubrics to guide LLMs-as-a-Judge, producing aggregate scores grounded in fine-grained errors (e.g. mistakes in compositional understanding). PoSh is replicable, interpretable and a better proxy for human raters than existing metrics (including GPT4o-as-a-Judge). To validate PoSh, we introduce a challenging new dataset, DOCENT. This novel benchmark contains artwork, paired with expert-written references, and model-generated descriptions, augmented with granular and coarse judgments of their quality from art history students. Thus, DOCENT enables evaluating both detailed image description metrics and detailed image description itself in a challenging new domain. We show that PoSh achieves stronger correlations (+0.05 Spearman $\rho$) with the human judgments in DOCENT than the best open-weight alternatives, is robust to image type (using CapArena, an existing dataset of web imagery) and is a capable reward function, outperforming standard supervised fine-tuning. Then, using PoSh, we characterize the performance of open and closed models in describing the paintings, sketches and statues in DOCENT and find that foundation models struggle to achieve full, error-free coverage of images with rich scene dynamics, establishing a demanding new task to gauge VLM progress. Through both PoSh and DOCENT, we hope to enable advances in important areas such as assistive text generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanke Chen, Yuan Liu, Minchen Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-driven 3D scene generation holds promise for a wide range of applications, from virtual prototyping to AR/VR and simulation. However, existing methods are often constrained to single-object generation, require domain-specific training, or lack support for full 360-degree viewability. In this work, we present a training-free approach to 3D scene synthesis by repurposing general-purpose text-to-3D object diffusion models as modular tile generators. We reformulate scene generation as a multi-tile denoising problem, where overlapping 3D regions are independently generated and seamlessly blended via weighted averaging. This enables scalable synthesis of large, coherent scenes while preserving local semantic control. Our method eliminates the need for scene-level datasets or retraining, relies on minimal heuristics, and inherits the generalization capabilities of object-level priors. We demonstrate that our approach supports diverse scene layouts, efficient generation, and flexible editing, establishing a simple yet powerful foundation for general-purpose, language-driven 3D scene construction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joonghyuk Shin, Zhengqi Li, Richard Zhang, Jun-Yan Zhu, Jaesik Park, Eli Shechtman, Xun Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Current motion-conditioned video generation methods suffer from prohibitive latency (minutes per video) and non-causal processing that prevents real-time interaction. We present MotionStream, enabling sub-second latency with up to 29 FPS streaming generation on a single GPU. Our approach begins by augmenting a text-to-video model with motion control, which generates high-quality videos that adhere to the global text prompt and local motion guidance, but does not perform inference on the fly. As such, we distill this bidirectional teacher into a causal student through Self Forcing with Distribution Matching Distillation, enabling real-time streaming inference. Several key challenges arise when generating videos of long, potentially infinite time-horizons -- (1) bridging the domain gap from training on finite length and extrapolating to infinite horizons, (2) sustaining high quality by preventing error accumulation, and (3) maintaining fast inference, without incurring growth in computational cost due to increasing context windows. A key to our approach is introducing carefully designed sliding-window causal attention, combined with attention sinks. By incorporating self-rollout with attention sinks and KV cache rolling during training, we properly simulate inference-time extrapolations with a fixed context window, enabling constant-speed generation of arbitrarily long videos. Our models achieve state-of-the-art results in motion following and video quality while being two orders of magnitude faster, uniquely enabling infinite-length streaming. With MotionStream, users can paint trajectories, control cameras, or transfer motion, and see results unfold in real-time, delivering a truly interactive experience.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiwei Ren, Tianci Wen, Yongchun Fang, Biao Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: The dominant 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) acceleration methods fail to properly regulate the number of Gaussians during training, causing redundant computational time overhead. In this paper, we propose FastGS, a novel, simple, and general acceleration framework that fully considers the importance of each Gaussian based on multi-view consistency, efficiently solving the trade-off between training time and rendering quality. We innovatively design a densification and pruning strategy based on multi-view consistency, dispensing with the budgeting mechanism. Extensive experiments on Mip-NeRF 360, Tanks & Temples, and Deep Blending datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in training speed, achieving a 3.32$\times$ training acceleration and comparable rendering quality compared with DashGaussian on the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset and a 15.45$\times$ acceleration compared with vanilla 3DGS on the Deep Blending dataset. We demonstrate that FastGS exhibits strong generality, delivering 2-7$\times$ training acceleration across various tasks, including dynamic scene reconstruction, surface reconstruction, sparse-view reconstruction, large-scale reconstruction, and simultaneous localization and mapping.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuanmin Huang, Wenxuan Li, Mi Zhang, Xiaohan Zhang, Xiaoyu You, Min Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks have recently achieved notable progress in 3D point cloud recognition, yet their vulnerability to adversarial perturbations poses critical security challenges in practical deployments. Conventional defense mechanisms struggle to address the evolving landscape of multifaceted attack patterns. Through systematic analysis of existing defenses, we identify that their unsatisfactory performance primarily originates from an entangled feature space, where adversarial attacks can be performed easily. To this end, we present 3D-ANC, a novel approach that capitalizes on the Neural Collapse (NC) mechanism to orchestrate discriminative feature learning. In particular, NC depicts where last-layer features and classifier weights jointly evolve into a simplex equiangular tight frame (ETF) arrangement, establishing maximally separable class prototypes. However, leveraging this advantage in 3D recognition confronts two substantial challenges: (1) prevalent class imbalance in point cloud datasets, and (2) complex geometric similarities between object categories. To tackle these obstacles, our solution combines an ETF-aligned classification module with an adaptive training framework consisting of representation-balanced learning (RBL) and dynamic feature direction loss (FDL). 3D-ANC seamlessly empowers existing models to develop disentangled feature spaces despite the complexity in 3D data distribution. Comprehensive evaluations state that 3D-ANC significantly improves the robustness of models with various structures on two datasets. For instance, DGCNN's classification accuracy is elevated from 27.2% to 80.9% on ModelNet40 -- a 53.7% absolute gain that surpasses leading baselines by 34.0%.</p>

<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence is revealing what medicine never intended to encode. Deep vision models, trained on chest X-rays, can now detect not only disease but also invisible traces of social inequality. In this study, we show that state-of-the-art architectures (DenseNet121, SwinV2-B, MedMamba) can predict a patient's health insurance type, a strong proxy for socioeconomic status, from normal chest X-rays with significant accuracy (AUC around 0.70 on MIMIC-CXR-JPG, 0.68 on CheXpert). The signal was unlikely contributed by demographic features by our machine learning study combining age, race, and sex labels to predict health insurance types; it also remains detectable when the model is trained exclusively on a single racial group. Patch-based occlusion reveals that the signal is diffuse rather than localized, embedded in the upper and mid-thoracic regions. This suggests that deep networks may be internalizing subtle traces of clinical environments, equipment differences, or care pathways; learning socioeconomic segregation itself. These findings challenge the assumption that medical images are neutral biological data. By uncovering how models perceive and exploit these hidden social signatures, this work reframes fairness in medical AI: the goal is no longer only to balance datasets or adjust thresholds, but to interrogate and disentangle the social fingerprints embedded in clinical data itself.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongmei Shan, Wei Lian, Chongxia Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a critical threat to deep learning, especially in safety-sensitive 3D domains such as autonomous driving and robotics. While potent, existing attacks on 3D point clouds are predominantly limited to one-to-one paradigms. The more flexible and universal one-to-N multi-target backdoor threat remains largely unexplored, lacking both theoretical and practical foundations. To bridge this gap, we propose STONE (Spherical Trigger One-to-N universal backdoor Enabling), the first method to instantiate this threat via a configurable spherical trigger design. Its parameterized spatial properties establish a dynamic key space, enabling a single trigger to map to multiple target labels. Theoretically, we ground STONE in a Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) analysis, providing the first formal basis for one-to-N mappings in 3D models. Empirically, extensive evaluations demonstrate high attack success rates (up to 100\%) without compromising clean-data accuracy. This work establishes a foundational benchmark for multi-target backdoor threats under dirty-label and black-box settings in 3D vision -- a crucial step toward securing future intelligent systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zheyuan Zhang, Jiwei Zhang, Boyu Zhou, Linzhimeng Duan, Hong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) aims to determine the geographic location of a query image by retrieving its most visually similar counterpart from a geo-tagged reference database. Recently, the emergence of the powerful visual foundation model, DINOv2, trained in a self-supervised manner on massive datasets, has significantly improved VPR performance. This improvement stems from DINOv2's exceptional feature generalization capabilities but is often accompanied by increased model complexity and computational overhead that impede deployment on resource-constrained devices. To address this challenge, we propose $D^{2}$-VPR, a $D$istillation- and $D$eformable-based framework that retains the strong feature extraction capabilities of visual foundation models while significantly reducing model parameters and achieving a more favorable performance-efficiency trade-off. Specifically, first, we employ a two-stage training strategy that integrates knowledge distillation and fine-tuning. Additionally, we introduce a Distillation Recovery Module (DRM) to better align the feature spaces between the teacher and student models, thereby minimizing knowledge transfer losses to the greatest extent possible. Second, we design a Top-Down-attention-based Deformable Aggregator (TDDA) that leverages global semantic features to dynamically and adaptively adjust the Regions of Interest (ROI) used for aggregation, thereby improving adaptability to irregular structures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Meanwhile, it reduces the parameter count by approximately 64.2% and MACs by about 62.6% (compared to CricaVPR).Code is available at https://github.com/tony19980810/D2VPR.</p>

<p>Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has demonstrated strong generalization across a wide range of visual tasks by leveraging large-scale English-image pairs. However, its extension to low-resource languages remains limited due to the scarcity of high-quality multilingual image-text data. Existing multilingual vision-language models exhibit consistently low retrieval performance in underrepresented languages including Czech, Finnish, Croatian, Hungarian, and Romanian on the Crossmodal-3600 (XM3600) benchmark. To address this, we propose a lightweight and data-efficient framework for multilingual vision-language alignment. Our approach requires no image-text pairs or text-text pairs and freezes both the pretrained image encoder and multilingual text encoder during training. Only a compact 1.7M-parameter projection module is trained, using a contrastive loss over English representations as semantic anchors. This minimal training setup enables robust multilingual alignment even for languages with limited supervision. Extensive evaluation across multiple multilingual retrieval benchmarks confirms the effectiveness of our method, showing significant gains in five underrepresented languages where existing models typically underperform. These findings highlight the effectiveness of our pivot-based, parameter-efficient alignment strategy for inclusive multimodal learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zonghao Ying, Moyang Chen, Nizhang Li, Zhiqiang Wang, Wenxin Zhang, Quanchen Zou, Zonglei Jing, Aishan Liu, Xianglong Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Jailbreak attacks can circumvent model safety guardrails and reveal critical blind spots. Prior attacks on text-to-video (T2V) models typically add adversarial perturbations to obviously unsafe prompts, which are often easy to detect and defend. In contrast, we show that benign-looking prompts containing rich, implicit cues can induce T2V models to generate semantically unsafe videos that both violate policy and preserve the original (blocked) intent. To realize this, we propose VEIL, a jailbreak framework that leverages T2V models' cross-modal associative patterns via a modular prompt design. Specifically, our prompts combine three components: neutral scene anchors, which provide the surface-level scene description extracted from the blocked intent to maintain plausibility; latent auditory triggers, textual descriptions of innocuous-sounding audio events (e.g., creaking, muffled noises) that exploit learned audio-visual co-occurrence priors to bias the model toward particular unsafe visual concepts; and stylistic modulators, cinematic directives (e.g., camera framing, atmosphere) that amplify and stabilize the latent trigger's effect. We formalize attack generation as a constrained optimization over the above modular prompt space and solve it with a guided search procedure that balances stealth and effectiveness. Extensive experiments over 7 T2V models demonstrate the efficacy of our attack, achieving a 23 percent improvement in average attack success rate in commercial models.

<p>Abstract: Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) distills a pre-trained multi-step diffusion model to a few-step one to improve inference efficiency. However, the performance of the latter is often capped by the former. To circumvent this dilemma, we propose DMDR, a novel framework that combines Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques into the distillation process. We show that for the RL of the few-step generator, the DMD loss itself is a more effective regularization compared to the traditional ones. In turn, RL can help to guide the mode coverage process in DMD more effectively. These allow us to unlock the capacity of the few-step generator by conducting distillation and RL simultaneously. Meanwhile, we design the dynamic distribution guidance and dynamic renoise sampling training strategies to improve the initial distillation process. The experiments demonstrate that DMDR can achieve leading visual quality, prompt coherence among few-step methods, and even exhibit performance that exceeds the multi-step teacher.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in computational pathology have leveraged vision-language models to learn joint representations of Hematoxylin and Eosin (HE) images with spatial transcriptomic (ST) profiles. However, existing approaches typically align HE tiles with their corresponding ST profiles at a single scale, overlooking fine-grained cellular structures and their spatial organization. To address this, we propose Sigmma, a multi-modal contrastive alignment framework for learning hierarchical representations of HE images and spatial transcriptome profiles across multiple scales. Sigmma introduces multi-scale contrastive alignment, ensuring that representations learned at different scales remain coherent across modalities. Furthermore, by representing cell interactions as a graph and integrating inter- and intra-subgraph relationships, our approach effectively captures cell-cell interactions, ranging from fine to coarse, within the tissue microenvironment. We demonstrate that Sigmm learns representations that better capture cross-modal correspondences, leading to an improvement of avg. 9.78\% in the gene-expression prediction task and avg. 26.93\% in the cross-modal retrieval task across datasets. We further show that it learns meaningful multi-tissue organization in downstream analyses.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal Action Quality Assessment (AQA) has recently emerged as a promising paradigm. By leveraging complementary information across shared contextual cues, it enhances the discriminative evaluation of subtle intra-class variations in highly similar action sequences. However, partial modalities are frequently unavailable at the inference stage in reality. The absence of any modality often renders existing multimodal models inoperable. Furthermore, it triggers catastrophic performance degradation due to interruptions in cross-modal interactions. To address this issue, we propose a novel Missing Completion Framework with Mixture of Experts (MCMoE) that unifies unimodal and joint representation learning in single-stage training. Specifically, we propose an adaptive gated modality generator that dynamically fuses available information to reconstruct missing modalities. We then design modality experts to learn unimodal knowledge and dynamically mix the knowledge of all experts to extract cross-modal joint representations. With a mixture of experts, missing modalities are further refined and complemented. Finally, in the training phase, we mine the complete multimodal features and unimodal expert knowledge to guide modality generation and generation-based joint representation extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our MCMoE achieves state-of-the-art results in both complete and incomplete multimodal learning on three public AQA benchmarks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyang Han, Junhao Su, Junjie Hu, Peizhen Yang, Hengyu Shi, Junfeng Luo, Jialin Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models today are capable of producing photorealistic, instruction-following images, yet they still frequently fail on prompts that require implicit world knowledge. Existing evaluation protocols either emphasize compositional alignment or rely on single-round VQA-based scoring, leaving critical dimensions such as knowledge grounding, multi-physics interactions, and auditable evidence-substantially undertested. To address these limitations, we introduce PicWorld, the first comprehensive benchmark that assesses the grasp of implicit world knowledge and physical causal reasoning of T2I models. This benchmark consists of 1,100 prompts across three core categories. To facilitate fine-grained evaluation, we propose PW-Agent, an evidence-grounded multi-agent evaluator to hierarchically assess images on their physical realism and logical consistency by decomposing prompts into verifiable visual evidence. We conduct a thorough analysis of 17 mainstream T2I models on PicWorld, illustrating that they universally exhibit a fundamental limitation in their capacity for implicit world knowledge and physical causal reasoning to varying degrees. The findings highlight the need for reasoning-aware, knowledge-integrative architectures in future T2I systems.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zilong Huang, Jun He, Xiaobin Huang, Ziyi Xiong, Yang Luo, Junyan Ye, Weijia Li, Yiping Chen, Ting Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating realistic 3D cities is fundamental to world models, virtual reality, and game development, where an ideal urban scene must satisfy both stylistic diversity, fine-grained, and controllability. However, existing methods struggle to balance the creative flexibility offered by text-based generation with the object-level editability enabled by explicit structural representations. We introduce MajutsuCity, a natural language-driven and aesthetically adaptive framework for synthesizing structurally consistent and stylistically diverse 3D urban scenes. MajutsuCity represents a city as a composition of controllable layouts, assets, and materials, and operates through a four-stage pipeline. To extend controllability beyond initial generation, we further integrate MajutsuAgent, an interactive language-grounded editing agent} that supports five object-level operations. To support photorealistic and customizable scene synthesis, we also construct MajutsuDataset, a high-quality multimodal dataset} containing 2D semantic layouts and height maps, diverse 3D building assets, and curated PBR materials and skyboxes, each accompanied by detailed annotations. Meanwhile, we develop a practical set of evaluation metrics, covering key dimensions such as structural consistency, scene complexity, material fidelity, and lighting atmosphere. Extensive experiments demonstrate MajutsuCity reduces layout FID by 83.7% compared with CityDreamer and by 20.1% over CityCraft. Our method ranks first across all AQS and RDR scores, outperforming existing methods by a clear margin. These results confirm MajutsuCity as a new state-of-the-art in geometric fidelity, stylistic adaptability, and semantic controllability for 3D city generation. We expect our framework can inspire new avenues of research in 3D city generation. Our project page: https://longhz140516.github.io/MajutsuCity/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samuele Dell'Erba, Andrew D. Bagdanov</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have established the state-of-the-art in text-to-image generation, but their performance often relies on a diffusion prior network to translate text embeddings into the visual manifold for easier decoding. These priors are computationally expensive and require extensive training on massive datasets. In this work, we challenge the necessity of a trained prior at all by employing Optimization-based Visual Inversion (OVI), a training-free and data-free alternative, to replace the need for a prior. OVI initializes a latent visual representation from random pseudo-tokens and iteratively optimizes it to maximize the cosine similarity with input textual prompt embedding. We further propose two novel constraints, a Mahalanobis-based and a Nearest-Neighbor loss, to regularize the OVI optimization process toward the distribution of realistic images. Our experiments, conducted on Kandinsky 2.2, show that OVI can serve as an alternative to traditional priors. More importantly, our analysis reveals a critical flaw in current evaluation benchmarks like T2I-CompBench++, where simply using the text embedding as a prior achieves surprisingly high scores, despite lower perceptual quality. Our constrained OVI methods improve visual fidelity over this baseline, with the Nearest-Neighbor approach proving particularly effective, achieving quantitative scores comparable to or higher than the state-of-the-art data-efficient prior, indicating that the idea merits further investigation. The code will be publicly available upon acceptance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenxiang Lin, Maryam Haghighat, Will Browne, Dimity Miller</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have gained popularity for their strong open vocabulary classification performance, but they are prone to assigning high confidence scores to misclassifications, limiting their reliability in safety-critical applications. We introduce a training-free, post-hoc uncertainty estimation method for contrastive VLMs that can be used to detect erroneous predictions. The key to our approach is to measure visual feature consistency within a class, using feature projection combined with multivariate Gaussians to create class-specific probabilistic embeddings. Our method is VLM-agnostic, requires no fine-tuning, demonstrates robustness to distribution shift, and works effectively with as few as 10 training images per class. Extensive experiments on ImageNet, Flowers102, Food101, EuroSAT and DTD show state-of-the-art error detection performance, significantly outperforming both deterministic and probabilistic VLM baselines.

<p>Abstract: The landscape of high-performance image generation models is currently dominated by proprietary systems, such as Nano Banana Pro and Seedream 4.0. Leading open-source alternatives, including Qwen-Image, Hunyuan-Image-3.0 and FLUX.2, are characterized by massive parameter counts (20B to 80B), making them impractical for inference, and fine-tuning on consumer-grade hardware. To address this gap, we propose Z-Image, an efficient 6B-parameter foundation generative model built upon a Scalable Single-Stream Diffusion Transformer (S3-DiT) architecture that challenges the "scale-at-all-costs" paradigm. By systematically optimizing the entire model lifecycle -- from a curated data infrastructure to a streamlined training curriculum -- we complete the full training workflow in just 314K H800 GPU hours (approx. $630K). Our few-step distillation scheme with reward post-training further yields Z-Image-Turbo, offering both sub-second inference latency on an enterprise-grade H800 GPU and compatibility with consumer-grade hardware (<16GB VRAM). Additionally, our omni-pre-training paradigm also enables efficient training of Z-Image-Edit, an editing model with impressive instruction-following capabilities. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our model achieves performance comparable to or surpassing that of leading competitors across various dimensions. Most notably, Z-Image exhibits exceptional capabilities in photorealistic image generation and bilingual text rendering, delivering results that rival top-tier commercial models, thereby demonstrating that state-of-the-art results are achievable with significantly reduced computational overhead. We publicly release our code, weights, and online demo to foster the development of accessible, budget-friendly, yet state-of-the-art generative models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianhao Xie, Linlian Jiang, Xinxin Zuo, Yang Wang, Tiberiu Popa</p>
<p>Abstract: Realistic scene appearance modeling has advanced rapidly with Gaussian Splatting, which enables real-time, high-quality rendering. Recent advances introduced per-primitive textures that incorporate spatial color variations within each Gaussian, improving their expressiveness. However, texture-based Gaussians parameterize appearance with a uniform per-Gaussian sampling grid, allocating equal sampling density regardless of local visual complexity. This leads to inefficient texture space utilization, where high-frequency regions are under-sampled and smooth regions waste capacity, causing blurred appearance and loss of fine structural detail. We introduce FACT-GS, a Frequency-Aligned Complexity-aware Texture Gaussian Splatting framework that allocates texture sampling density according to local visual frequency. Grounded in adaptive sampling theory, FACT-GS reformulates texture parameterization as a differentiable sampling-density allocation problem, replacing the uniform textures with a learnable frequency-aware allocation strategy implemented via a deformation field whose Jacobian modulates local sampling density. Built on 2D Gaussian Splatting, FACT-GS performs non-uniform sampling on fixed-resolution texture grids, preserving real-time performance while recovering sharper high-frequency details under the same parameter budget.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Maaz, Hanoona Rasheed, Fahad Shahbaz Khan, Salman Khan</p>
<p>Abstract: Reasoning over dynamic visual content remains a central challenge for multimodal large language models. Recent thinking models generate explicit reasoning traces for interpretability; however, their reasoning often appears convincing while being logically inconsistent or weakly grounded in visual evidence. We identify and formalize these issues through two diagnostic metrics: Think Answer Consistency (TAC), which measures the alignment between reasoning and answers, and Video Attention Score (VAS), which captures the extent to which reasoning depends on visual versus textual cues. Analysis across 11 video reasoning benchmarks shows that current models rely heavily on linguistic priors rather than visual content. To address this, we propose a reinforcement learning approach that enhances both temporal precision and reasoning consistency. Our approach combines timestamp aware supervised fine tuning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) guided by a novel Temporal Alignment Reward (TAR). This dual step post training stage encourages temporally aligned and causally coherent video reasoning. The resulting model, Video R2, achieves consistently higher TAC, VAS, and accuracy across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating that improvements in temporal alignment and reasoning coherence lead to more accurate and trustworthy video understanding.

<p>Abstract: Recent image editing models boast next-level intelligent capabilities, facilitating cognition- and creativity-informed image editing. Yet, existing benchmarks provide too narrow a scope for evaluation, failing to holistically assess these advanced abilities. To address this, we introduce WiseEdit, a knowledge-intensive benchmark for comprehensive evaluation of cognition- and creativity-informed image editing, featuring deep task depth and broad knowledge breadth. Drawing an analogy to human cognitive creation, WiseEdit decomposes image editing into three cascaded steps, i.e., Awareness, Interpretation, and Imagination, each corresponding to a task that poses a challenge for models to complete at the specific step. It also encompasses complex tasks, where none of the three steps can be finished easily. Furthermore, WiseEdit incorporates three fundamental types of knowledge: Declarative, Procedural, and Metacognitive knowledge. Ultimately, WiseEdit comprises 1,220 test cases, objectively revealing the limitations of SoTA image editing models in knowledge-based cognitive reasoning and creative composition capabilities. The benchmark, evaluation code, and the generated images of each model will be made publicly available soon. Project Page: https://qnancy.github.io/wiseedit_project_page/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boran Wen, Ye Lu, Keyan Wan, Sirui Wang, Jiahong Zhou, Junxuan Liang, Xinpeng Liu, Bang Xiao, Dingbang Huang, Ruiyang Liu, Yong-Lu Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Generalized robots must learn from diverse, large-scale human-object interactions (HOI) to operate robustly in the real world. Monocular internet videos offer a nearly limitless and readily available source of data, capturing an unparalleled diversity of human activities, objects, and environments. However, accurately and scalably extracting 4D interaction data from these in-the-wild videos remains a significant and unsolved challenge. Thus, in this work, we introduce 4DHOISolver, a novel and efficient optimization framework that constrains the ill-posed 4D HOI reconstruction problem by leveraging sparse, human-in-the-loop contact point annotations, while maintaining high spatio-temporal coherence and physical plausibility. Leveraging this framework, we introduce Open4DHOI, a new large-scale 4D HOI dataset featuring a diverse catalog of 144 object types and 103 actions. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our reconstructions by enabling an RL-based agent to imitate the recovered motions. However, a comprehensive benchmark of existing 3D foundation models indicates that automatically predicting precise human-object contact correspondences remains an unsolved problem, underscoring the immediate necessity of our human-in-the-loop strategy while posing an open challenge to the community.

<p>Abstract: A generalist robotic policy needs both semantic understanding for task planning and the ability to interact with the environment through predictive capabilities. To tackle this, we present MM-ACT, a unified Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model that integrates text, image, and action in shared token space and performs generation across all three modalities. MM-ACT adopts a re-mask parallel decoding strategy for text and image generation, and employs a one-step parallel decoding strategy for action generation to improve efficiency. We introduce Context-Shared Multimodal Learning, a unified training paradigm that supervises generation in all three modalities from a shared context, enhancing action generation through cross-modal learning. Experiments were conducted on the LIBERO simulation and Franka real-robot setups as well as RoboTwin2.0 to assess in-domain and out-of-domain performances respectively. Our approach achieves a success rate of 96.3% on LIBERO, 72.0% across three tasks of real Franka, and 52.38% across eight bimanual tasks of RoboTwin2.0 with an additional gain of 9.25% from cross-modal learning.

<p>Abstract: Despite recent text-to-image models achieving highfidelity text rendering, they still struggle with long or multiple texts due to diluted global attention. We propose DCText, a training-free visual text generation method that adopts a divide-and-conquer strategy, leveraging the reliable short-text generation of Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers. Our method first decomposes a prompt by extracting and dividing the target text, then assigns each to a designated region. To accurately render each segment within their regions while preserving overall image coherence, we introduce two attention masks - Text-Focus and Context-Expansion - applied sequentially during denoising. Additionally, Localized Noise Initialization further improves text accuracy and region alignment without increasing computational cost. Extensive experiments on single- and multisentence benchmarks show that DCText achieves the best text accuracy without compromising image quality while also delivering the lowest generation latency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Branches swaying in the breeze, flags rippling in the wind, and boats rocking on the water all show how aerodynamics shape natural motion -- an effect crucial for realism in vision and graphics. In this paper, we present Gaussian Swaying, a surface-based framework for aerodynamic simulation using 3D Gaussians. Unlike mesh-based methods that require costly meshing, or particle-based approaches that rely on discrete positional data, Gaussian Swaying models surfaces continuously with 3D Gaussians, enabling efficient and fine-grained aerodynamic interaction. Our framework unifies simulation and rendering on the same representation: Gaussian patches, which support force computation for dynamics while simultaneously providing normals for lightweight shading. Comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets across multiple metrics demonstrate that Gaussian Swaying achieves state-of-the-art performance and efficiency, offering a scalable approach for realistic aerodynamic scene simulation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Meng Cao, Haokun Lin, Haoyuan Li, Haoran Tang, Rongtao Xu, Dong An, Xue Liu, Ian Reid, Xiaodan Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Spatial reasoning, the ability to understand and interpret the 3D structure of the world, is a critical yet underdeveloped capability in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Current methods predominantly rely on verbal descriptive tuning, which suffers from visual illiteracy, i.e., they learn spatial concepts through textual symbols alone, devoid of connection to their visual manifestations. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces MILO, an Implicit spatIaL wOrld modeling paradigm that simulates human-like spatial imagination. MILO integrates a visual generator to provide geometry-aware feedback, thereby implicitly grounding the MLLM's symbolic reasoning in perceptual experience. Complementing this paradigm, we propose RePE (Relative Positional Encoding), a novel encoding scheme that captures relative camera-pose transformations, offering superior performance over absolute coordinate systems. To support the training, we construct GeoGen, a large-scale Geometry-aware Generative dataset with approximately 2,241 videos and 67,827 observation-action-outcome triplets. Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances spatial reasoning capabilities across multiple baselines and benchmarks, offering a more holistic understanding of 3D space.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite recent progress in multimodal agentic systems, existing approaches often treat image manipulation and web search as disjoint capabilities, rely heavily on costly reinforcement learning, and lack planning grounded in real tool-execution traces. To address these limitations, we present Skywork-R1V4, a 30B (A3B) parameter multimodal agentic model that unifies multimodal planning, active image manipulation ("thinking with images"), deep multimodal search, and, most critically, interleaved reasoning that dynamically alternates between visual operations and external knowledge retrieval. Trained solely via supervised fine-tuning on fewer than 30,000 high-quality, planning-execution-consistent trajectories and validated through stepwise consistency filtering, Skywork-R1V4 achieves state-of-the-art results across perception and multimodal search benchmarks: it scores 66.1 on MMSearch and 67.2 on FVQA, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Flash on all 11 metrics. Skywork-R1V4 exhibits emergent long-horizon reasoning at inference time, successfully orchestrating more than 10 tool calls to solve complex, multi-step tasks. Our results demonstrate that sophisticated agentic multimodal intelligence can be achieved through carefully curated supervised learning alone, without any reliance on reinforcement learning.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce PPTArena, a benchmark for PowerPoint editing that measures reliable modifications to real slides under natural-language instructions. In contrast to image-PDF renderings or text-to-slide generation, PPTArena focuses on in-place editing across 100 decks, 2125 slides, and over 800 targeted edits covering text, charts, tables, animations, and master-level styles. Each case includes a ground-truth deck, a fully specified target outcome, and a dual VLM-as-judge pipeline that separately scores instruction following and visual quality using both structural diffs and slide images. Building on this setting, we propose PPTPilot, a structure-aware slide-editing agent that plans semantic edit sequences, routes between high-level programmatic tools and deterministic XML operations for precise control, and verifies outputs through an iterative plan-edit-check loop against task-specific constraints. In our experiments, PPTPilot outperforms strong proprietary agents and frontier VLM systems by over 10 percentage points on compound, layout-sensitive, and cross-slide edits, with particularly large gains in visual fidelity and deck-wide consistency. Despite these improvements, existing agents still underperform on long-horizon, document-scale tasks in PPTArena, highlighting the remaining challenges in reliable PPT editing.</p>

<p>Abstract: Video generation has achieved remarkable progress in visual fidelity and controllability, enabling conditioning on text, layout, or motion. Among these, motion control - specifying object dynamics and camera trajectories - is essential for composing complex, cinematic scenes, yet existing interfaces remain limited. We introduce LAMP that leverages large language models (LLMs) as motion planners to translate natural language descriptions into explicit 3D trajectories for dynamic objects and (relatively defined) cameras. LAMP defines a motion domain-specific language (DSL), inspired by cinematography conventions. By harnessing program synthesis capabilities of LLMs, LAMP generates structured motion programs from natural language, which are deterministically mapped to 3D trajectories. We construct a large-scale procedural dataset pairing natural text descriptions with corresponding motion programs and 3D trajectories. Experiments demonstrate LAMP's improved performance in motion controllability and alignment with user intent compared to state-of-the-art alternatives establishing the first framework for generating both object and camera motions directly from natural language specifications.

<p>Abstract: The Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated remarkable performance on embodied tasks and shown promising potential for real-world applications. However, current VLAs still struggle to produce consistent and precise target-oriented actions, as they often generate redundant or unstable motions along trajectories, limiting their applicability in time-sensitive scenarios.In this work, we attribute these redundant actions to the spatially uniform perception field of existing VLAs, which causes them to be distracted by target-irrelevant objects, especially in complex environments.To address this issue, we propose an efficient PosA-VLA framework that anchors visual attention via pose-conditioned supervision, consistently guiding the model's perception toward task-relevant regions. The pose-conditioned anchor attention mechanism enables the model to better align instruction semantics with actionable visual cues, thereby improving action generation precision and efficiency. Moreover, our framework adopts a lightweight architecture and requires no auxiliary perception modules (e.g., segmentation or grounding networks), ensuring efficient inference. Extensive experiments verify that our method executes embodied tasks with precise and time-efficient behavior across diverse robotic manipulation benchmarks and shows robust generalization in a variety of challenging environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniele Falcetta, Liane S. Canas, Lorenzo Suppa, Matteo Pentassuglia, Jon Cleary, Marc Modat, S\'ebastien Ourselin, Maria A. Zuluaga</p>
<p>Abstract: We present CaravelMetrics, a computational framework for automated cerebrovascular analysis that models vessel morphology through skeletonization-derived graph representations. The framework integrates atlas-based regional parcellation, centerline extraction, and graph construction to compute fifteen morphometric, topological, fractal, and geometric features. The features can be estimated globally from the complete vascular network or regionally within arterial territories, enabling multiscale characterization of cerebrovascular organization. Applied to 570 3D TOF-MRA scans from the IXI dataset (ages 20-86), CaravelMetrics yields reproducible vessel graphs capturing age- and sex-related variations and education-associated increases in vascular complexity, consistent with findings reported in the literature. The framework provides a scalable and fully automated approach for quantitative cerebrovascular feature extraction, supporting normative modeling and population-level studies of vascular health and aging.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bin Sun, Yaoguang Cao, Yan Wang, Rui Wang, Jiachen Shang, Xiejie Feng, Jiayi Lu, Jia Shi, Shichun Yang, Xiaoyu Yan, Ziying Song</p>
<p>Abstract: End-to-End autonomous driving (E2E-AD) has emerged as a new paradigm, where trajectory planning plays a crucial role. Existing studies mainly follow two directions: trajectory generation oriented, which focuses on producing high-quality trajectories with simple decision mechanisms, and trajectory selection oriented, which performs multi-dimensional evaluation to select the best trajectory yet lacks sufficient generative capability. In this work, we propose MindDrive, a harmonized framework that integrates high-quality trajectory generation with comprehensive decision reasoning. It establishes a structured reasoning paradigm of "context simulation - candidate generation - multi-objective trade-off". In particular, the proposed Future-aware Trajectory Generator (FaTG), based on a World Action Model (WaM), performs ego-conditioned "what-if" simulations to predict potential future scenes and generate foresighted trajectory candidates. Building upon this, the VLM-oriented Evaluator (VLoE) leverages the reasoning capability of a large vision-language model to conduct multi-objective evaluations across safety, comfort, and efficiency dimensions, leading to reasoned and human-aligned decision making. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM-v1 and NAVSIM-v2 benchmarks demonstrate that MindDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance across multi-dimensional driving metrics, significantly enhancing safety, compliance, and generalization. This work provides a promising path toward interpretable and cognitively guided autonomous driving.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Houzhang Fang, Chenxing Wu, Kun Bai, Tianqi Chen, Xiaolin Wang, Xiyang Liu, Yi Chang, Luxin Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) target tracking based on thermal infrared imaging has been one of the most important sensing technologies in anti-UAV applications. However, the infrared UAV targets often exhibit weak features and complex backgrounds, posing significant challenges to accurate tracking. To address these problems, we introduce SiamDFF, a novel dynamic feature fusion Siamese network that integrates feature enhancement and global contextual attention knowledge distillation for infrared UAV target (IRUT) tracking. The SiamDFF incorporates a selective target enhancement network (STEN), a dynamic spatial feature aggregation module (DSFAM), and a dynamic channel feature aggregation module (DCFAM). The STEN employs intensity-aware multi-head cross-attention to adaptively enhance important regions for both template and search branches. The DSFAM enhances multi-scale UAV target features by integrating local details with global features, utilizing spatial attention guidance within the search frame. The DCFAM effectively integrates the mixed template generated from STEN in the template branch and original template, avoiding excessive background interference with the template and thereby enhancing the emphasis on UAV target region features within the search frame. Furthermore, to enhance the feature extraction capabilities of the network for IRUT without adding extra computational burden, we propose a novel tracking-specific target-aware contextual attention knowledge distiller. It transfers the target prior from the teacher network to the student model, significantly improving the student network's focus on informative regions at each hierarchical level of the backbone network. Extensive experiments on real infrared UAV datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art target trackers under complex backgrounds while achieving a real-time tracking speed.</p>

<p>Abstract: Cross-view correspondence is a fundamental capability for spatial understanding and embodied AI. However, it is still far from being realized in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), especially in achieving precise point-level correspondence, which is crucial for precise affordance interaction. So we propose the Cross-View Point Correspondence (CVPC) task and CrossPoint-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark with hierarchical design, inspired by the human cognitive process of "perceive", "reason", and "correspond". Our evaluation shows the state-of-the-art models (e.g., Gemini-2.5-Pro) still fall far behind humans, with a gap of over 54.65% in overall accuracy, exposing a challenge in transitioning from coarse-grained judgement to fine-grained coordinate prediction. To address this problem, we construct CrossPoint-378K, a dataset with 378K question-answering pairs across 900 scenes, focused on actionable affordance regions that better reflect real-world manipulation and interaction scenarios. Furthermore, we propose CroPond that trained on the CrossPoint-378K dataset. Our CroPond achieves state-of-the-art performance on CrossPoint-Bench, surpassing Gemini-2.5-Pro by 39.7% accuracy, which offers a foundation for advancing future work on cross-view correspondence.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin He, Longhui Wei, Jianbo Ouyang, Lingxi Xie, Qi Tian</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose EMMA, an efficient and unified architecture for multimodal understanding, generation and editing. Specifically, EMMA primarily consists of 1) An efficient autoencoder with a 32x compression ratio, which significantly reduces the number of tokens required for generation. This also ensures the training balance between understanding and generation tasks by applying the same compression ratio to images. 2) Channel-wise concatenation instead of token-wise concatenation among visual understanding and generation tokens, which further reduces the visual tokens in unified architectures. 3) A shared-and-decoupled network that enables mutual improvements across tasks while meeting the task-specific modeling requirements. 4) A mixture-of-experts mechanism adopted for visual understanding encoder, which substantially improves perceptual capabilities with a few parameters increase. Extensive experiments have shown that EMMA-4B can significantly outperform state-of-the-art unified multimodal approaches (e.g., BAGEL-7B) in both efficiency and performance, while also achieving competitive results compared to recent multimodal understanding and generation experts (e.g., Qwen3-VL and Qwen-Image). We believe that EMMA lays a solid foundation for the future development of unified multimodal architectures.</p>

<p>Abstract: Autoregressive vision-language-action (VLA) models have recently demonstrated strong capabilities in robotic manipulation. However, their core process of action tokenization often involves a trade-off between reconstruction fidelity and inference efficiency. We introduce FASTer, a unified framework for efficient and generalizable robot learning that integrates a learnable tokenizer with an autoregressive policy built upon it. FASTerVQ encodes action chunks as single-channel images, capturing global spatio-temporal dependencies while maintaining a high compression ratio. FASTerVLA builds on this tokenizer with block-wise autoregressive decoding and a lightweight action expert, achieving both faster inference and higher task performance. Extensive experiments across simulated and real-world benchmarks show that FASTerVQ delivers superior reconstruction quality, high token utilization, and strong cross-task and cross-embodiment generalization, while FASTerVLA further improves overall capability, surpassing previous state-of-the-art VLA models in both inference speed and task performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Zeng, Charles Ochoa, Mingyuan Zhou, Vishal M. Patel, Vitor Guizilini, Rowan McAllister</p>
<p>Abstract: Standard diffusion corrupts data using Gaussian noise whose Fourier coefficients have random magnitudes and random phases. While effective for unconditional or text-to-image generation, corrupting phase components destroys spatial structure, making it ill-suited for tasks requiring geometric consistency, such as re-rendering, simulation enhancement, and image-to-image translation. We introduce Phase-Preserving Diffusion {\phi}-PD, a model-agnostic reformulation of the diffusion process that preserves input phase while randomizing magnitude, enabling structure-aligned generation without architectural changes or additional parameters. We further propose Frequency-Selective Structured (FSS) noise, which provides continuous control over structural rigidity via a single frequency-cutoff parameter. {\phi}-PD adds no inference-time cost and is compatible with any diffusion model for images or videos. Across photorealistic and stylized re-rendering, as well as sim-to-real enhancement for driving planners, {\phi}-PD produces controllable, spatially aligned results. When applied to the CARLA simulator, {\phi}-PD improves CARLA-to-Waymo planner performance by 50\%. The method is complementary to existing conditioning approaches and broadly applicable to image-to-image and video-to-video generation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao-Jen Chien, Yi-Chuan Huang, Chung-Ho Wu, Wei-Lun Chao, Yu-Lun Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Synthesizing high-fidelity frozen 3D scenes from monocular Mannequin-Challenge (MC) videos is a unique problem distinct from standard dynamic scene reconstruction. Instead of focusing on modeling motion, our goal is to create a frozen scene while strategically preserving subtle dynamics to enable user-controlled instant selection. To achieve this, we introduce a novel application of dynamic Gaussian splatting: the scene is modeled dynamically, which retains nearby temporal variation, and a static scene is rendered by fixing the model's time parameter. However, under this usage, monocular capture with sparse temporal supervision introduces artifacts like ghosting and blur for Gaussians that become unobserved or occluded at weakly supervised timestamps. We propose Splannequin, an architecture-agnostic regularization that detects two states of Gaussian primitives, hidden and defective, and applies temporal anchoring. Under predominantly forward camera motion, hidden states are anchored to their recent well-observed past states, while defective states are anchored to future states with stronger supervision. Our method integrates into existing dynamic Gaussian pipelines via simple loss terms, requires no architectural changes, and adds zero inference overhead. This results in markedly improved visual quality, enabling high-fidelity, user-selectable frozen-time renderings, validated by a 96% user preference.

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05513">Know-Show: Benchmarking Video-Language Models on Spatio-Temporal Grounded Reasoning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Chinthani Sugandhika, Chen Li, Deepu Rajan, Basura Fernando</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Video-Language Models (Video-LMs) have achieved impressive progress in multimodal understanding, yet their reasoning remains weakly grounded in space and time. We present Know-Show, a new benchmark designed to evaluate spatio-temporal grounded reasoning, the ability of a model to reason about actions and their semantics while simultaneously grounding its inferences in visual and temporal evidence. Know-Show unifies reasoning and localization within a single evaluation framework consisting of five complementary scenarios across spatial (person, object, person-object, and hand-object) and temporal dimensions. Built from Charades, Action Genome, and Ego4D with 2.5K human-authored questions, the benchmark exposes significant gaps between current Video-LMs and human reasoning. To bridge this gap, we propose GRAM, a training-free plug-in that augments Video-LMs with fine-grained grounding through attention-based video token selection and explicit timestamp encoding. Extensive experiments across open and closed Video-LMs (Qwen, VideoLLaVA, GPT-4o, and Gemini, etc.) reveal that existing models struggle to "show what they know" and vice versa, especially in fine-grained hand-object interactions. Know-Show establishes a unified standard for assessing grounded reasoning in video-language understanding and provides insights toward developing interpretable and reliable multimodal reasoning systems.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chinthani Sugandhika, Chen Li, Deepu Rajan, Basura Fernando</p>
<p>Abstract: Spatio-temporal scene graph generation (ST-SGG) aims to model objects and their evolving relationships across video frames, enabling interpretable representations for downstream reasoning tasks such as video captioning and visual question answering. Despite recent advancements in DETR-style single-stage ST-SGG models, they still suffer from several key limitations. First, while these models rely on attention-based learnable queries as a core component, these learnable queries are semantically uninformed and instance-agnostically initialized. Second, these models rely exclusively on unimodal visual features for predicate classification. To address these challenges, we propose VOST-SGG, a VLM-aided one-stage ST-SGG framework that integrates the common sense reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) into the ST-SGG pipeline. First, we introduce the dual-source query initialization strategy that disentangles what to attend to from where to attend, enabling semantically grounded what-where reasoning. Furthermore, we propose a multi-modal feature bank that fuses visual, textual, and spatial cues derived from VLMs for improved predicate classification. Extensive experiments on the Action Genome dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of integrating VLM-aided semantic priors and multi-modal features for ST-SGG.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiji Zhao, Shukun Xiong, Yao Huang, Yan Jin, Zhenyu Wu, Jiyang Guan, Ranjie Duan, Jialing Tao, Hui Xue, Xingxing Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are widely used in various fields due to their powerful cross-modal comprehension and generation capabilities. However, more modalities bring more vulnerabilities to being utilized for jailbreak attacks, which induces MLLMs to output harmful content. Due to the strong reasoning ability of MLLMs, previous jailbreak attacks try to explore reasoning safety risk in text modal, while similar threats have been largely overlooked in the visual modal. To fully evaluate potential safety risks in the visual reasoning task, we propose Visual Reasoning Sequential Attack (VRSA), which induces MLLMs to gradually externalize and aggregate complete harmful intent by decomposing the original harmful text into several sequentially related sub-images. In particular, to enhance the rationality of the scene in the image sequence, we propose Adaptive Scene Refinement to optimize the scene most relevant to the original harmful query. To ensure the semantic continuity of the generated image, we propose Semantic Coherent Completion to iteratively rewrite each sub-text combined with contextual information in this scene. In addition, we propose Text-Image Consistency Alignment to keep the semantical consistency. A series of experiments demonstrates that the VRSA can achieve a higher attack success rate compared with the state-of-the-art jailbreak attack methods on both the open-source and closed-source MLLMs such as GPT-4o and Claude-4.5-Sonnet.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zitai Wang, Qianqian Xu, Zhiyong Yang, Zhikang Xu, Linchao Zhang, Xiaochun Cao, Qingming Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to the inherent imbalance in real-world datasets, na\"ive Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) tends to bias the learning process towards the majority classes, hindering generalization to minority classes. To rebalance the learning process, one straightforward yet effective approach is to modify the loss function via class-dependent terms, such as re-weighting and logit-adjustment. However, existing analysis of these loss-oriented methods remains coarse-grained and fragmented, failing to explain some empirical results. After reviewing prior work, we find that the properties used through their analysis are typically global, i.e., defined over the whole dataset. Hence, these properties fail to effectively capture how class-dependent terms influence the learning process. To bridge this gap, we turn to explore the localized versions of such properties i.e., defined within each class. Specifically, we employ localized calibration to provide consistency validation across a broader range of losses and localized Lipschitz continuity to provide a fine-grained generalization bound. In this way, we reach a unified perspective for improving and adjusting loss-oriented methods. Finally, a principled learning algorithm is developed based on these insights. Empirical results on both traditional ResNets and foundation models validate our theoretical analyses and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mahdi Tabassian, Somayeh Akbari, Sandro Queir\'os, Jan D'hooge</p>
<p>Abstract: This study presents a deep convolutional autoencoder network for filtering reverberation clutter from transthoracic echocardiographic (TTE) image sequences. Given the spatiotemporal nature of this type of clutter, the filtering network employs 3D convolutional layers to suppress it throughout the cardiac cycle. The design of the network incorporates two key features that contribute to the effectiveness of the filter: 1) an attention mechanism for focusing on cluttered regions and leveraging contextual information, and 2) residual learning for preserving fine image structures. To train the network, a diverse set of artifact patterns was simulated and superimposed onto ultra-realistic synthetic TTE sequences from six ultrasound vendors, generating input for the filtering network. The artifact-free sequences served as ground-truth. Performance of the filtering network was evaluated using unseen synthetic and in vivo artifactual sequences. Results from the in vivo dataset confirmed the network's strong generalization capabilities, despite being trained solely on synthetic data and simulated artifacts. The suitability of the filtered sequences for downstream processing was assessed by computing segmental strain curves. A significant reduction in the discrepancy between strain profiles computed from cluttered and clutter-free segments was observed after filtering the cluttered sequences with the proposed network. The trained network processes a TTE sequence in a fraction of a second, enabling real-time clutter filtering and potentially improving the precision of clinically relevant indices derived from TTE sequences.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marianne Rakic, Hallee E. Wong, Jose Javier Gonzalez Ortiz, Beth Cimini, John Guttag, Adrian V. Dalca</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing learning-based solutions to medical image segmentation have two important shortcomings. First, for most new segmentation task, a new model has to be trained or fine-tuned. This requires extensive resources and machine learning expertise, and is therefore often infeasible for medical researchers and clinicians. Second, most existing segmentation methods produce a single deterministic segmentation mask for a given image. In practice however, there is often considerable uncertainty about what constitutes the correct segmentation, and different expert annotators will often segment the same image differently. We tackle both of these problems with Tyche, a model that uses a context set to generate stochastic predictions for previously unseen tasks without the need to retrain. Tyche differs from other in-context segmentation methods in two important ways. (1) We introduce a novel convolution block architecture that enables interactions among predictions. (2) We introduce in-context test-time augmentation, a new mechanism to provide prediction stochasticity. When combined with appropriate model design and loss functions, Tyche can predict a set of plausible diverse segmentation candidates for new or unseen medical images and segmentation tasks without the need to retrain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianxin Lei, Dongze Wu, Chengcai Xu, Hongcheng Gu, Guangquan Zhou, Junhui Hou, Ping Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Hand-held light field (LF) cameras often exhibit low spatial resolution due to the inherent trade-off between spatial and angular dimensions. Existing supervised learning-based LF spatial super-resolution (SR) methods, which rely on pre-defined image degradation models, struggle to overcome the domain gap between the training phase -- where LFs with natural resolution are used as ground truth -- and the inference phase, which aims to reconstruct higher-resolution LFs, especially when applied to real-world data.To address this challenge, this paper introduces a novel self-supervised learning-based method for LF spatial SR, which can produce higher spatial resolution LF images than originally captured ones without pre-defined image degradation models. The self-supervised method incorporates a hybrid LF imaging prototype, a real-world hybrid LF dataset, and a self-supervised LF spatial SR framework. The prototype makes reference image pairs between low-resolution central-view sub-aperture images and high-resolution (HR) images. The self-supervised framework consists of a well-designed LF spatial SR network with hybrid input, a central-view synthesis network with an HR-aware loss that enables side-view sub-aperture images to learn high-frequency information from the only HR central view reference image, and a backward degradation network with an epipolar-plane image gradient loss to preserve LF parallax structures. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate the significant superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art ones in reconstructing higher spatial resolution LF images without pre-defined degradation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongrui Yu, Hanyu Chen, Zitian Zhang, Qiong Xiao, Wenhui Lei, Linrui Dai, Yu Fu, Hui Tan, Guan Wang, Peng Gao, Xiaofan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the significant success achieved by deep learning methods in medical image segmentation, researchers still struggle in the computer-aided diagnosis of abdominal lymph nodes due to the complex abdominal environment, small and indistinguishable lesions, and limited annotated data. To address these problems, we present a pipeline that integrates the conditional diffusion model for lymph node generation and the nnU-Net model for lymph node segmentation to improve the segmentation performance of abdominal lymph nodes through synthesizing a diversity of realistic abdominal lymph node data. We propose LN-DDPM, a conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) for lymph node (LN) generation. LN-DDPM utilizes lymph node masks and anatomical structure masks as model conditions. These conditions work in two conditioning mechanisms: global structure conditioning and local detail conditioning, to distinguish between lymph nodes and their surroundings and better capture lymph node characteristics. The obtained paired abdominal lymph node images and masks are used for the downstream segmentation task. Experimental results on the abdominal lymph node datasets demonstrate that LN-DDPM outperforms other generative methods in the abdominal lymph node image synthesis and better assists the downstream abdominal lymph node segmentation task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tamir Shor, Moti Freiman, Chaim Baskin, Alex Bronstein</p>
<p>Abstract: Cardiac T1 mapping provides critical quantitative insights into myocardial tissue composition, enabling the assessment of pathologies such as fibrosis, inflammation, and edema. However, the inherently dynamic nature of the heart imposes strict limits on acquisition times, making high-resolution T1 mapping a persistent challenge. Compressed sensing (CS) approaches have reduced scan durations by undersampling k-space and reconstructing images from partial data, and recent studies show that jointly optimizing the undersampling patterns with the reconstruction network can substantially improve performance. Still, most current T1 mapping pipelines rely on static, hand-crafted masks that do not exploit the full acceleration and accuracy potential. In this work, we introduce T1-PILOT: an end-to-end method that explicitly incorporates the T1 signal relaxation model into the sampling-reconstruction framework to guide the learning of non-Cartesian trajectories, crossframe alignment, and T1 decay estimation. Through extensive experiments on the CMRxRecon dataset, T1-PILOT significantly outperforms several baseline strategies (including learned single-mask and fixed radial or golden-angle sampling schemes), achieving higher T1 map fidelity at greater acceleration factors. In particular, we observe consistent gains in PSNR and VIF relative to existing methods, along with marked improvements in delineating finer myocardial structures. Our results highlight that optimizing sampling trajectories in tandem with the physical relaxation model leads to both enhanced quantitative accuracy and reduced acquisition times.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Moein Heidari, Afshin Bozorgpour, AmirHossein Zarif-Fakharnia, Wenjin Chen, Dorit Merhof, David J Foran, Jasmine Grewal, Ilker Hacihaliloglu</p>
<p>Abstract: Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is a key indicator of cardiac function and is routinely used to diagnose heart failure and guide treatment decisions. Although deep learning has advanced automated LVEF estimation, many existing approaches are computationally demanding and underutilize the joint structure of spatial and temporal information in echocardiography videos, limiting their suitability for real-time clinical deployment. We propose Echo-E$^3$Net, an efficient endocardial spatio-temporal network specifically designed for LVEF estimation from echocardiography videos. Echo-E$^3$Net comprises two complementary modules: (1) a dual-phase Endocardial Border Detector (E$^2$CBD), which uses phase-specific cross-attention to predict ED/ES endocardial landmarks (EBs) and learn phase-aware landmark embeddings (LEs), and (2) an Endocardial Feature Aggregator (E$^2$FA), which fuses these embeddings with global statistical descriptors (mean, maximum, variance) of deep feature maps to refine EF regression. A multi-component loss function, inspired by Simpson's biplane method, jointly supervises EF, volumes, and landmark geometry, thereby aligning optimization with the clinical definition of LVEF and promoting robust spatio-temporal representation learning. Evaluated on the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset, Echo-E$^3$Net achieves an RMSE of 5.20 and an $R^2$ score of 0.82, while using only 1.54M parameters and 8.05 GFLOPs. The model operates without external pre-training, heavy data augmentation, or test-time ensembling, making it highly suitable for real-time point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) applications.

<p>Abstract: We introduce MAVERIX (Multimodal audiovisual Evaluation and Recognition IndeX), a unified benchmark to probe the video understanding in multimodal LLMs, encompassing video, audio, text inputs with human performance baselines. Although recent advancements in models with vision and audio understanding capabilities have shown substantial progress, the field lacks a standardized evaluation framework to thoroughly assess their cross-modality comprehension performance. MAVERIX curates 2,556 questions from 700 videos, in the form of both multiple-choice and open-ended formats, explicitly designed to evaluate multimodal models through questions that necessitate tight integration of video and audio information, spanning a broad spectrum of agentic scenarios. MAVERIX uniquely provides models with audiovisual questions, closely mimicking the multimodal perceptual experiences available to humans during inference and decision-making processes. To our knowledge, MAVERIX is the first benchmark aimed explicitly at assessing comprehensive audiovisual integration in such granularity. Experiments with state-of-the-art models, including Qwen 2.5 Omni and Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite, show performance around 64% accuracy, while human experts reach near-ceiling performance of 92.8%, exposing a substantial gap to human-level comprehension. With standardized evaluation protocols, a rigorously annotated pipeline, and a public toolkit, MAVERIX establishes a challenging testbed for advancing audiovisual multimodal intelligence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexey Gavryushin, Xi Wang, Robert J. S. Malate, Chenyu Yang, Davide Liconti, Ren\'e Zurbr\"ugg, Robert K. Katzschmann, Marc Pollefeys</p>
<p>Abstract: Large-scale egocentric video datasets capture diverse human activities across a wide range of scenarios, offering rich and detailed insights into how humans interact with objects, especially those that require fine-grained dexterous control. Such complex, dexterous skills with precise controls are crucial for many robotic manipulation tasks, yet are often insufficiently addressed by traditional data-driven approaches to robotic manipulation. To address this gap, we leverage manipulation priors learned from large-scale egocentric video datasets to improve policy learning for dexterous robotic manipulation tasks. We present MAPLE, a novel method for dexterous robotic manipulation that learns features to predict object contact points and detailed hand poses at the moment of contact from egocentric images. We then use the learned features to train policies for downstream manipulation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of MAPLE across 4 existing simulation benchmarks, as well as a newly designed set of 4 challenging simulation tasks requiring fine-grained object control and complex dexterous skills. The benefits of MAPLE are further highlighted in real-world experiments using a 17 DoF dexterous robotic hand, whereas the simultaneous evaluation across both simulation and real-world experiments has remained underexplored in prior work. We additionally showcase the efficacy of our model on an egocentric contact point prediction task, validating its usefulness beyond dexterous manipulation policy learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Carlo Alberto Barbano, Benoit Dufumier, Edouard Duchesnay, Marco Grangetto, Pietro Gori</p>
<p>Abstract: Estimating brain age from structural MRI has emerged as a powerful tool for characterizing normative and pathological aging. In this work, we explore contrastive learning as a scalable and robust alternative to L1-supervised approaches for brain age estimation. We introduce a novel contrastive loss function, $\mathcal{L}^{exp}$, and evaluate it across multiple public neuroimaging datasets comprising over 20,000 scans. Our experiments reveal four key findings. First, scaling pre-training on diverse, multi-site data consistently improves generalization performance, cutting external mean absolute error (MAE) nearly in half. Second, $\mathcal{L}^{exp}$ is robust to site-related confounds, maintaining low scanner-predictability as training size increases. Third, contrastive models reliably capture accelerated aging in patients with cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease, as shown through brain age gap analysis, ROC curves, and longitudinal trends. Lastly, unlike L1-supervised baselines, $\mathcal{L}^{exp}$ maintains a strong correlation between brain age accuracy and downstream diagnostic performance, supporting its potential as a foundation model for neuroimaging. These results position contrastive learning as a promising direction for building generalizable and clinically meaningful brain representations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boheng Li, Renjie Gu, Junjie Wang, Leyi Qi, Yiming Li, Run Wang, Zhan Qin, Tianwei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have achieved impressive image generation quality and are increasingly fine-tuned for personalized applications. However, these models often inherit unsafe behaviors from toxic pretraining data, raising growing safety concerns. While recent safety-driven unlearning methods have made promising progress in suppressing model toxicity, they are found to be fragile to downstream fine-tuning, as we reveal that state-of-the-art methods largely fail to retain their effectiveness even when fine-tuned on entirely benign datasets. To mitigate this problem, in this paper, we propose ResAlign, a safety-driven unlearning framework with enhanced resilience against downstream fine-tuning. By modeling downstream fine-tuning as an implicit optimization problem with a Moreau envelope-based reformulation, ResAlign enables efficient gradient estimation to minimize the recovery of harmful behaviors. Additionally, a meta-learning strategy is proposed to simulate a diverse distribution of fine-tuning scenarios to improve generalization. Extensive experiments across a wide range of datasets, fine-tuning methods, and configurations demonstrate that ResAlign consistently outperforms prior unlearning approaches in retaining safety, while effectively preserving benign generation capability.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boheng Li, Junjie Wang, Yiming Li, Zhiyang Hu, Leyi Qi, Jianshuo Dong, Run Wang, Han Qiu, Zhan Qin, Tianwei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the integration of safety alignment and external filters, text-to-image (T2I) generative systems are still susceptible to producing harmful content, such as sexual or violent imagery. This raises serious concerns about unintended exposure and potential misuse. Red teaming, which aims to proactively identify diverse prompts that can elicit unsafe outputs from the T2I system, is increasingly recognized as an essential method for assessing and improving safety before real-world deployment. However, existing automated red teaming approaches often treat prompt discovery as an isolated, prompt-level optimization task, which limits their scalability, diversity, and overall effectiveness. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose DREAM, a scalable red teaming framework to automatically uncover diverse problematic prompts from a given T2I system. Unlike prior work that optimizes prompts individually, DREAM directly models the probabilistic distribution of the target system's problematic prompts, which enables explicit optimization over both effectiveness and diversity, and allows efficient large-scale sampling after training. To achieve this without direct access to representative training samples, we draw inspiration from energy-based models and reformulate the objective into a simple and tractable form. We further introduce GC-SPSA, an efficient optimization algorithm that provides stable gradient estimates through the long and potentially non-differentiable T2I pipeline. During inference, we also propose a diversity-aware sampling strategy to enhance prompt variety. The effectiveness of DREAM is validated through extensive experiments, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of T2I models and safety filters in terms of both prompt success rate and diversity.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haohang Xu, Chengjie Liu, Qihang Wang, Wenhao Huang, Yongjian Xu, Weiyu Chen, Anlan Peng, Zhijun Li, Bo Li, Lei Qi, Jun Yang, Yuan Du, Li Du</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) exhibits great potential in designing of analog integrated circuits (IC) because of its excellence in abstraction and generalization for knowledge. However, further development of LLM-based analog ICs heavily relies on textual description of analog ICs, while existing analog ICs are mostly illustrated in image-based circuit diagrams rather than text-based netlists. Converting circuit diagrams to netlists help LLMs to enrich the knowledge of analog IC. Nevertheless, previously proposed conversion frameworks face challenges in further application because of limited support of image styles and circuit elements. Up to now, it still remains a challenging task to effectively convert complex circuit diagrams into netlists. To this end, this paper constructs and opensources a new dataset with rich styles of circuit diagrams as well as balanced distribution of simple and complex analog ICs. And a hybrid framework, named Image2Net, is proposed for practical conversion from circuit diagrams to netlists. The netlist edit distance (NED) is also introduced to precisely assess the difference between the converted netlists and ground truth. Based on our benchmark, Image2Net achieves 80.77% successful rate, which is 34.62%-45.19% higher than previous works. Specifically, the proposed work shows 0.116 averaged NED, which is 62.1%-69.6% lower than state-of-the-arts. Our datasets and benchmark are available at https://github.com/LAD021/ci2n_datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akis Nousias, Stavros Nousias</p>
<p>Abstract: Currently, prominent Transformer architectures applied on graphs and meshes for shape analysis tasks employ traditional attention layers that heavily utilize spectral features requiring costly eigenvalue decomposition-based methods. To encode the mesh structure, these methods derive positional embeddings, that heavily rely on eigenvalue decomposition based operations, e.g. on the Laplacian matrix, or on heat-kernel signatures, which are then concatenated to the input features. This paper proposes a novel approach inspired by the explicit construction of the Hodge Laplacian operator in Discrete Exterior Calculus as a product of discrete Hodge operators and exterior derivatives, i.e. $(L := \star_0^{-1} d_0^T \star_1 d_0)$. We adjust the Transformer architecture in a novel deep learning layer that utilizes the multi-head attention mechanism to approximate Hodge matrices $\star_0$, $\star_1$ and $\star_2$ and learn families of discrete operators $L$ that act on mesh vertices, edges and faces. Our approach results in a computationally-efficient architecture that achieves comparable performance in mesh segmentation and classification tasks, through a direct learning framework, while eliminating the need for costly eigenvalue decomposition operations or complex preprocessing operations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is the dominant paradigm for sharpening strategic tool use capabilities of LLMs on long-horizon, sparsely-rewarded agent tasks, yet it faces a fundamental challenge of exploration-exploitation trade-off. Existing studies stimulate exploration through the lens of policy entropy, but such mechanical entropy maximization is prone to RL instability due to the multi-turn distribution shifting. In this paper, we target the progressive exploration-exploitation balance under the guidance of the agent's own experiences without succumbing to either entropy collapsing or runaway divergence. We propose SPEAR, a self-imitation learning (SIL) recipe for training agentic LLMs. It extends the vanilla SIL, where a replay buffer stores good experience for off-policy update, by gradually steering the policy entropy across stages. Specifically, the proposed curriculum scheduling harmonizes intrinsic reward shaping and self-imitation to 1) expedite exploration via frequent tool interactions at the beginning, and 2) strengthen exploitation of successful tactics upon convergence towards familiarity with the environment. We also combine bag-of-tricks of industrial RL optimizations for a strong baseline Dr.BoT to demonstrate our effectiveness. In ALFWorld and WebShop, SPEAR increases the success rates of GRPO/GiGPO/Dr.BoT by up to 16.1%/5.1%/8.6% and 20.7%/11.8%/13.9%, respectively. In AIME24 and AIME25, SPEAR boosts Dr.BoT by up to 3.8% and 6.1%, respectively. Such gains incur only 10%-25% extra theoretical complexity and negligible runtime overhead in practice, demonstrating the plug-and-play scalability of SPEAR.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jialin Wu, Xiaofeng Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Longitudinal medical visual question answering (Diff-VQA) requires comparing paired studies from different time points and answering questions about clinically meaningful changes. In this setting, the difference signal and the consistency of visual focus across time are more informative than absolute single-image findings. We propose a saliency-guided encoder-decoder for chest X-ray Diff-VQA that turns post-hoc saliency into actionable supervision. The model first performs a lightweight near-identity affine pre-alignment to reduce nuisance motion between visits. It then executes a within-epoch two-step loop: step 1 extracts a medically relevant keyword from the answer and generates keyword-conditioned Grad-CAM on both images to obtain disease-focused saliency; step 2 applies the shared saliency mask to both time points and generates the final answer. This closes the language-vision loop so that the terms that matter also guide where the model looks, enforcing spatially consistent attention on corresponding anatomy. On Medical-Diff-VQA, the approach attains competitive performance on BLEU, ROUGE-L, CIDEr, and METEOR while providing intrinsic interpretability. Notably, the backbone and decoder are general-domain pretrained without radiology-specific pretraining, highlighting practicality and transferability. These results support saliency-conditioned generation with mild pre-alignment as a principled framework for longitudinal reasoning in medical VQA.</p>

<p>Abstract: Embodied agents face a fundamental limitation: once deployed in real-world environments to perform specific tasks, they are unable to acquire additional knowledge to enhance task performance. In this paper, we propose a general post-deployment learning framework Dejavu, which employs an Experience Feedback Network (EFN) and augments the frozen Vision-Language-Action (VLA) policy with retrieved execution memories. EFN identifies contextually prior action experiences and conditions action prediction on this retrieved guidance. We adopt reinforcement learning with semantic similarity rewards to train EFN, ensuring that the predicted actions align with past behaviors under current observations. During deployment, EFN continually enriches its memory with new trajectories, enabling the agent to exhibit "learning from experience". Experiments across diverse embodied tasks show that EFN improves adaptability, robustness, and success rates over frozen baselines. We provide code and demo in our supplementary material.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luxuan Li, Xiao Wang, Chunfeng Cui</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep hashing converts high-dimensional feature vectors into compact binary codes, enabling efficient large-scale retrieval. A fundamental challenge in deep hashing stems from the discrete nature of quantization in generating the codes. W-type regularizations, such as $||z|-1|$, have been proven effective as they encourage variables toward binary values. However, existing methods often directly optimize these regularizations without convergence guarantees. While proximal gradient methods offer a promising solution, the coupling between W-type regularizers and neural network outputs results in composite forms that generally lack closed-form proximal solutions. In this paper, we present a stochastic primal-dual hashing algorithm, referred to as DualHash, that provides rigorous complexity bounds. Using Fenchel duality, we partially transform the nonconvex W-type regularization optimization into the dual space, which results in a proximal operator that admits closed-form solutions. We derive two algorithm instances: a momentum-accelerated version with $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-4})$ complexity and an improved $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-3})$ version using variance reduction. Experiments on three image retrieval databases demonstrate the superior performance of DualHash.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in whole-body robot control have enabled humanoid and legged robots to perform increasingly agile and coordinated motions. However, standardized benchmarks for evaluating these capabilities in real-world settings, and in direct comparison to humans, remain scarce. Existing evaluations often rely on pre-collected human motion datasets or simulation-based experiments, which limit reproducibility, overlook hardware factors, and hinder fair human-robot comparisons. We present Switch-JustDance, a low-cost and reproducible benchmarking pipeline that leverages motion-sensing console games, Just Dance on the Nintendo Switch, to evaluate robot whole-body control. Using Just Dance on the Nintendo Switch as a representative platform, Switch-JustDance converts in-game choreography into robot-executable motions through streaming, motion reconstruction, and motion retargeting modules and enables users to evaluate controller performance through the game's built-in scoring system. We first validate the evaluation properties of Just Dance, analyzing its reliability, validity, sensitivity, and potential sources of bias. Our results show that the platform provides consistent and interpretable performance measures, making it a suitable tool for benchmarking embodied AI. Building on this foundation, we benchmark three state-of-the-art humanoid whole-body controllers on hardware and provide insights into their relative strengths and limitations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiujian Liang, Jiacheng Liu, Mingyang Sun, Qichen He, Cewu Lu, Jianhua Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Robot manipulation in the real world is fundamentally constrained by the visual sim2real gap, where depth observations collected in simulation fail to reflect the complex noise patterns inherent to real sensors. In this work, inspired by the denoising capability of diffusion models, we invert the conventional perspective and propose a clean-to-noisy paradigm that learns to synthesize noisy depth, thereby bridging the visual sim2real gap through purely simulation-driven robotic learning. Building on this idea, we introduce RealD$^2$iff, a hierarchical coarse-to-fine diffusion framework that decomposes depth noise into global structural distortions and fine-grained local perturbations. To enable progressive learning of these components, we further develop two complementary strategies: Frequency-Guided Supervision (FGS) for global structure modeling and Discrepancy-Guided Optimization (DGO) for localized refinement. To integrate RealD$^2$iff seamlessly into imitation learning, we construct a pipeline that spans six stages. We provide comprehensive empirical and experimental validation demonstrating the effectiveness of this paradigm. RealD$^2$iff enables two key applications: (1) generating real-world-like depth to construct clean-noisy paired datasets without manual sensor data collection. (2) Achieving zero-shot sim2real robot manipulation, substantially improving real-world performance without additional fine-tuning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Video generation models are rapidly advancing, but can still struggle with complex video outputs that require significant semantic branching or repeated high-level reasoning about what should happen next. In this paper, we introduce a new class of omni video-text models that integrate ideas from recent LM reasoning advances to address this challenge. More specifically, we present TV2TV, a unified generative modeling framework which decomposes video generation into an interleaved text and video generation process. TV2TV jointly learns language modeling (next-token prediction) and video flow matching (next-frame prediction) using a Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) architecture. At inference time, TV2TV decides when to alternate between generating text and video frames, allowing the model to "think in words" about subsequent content before ``acting in pixels'' to produce frames. This design offloads much of the responsibility for deciding what should happen next to the language modeling tower, enabling improved visual quality and prompt alignment of generated videos. It also enables fine-grained controllability, allowing users to modify the video generation trajectory through text interventions at any point in the process. In controlled experiments on video game data, TV2TV demonstrates substantial improvements in both visual quality and controllability. TV2TV also scales to natural videos, as we show by augmenting sports videos with interleaved natural language action descriptions using vision-language models (VLMs). Training TV2TV on this corpus yields strong visual quality and prompt alignment, showcasing the model's ability to reason about and generate complex real-world action sequences. Together, these results highlight TV2TV as a promising step toward video generation with open-ended textual reasoning and control.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05117">The Universal Weight Subspace Hypothesis</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Prakhar Kaushik, Shravan Chaudhari, Ankit Vaidya, Rama Chellappa, Alan Yuille</p>
<p>Abstract: We show that deep neural networks trained across diverse tasks exhibit remarkably similar low-dimensional parametric subspaces. We provide the first large-scale empirical evidence that demonstrates that neural networks systematically converge to shared spectral subspaces regardless of initialization, task, or domain. Through mode-wise spectral analysis of over 1100 models - including 500 Mistral-7B LoRAs, 500 Vision Transformers, and 50 LLaMA-8B models - we identify universal subspaces capturing majority variance in just a few principal directions. By applying spectral decomposition techniques to the weight matrices of various architectures trained on a wide range of tasks and datasets, we identify sparse, joint subspaces that are consistently exploited, within shared architectures across diverse tasks and datasets. Our findings offer new insights into the intrinsic organization of information within deep networks and raise important questions about the possibility of discovering these universal subspaces without the need for extensive data and computational resources. Furthermore, this inherent structure has significant implications for model reusability, multi-task learning, model merging, and the development of training and inference-efficient algorithms, potentially reducing the carbon footprint of large-scale neural models.</p>
