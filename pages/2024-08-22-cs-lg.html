<p><b>Authors:</b> Kai-liang Lu, Yu-meng Su, Cheng Qiu, Zhuo Bi, Wen-jun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper compared physics-informed neural network (PINN), conventional neural network (NN) and numerical discretization methods on solving differential equations through literature research. We formalized the mathematical framework and computational flow of the soft-constrained PINN method for solving differential equations (e.g., ODEs/PDEs). Its working mechanism and its accuracy and efficiency were experimentally verified by solving typical linear and non-linear oscillator ODEs. The implementation of the PINN method based on DeepXDE is not only light code and efficient in training, but also flexible across platforms. PINN greatly reduces the need for labeled data: when the nonlinearity of the ODE is weak, a very small amount of supervised training data plus a small amount of collocation points are sufficient to predict the solution; in the minimalist case, only one or two training points (with initial values) are needed for first- or second-order ODEs, respectively. Strongly nonlinear ODE also require only an appropriate increase in the number of training and collocation points, which still has significant advantages over conventional NN. With the aid of collocation points and the use of physical information, PINN has the ability to extrapolate data outside the time domain covered by the training set, and is robust to noisy data, thus with enhanced generalization capabilities. Training is accelerated when the gains obtained along with the reduction in the amount of data outweigh the delay caused by the increase in the loss function terms. The soft-constrained PINN method can easily impose a physical law (e.g., energy conservation) constraint by adding a regularization term to the total loss function, thus improving the solution performance of ODEs that obey this physical law.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiang Liu, Mengyu Chu, Nils Thuerey</p>
<p>Abstract: The loss functions of many learning problems contain multiple additive terms that can disagree and yield conflicting update directions. For Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), loss terms on initial/boundary conditions and physics equations are particularly interesting as they are well-established as highly difficult tasks. To improve learning the challenging multi-objective task posed by PINNs, we propose the ConFIG method, which provides conflict-free updates by ensuring a positive dot product between the final update and each loss-specific gradient. It also maintains consistent optimization rates for all loss terms and dynamically adjusts gradient magnitudes based on conflict levels. We additionally leverage momentum to accelerate optimizations by alternating the back-propagation of different loss terms. The proposed method is evaluated across a range of challenging PINN scenarios, consistently showing superior performance and runtime compared to baseline methods. We also test the proposed method in a classic multi-task benchmark, where the ConFIG method likewise exhibits a highly promising performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tom Segal, Asaf Shabtai, Yuval Elovici</p>
<p>Abstract: The utility of large language models (LLMs) depends heavily on the quality and quantity of their training data. Many organizations possess large data corpora that could be leveraged to train or fine-tune LLMs tailored to their specific needs. However, these datasets often come with access restrictions that are based on user privileges and enforced by access control mechanisms. Training LLMs on such datasets could result in exposure of sensitive information to unauthorized users. A straightforward approach for preventing such exposure is to train a separate model for each access level. This, however, may result in low utility models due to the limited amount of training data per model compared to the amount in the entire organizational corpus. Another approach is to train a single LLM on all the data while limiting the exposure of unauthorized information. However, current exposure-limiting methods for LLMs are ineffective for access-controlled data, where sensitive information appears frequently across many training examples. We propose DOMBA - double model balancing - a simple approach for training and deploying LLMs that provides high utility and access-control functionality with security guarantees. DOMBA aggregates the probability distributions of two models, each trained on documents with (potentially many) different access levels, using a "min-bounded" average function (a function that is bounded by the smaller value, e.g., harmonic mean). A detailed mathematical analysis and extensive evaluation show that DOMBA safeguards restricted information while offering utility comparable to non-secure models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jian Wang, Xin Lan, Yuxin Tian, Jiancheng Lv</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have made impressive advances in image generation, but they often require large-scale training data to avoid degradation caused by discriminator overfitting. To tackle this issue, we investigate the challenge of training GANs with limited data, and propose a novel regularization method based on the idea of renormalization group (RG) in physics.We observe that in the limited data setting, the gradient pattern that the generator obtains from the discriminator becomes more aggregated over time. In RG context, this aggregated pattern exhibits a high discrepancy from its coarse-grained versions, which implies a high-capacity and sensitive system, prone to overfitting and collapse. To address this problem, we introduce a \textbf{m}ulti-\textbf{s}cale \textbf{s}tructural \textbf{s}elf-\textbf{d}issimilarity (MS$^3$D) regularization, which constrains the gradient field to have a consistent pattern across different scales, thereby fostering a more redundant and robust system. We show that our method can effectively enhance the performance and stability of GANs under limited data scenarios, and even allow them to generate high-quality images with very few data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuanzhe Wang, Alexandre M. Tartakovsky</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose an approximate Bayesian method for quantifying the total uncertainty in inverse PDE solutions obtained with machine learning surrogate models, including operator learning models. The proposed method accounts for uncertainty in the observations and PDE and surrogate models. First, we use the surrogate model to formulate a minimization problem in the reduced space for the maximum a posteriori (MAP) inverse solution. Then, we randomize the MAP objective function and obtain samples of the posterior distribution by minimizing different realizations of the objective function. We test the proposed framework by comparing it with the iterative ensemble smoother and deep ensembling methods for a non-linear diffusion equation with an unknown space-dependent diffusion coefficient. Among other problems, this equation describes groundwater flow in an unconfined aquifer. Depending on the training dataset and ensemble sizes, the proposed method provides similar or more descriptive posteriors of the parameters and states than the iterative ensemble smoother method. Deep ensembling underestimates uncertainty and provides less informative posteriors than the other two methods.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11172">SubgoalXL: Subgoal-based Expert Learning for Theorem Proving</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xueliang Zhao, Lin Zheng, Haige Bo, Changran Hu, Urmish Thakker, Lingpeng Kong</p>
<p>Abstract: Formal theorem proving, a field at the intersection of mathematics and computer science, has seen renewed interest with advancements in large language models (LLMs). This paper introduces SubgoalXL, a novel approach that synergizes subgoal-based proofs with expert learning to enhance LLMs' capabilities in formal theorem proving within the Isabelle environment. SubgoalXL addresses two critical challenges: the scarcity of specialized mathematics and theorem-proving data, and the need for improved multi-step reasoning abilities in LLMs. By optimizing data efficiency and employing subgoal-level supervision, SubgoalXL extracts richer information from limited human-generated proofs. The framework integrates subgoal-oriented proof strategies with an expert learning system, iteratively refining formal statement, proof, and subgoal generators. Leveraging the Isabelle environment's advantages in subgoal-based proofs, SubgoalXL achieves a new state-of-the-art performance of 56.1\% in Isabelle on the standard miniF2F dataset, marking an absolute improvement of 4.9\%. Notably, SubgoalXL successfully solves 41 AMC12, 9 AIME, and 3 IMO problems from miniF2F. These results underscore the effectiveness of maximizing limited data utility and employing targeted guidance for complex reasoning in formal theorem proving, contributing to the ongoing advancement of AI reasoning capabilities.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11181">A Full DAG Score-Based Algorithm for Learning Causal Bayesian Networks with Latent Confounders</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Christophe Gonzales, Amir-Hosein Valizadeh</p>
<p>Abstract: Causal Bayesian networks (CBN) are popular graphical probabilistic models that encode causal relations among variables. Learning their graphical structure from observational data has received a lot of attention in the literature. When there exists no latent (unobserved) confounder, i.e., no unobserved direct common cause of some observed variables, learning algorithms can be divided essentially into two classes: constraint-based and score-based approaches. The latter are often thought to be more robust than the former and to produce better results. However, to the best of our knowledge, when variables are discrete, no score-based algorithm is capable of dealing with latent confounders. This paper introduces the first fully score-based structure learning algorithm searching the space of DAGs (directed acyclic graphs) that is capable of identifying the presence of some latent confounders. It is justified mathematically and experiments highlight its effectiveness.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11185">CRACKS: Crowdsourcing Resources for Analysis and Categorization of Key Subsurface faults</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohit Prabhushankar, Kiran Kokilepersaud, Jorge Quesada, Yavuz Yarici, Chen Zhou, Mohammad Alotaibi, Ghassan AlRegib, Ahmad Mustafa, Yusufjon Kumakov</p>
<p>Abstract: Crowdsourcing annotations has created a paradigm shift in the availability of labeled data for machine learning. Availability of large datasets has accelerated progress in common knowledge applications involving visual and language data. However, specialized applications that require expert labels lag in data availability. One such application is fault segmentation in subsurface imaging. Detecting, tracking, and analyzing faults has broad societal implications in predicting fluid flows, earthquakes, and storing excess atmospheric CO$_2$. However, delineating faults with current practices is a labor-intensive activity that requires precise analysis of subsurface imaging data by geophysicists. In this paper, we propose the $\texttt{CRACKS}$ dataset to detect and segment faults in subsurface images by utilizing crowdsourced resources. We leverage Amazon Mechanical Turk to obtain fault delineations from sections of the Netherlands North Sea subsurface images from (i) $26$ novices who have no exposure to subsurface data and were shown a video describing and labeling faults, (ii) $8$ practitioners who have previously interacted and worked on subsurface data, (iii) one geophysicist to label $7636$ faults in the region. Note that all novices, practitioners, and the expert segment faults on the same subsurface volume with disagreements between and among the novices and practitioners. Additionally, each fault annotation is equipped with the confidence level of the annotator. The paper provides benchmarks on detecting and segmenting the expert labels, given the novice and practitioner labels.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kunal Ghosh, Milica Todorovi\'c, Aki Vehtari, Patrick Rinke</p>
<p>Abstract: Active learning (AL) has shown promise for being a particularly data-efficient machine learning approach. Yet, its performance depends on the application and it is not clear when AL practitioners can expect computational savings. Here, we carry out a systematic AL performance assessment for three diverse molecular datasets and two common scientific tasks: compiling compact, informative datasets and targeted molecular searches. We implemented AL with Gaussian processes (GP) and used the many-body tensor as molecular representation. For the first task, we tested different data acquisition strategies, batch sizes and GP noise settings. AL was insensitive to the acquisition batch size and we observed the best AL performance for the acquisition strategy that combines uncertainty reduction with clustering to promote diversity. However, for optimal GP noise settings, AL did not outperform randomized selection of data points. Conversely, for targeted searches, AL outperformed random sampling and achieved data savings up to 64%. Our analysis provides insight into this task-specific performance difference in terms of target distributions and data collection strategies. We established that the performance of AL depends on the relative distribution of the target molecules in comparison to the total dataset distribution, with the largest computational savings achieved when their overlap is minimal.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11200">UKAN: Unbound Kolmogorov-Arnold Network Accompanied with Accelerated Library</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Alireza Moradzadeh, Lukasz Wawrzyniak, Miles Macklin, Saee G. Paliwal</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we present a GPU-accelerated library for the underlying components of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), along with an algorithm to eliminate bounded grids in KANs. The GPU-accelerated library reduces the computational complexity of Basis Spline (B-spline) evaluation by a factor of $\mathcal{O}$(grid size) compared to existing codes, enabling batch computation for large-scale learning. To overcome the limitations of traditional KANs, we introduce Unbounded KANs (UKANs), which eliminate the need for a bounded grid and a fixed number of B-spline coefficients. To do so, we replace the KAN parameters (B-spline coefficients) with a coefficient generator (CG) model. The inputs to the CG model are designed based on the idea of an infinite symmetric grid extending from negative infinity to positive infinity. The positional encoding of grid group, a sequential collection of B-spline grid indexes, is fed into the CG model, and coefficients are consumed by the efficient implementation (matrix representations) of B-spline functions to generate outputs. We perform several experiments on regression, classification, and generative tasks, which are promising. In particular, UKAN does not require data normalization or a bounded domain for evaluation. Additionally, our benchmarking results indicate the superior memory and computational efficiency of our library compared to existing codes.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce a group of related methods for binary classification tasks using probes of the hidden state activations in large language models (LLMs). Performance is on par with the largest and most advanced LLMs currently available, but requiring orders of magnitude fewer computational resources and not requiring labeled data. This approach involves translating class labels into a semantically rich description, spontaneous symmetry breaking of multilayer perceptron probes for unsupervised learning and inference, training probes to generate confidence scores (prior probabilities) from hidden state activations subject to known constraints via entropy maximization, and selecting the most confident probe model from an ensemble for prediction. These techniques are evaluated on four datasets using five base LLMs.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11240">Asymmetric Graph Error Control with Low Complexity in Causal Bandits</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen Peng, Di Zhang, Urbashi Mitra</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, the causal bandit problem is investigated, in which the objective is to select an optimal sequence of interventions on nodes in a causal graph. It is assumed that the graph is governed by linear structural equations; it is further assumed that both the causal topology and the distribution of interventions are unknown. By exploiting the causal relationships between the nodes whose signals contribute to the reward, interventions are optimized. First, based on the difference between the two types of graph identification errors (false positives and negatives), a causal graph learning method is proposed, which strongly reduces sample complexity relative to the prior art by learning sub-graphs. Under the assumption of Gaussian exogenous inputs and minimum-mean squared error weight estimation, a new uncertainty bound tailored to the causal bandit problem is derived. This uncertainty bound drives an upper confidence bound based intervention selection to optimize the reward. To cope with non-stationary bandits, a sub-graph change detection mechanism is proposed, with high sample efficiency. Numerical results compare the new methodology to existing schemes and show a substantial performance improvement in both stationary and non-stationary settings. Compared to existing approaches, the proposed scheme takes 67% fewer samples to learn the causal structure and achieves an average reward gain of 85%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qian Ma, Haitao Mao, Jingzhe Liu, Zhehua Zhang, Chunlin Feng, Yu Song, Yihan Shao, Tianfan Fu, Yao Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning~(SSL) is essential to obtain foundation models in NLP and CV domains via effectively leveraging knowledge in large-scale unlabeled data. The reason for its success is that a suitable SSL design can help the model to follow the neural scaling law, i.e., the performance consistently improves with increasing model and dataset sizes. However, it remains a mystery whether existing SSL in the graph domain can follow the scaling behavior toward building Graph Foundation Models~(GFMs) with large-scale pre-training. In this study, we examine whether existing graph SSL techniques can follow the neural scaling behavior with the potential to serve as the essential component for GFMs. Our benchmark includes comprehensive SSL technique implementations with analysis conducted on both the conventional SSL setting and many new settings adopted in other domains. Surprisingly, despite the SSL loss continuously decreasing, no existing graph SSL techniques follow the neural scaling behavior on the downstream performance. The model performance only merely fluctuates on different data scales and model scales. Instead of the scales, the key factors influencing the performance are the choices of model architecture and pretext task design. This paper examines existing SSL techniques for the feasibility of Graph SSL techniques in developing GFMs and opens a new direction for graph SSL design with the new evaluation prototype.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengyang Li, Wenhao Liang, Chang Dong, Weitong Chen, Dong Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: This study investigates the vulnerability of time series classification models to adversarial attacks, with a focus on how these models process local versus global information under such conditions. By leveraging the Normalized Auto Correlation Function (NACF), an exploration into the inclination of neural networks is conducted. It is demonstrated that regularization techniques, particularly those employing Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) methods and targeting frequency components of perturbations, markedly enhance the effectiveness of attacks. Meanwhile, the defense strategies, like noise introduction and Gaussian filtering, are shown to significantly lower the Attack Success Rate (ASR), with approaches based on noise introducing notably effective in countering high-frequency distortions. Furthermore, models designed to prioritize global information are revealed to possess greater resistance to adversarial manipulations. These results underline the importance of designing attack and defense mechanisms, informed by frequency domain analysis, as a means to considerably reinforce the resilience of neural network models against adversarial threats.</p>

This paper delves into the inverse problem, aiming to recover the intrinsic model parameters given the leverage scores gradient. This endeavor not only enriches the theoretical understanding of models trained with leverage score techniques but also has substantial implications for data privacy and adversarial security. We specifically scrutinize the inversion of the leverage score gradient, denoted as $g(x)$. An innovative iterative algorithm is introduced for the approximate resolution of the regularized least squares problem stated as $\min_{x \in \mathbb{R}^d} 0.5 \|g(x) - c\|_2^2 + 0.5\|\mathrm{diag}(w)Ax\|_2^2$. Our algorithm employs subsampled leverage score distributions to compute an approximate Hessian in each iteration, under standard assumptions, considerably mitigating the time complexity. Given that a total of $T = \log(\| x_0 - x^* \|_2/ \epsilon)$ iterations are required, the cost per iteration is optimized to the order of $O( (\mathrm{nnz}(A) + d^{\omega} ) \cdot \mathrm{poly}(\log(n/\delta))$, where $\mathrm{nnz}(A)$ denotes the number of non-zero entries of $A$.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Donghoon Kim, Minjong Yoo, Honguk Woo</p>
<p>Abstract: Goal-conditioned (GC) policy learning often faces a challenge arising from the sparsity of rewards, when confronting long-horizon goals. To address the challenge, we explore skill-based GC policy learning in offline settings, where skills are acquired from existing data and long-horizon goals are decomposed into sequences of near-term goals that align with these skills. Specifically, we present an `offline GC policy learning via skill-step abstraction' framework (GLvSA) tailored for tackling long-horizon GC tasks affected by goal distribution shifts. In the framework, a GC policy is progressively learned offline in conjunction with the incremental modeling of skill-step abstractions on the data. We also devise a GC policy hierarchy that not only accelerates GC policy learning within the framework but also allows for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of the policy. Through experiments with the maze and Franka kitchen environments, we demonstrate the superiority and efficiency of our GLvSA framework in adapting GC policies to a wide range of long-horizon goals. The framework achieves competitive zero-shot and few-shot adaptation performance, outperforming existing GC policy learning and skill-based methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liang Zhang, Guannan Liu, Junjie Wu, Yong Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: While the classic Prospect Theory has highlighted the reference-dependent and comparative nature of consumers' product evaluation processes, few models have successfully integrated this theoretical hypothesis into data-driven preference quantification, particularly in the realm of recommender systems development. To bridge this gap, we propose a new research problem of modeling reference-dependent preferences from a data-driven perspective, and design a novel deep learning-based framework named Attributed Reference-dependent Choice Model for Recommendation (ArcRec) to tackle the inherent challenges associated with this problem. ArcRec features in building a reference network from aggregated historical purchase records for instantiating theoretical reference points, which is then decomposed into product attribute specific sub-networks and represented through Graph Neural Networks. In this way, the reference points of a consumer can be encoded at the attribute-level individually from her past experiences but also reflect the crowd influences. ArcRec also makes novel contributions to quantifying consumers' reference-dependent preferences using a deep neural network-based utility function that integrates both interest-inspired and price-inspired preferences, with their complex interaction effects captured by an attribute-aware price sensitivity mechanism. Most importantly, ArcRec introduces a novel Attribute-level Willingness-To-Pay measure to the reference-dependent utility function, which captures a consumer's heterogeneous salience of product attributes via observing her attribute-level price tolerance to a product. Empirical evaluations on both synthetic and real-world online shopping datasets demonstrate ArcRec's superior performances over fourteen state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinho Choi, Sivaram Krishnan, Jihong Park</p>
<p>Abstract: The Koopman autoencoder, a data-driven technique, has gained traction for modeling nonlinear dynamics using deep learning methods in recent years. Given the linear characteristics inherent to the Koopman operator, controlling its eigenvalues offers an opportunity to enhance long-term prediction performance, a critical task for forecasting future trends in time-series datasets with long-term behaviors. However, controlling eigenvalues is challenging due to high computational complexity and difficulties in managing them during the training process. To tackle this issue, we propose leveraging the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the Koopman matrix to adjust the singular values for better long-term prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that, during training, the loss term for singular values effectively brings the eigenvalues close to the unit circle, and the proposed approach outperforms existing baseline methods for long-term prediction tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanzi Mei, Dongqi Cai, Ao Zhou, Shangguang Wang, Mengwei Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) push the boundaries of AI capabilities, their demand for data is growing. Much of this data is private and distributed across edge devices, making Federated Learning (FL) a de-facto alternative for fine-tuning (i.e., FedLLM). However, it faces significant challenges due to the inherent heterogeneity among clients, including varying data distributions and diverse task types. Towards a versatile FedLLM, we replace traditional dense model with a sparsely-activated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, whose parallel feed-forward networks enable greater flexibility. To make it more practical in resource-constrained environments, we present FedMoE, the efficient personalized FL framework to address data heterogeneity, constructing an optimal sub-MoE for each client and bringing the knowledge back to global MoE. FedMoE is composed of two fine-tuning stages. In the first stage, FedMoE simplifies the problem by conducting a heuristic search based on observed activation patterns, which identifies a suboptimal submodel for each client. In the second stage, these submodels are distributed to clients for further training and returned for server aggregating through a novel modular aggregation strategy. Meanwhile, FedMoE progressively adjusts the submodels to optimal through global expert recommendation. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over previous personalized FL methods.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11306">KAN4TSF: Are KAN and KAN-based models Effective for Time Series Forecasting?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiao Han, Xinfeng Zhang, Yiling Wu, Zhenduo Zhang, Zhe Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series forecasting is a crucial task that predicts the future values of variables based on historical data. Time series forecasting techniques have been developing in parallel with the machine learning community, from early statistical learning methods to current deep learning methods. Although existing methods have made significant progress, they still suffer from two challenges. The mathematical theory of mainstream deep learning-based methods does not establish a clear relation between network sizes and fitting capabilities, and these methods often lack interpretability. To this end, we introduce the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) into time series forecasting research, which has better mathematical properties and interpretability. First, we propose the Reversible Mixture of KAN experts (RMoK) model, which is a KAN-based model for time series forecasting. RMoK uses a mixture-of-experts structure to assign variables to KAN experts. Then, we compare performance, integration, and speed between RMoK and various baselines on real-world datasets, and the experimental results show that RMoK achieves the best performance in most cases. And we find the relationship between temporal feature weights and data periodicity through visualization, which roughly explains RMoK's mechanism. Thus, we conclude that KAN and KAN-based models (RMoK) are effective in time series forecasting. Code is available at KAN4TSF: https://github.com/2448845600/KAN4TSF.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xun Zhou, Liang Feng, Xingyu Wu, Zhichao Lu, Kay Chen Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: Transferable neural architecture search (TNAS) has been introduced to design efficient neural architectures for multiple tasks, to enhance the practical applicability of NAS in real-world scenarios. In TNAS, architectural knowledge accumulated in previous search processes is reused to warm up the architecture search for new tasks. However, existing TNAS methods still search in an extensive search space, necessitating the evaluation of numerous architectures. To overcome this challenge, this work proposes a novel transfer paradigm, i.e., design principle transfer. In this work, the linguistic description of various structural components' effects on architectural performance is termed design principles. They are learned from established architectures and then can be reused to reduce the search space by discarding unpromising architectures. Searching in the refined search space can boost both the search performance and efficiency for new NAS tasks. To this end, a large language model (LLM)-assisted design principle transfer (LAPT) framework is devised. In LAPT, LLM is applied to automatically reason the design principles from a set of given architectures, and then a principle adaptation method is applied to refine these principles progressively based on the new search results. Experimental results show that LAPT can beat the state-of-the-art TNAS methods on most tasks and achieve comparable performance on others.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tajamul Ashraf, Janibul Bashir</p>
<p>Abstract: One of the major challenges of the twenty-first century is climate change, evidenced by rising sea levels, melting glaciers, and increased storm frequency. Accurate temperature forecasting is vital for understanding and mitigating these impacts. Traditional data-driven models often use recurrent neural networks (RNNs) but face limitations in parallelization, especially with longer sequences. To address this, we introduce a novel approach based on the FocalNet Transformer architecture. Our Focal modulation Attention Encoder (FATE) framework operates in a multi-tensor format, utilizing tensorized modulation to capture spatial and temporal nuances in meteorological data. Comparative evaluations against existing transformer encoders, 3D CNNs, LSTM, and ConvLSTM models show that FATE excels at identifying complex patterns in temperature data. Additionally, we present a new labeled dataset, the Climate Change Parameter dataset (CCPD), containing 40 years of data from Jammu and Kashmir on seven climate-related parameters. Experiments with real-world temperature datasets from the USA, Canada, and Europe show accuracy improvements of 12\%, 23\%, and 28\%, respectively, over current state-of-the-art models. Our CCPD dataset also achieved a 24\% improvement in accuracy. To support reproducible research, we have released the source code and pre-trained FATE model at \href{https://github.com/Tajamul21/FATE}{https://github.com/Tajamul21/FATE}.</p>

<p>Abstract: Material characterization using electron micrographs is a crucial but challenging task with applications in various fields, such as semiconductors, quantum materials, batteries, etc. The challenges in categorizing electron micrographs include but are not limited to the complexity of patterns, high level of detail, and imbalanced data distribution(long-tail distribution). Existing methods have difficulty in modeling the complex relational structure in electron micrographs, hindering their ability to effectively capture the complex relationships between different spatial regions of micrographs. We propose a hypergraph neural network(HgNN) backbone architecture, a conceptually alternative approach, to better model the complex relationships in electron micrographs and improve material characterization accuracy. By utilizing cost-effective GPU hardware, our proposed framework outperforms popular baselines. The results of the ablation studies demonstrate that the proposed framework is effective in achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets and efficient in terms of computational and memory requirements for handling large-scale electron micrograph-based datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Anomaly detection is fundamental yet, challenging problem with practical applications in industry. The current approaches neglect the higher-order dependencies within the networks of interconnected sensors in the high-dimensional time series(multisensor data) for anomaly detection. To this end, we present a self-adapting anomaly detection framework for joint learning of (a) discrete hypergraph structure and (b) modeling the temporal trends and spatial relations among the interdependent sensors using the hierarchical encoder-decoder architecture to overcome the challenges. The hypergraph representation learning-based framework exploits the relational inductive biases in the hypergraph-structured data to learn the pointwise single-step-ahead forecasts through the self-supervised autoregressive task and predicts the anomalies based on the forecast error. Furthermore, our framework incentivizes learning the anomaly-diagnosis ontology through a differentiable approach. It derives the anomaly information propagation-based computational hypergraphs for root cause analysis and provides recommendations through an offline, optimal predictive control policy to remedy an anomaly. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed method on the benchmark datasets for fair and rigorous comparison with the popular baselines. The proposed method outperforms the baseline models and achieves SOTA performance. We report the ablation studies to support the efficacy of the framework.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11370">Graph Classification via Reference Distribution Learning: Theory and Practice</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zixiao Wang, Jicong Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph classification is a challenging problem owing to the difficulty in quantifying the similarity between graphs or representing graphs as vectors, though there have been a few methods using graph kernels or graph neural networks (GNNs). Graph kernels often suffer from computational costs and manual feature engineering, while GNNs commonly utilize global pooling operations, risking the loss of structural or semantic information. This work introduces Graph Reference Distribution Learning (GRDL), an efficient and accurate graph classification method. GRDL treats each graph's latent node embeddings given by GNN layers as a discrete distribution, enabling direct classification without global pooling, based on maximum mean discrepancy to adaptively learned reference distributions. To fully understand this new model (the existing theories do not apply) and guide its configuration (e.g., network architecture, references' sizes, number, and regularization) for practical use, we derive generalization error bounds for GRDL and verify them numerically. More importantly, our theoretical and numerical results both show that GRDL has a stronger generalization ability than GNNs with global pooling operations. Experiments on moderate-scale and large-scale graph datasets show the superiority of GRDL over the state-of-the-art, emphasizing its remarkable efficiency, being at least 10 times faster than leading competitors in both training and inference stages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Romit Chatterjee, Vikram Chundawat, Ayush Tarun, Ankur Mali, Murari Mandal</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual learning and machine unlearning are crucial challenges in machine learning, typically addressed separately. Continual learning focuses on adapting to new knowledge while preserving past information, whereas unlearning involves selectively forgetting specific subsets of data. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that jointly tackles both tasks by leveraging controlled knowledge distillation. Our approach enables efficient learning with minimal forgetting and effective targeted unlearning. By incorporating a fixed memory buffer, the system supports learning new concepts while retaining prior knowledge. The distillation process is carefully managed to ensure a balance between acquiring new information and forgetting specific data as needed. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that our method matches or exceeds the performance of existing approaches in both continual learning and machine unlearning. This unified framework is the first to address both challenges simultaneously, paving the way for adaptable models capable of dynamic learning and forgetting while maintaining strong overall performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: The availability of temporal geospatial data in multiple modalities has been extensively leveraged to enhance the performance of machine learning models. While efforts on the design of adequate model architectures are approaching a level of saturation, focusing on a data-centric perspective can complement these efforts to achieve further enhancements in data usage efficiency and model generalization capacities. This work contributes to this direction. We leverage model explanation methods to identify the features crucial for the model to reach optimal performance and the smallest set of features sufficient to achieve this performance. We evaluate our approach on three temporal multimodal geospatial datasets and compare multiple model explanation techniques. Our results reveal that some datasets can reach their optimal accuracy with less than 20% of the temporal instances, while in other datasets, the time series of a single band from a single modality is sufficient.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper proposes an easy-to-use method for one-class classification: Repeated Element-wise Folding (REF). The algorithm consists of repeatedly standardizing and applying an element-wise folding operation on the one-class training data. Equivalent mappings are performed on unknown test items and the classification prediction is based on the item's distance to the origin of the final distribution. As all the included operations have linear time complexity, the proposed algorithm provides a linear-time alternative for the commonly used computationally much more demanding approaches. Furthermore, REF can avoid the challenges of hyperparameter setting in one-class classification by providing robust default settings. The experiments show that the proposed method can produce similar classification performance or even outperform the more complex algorithms on various benchmark datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuyao Sun, Zhenxing Niu, Gang hua, Rong jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern privacy regulations have spurred the evolution of machine unlearning, a technique that enables the removal of data from an already trained ML model without requiring retraining from scratch. Previous unlearning methods tend to induce the model to achieve lowest classification accuracy on the removal data. Nonetheless, the authentic objective of machine unlearning is to align the unlearned model with the gold model, i.e., achieving the same classification accuracy as the gold model. For this purpose, we present a Twin Machine Unlearning (TMU) approach, where a twin unlearning problem is defined corresponding to the original unlearning problem. As a results, the generalization-label predictor trained on the twin problem can be transferred to the original problem, facilitating aligned data removal. Comprehensive empirical experiments illustrate that our approach significantly enhances the alignment between the unlearned model and the gold model. Meanwhile, our method allows data removal without compromising the model accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wuxin Wang, Weicheng Ni, Tao Han, Lei Bai, Boheng Duan, Kaijun Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning (DL) have led to the development of several Large Weather Models (LWMs) that rival state-of-the-art (SOTA) numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems. Up to now, these models still rely on traditional NWP-generated analysis fields as input and are far from being an autonomous system. While researchers are exploring data-driven data assimilation (DA) models to generate accurate initial fields for LWMs, the lack of a standard benchmark impedes the fair evaluation among different data-driven DA algorithms. Here, we introduce DABench, a benchmark dataset utilizing ERA5 data as ground truth to guide the development of end-to-end data-driven weather prediction systems. DABench contributes four standard features: (1) sparse and noisy simulated observations under the guidance of the observing system simulation experiment method; (2) a skillful pre-trained weather prediction model to generate background fields while fairly evaluating the impact of assimilation outcomes on predictions; (3) standardized evaluation metrics for model comparison; (4) a strong baseline called the DA Transformer (DaT). DaT integrates the four-dimensional variational DA prior knowledge into the Transformer model and outperforms the SOTA in physical state reconstruction, named 4DVarNet. Furthermore, we exemplify the development of an end-to-end data-driven weather prediction system by integrating DaT with the prediction model. Researchers can leverage DABench to develop their models and compare performance against established baselines, which will benefit the future advancements of data-driven weather prediction systems. The code is available on this Github repository and the dataset is available at the Baidu Drive.</p>

<p>Abstract: Utilizing deep learning models to learn part-based representations holds significant potential for interpretable-by-design approaches, as these models incorporate latent causes obtained from feature representations through simple addition. However, training a part-based learning model presents challenges, particularly in enforcing non-negative constraints on the model's parameters, which can result in training difficulties such as instability and convergence issues. Moreover, applying such approaches in Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) is even more demanding due to the inherent instabilities that impact many optimization methods. In this paper, we propose a non-negative training approach for actor models in RL, enabling the extraction of part-based representations that enhance interpretability while adhering to non-negative constraints. To this end, we employ a non-negative initialization technique, as well as a modified sign-preserving training method, which can ensure better gradient flow compared to existing approaches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach using the well-known Cartpole benchmark.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study challenges strictly guaranteeing ``dissipativity'' of a dynamical system represented by neural networks learned from given time-series data. Dissipativity is a crucial indicator for dynamical systems that generalizes stability and input-output stability, known to be valid across various systems including robotics, biological systems, and molecular dynamics. By analytically proving the general solution to the nonlinear Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov (KYP) lemma, which is the necessary and sufficient condition for dissipativity, we propose a differentiable projection that transforms any dynamics represented by neural networks into dissipative ones and a learning method for the transformed dynamics. Utilizing the generality of dissipativity, our method strictly guarantee stability, input-output stability, and energy conservation of trained dynamical systems. Finally, we demonstrate the robustness of our method against out-of-domain input through applications to robotic arms and fluid dynamics.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengjia Xu, Dingyang Lyu, Jinghui Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: As graphs grow larger, full-batch GNN training becomes hard for single GPU memory. Therefore, to enhance the scalability of GNN training, some studies have proposed sampling-based mini-batch training and distributed graph learning. However, these methods still have drawbacks, such as performance degradation and heavy communication. This paper introduces SliceGCN, a feature-sliced distributed large-scale graph learning method. SliceGCN slices the node features, with each computing device, i.e., GPU, handling partial features. After each GPU processes its share, partial representations are obtained and concatenated to form complete representations, enabling a single GPU's memory to handle the entire graph structure. This aims to avoid the accuracy loss typically associated with mini-batch training (due to incomplete graph structures) and to reduce inter-GPU communication during message passing (the forward propagation process of GNNs). To study and mitigate potential accuracy reductions due to slicing features, this paper proposes feature fusion and slice encoding. Experiments were conducted on six node classification datasets, yielding some interesting analytical results. These results indicate that while SliceGCN does not enhance efficiency on smaller datasets, it does improve efficiency on larger datasets. Additionally, we found that SliceGCN and its variants have better convergence, feature fusion and slice encoding can make training more stable, reduce accuracy fluctuations, and this study also discovered that the design of SliceGCN has a potentially parameter-efficient nature.</p>

<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of learning a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) via general parameterization. Our proposed Primal-Dual based Regularized Accelerated Natural Policy Gradient (PDR-ANPG) algorithm uses entropy and quadratic regularizers to reach this goal. For a parameterized policy class with transferred compatibility approximation error, $\epsilon_{\mathrm{bias}}$, PDR-ANPG achieves a last-iterate $\epsilon$ optimality gap and $\epsilon$ constraint violation (up to some additive factor of $\epsilon_{\mathrm{bias}}$) with a sample complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2}\min\{\epsilon^{-2},\epsilon_{\mathrm{bias}}^{-\frac{1}{3}}\})$. If the class is incomplete ($\epsilon_{\mathrm{bias}}>0$), then the sample complexity reduces to $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$ for $\epsilon<(\epsilon_{\mathrm{bias}})^{\frac{1}{6}}$. Moreover, for complete policies with $\epsilon_{\mathrm{bias}}=0$, our algorithm achieves a last-iterate $\epsilon$ optimality gap and $\epsilon$ constraint violation with $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-4})$ sample complexity. It is a significant improvement of the state-of-the-art last-iterate guarantees of general parameterized CMDPs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Viacheslav Komisarenko, Meelis Kull</p>
<p>Abstract: Proper losses such as cross-entropy incentivize classifiers to produce class probabilities that are well-calibrated on the training data. Due to the generalization gap, these classifiers tend to become overconfident on the test data, mandating calibration methods such as temperature scaling. The focal loss is not proper, but training with it has been shown to often result in classifiers that are better calibrated on test data. Our first contribution is a simple explanation about why focal loss training often leads to better calibration than cross-entropy training. For this, we prove that focal loss can be decomposed into a confidence-raising transformation and a proper loss. This is why focal loss pushes the model to provide under-confident predictions on the training data, resulting in being better calibrated on the test data, due to the generalization gap. Secondly, we reveal a strong connection between temperature scaling and focal loss through its confidence-raising transformation, which we refer to as the focal calibration map. Thirdly, we propose focal temperature scaling - a new post-hoc calibration method combining focal calibration and temperature scaling. Our experiments on three image classification datasets demonstrate that focal temperature scaling outperforms standard temperature scaling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> L\'ena\"ic Chizat</p>
<p>Abstract: Sinkhorn's algorithm is a method of choice to solve large-scale optimal transport (OT) problems. In this context, it involves an inverse temperature parameter $\beta$ that determines the speed-accuracy trade-off. To improve this trade-off, practitioners often use a variant of this algorithm, Annealed Sinkhorn, that uses an nondecreasing sequence $(\beta_t)_{t\in \mathbb{N}}$ where $t$ is the iteration count. However, besides for the schedule $\beta_t=\Theta(\log t)$ which is impractically slow, it is not known whether this variant is guaranteed to actually solve OT. Our first contribution answers this question: we show that a concave annealing schedule asymptotically solves OT if and only if $\beta_t\to+\infty$ and $\beta_t-\beta_{t-1}\to 0$. The proof is based on an equivalence with Online Mirror Descent and further suggests that the iterates of Annealed Sinkhorn follow the solutions of a sequence of relaxed, entropic OT problems, the regularization path. An analysis of this path reveals that, in addition to the well-known "entropic" error in $\Theta(\beta^{-1}_t)$, the annealing procedure induces a "relaxation" error in $\Theta(\beta_{t}-\beta_{t-1})$. The best error trade-off is achieved with the schedule $\beta_t = \Theta(\sqrt{t})$ which, albeit slow, is a universal limitation of this method. Going beyond this limitation, we propose a simple modification of Annealed Sinkhorn that reduces the relaxation error, and therefore enables faster annealing schedules. In toy experiments, we observe the effectiveness of our Debiased Annealed Sinkhorn's algorithm: a single run of this algorithm spans the whole speed-accuracy Pareto front of the standard Sinkhorn's algorithm.</p>

Based on this model, we present PAC-Bayesian generalization bounds for functions that are defined on the trajectory of the learned algorithm, for example, the expected (non-asymptotic) convergence rate and the expected time to reach the stopping criterion. Thus, not only does this model allow for learning stochastic algorithms based on their empirical performance, it also yields results about their actual convergence rate and their actual convergence time. We stress that, since the model is valid in a more general setting than learning-to-optimize, it is of interest for other fields of application, too. Finally, we conduct five practically relevant experiments, showing the validity of our claims.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dani\"el Vos, Sicco Verwer</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning techniques leveraging deep learning have made tremendous progress in recent years. However, the complexity of neural networks prevents practitioners from understanding their behavior. Decision trees have gained increased attention in supervised learning for their inherent interpretability, enabling modelers to understand the exact prediction process after learning. This paper considers the problem of optimizing interpretable decision tree policies to replace neural networks in reinforcement learning settings. Previous works have relaxed the tree structure, restricted to optimizing only tree leaves, or applied imitation learning techniques to approximately copy the behavior of a neural network policy with a decision tree. We propose the Decision Tree Policy Optimization (DTPO) algorithm that directly optimizes the complete decision tree using policy gradients. Our technique uses established decision tree heuristics for regression to perform policy optimization. We empirically show that DTPO is a competitive algorithm compared to imitation learning algorithms for optimizing decision tree policies in reinforcement learning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Random feature attention (RFA) adopts random fourier feature (RFF) methods to approximate the softmax function, resulting in a linear time and space attention mechanism that enables the construction of an efficient Transformer. Inspired by RFA, we propose Macformer, a Transformer architecture that employs random Maclaurin features (RMF) to approximate various dot-product kernels, thereby accelerating attention computations for long sequence. Macformer consists of Random Maclaurin Feature Attention (RMFA) and pre-post Scaling Batch Normalization (ppSBN), the former is an unbiased approximation for dot-product kernelized attention and the later is a two-stage regularization mechanism guaranteeing the error of RMFA. We conducted toy experiments to demonstrate the efficiency of RMFA and ppSBN, and experiments on long range arena (LRA) benchmark to validate the acceleration and accuracy of Macformer with different dot-product kernels. Experiment results of Macformer are consistent with our theoretical analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Longwen Wang, Jianchun Liu, Zhi Liu, Jinyang Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Graph Learning (FGL) is an emerging technology that enables clients to collaboratively train powerful Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in a distributed manner without exposing their private data. Nevertheless, FGL still faces the challenge of the severe non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) nature of graphs, which possess diverse node and edge structures, especially across varied domains. Thus, exploring the knowledge inherent in these structures becomes significantly crucial. Existing methods, however, either overlook the inherent structural knowledge in graph data or capture it at the cost of significantly increased resource demands (e.g., FLOPs and communication bandwidth), which can be detrimental to distributed paradigms. Inspired by this, we propose FedDense, a novel FGL framework that optimizes the utilization efficiency of inherent structural knowledge. To better acquire knowledge of diverse and underexploited structures, FedDense first explicitly encodes the structural knowledge inherent within graph data itself alongside node features. Besides, FedDense introduces a Dual-Densely Connected (DDC) GNN architecture that exploits the multi-scale (i.e., one-hop to multi-hop) feature and structure insights embedded in the aggregated feature maps at each layer. In addition to the exploitation of inherent structures, we consider resource limitations in FGL, devising exceedingly narrow layers atop the DDC architecture and adopting a selective parameter sharing strategy to reduce resource costs substantially. We conduct extensive experiments using 15 datasets across 4 different domains, demonstrating that FedDense consistently surpasses baselines by a large margin in training performance, while demanding minimal resources.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Janani Suresh, Nancy Nayak, Sheetal Kalyani</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial training (AT) incurs significant computational overhead, leading to growing interest in designing inherently robust architectures. We demonstrate that a carefully designed first layer of the neural network can serve as an implicit adversarial noise filter (ANF). This filter is created using a combination of large kernel size, increased convolution filters, and a maxpool operation. We show that integrating this filter as the first layer in architectures such as ResNet, VGG, and EfficientNet results in adversarially robust networks. Our approach achieves higher adversarial accuracies than existing natively robust architectures without AT and is competitive with adversarial-trained architectures across a wide range of datasets. Supporting our findings, we show that (a) the decision regions for our method have better margins, (b) the visualized loss surfaces are smoother, (c) the modified peak signal-to-noise ratio (mPSNR) values at the output of the ANF are higher, (d) high-frequency components are more attenuated, and (e) architectures incorporating ANF exhibit better denoising in Gaussian noise compared to baseline architectures.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziwei Zheng, Huizhi Liang, Vaclav Snasel, Vito Latora, Panos Pardalos, Giuseppe Nicosia, Varun Ojha</p>
<p>Abstract: We scrutinize the structural and operational aspects of deep learning models, particularly focusing on the nuances of learnable parameters (weight) statistics, distribution, node interaction, and visualization. By establishing correlations between variance in weight patterns and overall network performance, we investigate the varying (optimal and suboptimal) performances of various deep-learning models. Our empirical analysis extends across widely recognized datasets such as MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10, and various deep learning models such as deep neural networks (DNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and vision transformer (ViT), enabling us to pinpoint characteristics of learnable parameters that correlate with successful networks. Through extensive experiments on the diverse architectures of deep learning models, we shed light on the critical factors that influence the functionality and efficiency of DNNs. Our findings reveal that successful networks, irrespective of datasets or models, are invariably similar to other successful networks in their converged weights statistics and distribution, while poor-performing networks vary in their weights. In addition, our research shows that the learnable parameters of widely varied deep learning models such as DNN, CNN, and ViT exhibit similar learning characteristics.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11743">MARLIN: Mixed-Precision Auto-Regressive Parallel Inference on Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Elias Frantar, Roberto L. Castro, Jiale Chen, Torsten Hoefler, Dan Alistarh</p>
<p>Abstract: As inference on Large Language Models (LLMs) emerges as an important workload in machine learning applications, weight quantization has become a standard technique for efficient GPU deployment. Quantization not only reduces model size, but has also been shown to yield substantial speedups for single-user inference, due to reduced memory movement, with low accuracy impact. Yet, it remains open whether speedups are achievable also in \emph{batched} settings with multiple parallel clients, which are highly relevant for practical serving. It is unclear whether GPU kernels can be designed to remain practically memory-bound, while supporting the substantially increased compute requirements of batched workloads.
  This paper resolves this question positively by describing the design of Mixed-precision Auto-Regressive LINear kernels, called MARLIN. Concretely, given a model whose weights are compressed via quantization to, e.g., 4 bits per element, MARLIN shows that batchsizes up to 16-32 can be supported with close to maximum ($4\times$) quantization speedup, and larger batchsizes up to 64-128 with gradually decreasing, but still significant, acceleration. MARLIN accomplishes this via a combination of techniques, such as asynchronous memory access, complex task scheduling and pipelining, and bespoke quantization support. Our experiments show that MARLIN's near-optimal performance on individual LLM layers across different scenarios can also lead to end-to-end LLM inference speedups (of up to $2.8\times$) when integrated with the popular vLLM serving engine. Finally, MARLIN is extensible to further compression techniques, like NVIDIA 2:4 sparsity, leading to additional speedups.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pihe Hu, Shaolong Li, Longbo Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides in complex tasks, yet their widespread adoption is impeded by substantial computational demands. With hundreds of billion parameters, transformer-based LLMs necessitate months of pretraining across a high-end GPU cluster. However, this paper reveals a compelling finding: transformers exhibit considerable redundancy in pretraining computations, which motivates our proposed solution, Mixed Sparsity Training (MST), an efficient pretraining method that can reduce about $75\%$ of Floating Point Operations (FLOPs) while maintaining performance. MST integrates dynamic sparse training (DST) with Sparsity Variation (SV) and Hybrid Sparse Attention (HSA) during pretraining, involving three distinct phases: warm-up, ultra-sparsification, and restoration. The warm-up phase transforms the dense model into a sparse one, and the restoration phase reinstates connections. Throughout these phases, the model is trained with a dynamically evolving sparse topology and an HSA mechanism to maintain performance and minimize training FLOPs concurrently. Our experiment on GPT-2 showcases a FLOP reduction of $4\times$ without compromising performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lorenzo Loconte, Stefan Mengel, Antonio Vergari</p>
<p>Abstract: Designing expressive generative models that support exact and efficient inference is a core question in probabilistic ML. Probabilistic circuits (PCs) offer a framework where this tractability-vs-expressiveness trade-off can be analyzed theoretically. Recently, squared PCs encoding subtractive mixtures via negative parameters have emerged as tractable models that can be exponentially more expressive than monotonic PCs, i.e., PCs with positive parameters only. In this paper, we provide a more precise theoretical characterization of the expressiveness relationships among these models. First, we prove that squared PCs can be less expressive than monotonic ones. Second, we formalize a novel class of PCs -- sum of squares PCs -- that can be exponentially more expressive than both squared and monotonic PCs. Around sum of squares PCs, we build an expressiveness hierarchy that allows us to precisely unify and separate different tractable model classes such as Born Machines and PSD models, and other recently introduced tractable probabilistic models by using complex parameters. Finally, we empirically show the effectiveness of sum of squares circuits in performing distribution estimation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Medication nonadherence significantly reduces the effectiveness of therapies, yet it remains prevalent among patients. Nonadherence has been linked to adverse outcomes, including increased risks of mortality and hospitalization. Although various methods exist to help patients track medication schedules, such as the Intelligent Drug Administration System (IDAS) and Smart Blister, these tools often face challenges that hinder their commercial viability. Building on the principles of dosage measurement and information communication in IoT, we introduce the Smart Pill Case a smart health adherence tool that leverages RFID-based data recording and NFC-based data extraction. This system incorporates a load cell for precise dosage measurement and features an Android app to monitor medication intake, offer suggestions, and issue warnings. To enhance the effectiveness and personalization of the Smart Pill Case, we propose integrating federated learning into the system. Federated learning allows the Smart Pill Case to learn from medication adherence patterns across multiple users without compromising individual privacy. By training machine learning models on decentralized data collected from various Smart Pill Cases, the system can continuously improve its recommendations and warnings, adapting to the diverse needs and behaviors of users. This approach not only enhances the tools ability to support medication adherence but also ensures that sensitive user data remains secure and private.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zachary Ankner, Mansheej Paul, Brandon Cui, Jonathan D. Chang, Prithviraj Ammanabrolu</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditionally, reward models used for reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) are trained to directly predict preference scores without leveraging the generation capabilities of the underlying large language model (LLM). This limits the capabilities of reward models as they must reason implicitly about the quality of a response, i.e., preference modeling must be performed in a single forward pass through the model. To enable reward models to reason explicitly about the quality of a response, we introduce Critique-out-Loud (CLoud) reward models. CLoud reward models operate by first generating a natural language critique of the assistant's response that is then used to predict a scalar reward for the quality of the response. We demonstrate the success of CLoud reward models for both Llama-3-8B and 70B base models: compared to classic reward models CLoud reward models improve pairwise preference classification accuracy on RewardBench by 4.65 and 5.84 percentage points for the 8B and 70B base models respectively. Furthermore, CLoud reward models lead to a Pareto improvement for win rate on ArenaHard when used as the scoring model for Best-of-N. Finally, we explore how to exploit the dynamic inference compute capabilities of CLoud reward models by performing self-consistency decoding for reward prediction.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose an empirical approach centered on the spectral dynamics of weights -- the behavior of singular values and vectors during optimization -- to unify and clarify several phenomena in deep learning. We identify a consistent bias in optimization across various experiments, from small-scale ``grokking'' to large-scale tasks like image classification with ConvNets, image generation with UNets, speech recognition with LSTMs, and language modeling with Transformers. We also demonstrate that weight decay enhances this bias beyond its role as a norm regularizer, even in practical systems. Moreover, we show that these spectral dynamics distinguish memorizing networks from generalizing ones, offering a novel perspective on this longstanding conundrum. Additionally, we leverage spectral dynamics to explore the emergence of well-performing sparse subnetworks (lottery tickets) and the structure of the loss surface through linear mode connectivity. Our findings suggest that spectral dynamics provide a coherent framework to better understand the behavior of neural networks across diverse settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the face of difficult exploration problems in reinforcement learning, we study whether giving an agent an object-centric mapping (describing a set of items and their attributes) allow for more efficient learning. We found this problem is best solved hierarchically by modelling items at a higher level of state abstraction to pixels, and attribute change at a higher level of temporal abstraction to primitive actions. This abstraction simplifies the transition dynamic by making specific future states easier to predict. We make use of this to propose a fully model-based algorithm that learns a discriminative world model, plans to explore efficiently with only a count-based intrinsic reward, and can subsequently plan to reach any discovered (abstract) states.
  We demonstrate the model's ability to (i) efficiently solve single tasks, (ii) transfer zero-shot and few-shot across item types and environments, and (iii) plan across long horizons. Across a suite of 2D crafting and MiniHack environments, we empirically show our model significantly out-performs state-of-the-art low-level methods (without abstraction), as well as performant model-free and model-based methods using the same abstraction. Finally, we show how to reinforce learn low level object-perturbing policies, as well as supervise learn the object mapping itself.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaehyun Nam, Woomin Song, Seong Hyeon Park, Jihoon Tack, Sukmin Yun, Jaehyung Kim, Kyu Hwan Oh, Jinwoo Shin</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning with a limited number of labeled data is a central problem in real-world applications of machine learning, as it is often expensive to obtain annotations. To deal with the scarcity of labeled data, transfer learning is a conventional approach; it suggests to learn a transferable knowledge by training a neural network from multiple other sources. In this paper, we investigate transfer learning of tabular tasks, which has been less studied and successful in the literature, compared to other domains, e.g., vision and language. This is because tables are inherently heterogeneous, i.e., they contain different columns and feature spaces, making transfer learning difficult. On the other hand, recent advances in natural language processing suggest that the label scarcity issue can be mitigated by utilizing in-context learning capability of large language models (LLMs). Inspired by this and the fact that LLMs can also process tables within a unified language space, we ask whether LLMs can be effective for tabular transfer learning, in particular, under the scenarios where the source and target datasets are of different format. As a positive answer, we propose a novel tabular transfer learning framework, coined Prompt to Transfer (P2T), that utilizes unlabeled (or heterogeneous) source data with LLMs. Specifically, P2T identifies a column feature in a source dataset that is strongly correlated with a target task feature to create examples relevant to the target task, thus creating pseudo-demonstrations for prompts. Experimental results demonstrate that P2T outperforms previous methods on various tabular learning benchmarks, showing good promise for the important, yet underexplored tabular transfer learning problem.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongqi Ding, Lin Zuo, Mengmeng Jing, Kunshan Yang, Biao Chen, Yunqian Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) transmit information via low-power binary spikes and have received widespread attention in areas such as computer vision and reinforcement learning. However, there have been very few explorations of SNNs in more practical industrial scenarios. In this paper, we focus on the application of SNNs in bearing fault diagnosis to facilitate the integration of high-performance AI algorithms and real-world industries. In particular, we identify two key limitations of existing SNN fault diagnosis methods: inadequate encoding capacity that necessitates cumbersome data preprocessing, and non-spike-oriented architectures that constrain the performance of SNNs. To alleviate these problems, we propose a Multi-scale Residual Attention SNN (MRA-SNN) to simultaneously improve the efficiency, performance, and robustness of SNN methods. By incorporating a lightweight attention mechanism, we have designed a multi-scale attention encoding module to extract multiscale fault features from vibration signals and encode them as spatio-temporal spikes, eliminating the need for complicated preprocessing. Then, the spike residual attention block extracts high-dimensional fault features and enhances the expressiveness of sparse spikes with the attention mechanism for end-to-end diagnosis. In addition, the performance and robustness of MRA-SNN is further enhanced by introducing the lightweight attention mechanism within the spiking neurons to simulate the biological dendritic filtering effect. Extensive experiments on MFPT and JNU benchmark datasets demonstrate that MRA-SNN significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy, energy consumption and noise robustness, and is more feasible for deployment in real-world industrial scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Code-LLMs, LLMs pre-trained on large code corpora, have shown great progress in learning rich representations of the structure and syntax of code, successfully using it to generate or classify code fragments. At the same time, understanding if they are able to do so because they capture code semantics, and how well, is still an open question. In this paper, we tackle this problem by introducing SeqCoBench, a benchmark for systematically assessing how Code-LLMs can capture code functional equivalence. SeqCoBench contains over 20 code transformations that either preserve or alter the semantics of Python programs. We conduct extensive evaluations in different settings, including zero-shot and parameter-efficient finetuning methods on state-of-the-art (Code-)LLMs to see if they can discern semantically equivalent or different pairs of programs in SeqCoBench. We find that the performance gap between these LLMs and classical match-based retrieval scores is minimal, with both approaches showing a concerning lack of depth in understanding code semantics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Hu, Jie Wang, Xin Chen, Niao He</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider stochastic optimization when one only has access to biased stochastic oracles of the objective and the gradient, and obtaining stochastic gradients with low biases comes at high costs. This setting captures various optimization paradigms, such as conditional stochastic optimization, distributionally robust optimization, shortfall risk optimization, and machine learning paradigms, such as contrastive learning. We examine a family of multi-level Monte Carlo (MLMC) gradient methods that exploit a delicate tradeoff among bias, variance, and oracle cost. We systematically study their total sample and computational complexities for strongly convex, convex, and nonconvex objectives and demonstrate their superiority over the widely used biased stochastic gradient method. When combined with the variance reduction techniques like SPIDER, these MLMC gradient methods can further reduce the complexity in the nonconvex regime. Our results imply that a series of stochastic optimization problems with biased oracles, previously considered to be more challenging, is fundamentally no harder than the classical stochastic optimization with unbiased oracles. We also delineate the boundary conditions under which these problems become more difficult. Moreover, MLMC gradient methods significantly improve the best-known complexities in the literature for conditional stochastic optimization and shortfall risk optimization. Our extensive numerical experiments on distributionally robust optimization, pricing and staffing scheduling problems, and contrastive learning demonstrate the superior performance of MLMC gradient methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Javid Akhavan, Chaitanya Krishna Vallabh, Xianyun Zhao, Souran Manoochehri</p>
<p>Abstract: In metal Additive Manufacturing (AM), monitoring the temperature of the Melt Pool (MP) is crucial for ensuring part quality, process stability, defect prevention, and overall process optimization. Traditional methods, are slow to converge and require extensive manual effort to translate data into actionable insights, rendering them impractical for real-time monitoring and control. To address this challenge, we propose an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based solution aimed at reducing manual data processing reliance and improving the efficiency of transitioning from data to insight. In our study, we utilize a dataset comprising dual-wavelength real-time process monitoring data and corresponding temperature maps. We introduce a deep learning model called the "Binocular model," which exploits dual input observations to perform a precise analysis of MP temperature in Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF). Through advanced deep learning techniques, we seamlessly convert raw data into temperature maps, significantly streamlining the process and enabling batch processing at a rate of up to 750 frames per second, approximately 1000 times faster than conventional methods. Our Binocular model achieves high accuracy in temperature estimation, evidenced by a 0.95 R-squared score, while simultaneously enhancing processing efficiency by a factor of $\sim1000x$ times. This model directly addresses the challenge of real-time MP temperature monitoring and offers insights into the encountered constraints and the benefits of our Deep Learning-based approach. By combining efficiency and precision, our work contributes to the advancement of temperature monitoring in L-PBF, thus driving progress in the field of metal AM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rashida Hakim, Jason Milionis, Christos Papadimitriou, Georgios Piliouras</p>
<p>Abstract: During 2023, two interesting results were proven about the limit behavior of game dynamics: First, it was shown that there is a game for which no dynamics converges to the Nash equilibria. Second, it was shown that the sink equilibria of a game adequately capture the limit behavior of natural game dynamics. These two results have created a need and opportunity to articulate a principled computational theory of the meaning of the game that is based on game dynamics. Given any game in normal form, and any prior distribution of play, we study the problem of computing the asymptotic behavior of a class of natural dynamics called the noisy replicator dynamics as a limit distribution over the sink equilibria of the game. When the prior distribution has pure strategy support, we prove this distribution can be computed efficiently, in near-linear time to the size of the best-response graph. When the distribution can be sampled -- for example, if it is the uniform distribution over all mixed strategy profiles -- we show through experiments that the limit distribution of reasonably large games can be estimated quite accurately through sampling and simulation.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the high-dimensional setting, Gaussian mixture kernel density estimates become increasingly suboptimal. In this work we aim to show that it is practical to instead use the optimal multivariate Epanechnikov kernel. We make use of this optimal Epanechnikov mixture kernel density estimate for the sequential filtering scenario through what we term the ensemble Epanechnikov mixture filter (EnEMF). We provide a practical implementation of the EnEMF that is as cost efficient as the comparable ensemble Gaussian mixture filter. We show on a static example that the EnEMF is robust to growth in dimension, and also that the EnEMF has a significant reduction in error per particle on the 40-variable Lorenz '96 system.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benjamin Reichman, Kartik Talamadupula, Toshish Jawale, Larry Heck</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems augment how knowledge language models are by integrating external information sources such as Wikipedia, internal documents, scientific papers, or the open internet. RAG systems that rely on the open internet as their knowledge source have to contend with the complexities of human-generated content. Human communication extends much deeper than just the words rendered as text. Intent, tonality, and connotation can all change the meaning of what is being conveyed. Recent real-world deployments of RAG systems have shown some difficulty in understanding these nuances of human communication. One significant challenge for these systems lies in processing sarcasm. Though the Large Language Models (LLMs) that make up the backbone of these RAG systems are able to detect sarcasm, they currently do not always use these detections for the subsequent processing of text. To address these issues, in this paper, we synthetically generate sarcastic passages from Natural Question's Wikipedia retrieval corpus. We then test the impact of these passages on the performance of both the retriever and reader portion of the RAG pipeline. We introduce a prompting system designed to enhance the model's ability to interpret and generate responses in the presence of sarcasm, thus improving overall system performance. Finally, we conduct ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating improvements in handling sarcastic content within RAG systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tatsuhiro Shimizu, Koichi Tanaka, Ren Kishimoto, Haruka Kiyohara, Masahiro Nomura, Yuta Saito</p>
<p>Abstract: We explore off-policy evaluation and learning (OPE/L) in contextual combinatorial bandits (CCB), where a policy selects a subset in the action space. For example, it might choose a set of furniture pieces (a bed and a drawer) from available items (bed, drawer, chair, etc.) for interior design sales. This setting is widespread in fields such as recommender systems and healthcare, yet OPE/L of CCB remains unexplored in the relevant literature. Typical OPE/L methods such as regression and importance sampling can be applied to the CCB problem, however, they face significant challenges due to high bias or variance, exacerbated by the exponential growth in the number of available subsets. To address these challenges, we introduce a concept of factored action space, which allows us to decompose each subset into binary indicators. This formulation allows us to distinguish between the ''main effect'' derived from the main actions, and the ''residual effect'', originating from the supplemental actions, facilitating more effective OPE. Specifically, our estimator, called OPCB, leverages an importance sampling-based approach to unbiasedly estimate the main effect, while employing regression-based approach to deal with the residual effect with low variance. OPCB achieves substantial variance reduction compared to conventional importance sampling methods and bias reduction relative to regression methods under certain conditions, as illustrated in our theoretical analysis. Experiments demonstrate OPCB's superior performance over typical methods in both OPE and OPL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alex N. Wang, Christopher Hoang, Yuwen Xiong, Yann LeCun, Mengye Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning has driven significant progress in learning from single-subject, iconic images. However, there are still unanswered questions about the use of minimally-curated, naturalistic video data, which contain dense scenes with many independent objects, imbalanced class distributions, and varying object sizes. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that combines an invariance-based SSL objective on pooled representations with a dense SSL objective that enforces equivariance to optical flow warping. Our findings indicate that a unified objective applied at multiple feature scales is essential for learning effective image representations from high-resolution, naturalistic videos. We validate our approach on the BDD100K driving video dataset and the Walking Tours first-person video dataset, demonstrating its ability to capture spatial understanding from a dense objective and semantic understanding via a pooled representation objective.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kathryn Linehan, Radu Balan</p>
<p>Abstract: Computing the proximal operator of the $\ell_\infty$ norm, $\textbf{prox}_{\alpha ||\cdot||_\infty}(\mathbf{x})$, generally requires a sort of the input data, or at least a partial sort similar to quicksort. In order to avoid using a sort, we present an $O(m)$ approximation of $\textbf{prox}_{\alpha ||\cdot||_\infty}(\mathbf{x})$ using a neural network. A novel aspect of the network is that it is able to accept vectors of varying lengths due to a feature selection process that uses moments of the input data. We present results on the accuracy of the approximation, feature importance, and computational efficiency of the approach. We show that the network outperforms a "vanilla neural network" that does not use feature selection. We also present an algorithm with corresponding theory to calculate $\textbf{prox}_{\alpha ||\cdot||_\infty}(\mathbf{x})$ exactly, relate it to the Moreau decomposition, and compare its computational efficiency to that of the approximation.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rise of computer vision applications in the real world puts the security of the deep neural networks at risk. Recent works demonstrate that convolutional neural networks are susceptible to adversarial examples - where the input images look similar to the natural images but are classified incorrectly by the model. To provide a rebuttal to this problem, we propose a new method to build robust deep neural networks against adversarial attacks by reformulating the saddle point optimization problem in \cite{madry2017towards}. Our proposed method offers significant resistance and a concrete security guarantee against multiple adversaries. The goal of this paper is to act as a stepping stone for a new variation of deep learning models which would lead towards fully robust deep learning models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manuel Weber, Carly Beneke, Clyde Wheeler</p>
<p>Abstract: Regular measurement of carbon stock in the world's forests is critical for carbon accounting and reporting under national and international climate initiatives, and for scientific research, but has been largely limited in scalability and temporal resolution due to a lack of ground based assessments. Increasing efforts have been made to address these challenges by incorporating remotely sensed data. We present a new methodology which uses multi-sensor, multi-spectral imagery at a resolution of 10 meters and a deep learning based model which unifies the prediction of above ground biomass density (AGBD), canopy height (CH), canopy cover (CC) as well as uncertainty estimations for all three quantities. The model is trained on millions of globally sampled GEDI-L2/L4 measurements. We validate the capability of our model by deploying it over the entire globe for the year 2023 as well as annually from 2016 to 2023 over selected areas. The model achieves a mean absolute error for AGBD (CH, CC) of 26.1 Mg/ha (3.7 m, 9.9 %) and a root mean squared error of 50.6 Mg/ha (5.4 m, 15.8 %) on a globally sampled test dataset, demonstrating a significant improvement over previously published results. We also report the model performance against independently collected ground measurements published in the literature, which show a high degree of correlation across varying conditions. We further show that our pre-trained model facilitates seamless transferability to other GEDI variables due to its multi-head architecture.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christos Constantinou, Georgios Ioannides, Aman Chadha, Aaron Elkins, Edwin Simpson</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) data is crucial in machine learning applications to mitigate the risk of model overconfidence, thereby enhancing the reliability and safety of deployed systems. The majority of existing OOD detection methods predominantly address uni-modal inputs, such as images or texts. In the context of multi-modal documents, there is a notable lack of extensive research on the performance of these methods, which have primarily been developed with a focus on computer vision tasks. We propose a novel methodology termed as attention head masking (AHM) for multi-modal OOD tasks in document classification systems. Our empirical results demonstrate that the proposed AHM method outperforms all state-of-the-art approaches and significantly decreases the false positive rate (FPR) compared to existing solutions up to 7.5\%. This methodology generalizes well to multi-modal data, such as documents, where visual and textual information are modeled under the same Transformer architecture. To address the scarcity of high-quality publicly available document datasets and encourage further research on OOD detection for documents, we introduce FinanceDocs, a new document AI dataset. Our code and dataset are publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shih-Yu Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper addresses the advancement of probability tail bound analysis, a crucial statistical tool for assessing the probability of large deviations of random variables from their expected values. Traditional tail bounds, such as Markov's, Chebyshev's, and Chernoff bounds, have proven valuable across numerous scientific and engineering fields. However, as data complexity grows, there is a pressing need to extend tail bound estimation from scalar variables to high-dimensional random objects. Existing studies often rely on the assumption of independence among high-dimensional random objects, an assumption that may not always be valid. Building on the work of researchers like Garg et al. and Chang, who employed random walks to model high-dimensional ensembles, this study introduces a more generalized approach by exploring random walks over manifolds. To address the challenges of constructing an appropriate underlying graph for a manifold, we propose a novel method that enhances random walks on graphs approximating the manifold. This approach ensures spectral similarity between the original manifold and the approximated graph, including matching eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and eigenfunctions. Leveraging graph approximation technique proposed by Burago et al. for manifolds, we derive the tensor Chernoff bound and establish its range for random walks on a Riemannian manifold according to the underlying manifold's spectral characteristics.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have been widely utilized for image restoration. However, previous blind image restoration methods still need to assume the type of degradation model while leaving the parameters to be optimized, limiting their real-world applications. Therefore, we aim to tame generative diffusion prior for universal blind image restoration dubbed BIR-D, which utilizes an optimizable convolutional kernel to simulate the degradation model and dynamically update the parameters of the kernel in the diffusion steps, enabling it to achieve blind image restoration results even in various complex situations. Besides, based on mathematical reasoning, we have provided an empirical formula for the chosen of adaptive guidance scale, eliminating the need for a grid search for the optimal parameter. Experimentally, Our BIR-D has demonstrated superior practicality and versatility than off-the-shelf unsupervised methods across various tasks both on real-world and synthetic datasets, qualitatively and quantitatively. BIR-D is able to fulfill multi-guidance blind image restoration. Moreover, BIR-D can also restore images that undergo multiple and complicated degradations, demonstrating the practical applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qinglong Meng, Chongkun Xia, Xueqian Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Inverse Kinematics (IK) is to find the robot's configurations that satisfy the target pose of the end effector. In motion planning, diverse configurations were required in case a feasible trajectory was not found. Meanwhile, collision checking (CC), e.g. Oriented bounding box (OBB), Discrete Oriented Polytope (DOP), and Quickhull \cite{quickhull}, needs to be done for each configuration provided by the IK solver to ensure every goal configuration for motion planning is available. This means the classical IK solver and CC algorithm should be executed repeatedly for every configuration. Thus, the preparation time is long when the required number of goal configurations is large, e.g. motion planning in cluster environments. Moreover, structured maps, which might be difficult to obtain, were required by classical collision-checking algorithms. To sidestep such two issues, we propose a flow-based vision method that can output diverse available configurations by fusing inverse kinematics and collision checking, named Vision Inverse Kinematics solver (ViIK). Moreover, ViIK uses RGB images as the perception of environments. ViIK can output 1000 configurations within 40 ms, and the accuracy is about 3 millimeters and 1.5 degrees. The higher accuracy can be obtained by being refined by the classical IK solver within a few iterations. The self-collision rates can be lower than 2%. The collision-with-env rates can be lower than 10% in most scenes. The code is available at: https://github.com/AdamQLMeng/ViIK.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study explores the potential of Modern Hopfield Networks (MHN) in improving the ability of computer vision models to handle out-of-distribution data. While current computer vision models can generalize to unseen samples from the same distribution, they are susceptible to minor perturbations such as blurring, which limits their effectiveness in real-world applications. We suggest integrating MHN into the baseline models to enhance their robustness. This integration can be implemented during the test time for any model and combined with any adversarial defense method. Our research shows that the proposed integration consistently improves model performance on the MNIST-C dataset, achieving a state-of-the-art increase of 13.84% in average corruption accuracy, a 57.49% decrease in mean Corruption Error (mCE), and a 60.61% decrease in relative mCE compared to the baseline model. Additionally, we investigate the capability of MHN to converge to the original non-corrupted data. Notably, our method does not require test-time adaptation or augmentation with corruptions, underscoring its practical viability for real-world deployment.

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Jacob Kedziora, Anna Musia{\l}, Wojciech Rudno-Rudzi\'nski, Bogdan Gabrys</p>
<p>Abstract: The use of single-photon sources (SPSs) is central to numerous systems and devices proposed amidst a modern surge in quantum technology. However, manufacturing schemes remain imperfect, and single-photon emission purity must often be experimentally verified via interferometry. Such a process is typically slow and costly, which has motivated growing research into whether SPS quality can be more rapidly inferred from incomplete emission statistics. Hence, this study is a sequel to previous work that demonstrated significant uncertainty in the standard method of quality estimation, i.e. the least-squares fitting of a physically motivated function, and asks: can machine learning (ML) do better? The study leverages eight datasets obtained from measurements involving an exemplary quantum emitter, i.e. a single InGaAs/GaAs epitaxial quantum dot; these eight contexts predominantly vary in the intensity of the exciting laser. Specifically, via a form of `transfer learning', five ML models, three linear and two ensemble-based, are trained on data from seven of the contexts and tested on the eighth. Validation metrics quickly reveal that even a linear regressor can outperform standard fitting when it is tested on the same contexts it was trained on, but the success of transfer learning is less assured, even though statistical analysis, made possible by data augmentation, suggests its superiority as an early estimator. Accordingly, the study concludes by discussing future strategies for grappling with the problem of SPS context dissimilarity, e.g. feature engineering and model adaptation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large-scale data collection is essential for developing personalized training data, mitigating the shortage of training data, and fine-tuning specialized models. However, creating high-quality datasets quickly and accurately remains a challenge due to annotation errors, the substantial time and costs associated with human labor. To address these issues, we propose Automatic Dataset Construction (ADC), an innovative methodology that automates dataset creation with negligible cost and high efficiency. Taking the image classification task as a starting point, ADC leverages LLMs for the detailed class design and code generation to collect relevant samples via search engines, significantly reducing the need for manual annotation and speeding up the data generation process. Despite these advantages, ADC also encounters real-world challenges such as label errors (label noise) and imbalanced data distributions (label bias). We provide open-source software that incorporates existing methods for label error detection, robust learning under noisy and biased data, ensuring a higher-quality training data and more robust model training procedure. Furthermore, we design three benchmark datasets focused on label noise detection, label noise learning, and class-imbalanced learning. These datasets are vital because there are few existing datasets specifically for label noise detection, despite its importance. Finally, we evaluate the performance of existing popular methods on these datasets, thereby facilitating further research in the field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Itai Nuri, Nir Shlezinger</p>
<p>Abstract: A leading family of algorithms for state estimation in dynamic systems with multiple sub-states is based on particle filters (PFs). PFs often struggle when operating under complex or approximated modelling (necessitating many particles) with low latency requirements (limiting the number of particles), as is typically the case in multi target tracking (MTT). In this work, we introduce a deep neural network (DNN) augmentation for PFs termed learning flock (LF). LF learns to correct a particles-weights set, which we coin flock, based on the relationships between all sub-particles in the set itself, while disregarding the set acquisition procedure. Our proposed LF, which can be readily incorporated into different PFs flow, is designed to facilitate rapid operation by maintaining accuracy with a reduced number of particles. We introduce a dedicated training algorithm, allowing both supervised and unsupervised training, and yielding a module that supports a varying number of sub-states and particles without necessitating re-training. We experimentally show the improvements in performance, robustness, and latency of LF augmentation for radar multi-target tracking, as well its ability to mitigate the effect of a mismatched observation modelling. We also compare and illustrate the advantages of LF over a state-of-the-art DNN-aided PF, and demonstrate that LF enhances both classic PFs as well as DNN-based filters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kelei He, Tiejun Dong, Jinhui Wu, Junfeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding the structure of the protein-ligand complex is crucial to drug development. Existing virtual structure measurement and screening methods are dominated by docking and its derived methods combined with deep learning. However, the sampling and scoring methodology have largely restricted the accuracy and efficiency. Here, we show that these two fundamental tasks can be accurately tackled with a single model, namely LigPose, based on multi-task geometric deep learning. By representing the ligand and the protein pair as a graph, LigPose directly optimizes the three-dimensional structure of the complex, with the learning of binding strength and atomic interactions as auxiliary tasks, enabling its one-step prediction ability without docking tools. Extensive experiments show LigPose achieved state-of-the-art performance on major tasks in drug research. Its considerable improvements indicate a promising paradigm of AI-based pipeline for drug development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yijia Xiao, Edward Sun, Yiqiao Jin, Qifan Wang, Wei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding biological processes, drug development, and biotechnological advancements requires detailed analysis of protein structures and sequences, a task in protein research that is inherently complex and time-consuming when performed manually. To streamline this process, we introduce ProteinGPT, a state-of-the-art multi-modal protein chat system, that allows users to upload protein sequences and/or structures for comprehensive protein analysis and responsive inquiries. ProteinGPT seamlessly integrates protein sequence and structure encoders with linear projection layers for precise representation adaptation, coupled with a large language model (LLM) to generate accurate and contextually relevant responses. To train ProteinGPT, we construct a large-scale dataset of 132,092 proteins with annotations, and optimize the instruction-tuning process using GPT-4o. This innovative system ensures accurate alignment between the user-uploaded data and prompts, simplifying protein analysis. Experiments show that ProteinGPT can produce promising responses to proteins and their corresponding questions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yibo Yan, Joey Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: In human reading and communication, individuals tend to engage in geospatial reasoning, which involves recognizing geographic entities and making informed inferences about their interrelationships. To mimic such cognitive process, current methods either utilize conventional natural language understanding toolkits, or directly apply models pretrained on geo-related natural language corpora. However, these methods face two significant challenges: i) they do not generalize well to unseen geospatial scenarios, and ii) they overlook the importance of integrating geospatial context from geographical databases with linguistic information from the Internet. To handle these challenges, we propose GeoReasoner, a language model capable of reasoning on geospatially grounded natural language. Specifically, it first leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate a comprehensive location description based on linguistic and geospatial information. It also encodes direction and distance information into spatial embedding via treating them as pseudo-sentences. Consequently, the model is trained on both anchor-level and neighbor-level inputs to learn geo-entity representation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate GeoReasoner's superiority in three tasks: toponym recognition, toponym linking, and geo-entity typing, compared to the state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chi Ma, Mincong Huang, Ying Zhang, Chao Wang, Yujie Wang, Lei Yu, Chuan Liu, Wei Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Dynamic activation (DA) techniques, such as DejaVu and MoEfication, have demonstrated their potential to significantly enhance the inference efficiency of large language models (LLMs). However, these techniques often rely on ReLU activation functions or require additional parameters and training to maintain performance. This paper introduces a training-free Threshold-based Dynamic Activation(TDA) method that leverage sequence information to exploit the inherent sparsity of models across various architectures. This method is designed to accelerate generation speed by 18-25\% without significantly compromising task performance, thereby addressing the limitations of existing DA techniques. Moreover, we delve into the root causes of LLM sparsity and theoretically analyze two of its critical features: history-related activation uncertainty and semantic-irrelevant activation inertia. Our comprehensive analyses not only provide a robust theoretical foundation for DA methods but also offer valuable insights to guide future research in optimizing LLMs for greater efficiency and effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Szymon Op{\l}atek, Dawid Rymarczyk, Bartosz Zieli\'nski</p>
<p>Abstract: Prototypical parts networks, such as ProtoPNet, became popular due to their potential to produce more genuine explanations than post-hoc methods. However, for a long time, this potential has been strictly theoretical, and no systematic studies have existed to support it. That changed recently with the introduction of the FunnyBirds benchmark, which includes metrics for evaluating different aspects of explanations.
  However, this benchmark employs attribution maps visualization for all explanation techniques except for the ProtoPNet, for which the bounding boxes are used. This choice significantly influences the metric scores and questions the conclusions stated in FunnyBirds publication.
  In this study, we comprehensively compare metric scores obtained for two types of ProtoPNet visualizations: bounding boxes and similarity maps. Our analysis indicates that employing similarity maps aligns better with the essence of ProtoPNet, as evidenced by different metric scores obtained from FunnyBirds. Therefore, we advocate using similarity maps as a visualization technique for prototypical parts networks in explainability evaluation benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sara Kali\v{s}nik, Bastian Rieck, Ana \v{Z}egarac</p>
<p>Abstract: Persistent homology is one of the most popular methods in Topological Data Analysis. An initial step in any analysis with persistent homology involves constructing a nested sequence of simplicial complexes, called a filtration, from a point cloud. There is an abundance of different complexes to choose from, with Rips, Alpha, and witness complexes being popular choices. In this manuscript, we build a different type of a geometrically-informed simplicial complex, called an ellipsoid complex. This complex is based on the idea that ellipsoids aligned with tangent directions better approximate the data compared to conventional (Euclidean) balls centered at sample points that are used in the construction of Rips and Alpha complexes, for instance. We use Principal Component Analysis to estimate tangent spaces directly from samples and present algorithms as well as an implementation for computing ellipsoid barcodes, i.e., topological descriptors based on ellipsoid complexes. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments and compare ellipsoid barcodes with standard Rips barcodes. Our findings indicate that ellipsoid complexes are particularly effective for estimating homology of manifolds and spaces with bottlenecks from samples. In particular, the persistence intervals corresponding to a ground-truth topological feature are longer compared to the intervals obtained when using the Rips complex of the data. Furthermore, ellipsoid barcodes lead to better classification results in sparsely-sampled point clouds. Finally, we demonstrate that ellipsoid barcodes outperform Rips barcodes in classification tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaoze Zhang, Yuming Zhang, Yu Zhao, Yue Zhang, Feiyu Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge distillation is widely applied in various fundamental vision models to enhance the performance of compact models. Existing knowledge distillation methods focus on designing different distillation targets to acquire knowledge from teacher models. However, these methods often overlook the efficient utilization of distilled information, crudely coupling different types of information, making it difficult to explain how the knowledge from the teacher network aids the student network in learning. This paper proposes a novel knowledge distillation framework, Local Attention Knowledge Distillation (LAKD), which more efficiently utilizes the distilled information from teacher networks, achieving higher interpretability and competitive performance. The framework establishes an independent interactive training mechanism through a separation-decoupling mechanism and non-directional activation mapping. LAKD decouples the teacher's features and facilitates progressive interaction training from simple to complex. Specifically, the student network is divided into local modules with independent gradients to decouple the knowledge transferred from the teacher. The non-directional activation mapping helps the student network integrate knowledge from different local modules by learning coarse-grained feature knowledge. We conducted experiments on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets, and the results show that our LAKD method significantly outperforms existing methods, consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance across different datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Embodied learning for object-centric robotic manipulation is a rapidly developing and challenging area in embodied AI. It is crucial for advancing next-generation intelligent robots and has garnered significant interest recently. Unlike data-driven machine learning methods, embodied learning focuses on robot learning through physical interaction with the environment and perceptual feedback, making it especially suitable for robotic manipulation. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of the latest advancements in this field and categorize the existing work into three main branches: 1) Embodied perceptual learning, which aims to predict object pose and affordance through various data representations; 2) Embodied policy learning, which focuses on generating optimal robotic decisions using methods such as reinforcement learning and imitation learning; 3) Embodied task-oriented learning, designed to optimize the robot's performance based on the characteristics of different tasks in object grasping and manipulation. In addition, we offer an overview and discussion of public datasets, evaluation metrics, representative applications, current challenges, and potential future research directions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shahriar Golchin, Mihai Surdeanu, Steven Bethard, Eduardo Blanco, Ellen Riloff</p>
<p>Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has proven to be an effective strategy for improving the performance of large language models (LLMs) with no additional training. However, the exact mechanism behind these performance improvements remains unclear. This study is the first to show how ICL surfaces memorized training data and to explore the correlation between this memorization and performance across various ICL regimes: zero-shot, few-shot, and many-shot. Our most notable findings include: (1) ICL significantly surfaces memorization compared to zero-shot learning in most cases; (2) demonstrations, without their labels, are the most effective element in surfacing memorization; (3) ICL improves performance when the surfaced memorization in few-shot regimes reaches a high level (about 40%); and (4) there is a very strong correlation between performance and memorization in ICL when it outperforms zero-shot learning. Overall, our study uncovers a hidden phenomenon -- memorization -- at the core of ICL, raising an important question: to what extent do LLMs truly generalize from demonstrations in ICL, and how much of their success is due to memorization?</p>

Our experimental results demonstrate that the IRP consistently outperforms traditional anomaly detection models, particularly in environments with high noise levels. This study highlights the IRP's potential to significantly enhance anomaly detection processes in industrial settings, effectively managing the challenges of sparse and noisy data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Well-calibrated predictions of user preferences are essential for many applications. Since recommender systems typically select the top-N items for users, calibration for those top-N items, rather than for all items, is important. We show that previous calibration methods result in miscalibrated predictions for the top-N items, despite their excellent calibration performance when evaluated on all items. In this work, we address the miscalibration in the top-N recommended items. We first define evaluation metrics for this objective and then propose a generic method to optimize calibration models focusing on the top-N items. It groups the top-N items by their ranks and optimizes distinct calibration models for each group with rank-dependent training weights. We verify the effectiveness of the proposed method for both explicit and implicit feedback datasets, using diverse classes of recommender models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Patrick Benjamin, Alessandro Abate</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent works have provided algorithms by which decentralised agents, which may be connected via a communication network, can learn equilibria in Mean-Field Games from a single, non-episodic run of the empirical system. However, these algorithms are given for tabular settings: this computationally limits the size of players' observation space, meaning that the algorithms are not able to handle anything but small state spaces, nor to generalise beyond policies depending on the ego player's state to so-called 'population-dependent' policies. We address this limitation by introducing function approximation to the existing setting, drawing on the Munchausen Online Mirror Descent method that has previously been employed only in finite-horizon, episodic, centralised settings. While this permits us to include the population's mean-field distribution in the observation for each player's policy, it is arguably unrealistic to assume that decentralised agents would have access to this global information: we therefore additionally provide new algorithms that allow agents to estimate the global empirical distribution based on a local neighbourhood, and to improve this estimate via communication over a given network. Our experiments showcase how the communication network allows decentralised agents to estimate the mean-field distribution for population-dependent policies, and that exchanging policy information helps networked agents to outperform both independent and even centralised agents in function-approximation settings, by an even greater margin than in tabular settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Neural-based multi-task learning (MTL) has been successfully applied to many recommendation applications. However, these MTL models (e.g., MMoE, PLE) did not consider feature interaction during the optimization, which is crucial for capturing complex high-order features and has been widely used in ranking models for real-world recommender systems. Moreover, through feature importance analysis across various tasks in MTL, we have observed an interesting divergence phenomenon that the same feature can have significantly different importance across different tasks in MTL. To address these issues, we propose Deep Multiple Task-specific Feature Interactions Network (DTN) with a novel model structure design. DTN introduces multiple diversified task-specific feature interaction methods and task-sensitive network in MTL networks, enabling the model to learn task-specific diversified feature interaction representations, which improves the efficiency of joint representation learning in a general setup. We applied DTN to our company's real-world E-commerce recommendation dataset, which consisted of over 6.3 billion samples, the results demonstrated that DTN significantly outperformed state-of-the-art MTL models. Moreover, during online evaluation of DTN in a large-scale E-commerce recommender system, we observed a 3.28% in clicks, a 3.10% increase in orders and a 2.70% increase in GMV (Gross Merchandise Value) compared to the state-of-the-art MTL models. Finally, extensive offline experiments conducted on public benchmark datasets demonstrate that DTN can be applied to various scenarios beyond recommendations, enhancing the performance of ranking models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Climate change poses complex challenges, with extreme weather events becoming increasingly frequent and difficult to model. Examples include the dynamics of Combined Sewer Systems (CSS). Overburdened CSS during heavy rainfall will overflow untreated wastewater into surface water bodies. Classical approaches to modeling the impact of extreme rainfall events rely on physical simulations, which are particularly challenging to create for large urban infrastructures. Deep Learning (DL) models offer a cost-effective alternative for modeling the complex dynamics of sewer systems. In this study, we present a comprehensive empirical evaluation of several state-of-the-art DL time series models for predicting sewer system dynamics in a large urban infrastructure, utilizing three years of measurement data. We especially investigate the potential of DL models to maintain predictive precision during network outages by comparing global models, which have access to all variables within the sewer system, and local models, which are limited to data from a restricted set of local sensors. Our findings demonstrate that DL models can accurately predict the dynamics of sewer system load, even under network outage conditions. These results suggest that DL models can effectively aid in balancing the load redistribution in CSS, thereby enhancing the sustainability and resilience of urban infrastructures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zexu Sun, Hao Yang an Dugang Liu, Yunpeng Weng, Xing Tang, Xiuqiang He</p>
<p>Abstract: In modern online platforms, incentives are essential factors that enhance user engagement and increase platform revenue. Over recent years, uplift modeling has been introduced as a strategic approach to assign incentives to individual customers. Especially in many real-world applications, online platforms can only incentivize customers with specific budget constraints. This problem can be reformulated as the multi-choice knapsack problem. This optimization aims to select the optimal incentive for each customer to maximize the return on investment. Recent works in this field frequently tackle the budget allocation problem using a two-stage approach. However, this solution is confronted with the following challenges: (1) The causal inference methods often ignore the domain knowledge in online marketing, where the expected response curve of a customer should be monotonic and smooth as the incentive increases. (2) An optimality gap between the two stages results in inferior sub-optimal allocation performance due to the loss of the incentive recommendation information for the uplift prediction under the limited budget constraint. To address these challenges, we propose a novel End-to-End Cost-Effective Incentive Recommendation (E3IR) model under budget constraints. Specifically, our methods consist of two modules, i.e., the uplift prediction module and the differentiable allocation module. In the uplift prediction module, we construct prediction heads to capture the incremental improvement between adjacent treatments with the marketing domain constraints (i.e., monotonic and smooth). We incorporate integer linear programming (ILP) as a differentiable layer input in the allocation module. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments on public and real product datasets, demonstrating that our E3IR improves allocation performance compared to existing two-stage approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Paul Primus, Florian Schmid, Gerhard Widmer</p>
<p>Abstract: Dual-encoder-based audio retrieval systems are commonly optimized with contrastive learning on a set of matching and mismatching audio-caption pairs. This leads to a shared embedding space in which corresponding items from the two modalities end up close together. Since audio-caption datasets typically only contain matching pairs of recordings and descriptions, it has become common practice to create mismatching pairs by pairing the audio with a caption randomly drawn from the dataset. This is not ideal because the randomly sampled caption could, just by chance, partly or entirely describe the audio recording. However, correspondence information for all possible pairs is costly to annotate and thus typically unavailable; we, therefore, suggest substituting it with estimated correspondences. To this end, we propose a two-staged training procedure in which multiple retrieval models are first trained as usual, i.e., without estimated correspondences. In the second stage, the audio-caption correspondences predicted by these models then serve as prediction targets. We evaluate our method on the ClothoV2 and the AudioCaps benchmark and show that it improves retrieval performance, even in a restricting self-distillation setting where a single model generates and then learns from the estimated correspondences. We further show that our method outperforms the current state of the art by 1.6 pp. mAP@10 on the ClothoV2 benchmark.</p>

Interference in 5G networks challenges high-quality service due to dense user equipment deployment and increased wireless environment complexity.

Comprehensive datasets of simulated PRACH signals under controlled interference conditions were generated to train and validate the model. Experimental results show that our CNN-based approach outperforms traditional PRACH detection methods in accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score. This study demonstrates the potential of AI/ML techniques in advancing interference management in 5G networks, providing a foundation for future research and practical applications in optimizing network performance and reliability.</p>

Instead, we show that the potentials obtained from solving the static entropic optimal transport problem between the source and target samples can be modified to yield a natural plug-in estimator of the time-dependent drift that defines the bridge between two measures. Under minimal assumptions, we show that our proposal, which we call the \emph{Sinkhorn bridge}, provably estimates the Schr\"odinger bridge with a rate of convergence that depends on the intrinsic dimensionality of the target measure. Our approach combines results from the areas of sampling, and theoretical and statistical entropic optimal transport.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Oz Zafar, Lior Wolf, Idan Schwartz</p>
<p>Abstract: We address a persistent challenge in text-to-image models: accurately generating a specified number of objects. Current models, which learn from image-text pairs, inherently struggle with counting, as training data cannot depict every possible number of objects for any given object. To solve this, we propose optimizing the generated image based on a counting loss derived from a counting model that aggregates an object\'s potential. Employing an out-of-the-box counting model is challenging for two reasons: first, the model requires a scaling hyperparameter for the potential aggregation that varies depending on the viewpoint of the objects, and second, classifier guidance techniques require modified models that operate on noisy intermediate diffusion steps. To address these challenges, we propose an iterated online training mode that improves the accuracy of inferred images while altering the text conditioning embedding and dynamically adjusting hyperparameters. Our method offers three key advantages: (i) it can consider non-derivable counting techniques based on detection models, (ii) it is a zero-shot plug-and-play solution facilitating rapid changes to the counting techniques and image generation methods, and (iii) the optimized counting token can be reused to generate accurate images without additional optimization. We evaluate the generation of various objects and show significant improvements in accuracy. The project page is available at https://ozzafar.github.io/count_token.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel loss function aimed at optimizing the binary flare prediction problem by embedding the intrinsic ordinal flare characteristics into the binary cross-entropy (BCE) loss function. This modification is intended to provide the model with better guidance based on the ordinal characteristics of the data and improve the overall performance of the models. For our experiments, we employ a ResNet34-based model with transfer learning to predict $\geq$M-class flares by utilizing the shape-based features of magnetograms of active region (AR) patches spanning from $-$90$^{\circ}$ to $+$90$^{\circ}$ of solar longitude as our input data. We use a composite skill score (CSS) as our evaluation metric, which is calculated as the geometric mean of the True Skill Score (TSS) and the Heidke Skill Score (HSS) to rank and compare our models' performance. The primary contributions of this work are as follows: (i) We introduce a novel approach to encode ordinality into a binary loss function showing an application to solar flare prediction, (ii) We enhance solar flare forecasting by enabling flare predictions for each AR across the entire solar disk, without any longitudinal restrictions, and evaluate and compare performance. (iii) Our candidate model, optimized with the proposed loss function, shows an improvement of $\sim$7%, $\sim$4%, and $\sim$3% for AR patches within $\pm$30$^\circ$, $\pm$60$^\circ$, and $\pm$90$^\circ$ of solar longitude, respectively in terms of CSS, when compared with standard BCE. Additionally, we demonstrate the ability to issue flare forecasts for ARs in near-limb regions (regions between $\pm$60$^{\circ}$ to $\pm$90$^{\circ}$) with a CSS=0.34 (TSS=0.50 and HSS=0.23), expanding the scope of AR-based models for solar flare prediction. This advances the reliability of solar flare forecasts, leading to more effective prediction capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alireza Ghazavi Khorasgani, Mahtab Mirmohseni, Ahmed Elzanaty</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper characterizes the optimal capacity-distortion (C-D) tradeoff in an optical point-to-point (P2P) system with single-input single-output for communication and single-input multiple-output for sensing (SISO-SIMO-C/S) within an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) framework. We introduce practical, asymptotically optimal maximum a posteriori (MAP) and maximum likelihood estimators (MLE) for target distance, addressing nonlinear measurement-to-state relationships and non-conjugate priors. Our results show these estimators converge to the Bayesian Cramer-Rao bound (BCRB) as sensing antennas increase. We also demonstrate that the achievable rate-CRB (AR-CRB) serves as an outer bound (OB) for the optimal C-D region. To optimize input distribution across the Pareto boundary of the C-D region, we propose two algorithms: an iterative Blahut-Arimoto algorithm (BAA)-type method and a memory-efficient closed-form (CF) approach, including a CF optimal distribution for high optical signal-to-noise ratio (O-SNR) conditions. Additionally, we extend and modify the Deterministic-Random Tradeoff (DRT) to this optical ISAC context.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present a comprehensive report on compressing the Llama 3.1 8B and Mistral NeMo 12B models to 4B and 8B parameters, respectively, using pruning and distillation. We explore two distinct pruning strategies: (1) depth pruning and (2) joint hidden/attention/MLP (width) pruning, and evaluate the results on common benchmarks from the LM Evaluation Harness. The models are then aligned with NeMo Aligner and tested in instruct-tuned versions. This approach produces a compelling 4B model from Llama 3.1 8B and a state-of-the-art Mistral-NeMo-Minitron-8B (MN-Minitron-8B for brevity) model from Mistral NeMo 12B. We found that with no access to the original data, it is beneficial to slightly fine-tune teacher models on the distillation dataset. We open-source our base model weights on Hugging Face with a permissive license.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiqi Yang, Minghuan Liu, Yuzhe Qin, Runyu Ding, Jialong Li, Xuxin Cheng, Ruihan Yang, Sha Yi, Xiaolong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning from demonstrations has shown to be an effective approach to robotic manipulation, especially with the recently collected large-scale robot data with teleoperation systems. Building an efficient teleoperation system across diverse robot platforms has become more crucial than ever. However, there is a notable lack of cost-effective and user-friendly teleoperation systems for different end-effectors, e.g., anthropomorphic robot hands and grippers, that can operate across multiple platforms. To address this issue, we develop ACE, a cross-platform visual-exoskeleton system for low-cost dexterous teleoperation. Our system utilizes a hand-facing camera to capture 3D hand poses and an exoskeleton mounted on a portable base, enabling accurate real-time capture of both finger and wrist poses. Compared to previous systems, which often require hardware customization according to different robots, our single system can generalize to humanoid hands, arm-hands, arm-gripper, and quadruped-gripper systems with high-precision teleoperation. This enables imitation learning for complex manipulation tasks on diverse platforms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ria Doshi, Homer Walke, Oier Mees, Sudeep Dasari, Sergey Levine</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern machine learning systems rely on large datasets to attain broad generalization, and this often poses a challenge in robot learning, where each robotic platform and task might have only a small dataset. By training a single policy across many different kinds of robots, a robot learning method can leverage much broader and more diverse datasets, which in turn can lead to better generalization and robustness. However, training a single policy on multi-robot data is challenging because robots can have widely varying sensors, actuators, and control frequencies. We propose CrossFormer, a scalable and flexible transformer-based policy that can consume data from any embodiment. We train CrossFormer on the largest and most diverse dataset to date, 900K trajectories across 20 different robot embodiments. We demonstrate that the same network weights can control vastly different robots, including single and dual arm manipulation systems, wheeled robots, quadcopters, and quadrupeds. Unlike prior work, our model does not require manual alignment of the observation or action spaces. Extensive experiments in the real world show that our method matches the performance of specialist policies tailored for each embodiment, while also significantly outperforming the prior state of the art in cross-embodiment learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingcai Chen, Yuntao Du, Yi Zhang, Shuwei Qian, Chongjun Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Co-training, extended from self-training, is one of the frameworks for semi-supervised learning. Without natural split of features, single-view co-training works at the cost of training extra classifiers, where the algorithm should be delicately designed to prevent individual classifiers from collapsing into each other. To remove these obstacles which deter the adoption of single-view co-training, we present a simple and efficient algorithm Multi-Head Co-Training. By integrating base learners into a multi-head structure, the model is in a minimal amount of extra parameters. Every classification head in the unified model interacts with its peers through a "Weak and Strong Augmentation" strategy, in which the diversity is naturally brought by the strong data augmentation. Therefore, the proposed method facilitates single-view co-training by 1). promoting diversity implicitly and 2). only requiring a small extra computational overhead. The effectiveness of Multi-Head Co-Training is demonstrated in an empirical study on standard semi-supervised learning benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhe Yu, Joymallya Chakraborty, Tim Menzies</p>
<p>Abstract: This research seeks to benefit the software engineering society by providing a simple yet effective pre-processing approach to achieve equalized odds fairness in machine learning software. Fairness issues have attracted increasing attention since machine learning software is increasingly used for high-stakes and high-risk decisions. Amongst all the existing fairness notions, this work specifically targets "equalized odds" given its advantage in always allowing perfect classifiers. Equalized odds requires that members of every demographic group do not receive disparate mistreatment. Prior works either optimize for an equalized odds related metric during the learning process like a black-box, or manipulate the training data following some intuition. This work studies the root cause of the violation of equalized odds and how to tackle it. We found that equalizing the class distribution in each demographic group with sample weights is a necessary condition for achieving equalized odds without modifying the normal training process. In addition, an important partial condition for equalized odds (zero average odds difference) can be guaranteed when the class distributions are weighted to be not only equal but also balanced (1:1). Based on these analyses, we proposed FairBalance, a pre-processing algorithm which balances the class distribution in each demographic group by assigning calculated weights to the training data. On eight real-world datasets, our empirical results show that, at low computational overhead, the proposed pre-processing algorithm FairBalance can significantly improve equalized odds without much, if any damage to the utility. FairBalance also outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in terms of equalized odds. To facilitate reuse, reproduction, and validation, we made our scripts available at https://github.com/hil-se/FairBalance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rini Jasmine Gladstone, Mohammad Amin Nabian, Vahid Keshavarzzadeh, Hadi Meidani</p>
<p>Abstract: Robust topology optimization (RTO), as a class of topology optimization problems, identifies a design with the best average performance while reducing the response sensitivity to input uncertainties, e.g. load uncertainty. Solving RTO is computationally challenging as it requires repetitive finite element solutions for different candidate designs and different samples of random inputs. To address this challenge, a neural network method is proposed that offers computational efficiency because (1) it builds and explores a low dimensional search space which is parameterized using deterministically optimal designs corresponding to different realizations of random inputs, and (2) the probabilistic performance measure for each design candidate is predicted by a neural network surrogate. This method bypasses the numerous finite element response evaluations that are needed in the standard RTO approaches and with minimal training can produce optimal designs with better performance measures compared to those observed in the training set. Moreover, a multi-fidelity framework is incorporated to the proposed approach to further improve the computational efficiency. Numerical application of the method is shown on the robust design of L-bracket structure with single point load as well as multiple point loads.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fynn Oldenburg, Qiwei Han, Maximilian Kaiser</p>
<p>Abstract: As advertisers increasingly shift their budgets toward digital advertising, accurately forecasting advertising costs becomes essential for optimizing marketing campaign returns. This paper presents a comprehensive study that employs various time-series forecasting methods to predict daily average CPC in the online advertising market. We evaluate the performance of statistical models, machine learning techniques, and deep learning approaches, including the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT). Our findings reveal that incorporating multivariate models, enriched with covariates derived from competitors' CPC patterns through time-series clustering, significantly improves forecasting accuracy. We interpret the results by analyzing feature importance and temporal attention, demonstrating how the models leverage both the advertiser's data and insights from the competitive landscape. Additionally, our method proves robust during major market shifts, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, consistently outperforming models that rely solely on individual advertisers' data. This study introduces a scalable technique for selecting relevant covariates from a broad pool of advertisers, offering more accurate long-term forecasts and strategic insights into budget allocation and competitive dynamics in digital advertising.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jie Wang, Zhihao Shi, Xize Liang, Defu Lian, Shuiwang Ji, Bin Li, Enhong Chen, Feng Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Subgraph-wise sampling -- a promising class of mini-batch training techniques for graph neural networks (GNNs -- is critical for real-world applications. During the message passing (MP) in GNNs, subgraph-wise sampling methods discard messages outside the mini-batches in backward passes to avoid the well-known neighbor explosion problem, i.e., the exponentially increasing dependencies of nodes with the number of MP iterations. However, discarding messages may sacrifice the gradient estimation accuracy, posing significant challenges to their convergence analysis and convergence speeds. To address this challenge, we propose a novel subgraph-wise sampling method with a convergence guarantee, namely Local Message Compensation (LMC). To the best of our knowledge, LMC is the first subgraph-wise sampling method with provable convergence. The key idea is to retrieve the discarded messages in backward passes based on a message passing formulation of backward passes. By efficient and effective compensations for the discarded messages in both forward and backward passes, LMC computes accurate mini-batch gradients and thus accelerates convergence. Moreover, LMC is applicable to various MP-based GNN architectures, including convolutional GNNs (finite message passing iterations with different layers) and recurrent GNNs (infinite message passing iterations with a shared layer). Experiments on large-scale benchmarks demonstrate that LMC is significantly faster than state-of-the-art subgraph-wise sampling methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrea Cini, Danilo Mandic, Cesare Alippi</p>
<p>Abstract: Relationships among time series can be exploited as inductive biases in learning effective forecasting models. In hierarchical time series, relationships among subsets of sequences induce hard constraints (hierarchical inductive biases) on the predicted values. In this paper, we propose a graph-based methodology to unify relational and hierarchical inductive biases in the context of deep learning for time series forecasting. In particular, we model both types of relationships as dependencies in a pyramidal graph structure, with each pyramidal layer corresponding to a level of the hierarchy. By exploiting modern - trainable - graph pooling operators we show that the hierarchical structure, if not available as a prior, can be learned directly from data, thus obtaining cluster assignments aligned with the forecasting objective. A differentiable reconciliation stage is incorporated into the processing architecture, allowing hierarchical constraints to act both as an architectural bias as well as a regularization element for predictions. Simulation results on representative datasets show that the proposed method compares favorably against the state of the art.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiajun Zhou, Chenxuan Xie, Shengbo Gong, Jiaxu Qian, Shanqing Yu, Qi Xuan, Xiaoniu Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-world graphs exhibit increasing heterophily, where nodes no longer tend to be connected to nodes with the same label, challenging the homophily assumption of classical graph neural networks (GNNs) and impeding their performance. Intriguingly, from the observation of heterophilous data, we notice that certain high-order information exhibits higher homophily, which motivates us to involve high-order information in node representation learning. However, common practices in GNNs to acquire high-order information mainly through increasing model depth and altering message-passing mechanisms, which, albeit effective to a certain extent, suffer from three shortcomings: 1) over-smoothing due to excessive model depth and propagation times; 2) high-order information is not fully utilized; 3) low computational efficiency. In this regard, we design a similarity-based path sampling strategy to capture smooth paths containing high-order homophily. Then we propose a lightweight model based on multi-layer perceptrons (MLP), named PathMLP, which can encode messages carried by paths via simple transformation and concatenation operations, and effectively learn node representations in heterophilous graphs through adaptive path aggregation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines on 16 out of 20 datasets, underlining its effectiveness and superiority in alleviating the heterophily problem. In addition, our method is immune to over-smoothing and has high computational efficiency. The source code will be available in https://github.com/Graph4Sec-Team/PathMLP.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taicheng Guo, Changsheng Ma, Xiuying Chen, Bozhao Nan, Kehan Guo, Shichao Pei, Nitesh V. Chawla, Olaf Wiest, Xiangliang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Reaction prediction, a critical task in synthetic chemistry, is to predict the outcome of a reaction based on given reactants. Generative models like Transformer and VAE have typically been employed to predict the reaction product. However, these likelihood-maximization models overlooked the inherent stochastic nature of chemical reactions, such as the multiple ways electrons can be redistributed among atoms during the reaction process. In scenarios where similar reactants could follow different electron redistribution patterns, these models typically predict the most common outcomes, neglecting less frequent but potentially crucial reaction patterns. These overlooked patterns, though rare, can lead to innovative methods for designing synthetic routes and significantly advance synthesis techniques. To break the limits of previous approaches, we propose organizing the mapping space between reactants and electron redistribution patterns in a divide-and-conquer manner. We address the reaction problem by training multiple expert models, each specializing in capturing a type of electron redistribution pattern in reaction. These experts enhance the prediction process by considering both typical and other less common electron redistribution manners. In the inference stage, a dropout strategy is applied to each expert to improve the electron redistribution diversity. The most plausible products are finally predicted through a ranking stage designed to integrate the predictions from multiple experts. Experimental results on the largest reaction prediction benchmark USPTO-MIT show the superior performance of our proposed method compared to baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: Neural shape representation generally refers to representing 3D geometry using neural networks, e.g., computing a signed distance or occupancy value at a specific spatial position. In this paper we present a neural-network architecture suitable for accurate encoding of 3D shapes in a single forward pass. Our architecture is based on a multi-scale hybrid system incorporating graph-based and voxel-based components, as well as a continuously differentiable decoder. The hybrid system includes a novel way of voxelizing point-based features in neural networks, which we show can be used in combination with oriented point-clouds to obtain smoother and more detailed reconstructions. Furthermore, our network is trained to solve the eikonal equation and only requires knowledge of the zero-level set for training and inference. This means that in contrast to most previous shape encoder architectures, our network is able to output valid signed distance fields without explicit prior knowledge of non-zero distance values or shape occupancy. It also requires only a single forward-pass, instead of the latent-code optimization used in auto-decoder methods. We further propose a modification to the loss function in case that surface normals are not well defined, e.g., in the context of non-watertight surfaces and non-manifold geometry, resulting in an unsigned distance field. Overall, our system can help to reduce the computational overhead of training and evaluating neural distance fields, as well as enabling the application to difficult geometry.</p>

These architectures incorporate structured state space models as integral components and achieve statistically significant performance improvements compared to state-of-the-art approaches on the extensive Sleep Heart Health Study dataset. We anticipate that the architectural insights gained from this study along with the refined methodology for architecture search demonstrated herein will not only prove valuable for future research in sleep staging but also hold relevance for other time series annotation tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samyak Jain, Robert Kirk, Ekdeep Singh Lubana, Robert P. Dick, Hidenori Tanaka, Edward Grefenstette, Tim Rockt\"aschel, David Scott Krueger</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning large pre-trained models has become the de facto strategy for developing both task-specific and general-purpose machine learning systems, including developing models that are safe to deploy. Despite its clear importance, there has been minimal work that explains how fine-tuning alters the underlying capabilities learned by a model during pretraining: does fine-tuning yield entirely novel capabilities or does it just modulate existing ones? We address this question empirically in synthetic, controlled settings where we can use mechanistic interpretability tools (e.g., network pruning and probing) to understand how the model's underlying capabilities are changing. We perform an extensive analysis of the effects of fine-tuning in these settings, and show that: (i) fine-tuning rarely alters the underlying model capabilities; (ii) a minimal transformation, which we call a 'wrapper', is typically learned on top of the underlying model capabilities, creating the illusion that they have been modified; and (iii) further fine-tuning on a task where such hidden capabilities are relevant leads to sample-efficient 'revival' of the capability, i.e., the model begins reusing these capability after only a few gradient steps. This indicates that practitioners can unintentionally remove a model's safety wrapper merely by fine-tuning it on a, e.g., superficially unrelated, downstream task. We additionally perform analysis on language models trained on the TinyStories dataset to support our claims in a more realistic setup.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> C\'edric Goemaere, Johannes Deleu, Thomas Demeester</p>
<p>Abstract: The Hopfield network serves as a fundamental energy-based model in machine learning, capturing memory retrieval dynamics through an ordinary differential equation (ODE). The model's output, the equilibrium point of the ODE, is traditionally computed via synchronous updates using the forward Euler method. This paper aims to overcome some of the disadvantages of this approach. We propose a conceptual shift, viewing Hopfield networks as instances of Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQs). The DEQ framework not only allows for the use of specialized solvers, but also leads to new insights on an empirical inference technique that we will refer to as 'even-odd splitting'. Our theoretical analysis of the method uncovers a parallelizable asynchronous update scheme, which should converge roughly twice as fast as the conventional synchronous updates. Empirical evaluations validate these findings, showcasing the advantages of both the DEQ framework and even-odd splitting in digitally simulating energy minimization in Hopfield networks.

<p>Abstract: Time-series data exists in every corner of real-world systems and services, ranging from satellites in the sky to wearable devices on human bodies. Learning representations by extracting and inferring valuable information from these time series is crucial for understanding the complex dynamics of particular phenomena and enabling informed decisions. With the learned representations, we can perform numerous downstream analyses more effectively. Among several approaches, deep learning has demonstrated remarkable performance in extracting hidden patterns and features from time-series data without manual feature engineering. This survey first presents a novel taxonomy based on three fundamental elements in designing state-of-the-art universal representation learning methods for time series. According to the proposed taxonomy, we comprehensively review existing studies and discuss their intuitions and insights into how these methods enhance the quality of learned representations.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hamid Ghaderi, Brandon Foreman, Chandan K. Reddy, Vignesh Subbian</p>
<p>Abstract: Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) presents a broad spectrum of clinical presentations and outcomes due to its inherent heterogeneity, leading to diverse recovery trajectories and varied therapeutic responses. While many studies have delved into TBI phenotyping for distinct patient populations, identifying TBI phenotypes that consistently generalize across various settings and populations remains a critical research gap. Our research addresses this by employing multivariate time-series clustering to unveil TBI's dynamic intricates. Utilizing a self-supervised learning-based approach to clustering multivariate time-Series data with missing values (SLAC-Time), we analyzed both the research-centric TRACK-TBI and the real-world MIMIC-IV datasets. Remarkably, the optimal hyperparameters of SLAC-Time and the ideal number of clusters remained consistent across these datasets, underscoring SLAC-Time's stability across heterogeneous datasets. Our analysis revealed three generalizable TBI phenotypes ({\alpha}, \b{eta}, and {\gamma}), each exhibiting distinct non-temporal features during emergency department visits, and temporal feature profiles throughout ICU stays. Specifically, phenotype {\alpha} represents mild TBI with a remarkably consistent clinical presentation. In contrast, phenotype \b{eta} signifies severe TBI with diverse clinical manifestations, and phenotype {\gamma} represents a moderate TBI profile in terms of severity and clinical diversity. Age is a significant determinant of TBI outcomes, with older cohorts recording higher mortality rates. Importantly, while certain features varied by age, the core characteristics of TBI manifestations tied to each phenotype remain consistent across diverse populations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xu Weng, KV Ling, Haochen Liu, Kun Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: The pseudorange error is one of the root causes of localization inaccuracy in GPS. Previous data-driven methods regress and eliminate pseudorange errors using handcrafted intermediate labels. Unlike them, we propose an end-to-end GPS localization framework, E2E-PrNet, to train a neural network for pseudorange correction (PrNet) directly using the final task loss calculated with the ground truth of GPS receiver states. The gradients of the loss with respect to learnable parameters are backpropagated through a Differentiable Nonlinear Least Squares (DNLS) optimizer to PrNet. The feasibility of fusing the data-driven neural network and the model-based DNLS module is verified with GPS data collected by Android phones, showing that E2E-PrNet outperforms the baseline weighted least squares method and the state-of-the-art end-to-end data-driven approach. Finally, we discuss the explainability of E2E-PrNet.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoxiang Gao, Zhongruo Wang, Yaqian Li, Kaiwen Long, Ming Yang, Yiqing Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: The advent of foundation models has revolutionized the fields of natural language processing and computer vision, paving the way for their application in autonomous driving (AD). This survey presents a comprehensive review of more than 40 research papers, demonstrating the role of foundation models in enhancing AD. Large language models contribute to planning and simulation in AD, particularly through their proficiency in reasoning, code generation and translation. In parallel, vision foundation models are increasingly adapted for critical tasks such as 3D object detection and tracking, as well as creating realistic driving scenarios for simulation and testing. Multi-modal foundation models, integrating diverse inputs, exhibit exceptional visual understanding and spatial reasoning, crucial for end-to-end AD. This survey not only provides a structured taxonomy, categorizing foundation models based on their modalities and functionalities within the AD domain but also delves into the methods employed in current research. It identifies the gaps between existing foundation models and cutting-edge AD approaches, thereby charting future research directions and proposing a roadmap for bridging these gaps.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> J. Jon Ryu, Xiangxiang Xu, H. S. Melihcan Erol, Yuheng Bu, Lizhong Zheng, Gregory W. Wornell</p>
<p>Abstract: Computing eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) of a given linear operator, or finding its leading eigenvalues and eigenfunctions, is a fundamental task in many machine learning and scientific computing problems. For high-dimensional eigenvalue problems, training neural networks to parameterize the eigenfunctions is considered as a promising alternative to the classical numerical linear algebra techniques. This paper proposes a new optimization framework based on the low-rank approximation characterization of a truncated singular value decomposition, accompanied by new techniques called \emph{nesting} for learning the top-$L$ singular values and singular functions in the correct order. The proposed method promotes the desired orthogonality in the learned functions implicitly and efficiently via an unconstrained optimization formulation, which is easy to solve with off-the-shelf gradient-based optimization algorithms. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed optimization framework for use cases in computational physics and machine learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yoonho Lee, Michelle S. Lam, Helena Vasconcelos, Michael S. Bernstein, Chelsea Finn</p>
<p>Abstract: The standard way to teach models is by feeding them lots of data. However, this approach often teaches models incorrect ideas because they pick up on misleading signals in the data. To prevent such misconceptions, we must necessarily provide additional information beyond the training data. Prior methods incorporate additional instance-level supervision, such as labels for misleading features or additional labels for debiased data. However, such strategies require a large amount of labeler effort. We hypothesize that people are good at providing textual feedback at the concept level, a capability that existing teaching frameworks do not leverage. We propose Clarify, a novel interface and method for interactively correcting model misconceptions. Through Clarify, users need only provide a short text description of a model's consistent failure patterns. Then, in an entirely automated way, we use such descriptions to improve the training process. Clarify is the first end-to-end system for user model correction. Our user studies show that non-expert users can successfully describe model misconceptions via Clarify, leading to increased worst-case performance in two datasets. We additionally conduct a case study on a large-scale image dataset, ImageNet, using Clarify to find and rectify 31 novel hard subpopulations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ademide O. Mabadeje, Michael J. Pyrcz</p>
<p>Abstract: High-dimensional datasets present substantial challenges in statistical modeling across various disciplines, necessitating effective dimensionality reduction methods. Deep learning approaches, notable for their capacity to distill essential features from complex data, facilitate modeling, visualization, and compression through reduced dimensionality latent feature spaces, have wide applications from bioinformatics to earth sciences. This study introduces a novel workflow to evaluate the stability of these latent spaces, ensuring consistency and reliability in subsequent analyses. Stability, defined as the invariance of latent spaces to minor data, training realizations, and parameter perturbations, is crucial yet often overlooked.
  Our proposed methodology delineates three stability types, sample, structural, and inferential, within latent spaces, and introduces a suite of metrics for comprehensive evaluation. We implement this workflow across 500 autoencoder realizations and three datasets, encompassing both synthetic and real-world scenarios to explain latent space dynamics. Employing k-means clustering and the modified Jonker-Volgenant algorithm for class alignment, alongside anisotropy metrics and convex hull analysis, we introduce adjusted stress and Jaccard dissimilarity as novel stability indicators.
  Our findings highlight inherent instabilities in latent feature spaces and demonstrate the workflow's efficacy in quantifying and interpreting these instabilities. This work advances the understanding of latent feature spaces, promoting improved model interpretability and quality control for more informed decision-making for diverse analytical workflows that leverage deep learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhao Wu, Jiangchao Yao, Xiaobo Xia, Jun Yu, Ruxin Wang, Bo Han, Tongliang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the success of the carefully-annotated benchmarks, the effectiveness of existing graph neural networks (GNNs) can be considerably impaired in practice when the real-world graph data is noisily labeled. Previous explorations in sample selection have been demonstrated as an effective way for robust learning with noisy labels, however, the conventional studies focus on i.i.d data, and when moving to non-iid graph data and GNNs, two notable challenges remain: (1) nodes located near topological class boundaries are very informative for classification but cannot be successfully distinguished by the heuristic sample selection. (2) there is no available measure that considers the graph topological information to promote sample selection in a graph. To address this dilemma, we propose a $\textit{Topological Sample Selection}$ (TSS) method that boosts the informative sample selection process in a graph by utilising topological information. We theoretically prove that our procedure minimizes an upper bound of the expected risk under target clean distribution, and experimentally show the superiority of our method compared with state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sergio Nava-Mu\~noz, Mario Graff, Hugo Jair Escalante</p>
<p>Abstract: Collaborative competitions have gained popularity in the scientific and technological fields. These competitions involve defining tasks, selecting evaluation scores, and devising result verification methods. In the standard scenario, participants receive a training set and are expected to provide a solution for a held-out dataset kept by organizers. An essential challenge for organizers arises when comparing algorithms' performance, assessing multiple participants, and ranking them. Statistical tools are often used for this purpose; however, traditional statistical methods often fail to capture decisive differences between systems' performance. This manuscript describes an evaluation methodology for statistically analyzing competition results and competition. The methodology is designed to be universally applicable; however, it is illustrated using eight natural language competitions as case studies involving classification and regression problems. The proposed methodology offers several advantages, including off-the-shell comparisons with correction mechanisms and the inclusion of confidence intervals. Furthermore, we introduce metrics that allow organizers to assess the difficulty of competitions. Our analysis shows the potential usefulness of our methodology for effectively evaluating competition results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samarth Bhatia, Felix Dangel</p>
<p>Abstract: Memory is a limiting resource for many deep learning tasks. Beside the neural network weights, one main memory consumer is the computation graph built up by automatic differentiation (AD) for backpropagation. We observe that PyTorch's current AD implementation neglects information about parameter differentiability when storing the computation graph. This information is useful though to reduce memory whenever gradients are requested for a parameter subset, as is the case in many modern fine-tuning tasks. Specifically, inputs to layers that act linearly in their parameters (dense, convolution, or normalization layers) can be discarded whenever the parameters are marked as non-differentiable. We provide a drop-in, differentiability-agnostic implementation of such layers and demonstrate its ability to reduce memory without affecting run time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Caelin Kaplan, Angelo Rodio, Tareq Si Salem, Chuan Xu, Giovanni Neglia</p>
<p>Abstract: As Internet of Things (IoT) technology advances, end devices like sensors and smartphones are progressively equipped with AI models tailored to their local memory and computational constraints. Local inference reduces communication costs and latency; however, these smaller models typically underperform compared to more sophisticated models deployed on edge servers or in the cloud. Cooperative Inference Systems (CISs) address this performance trade-off by enabling smaller devices to offload part of their inference tasks to more capable devices. These systems often deploy hierarchical models that share numerous parameters, exemplified by Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) that utilize strategies like early exits or ordered dropout. In such instances, Federated Learning (FL) may be employed to jointly train the models within a CIS. Yet, traditional training methods have overlooked the operational dynamics of CISs during inference, particularly the potential high heterogeneity in serving rates across clients. To address this gap, we propose a novel FL approach designed explicitly for use in CISs that accounts for these variations in serving rates. Our framework not only offers rigorous theoretical guarantees, but also surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) training algorithms for CISs, especially in scenarios where inference request rates or data availability are uneven among clients.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12235">Hypergraph: A Unified and Uniform Definition with Application to Chemical Hypergraph and More</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel T. Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: The conventional definition of hypergraph has two major issues: (1) there is not a standard definition of directed hypergraph and (2) there is not a formal definition of nested hypergraph. To resolve these issues, we propose a new definition of hypergraph that unifies the concepts of undirected, directed and nested hypergraphs, and that is uniform in using hyperedge as a single construct for representing high-order correlations among things, i.e., nodes and hyperedges. Specifically, we define a hyperedge to be a simple hyperedge, a nesting hyperedge, or a directed hyperedge. With this new definition, a hypergraph is nested if it has nesting hyperedge(s), and is directed if it has directed hyperedge(s). Otherwise, a hypergraph is a simple hypergraph. The uniformity and power of this new definition, with visualization, should facilitate the use of hypergraph for representing (hierarchical) high-order correlations in general and chemical systems in particular. Graph has been widely used as a mathematical structure for machine learning on molecular structures and 3D molecular geometries. However, graph has a major limitation: it can represent only pairwise correlations between nodes. Hypergraph extends graph with high-order correlations among nodes. This extension is significant or essential for machine learning on chemical systems. For molecules, this is significant as it allows the direct, explicit representation of multicenter bonds and molecular substructures. For chemical reactions, this is essential since most chemical reactions involve multiple participants. We propose the use of chemical hypergraph, a multilevel hypergraph with simple, nesting and directed hyperedges, as a single mathematical structure for representing chemical systems. We apply the new definition of hypergraph to chemical hypergraph and, as simplified versions, molecular hypergraph and chemical reaction hypergraph.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emanuele Troiani, Yatin Dandi, Leonardo Defilippis, Lenka Zdeborov\'a, Bruno Loureiro, Florent Krzakala</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-index models - functions which only depend on the covariates through a non-linear transformation of their projection on a subspace - are a useful benchmark for investigating feature learning with neural networks. This paper examines the theoretical boundaries of efficient learnability in this hypothesis class, focusing particularly on the minimum sample complexity required for weakly recovering their low-dimensional structure with first-order iterative algorithms, in the high-dimensional regime where the number of samples is $n=\alpha d$ is proportional to the covariate dimension $d$. Our findings unfold in three parts: (i) first, we identify under which conditions a trivial subspace can be learned with a single step of a first-order algorithm for any $\alpha\!>\!0$; (ii) second, in the case where the trivial subspace is empty, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of an easy subspace consisting of directions that can be learned only above a certain sample complexity $\alpha\!>\!\alpha_c$. The critical threshold $\alpha_{c}$ marks the presence of a computational phase transition, in the sense that it is conjectured that no efficient iterative algorithm can succeed for $\alpha\!<\!\alpha_c$. In a limited but interesting set of really hard directions - akin to the parity problem - $\alpha_c$ is found to diverge. Finally, (iii) we demonstrate that interactions between different directions can result in an intricate hierarchical learning phenomenon, where some directions can be learned sequentially when coupled to easier ones. Our analytical approach is built on the optimality of approximate message-passing algorithms among first-order iterative methods, delineating the fundamental learnability limit across a broad spectrum of algorithms, including neural networks trained with gradient descent.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingze Wang, Jinbo Wang, Haotian He, Zilin Wang, Guanhua Huang, Feiyu Xiong, Zhiyu Li, Weinan E, Lei Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we propose an Implicit Regularization Enhancement (IRE) framework to accelerate the discovery of flat solutions in deep learning, thereby improving generalization and convergence. Specifically, IRE decouples the dynamics of flat and sharp directions, which boosts the sharpness reduction along flat directions while maintaining the training stability in sharp directions. We show that IRE can be practically incorporated with {\em generic base optimizers} without introducing significant computational overload. Experiments show that IRE consistently improves the generalization performance for image classification tasks across a variety of benchmark datasets (CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet) and models (ResNets and ViTs). Surprisingly, IRE also achieves a $2\times$ {\em speed-up} compared to AdamW in the pre-training of Llama models (of sizes ranging from 60M to 229M) on datasets including Wikitext-103, Minipile, and Openwebtext. Moreover, we provide theoretical guarantees, showing that IRE can substantially accelerate the convergence towards flat minima in Sharpness-aware Minimization (SAM).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sofie Goethals, Eoin Delaney, Brent Mittelstadt, Chris Russell</p>
<p>Abstract: Access to resources strongly constrains the decisions we make. While we might wish to offer every student a scholarship, or schedule every patient for follow-up meetings with a specialist, limited resources mean that this is not possible. When deploying machine learning systems, these resource constraints are simply enforced by varying the threshold of a classifier. However, these finite resource limitations are disregarded by most existing tools for fair machine learning, which do not allow the specification of resource limitations and do not remain fair when varying thresholds. This makes them ill-suited for real-world deployment. Our research introduces the concept of "resource-constrained fairness" and quantifies the cost of fairness within this framework. We demonstrate that the level of available resources significantly influences this cost, a factor overlooked in previous evaluations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mooho Song, Jay-Yoon Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural networks (NN) perform well in diverse tasks, but sometimes produce nonsensical results to humans. Most NN models "solely" learn from (input, output) pairs, occasionally conflicting with human knowledge. Many studies indicate injecting human knowledge by reducing output constraints during training can improve model performance and reduce constraint violations. While there have been several attempts to compare different existing algorithms under the same programming framework, nonetheless, there has been no previous work that categorizes learning algorithms with output constraints in a unified manner. Our contributions are as follows: (1) We categorize the previous studies based on three axes: type of constraint loss used (e.g. probabilistic soft logic, REINFORCE), exploration strategy of constraint-violating examples, and integration mechanism of learning signals from main task and constraint. (2) We propose new algorithms to integrate the information of main task and constraint injection, inspired by continual-learning algorithms. (3) Furthermore, we propose the $H\beta$-score as a metric for considering the main task metric and constraint violation simultaneously. To provide a thorough analysis, we examine all the algorithms on three NLP tasks: natural language inference (NLI), synthetic transduction examples (STE), and semantic role labeling (SRL). We explore and reveal the key factors of various algorithms associated with achieving high $H\beta$-scores.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pio Calderon, Marian-Andrei Rizoiu</p>
<p>Abstract: The spread of content on social media is shaped by intertwining factors on three levels: the source, the content itself, and the pathways of content spread. At the lowest level, the popularity of the sharing user determines its eventual reach. However, higher-level factors such as the nature of the online item and the credibility of its source also play crucial roles in determining how widely and rapidly the online item spreads. In this work, we propose the Bayesian Mixture Hawkes (BMH) model to jointly learn the influence of source, content and spread. We formulate the BMH model as a hierarchical mixture model of separable Hawkes processes, accommodating different classes of Hawkes dynamics and the influence of feature sets on these classes. We test the BMH model on two learning tasks, cold-start popularity prediction and temporal profile generalization performance, applying to two real-world retweet cascade datasets referencing articles from controversial and traditional media publishers. The BMH model outperforms the state-of-the-art models and predictive baselines on both datasets and utilizes cascade- and item-level information better than the alternatives. Lastly, we perform a counter-factual analysis where we apply the trained publisher-level BMH models to a set of article headlines and show that effectiveness of headline writing style (neutral, clickbait, inflammatory) varies across publishers. The BMH model unveils differences in style effectiveness between controversial and reputable publishers, where we find clickbait to be notably more effective for reputable publishers as opposed to controversial ones, which links to the latter's overuse of clickbait.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ninghui Feng, Songning Lai, Jiayu Yang, Fobao Zhou, Zhenxiao Yin, Hang Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series forecasting has become an increasingly popular research area due to its critical applications in various real-world domains such as traffic management, weather prediction, and financial analysis. Despite significant advancements, existing models face notable challenges, including the necessity of manual hyperparameter tuning for different datasets, and difficulty in effectively distinguishing signal from redundant features in data characterized by strong seasonality. These issues hinder the generalization and practical application of time series forecasting models. To solve this issues, we propose an innovative time series forecasting model TimeSieve designed to address these challenges. Our approach employs wavelet transforms to preprocess time series data, effectively capturing multi-scale features without the need for additional parameters or manual hyperparameter tuning. Additionally, we introduce the information bottleneck theory that filters out redundant features from both detail and approximation coefficients, retaining only the most predictive information. This combination reduces significantly improves the model's accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on 70% of the datasets, achieving higher predictive accuracy and better generalization across diverse datasets. Our results validate the effectiveness of our approach in addressing the key challenges in time series forecasting, paving the way for more reliable and efficient predictive models in practical applications.

<p>Abstract: Convolutional neural networks have been successfully extended to operate on graphs, giving rise to Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). GNNs combine information from adjacent nodes by successive applications of graph convolutions. GNNs have been implemented successfully in various learning tasks while the theoretical understanding of their generalization capability is still in progress. In this paper, we leverage manifold theory to analyze the statistical generalization gap of GNNs operating on graphs constructed on sampled points from manifolds. We study the generalization gaps of GNNs on both node-level and graph-level tasks. We show that the generalization gaps decrease with the number of nodes in the training graphs, which guarantees the generalization of GNNs to unseen points over manifolds. We validate our theoretical results in multiple real-world datasets.</p>

The distilled models are interpretable, succinct, and attain similar accuracy to the underlying GNN. Furthermore, when the ground truth is expressible in C2, our approach outperforms the GNN.</p>

FairX enables users to train benchmarking bias-removal models and evaluate their fairness using a wide array of fairness metrics, data utility metrics, and generate explanations for model predictions, all within a unified framework. Existing benchmarking tools do not have the way to evaluate synthetic data generated from fair generative models, also they do not have the support for training fair generative models either. In FairX, we add fair generative models in the collection of our fair-model library (pre-processing, in-processing, post-processing) and evaluation metrics for evaluating the quality of synthetic fair data. This version of FairX supports both tabular and image datasets. It also allows users to provide their own custom datasets. The open-source FairX benchmarking package is publicly available at https://github.com/fahim-sikder/FairX.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ivan Rubachev, Nikolay Kartashev, Yury Gorishniy, Artem Babenko</p>
<p>Abstract: Benchmarks that closely reflect downstream application scenarios are essential for the streamlined adoption of new research in tabular machine learning (ML). In this work, we examine existing tabular benchmarks and find two common characteristics of industry-grade tabular data that are underrepresented in the datasets available to the academic community. First, tabular data often changes over time in real-world deployment scenarios. This impacts model performance and requires time-based train and test splits for correct model evaluation. Yet, existing academic tabular datasets often lack timestamp metadata to enable such evaluation. Second, a considerable portion of datasets in production settings stem from extensive data acquisition and feature engineering pipelines. For each specific dataset, this can have a different impact on the absolute and relative number of predictive, uninformative, and correlated features, which in turn can affect model selection. To fill the aforementioned gaps in academic benchmarks, we introduce TabReD -- a collection of eight industry-grade tabular datasets covering a wide range of domains from finance to food delivery services. We assess a large number of tabular ML models in the feature-rich, temporally-evolving data setting facilitated by TabReD. We demonstrate that evaluation on time-based data splits leads to different methods ranking, compared to evaluation on random splits more common in academic benchmarks. Furthermore, on the TabReD datasets, MLP-like architectures and GBDT show the best results, while more sophisticated DL models are yet to prove their effectiveness.</p>

<p>Abstract: Enterprises have a growing need to identify relevant tables in data lakes; e.g. tables that are unionable, joinable, or subsets of each other. Tabular neural models can be helpful for such data discovery tasks. In this paper, we present TabSketchFM, a neural tabular model for data discovery over data lakes. First, we propose novel pre-training: a sketch-based approach to enhance the effectiveness of data discovery in neural tabular models. Second, we finetune the pretrained model for identifying unionable, joinable, and subset table pairs and show significant improvement over previous tabular neural models. Third, we present a detailed ablation study to highlight which sketches are crucial for which tasks. Fourth, we use these finetuned models to perform table search; i.e., given a query table, find other tables in a corpus that are unionable, joinable, or that are subsets of the query. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in F1 scores for search compared to state-of-the-art techniques. Finally, we show significant transfer across datasets and tasks establishing that our model can generalize across different tasks and over different data lakes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanshu Wang, Wang Li, Tong Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Matrix quantization compresses matrix elements into a more compact form to reduce storage requirements, with dequantization enabling reconstruction for use. We define the Quantization Error Minimization (QEM) problem as minimizing the difference between the original and quantized matrices while ensuring the quantized matrix remains within fixed memory constraints. This technique is crucial in applications like Large Language Model (LLM) weight compression and KV cache compression, where large matrix sizes demand efficient storage solutions.
  As modern LLMs like GPT-4 and BERT continue to grow, effective matrix compression is increasingly important. These models contain billions of parameters in matrix form, making efficient weight quantization essential for both storage and computational efficiency. Similarly, KV caches, storing intermediate inference results, are matrix-based and benefit significantly from optimized compression techniques.
  To address the QEM problem in the context of LLM weight and KV cache compression, we propose Quantum Entanglement Trees (QET). QET leverages the local structure of matrix elements by iteratively swapping elements to create a locally ordered matrix, which is then grouped and quantized column by column. To enhance QET, we introduce two optimizations: residual quantization to further reduce Mean Squared Error (MSE) and masking with batch processing to accelerate the algorithm.
  Our experiments demonstrate that QET can reduce MSE to 12.3% of its original value at the same compression ratio, outperforming leading baseline methods. Our contributions include framing the QEM problem specifically for LLM and KV cache compression, developing the QET algorithm, and implementing optimizations that improve accuracy and processing speed.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Meenatchi Sundaram Muthu Selva Annamalai</p>
<p>Abstract: Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) is a popular iterative algorithm used to train machine learning models while formally guaranteeing the privacy of users. However, the privacy analysis of DP-SGD makes the unrealistic assumption that all intermediate iterates (aka internal state) of the algorithm are released since, in practice, only the final trained model, i.e., the final iterate of the algorithm is released. In this hidden state setting, prior work has provided tighter analyses, albeit only when the loss function is constrained, e.g., strongly convex and smooth or linear. On the other hand, the privacy leakage observed empirically from hidden state DP-SGD, even when using non-convex loss functions, suggests that there is in fact a gap between the theoretical privacy analysis and the privacy guarantees achieved in practice. Therefore, it remains an open question whether hidden state privacy amplification for DP-SGD is possible for all (possibly non-convex) loss functions in general.
  In this work, we design a counter-example and show, both theoretically and empirically, that a hidden state privacy amplification result for DP-SGD for all loss functions in general is not possible. By carefully constructing a loss function for DP-SGD, we show that for specific loss functions, the final iterate of DP-SGD alone leaks as much information as the sequence of all iterates combined. Furthermore, we empirically verify this result by evaluating the privacy leakage from the final iterate of DP-SGD with our loss function and show that this exactly matches the theoretical upper bound guaranteed by DP. Therefore, we show that the current privacy analysis for DP-SGD is tight for general loss functions and conclude that no privacy amplification is possible for DP-SGD in general for all (possibly non-convex) loss functions.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08843">Inflationary Flows: Calibrated Bayesian Inference with Diffusion-Based Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniela de Albuquerque, John Pearson</p>
<p>Abstract: Beyond estimating parameters of interest from data, one of the key goals of statistical inference is to properly quantify uncertainty in these estimates. In Bayesian inference, this uncertainty is provided by the posterior distribution, the computation of which typically involves an intractable high-dimensional integral. Among available approximation methods, sampling-based approaches come with strong theoretical guarantees but scale poorly to large problems, while variational approaches scale well but offer few theoretical guarantees. In particular, variational methods are known to produce overconfident estimates of posterior uncertainty and are typically non-identifiable, with many latent variable configurations generating equivalent predictions. Here, we address these challenges by showing how diffusion-based models (DBMs), which have recently produced state-of-the-art performance in generative modeling tasks, can be repurposed for performing calibrated, identifiable Bayesian inference. By exploiting a previously established connection between the stochastic and probability flow ordinary differential equations (pfODEs) underlying DBMs, we derive a class of models, inflationary flows, that uniquely and deterministically map high-dimensional data to a lower-dimensional Gaussian distribution via ODE integration. This map is both invertible and neighborhood-preserving, with controllable numerical error, with the result that uncertainties in the data are correctly propagated to the latent space. We demonstrate how such maps can be learned via standard DBM training using a novel noise schedule and are effective at both preserving and reducing intrinsic data dimensionality. The result is a class of highly expressive generative models, uniquely defined on a low-dimensional latent space, that afford principled Bayesian inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samyak Jain, Ekdeep Singh Lubana, Kemal Oksuz, Tom Joy, Philip H. S. Torr, Amartya Sanyal, Puneet K. Dokania</p>
<p>Abstract: Safety fine-tuning helps align Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences for their safe deployment. To better understand the underlying factors that make models safe via safety fine-tuning, we design a synthetic data generation framework that captures salient aspects of an unsafe input by modeling the interaction between the task the model is asked to perform (e.g., "design") versus the specific concepts the task is asked to be performed upon (e.g., a "cycle" vs. a "bomb"). Using this, we investigate three well-known safety fine-tuning methods -- supervised safety fine-tuning, direct preference optimization, and unlearning -- and provide significant evidence demonstrating that these methods minimally transform MLP weights to specifically align unsafe inputs into its weights' null space. This yields a clustering of inputs based on whether the model deems them safe or not. Correspondingly, when an adversarial input (e.g., a jailbreak) is provided, its activations are closer to safer samples, leading to the model processing such an input as if it were safe. We validate our findings, wherever possible, on real-world models -- specifically, Llama-2 7B and Llama-3 8B.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Changhun Kim, Taewon Kim, Seungyeon Woo, June Yong Yang, Eunho Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: In real-world applications, tabular data often suffer from distribution shifts due to their widespread and abundant nature, leading to erroneous predictions of pre-trained machine learning models. However, addressing such distribution shifts in the tabular domain has been relatively underexplored due to unique challenges such as varying attributes and dataset sizes, as well as the limited representation learning capabilities of deep learning models for tabular data. Particularly, with the recent promising paradigm of test-time adaptation (TTA), where we adapt the off-the-shelf model to the unlabeled target domain during the inference phase without accessing the source domain, we observe that directly adopting commonly used TTA methods from other domains often leads to model collapse. We systematically explore challenges in tabular data test-time adaptation, including skewed entropy, complex latent space decision boundaries, confidence calibration issues with both overconfident and under-confident, and model bias towards source label distributions along with class imbalances. Based on these insights, we introduce AdapTable, a novel tabular test-time adaptation method that directly modifies output probabilities by estimating target label distributions and adjusting initial probabilities based on calibrated uncertainty. Extensive experiments on both natural distribution shifts and synthetic corruptions demonstrate the adaptation efficacy of the proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhipeng He, Chun Ouyang, Laith Alzubaidi, Alistair Barros, Catarina Moreira</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial attacks are a potential threat to machine learning models by causing incorrect predictions through imperceptible perturbations to the input data. While these attacks have been extensively studied in unstructured data like images, applying them to tabular data, poses new challenges. These challenges arise from the inherent heterogeneity and complex feature interdependencies in tabular data, which differ from the image data. To account for this distinction, it is necessary to establish tailored imperceptibility criteria specific to tabular data. However, there is currently a lack of standardised metrics for assessing the imperceptibility of adversarial attacks on tabular data. To address this gap, we propose a set of key properties and corresponding metrics designed to comprehensively characterise imperceptible adversarial attacks on tabular data. These are: proximity to the original input, sparsity of altered features, deviation from the original data distribution, sensitivity in perturbing features with narrow distribution, immutability of certain features that should remain unchanged, feasibility of specific feature values that should not go beyond valid practical ranges, and feature interdependencies capturing complex relationships between data attributes. We evaluate the imperceptibility of five adversarial attacks, including both bounded attacks and unbounded attacks, on tabular data using the proposed imperceptibility metrics. The results reveal a trade-off between the imperceptibility and effectiveness of these attacks. The study also identifies limitations in current attack algorithms, offering insights that can guide future research in the area. The findings gained from this empirical analysis provide valuable direction for enhancing the design of adversarial attack algorithms, thereby advancing adversarial machine learning on tabular data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohamed Kissi, Mathieu Pont, Joshua A. Levine, Julien Tierny</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a practical approach for the optimization of topological simplification, a central pre-processing step for the analysis and visualization of scalar data. Given an input scalar field f and a set of "signal" persistence pairs to maintain, our approach produces an output field g that is close to f and which optimizes (i) the cancellation of "non-signal" pairs, while (ii) preserving the "signal" pairs. In contrast to pre-existing simplification algorithms, our approach is not restricted to persistence pairs involving extrema and can thus address a larger class of topological features, in particular saddle pairs in three-dimensional scalar data. Our approach leverages recent generic persistence optimization frameworks and extends them with tailored accelerations specific to the problem of topological simplification. Extensive experiments report substantial accelerations over these frameworks, thereby making topological simplification optimization practical for real-life datasets. Our approach enables a direct visualization and analysis of the topologically simplified data, e.g., via isosurfaces of simplified topology (fewer components and handles). We apply our approach to the extraction of prominent filament structures in three-dimensional data. Specifically, we show that our pre-simplification of the data leads to practical improvements over standard topological techniques for removing filament loops. We also show how our approach can be used to repair genus defects in surface processing. Finally, we provide a C++ implementation for reproducibility purposes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aochuan Chen, Jiashun Cheng, Zijing Liu, Ziqi Gao, Fugee Tsung, Yu Li, Jia Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has gained popularity for fine-tuning large foundation models, leveraging low-rank matrices $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ to represent weight changes (i.e., $\Delta \mathbf{W} = \mathbf{B} \mathbf{A}$). This method reduces trainable parameters and mitigates heavy memory consumption associated with full delta matrices by sequentially multiplying $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ with the activation. Despite its success, the intrinsic low-rank characteristic may limit its performance. Although several variants have been proposed to address this issue, they often overlook the crucial computational and memory efficiency brought by LoRA. In this paper, we propose Circular Convolution Adaptation (C$^3$A), which not only achieves high-rank adaptation with enhanced performance but also excels in both computational power and memory utilization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that C$^3$A consistently outperforms LoRA and its variants across various fine-tuning tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruifeng Li, Mingqian Li, Wei Liu, Hongyang Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Effective molecular representation learning is crucial for advancing molecular property prediction and drug design. Mainstream molecular representation learning approaches are based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). However, these approaches struggle with three significant challenges: insufficient annotations, molecular diversity, and architectural limitations such as over-squashing, which leads to the loss of critical structural details. To address these challenges, we introduce a new class of GNNs that integrates the Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), known for their robust data-fitting capabilities and high accuracy in small-scale AI + Science tasks. By incorporating KANs into GNNs, our model enhances the representation of molecular structures. We further advance this approach with a variant called SwallowKAN (SKAN), which employs adaptive Radial Basis Functions (RBFs) as the core of the non-linear neurons. This innovation improves both computational efficiency and adaptability to diverse molecular structures. Building on the strengths of SKAN, we propose a new class of GNNs, GNN-SKAN, and its augmented variant, GNN-SKAN+, which incorporates a SKAN-based classifier to further boost performance. To our knowledge, this is the first work to integrate KANs into GNN architectures tailored for molecular representation learning. Experiments across 6 classification datasets, 6 regression datasets, and 4 few-shot learning datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves new state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and computational cost.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the evolution of large language models, traditional Transformer models become computationally demanding for lengthy sequences due to the quadratic growth in computation with respect to the sequence length. Mamba, emerging as a groundbreaking architecture in the field of generative AI, demonstrates remarkable proficiency in handling elongated sequences with reduced computational and memory complexity. Nevertheless, the existing training framework of Mamba presents inefficiency with variable-length sequence inputs. Either single-sequence training results in low GPU utilization, or batched processing of variable-length sequences to a maximum length incurs considerable memory and computational overhead. To address this problem, we analyze the performance of bottleneck operators in Mamba under diverse tensor shapes and proposed PackMamba, a high-throughput Mamba that efficiently handles variable-length sequences. Diving deep into state-space models (SSMs), we modify the parallel operators to avoid passing information between individual sequences while maintaining high performance. Experimental results on an NVIDIA A100 GPU demonstrate throughput exceeding the baseline single-sequence processing scheme: 3.06x speedup on the 1.4B model and 2.62x on the 2.8B model.</p>

<p>Abstract: The emergence of abundant electricity time series (ETS) data provides ample opportunities for various applications in the power systems, including demand-side management, grid stability, and consumer behavior analysis. Deep learning models have advanced ETS modeling by effectively capturing sequence dependence. Nevertheless, learning a generic representation of ETS data for various applications remains challenging due to the inherently complex hierarchical structure of ETS data. Moreover, ETS data exhibits intricate temporal dependencies and is suscepti ble to the influence of exogenous variables. Furthermore, different instances exhibit diverse electricity consumption behavior. In this paper, we propose a foundation model PowerPM to model ETS data, providing a large-scale, off-the-shelf model for power systems. PowerPM consists of a temporal encoder and a hierarchical encoder. The temporal encoder captures both temporal dependencies in ETS data, considering exogenous variables. The hierarchical encoder models the correlation between hierarchy. Furthermore, PowerPM leverages a novel self-supervised pretraining framework consisting of masked ETS modeling and dual-view contrastive learning, which enable PowerPM to capture temporal dependency within ETS windows and aware the discrepancy across ETS windows, providing two different perspectives to learn generic representation. Our experiments involve five real world scenario datasets, comprising private and public data. Through pre-training on massive ETS data, PowerPM achieves SOTA performance on diverse downstream tasks within the private dataset. Impressively, when transferred to the public datasets, PowerPM maintains its superiority, showcasing its remarkable generalization ability across various tasks and domains. Moreover, ablation studies, few-shot experiments provide additional evidence of the effectiveness of our model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenbin Hu, Huihao Jing, Qi Hu, Haoran Li, Yangqiu Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Textual graphs are ubiquitous in real-world applications, featuring rich text information with complex relationships, which enables advanced research across various fields. Textual graph representation learning aims to generate low-dimensional feature embeddings from textual graphs that can improve the performance of downstream tasks. A high-quality feature embedding should effectively capture both the structural and the textual information in a textual graph. However, most textual graph dataset benchmarks rely on word2vec techniques to generate feature embeddings, which inherently limits their capabilities. Recent works on textual graph representation learning can be categorized into two folds: supervised and unsupervised methods. Supervised methods finetune a language model on labeled nodes, which have limited capabilities when labeled data is scarce. Unsupervised methods, on the other hand, extract feature embeddings by developing complex training pipelines. To address these limitations, we propose a novel unified unsupervised learning autoencoder framework, named Node Level Graph AutoEncoder (NodeGAE). We employ language models as the backbone of the autoencoder, with pretraining on text reconstruction. Additionally, we add an auxiliary loss term to make the feature embeddings aware of the local graph structure. Our method maintains simplicity in the training process and demonstrates generalizability across diverse textual graphs and downstream tasks. We evaluate our method on two core graph representation learning downstream tasks: node classification and link prediction. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach substantially enhances the performance of diverse graph neural networks (GNNs) across multiple textual graph datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuan Tian, Tianyi Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) such as Copilot and ChatGPT have transformed software development by automating coding tasks. Despite these advancements, challenges remain in reducing error rates and fully meeting user expectations. Our empirical study reveals LLMs tend to dilute their self-attention on the initial prompt as more code tokens are generated. We hypothesize this self-attention dilution issue is one of the root causes of inaccuracies in LLM-generated code. To mitigate this issue, we propose Selective Prompt Anchoring (SPA). SPA amplifies the influence of the selected parts in the initial prompt, which we refer to as ``anchored text'', during code generation. Specifically, SPA calculates the logit distribution difference with and without the anchored text. We prove this difference approximates the anchored text's contextual contribution to the output logits. SPA creates an augmented logit distribution by linearly combining the original logit distribution and the logit difference. We evaluate SPA with five LLMs on four benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that using SPA can consistently improve Pass@1 rates by up to 9.7% in all settings. Notably, with selective text anchoring, a small version of DeepSeek-Coder (6.7B) can achieve better performance than an original much larger version (33B).

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10468">Tracing Privacy Leakage of Language Models to Training Data via Adjusted Influence Functions</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinxin Liu, Zao Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: The responses generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) can include sensitive information from individuals and organizations, leading to potential privacy leakage. This work implements Influence Functions (IFs) to trace privacy leakage back to the training data, thereby mitigating privacy concerns of Language Models (LMs). However, we notice that current IFs struggle to accurately estimate the influence of tokens with large gradient norms, potentially overestimating their influence. When tracing the most influential samples, this leads to frequently tracing back to samples with large gradient norm tokens, overshadowing the actual most influential samples even if their influences are well estimated. To address this issue, we propose Heuristically Adjusted IF (HAIF), which reduces the weight of tokens with large gradient norms, thereby significantly improving the accuracy of tracing the most influential samples. To establish easily obtained groundtruth for tracing privacy leakage, we construct two datasets, PII-E and PII-CR, representing two distinct scenarios: one with identical text in the model outputs and pre-training data, and the other where models leverage their reasoning abilities to generate text divergent from pre-training data. HAIF significantly improves tracing accuracy, enhancing it by 20.96\% to 73.71\% on the PII-E dataset and 3.21\% to 45.93\% on the PII-CR dataset, compared to the best SOTA IFs against various GPT-2 and QWen-1.5 models. HAIF also outperforms SOTA IFs on real-world pretraining data CLUECorpus2020, demonstrating strong robustness regardless prompt and response lengths.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Zhang, Chen Huang, Kevin Cao, Yueke Zhang, Scott Thomas Andersen, Huajie Shao, Kevin Leach, Yu Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Compiled software is delivered as executable binary code. Developers write source code to express the software semantics, but the compiler converts it to a binary format that the CPU can directly execute. Therefore, binary code analysis is critical to applications in reverse engineering and computer security tasks where source code is not available. However, unlike source code and natural language that contain rich semantic information, binary code is typically difficult for human engineers to understand and analyze. While existing work uses AI models to assist source code analysis, few studies have considered binary code. In this paper, we propose a COntrastive learning Model for Binary cOde Analysis, or COMBO, that incorporates source code and comment information into binary code during representation learning. Specifically, we present three components in COMBO: (1) a primary contrastive learning method for cold-start pre-training, (2) a simplex interpolation method to incorporate source code, comments, and binary code, and (3) an intermediate representation learning algorithm to provide binary code embeddings. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of the pre-trained representations produced by COMBO using three indicative downstream tasks relating to binary code: algorithmic functionality classification, binary code similarity, and vulnerability detection. Our experimental results show that COMBO facilitates representation learning of binary code visualized by distribution analysis, and improves the performance on all three downstream tasks by 5.45% on average compared to state-of-the-art large-scale language representation models. To the best of our knowledge, COMBO is the first language representation model that incorporates source code, binary code, and comments into contrastive code representation learning and unifies multiple tasks for binary code analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingxuan Liu, Subhankar Roy, Zhun Zhong, Nicu Sebe, Elisa Ricci</p>
<p>Abstract: Discovering novel concepts in unlabelled datasets and in a continuous manner is an important desideratum of lifelong learners. In the literature such problems have been partially addressed under very restricted settings, where novel classes are learned by jointly accessing a related labelled set (e.g., NCD) or by leveraging only a supervisedly pre-trained model (e.g., class-iNCD). In this work we challenge the status quo in class-iNCD and propose a learning paradigm where class discovery occurs continuously and truly unsupervisedly, without needing any related labelled set. In detail, we propose to exploit the richer priors from strong self-supervised pre-trained models (PTM). To this end, we propose simple baselines, composed of a frozen PTM backbone and a learnable linear classifier, that are not only simple to implement but also resilient under longer learning scenarios. We conduct extensive empirical evaluation on a multitude of benchmarks and show the effectiveness of our proposed baselines when compared with sophisticated state-of-the-art methods. The code is open source.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12822">Quantifying the effect of X-ray scattering for data generation in real-time defect detection</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Vladyslav Andriiashen, Robert van Liere, Tristan van Leeuwen, K. Joost Batenburg</p>
<p>Abstract: Background: X-ray imaging is widely used for the non-destructive detection of defects in industrial products on a conveyor belt. In-line detection requires highly accurate, robust, and fast algorithms. Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) satisfy these requirements when a large amount of labeled data is available. To overcome the challenge of collecting these data, different methods of X-ray image generation are considered.
  Objective: Depending on the desired degree of similarity to real data, different physical effects should either be simulated or can be ignored. X-ray scattering is known to be computationally expensive to simulate, and this effect can greatly affect the accuracy of a generated X-ray image. We aim to quantitatively evaluate the effect of scattering on defect detection.
  Methods: Monte-Carlo simulation is used to generate X-ray scattering distribution. DCNNs are trained on the data with and without scattering and applied to the same test datasets. Probability of Detection (POD) curves are computed to compare their performance, characterized by the size of the smallest detectable defect.
  Results: We apply the methodology to a model problem of defect detection in cylinders. When trained on data without scattering, DCNNs reliably detect defects larger than 1.3 mm, and using data with scattering improves performance by less than 5%. If the analysis is performed on the cases with large scattering-to-primary ratio ($1 < SPR < 5$), the difference in performance could reach 15% (approx. 0.4 mm).
  Conclusion: Excluding the scattering signal from the training data has the largest effect on the smallest detectable defects, and the difference decreases for larger defects. The scattering-to-primary ratio has a significant effect on detection performance and the required accuracy of data generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ronja Stern, Vishvaksenan Rasiah, Veton Matoshi, Srinanda Br\"ugger Bose, Matthias St\"urmer, Ilias Chalkidis, Daniel E. Ho, Joel Niklaus</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent strides in Large Language Models (LLMs) have saturated many Natural Language Processing (NLP) benchmarks, emphasizing the need for more challenging ones to properly assess LLM capabilities. However, domain-specific and multilingual benchmarks are rare because they require in-depth expertise to develop. Still, most public models are trained predominantly on English corpora, while other languages remain understudied, particularly for practical domain-specific NLP tasks. In this work, we introduce a novel NLP benchmark for the legal domain that challenges LLMs in five key dimensions: processing \emph{long documents} (up to 50K tokens), using \emph{domain-specific knowledge} (embodied in legal texts), \emph{multilingual} understanding (covering five languages), \emph{multitasking} (comprising legal document-to-document Information Retrieval, Court View Generation, Leading Decision Summarization, Citation Extraction, and eight challenging Text Classification tasks) and \emph{reasoning} (comprising especially Court View Generation, but also the Text Classification tasks). Our benchmark contains diverse datasets from the Swiss legal system, allowing for a comprehensive study of the underlying non-English, inherently multilingual legal system. Despite the large size of our datasets (some with hundreds of thousands of examples), existing publicly available multilingual models struggle with most tasks, even after extensive in-domain pre-training and fine-tuning. We publish all resources (benchmark suite, pre-trained models, code) under permissive open CC BY-SA licenses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juan G. Restrepo, Clayton P. Byers, Per Sebastian Skardal</p>
<p>Abstract: Identifying and suppressing unknown disturbances to dynamical systems is a problem with applications in many different fields. Here we present a model-free method to identify and suppress an unknown disturbance to an unknown system based only on previous observations of the system under the influence of a known forcing function. We find that, under very mild restrictions on the training function, our method is able to robustly identify and suppress a large class of unknown disturbances. We illustrate our scheme with the identification of both deterministic and stochastic unknown disturbances to an analog electric chaotic circuit and with numerical examples where a chaotic disturbance to various chaotic dynamical systems is identified and suppressed.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sanket Jantre, Shrijita Bhattacharya, Tapabrata Maiti</p>
<p>Abstract: Network complexity and computational efficiency have become increasingly significant aspects of deep learning. Sparse deep learning addresses these challenges by recovering a sparse representation of the underlying target function by reducing heavily over-parameterized deep neural networks. Specifically, deep neural architectures compressed via structured sparsity (e.g. node sparsity) provide low latency inference, higher data throughput, and reduced energy consumption. In this paper, we explore two well-established shrinkage techniques, Lasso and Horseshoe, for model compression in Bayesian neural networks. To this end, we propose structurally sparse Bayesian neural networks which systematically prune excessive nodes with (i) Spike-and-Slab Group Lasso (SS-GL), and (ii) Spike-and-Slab Group Horseshoe (SS-GHS) priors, and develop computationally tractable variational inference including continuous relaxation of Bernoulli variables. We establish the contraction rates of the variational posterior of our proposed models as a function of the network topology, layer-wise node cardinalities, and bounds on the network weights. We empirically demonstrate the competitive performance of our models compared to the baseline models in prediction accuracy, model compression, and inference latency.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12163">Quantum Inception Score</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Akira Sone, Akira Tanji, Naoki Yamamoto</p>
<p>Abstract: Motivated by the great success of classical generative models in machine learning, enthusiastic exploration of their quantum version has recently started. To depart on this journey, it is important to develop a relevant metric to evaluate the quality of quantum generative models; in the classical case, one such example is the (classical) inception score (cIS). In this paper, as a natural extension of cIS, we propose the quantum inception score (qIS) for quantum generators. Importantly, qIS relates the quality to the Holevo information of the quantum channel that classifies a given dataset. In this context, we show several properties of qIS. First, qIS is greater than or equal to the corresponding cIS, which is defined through projection measurements on the system output. Second, the difference between qIS and cIS arises from the presence of quantum coherence, as characterized by the resource theory of asymmetry. Third, when a set of entangled generators is prepared, there exists a classifying process leading to the further enhancement of qIS. Fourth, we harness the quantum fluctuation theorem to characterize the physical limitation of qIS. Finally, we apply qIS to assess the quality of the one-dimensional spin chain model as a quantum generative model, with the quantum convolutional neural network as a quantum classifier, for the phase classification problem in the quantum many-body physics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emilio Morales-Juarez, Gibran Fuentes-Pineda</p>
<p>Abstract: Although the capacity of deep generative models for image generation, such as Diffusion Models (DMs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), has dramatically improved in recent years, much of their success can be attributed to computationally expensive architectures. This has limited their adoption and use to research laboratories and companies with large resources, while significantly raising the carbon footprint for training, fine-tuning, and inference. In this work, we present LadaGAN, an efficient generative adversarial network that is built upon a novel Transformer block named Ladaformer. The main component of this block is a linear additive-attention mechanism that computes a single attention vector per head instead of the quadratic dot-product attention. We employ Ladaformer in both the generator and discriminator, which reduces the computational complexity and overcomes the training instabilities often associated with Transformer GANs. LadaGAN consistently outperforms existing convolutional and Transformer GANs on benchmark datasets at different resolutions while being significantly more efficient. Moreover, LadaGAN shows competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art multi-step generative models (e.g. DMs) using orders of magnitude less computational resources.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Claudio Spiess, David Gros, Kunal Suresh Pai, Michael Pradel, Md Rafiqul Islam Rabin, Amin Alipour, Susmit Jha, Prem Devanbu, Toufique Ahmed</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning models are widely used, but can also often be wrong. Users would benefit from a reliable indication of whether a given output from a given model should be trusted, so a rational decision can be made whether to use the output or not. For example, outputs can be associated with a confidence measure; if this confidence measure is strongly associated with likelihood of correctness, then the model is said to be well-calibrated.
  A well-calibrated confidence measure can serve as a basis for rational, graduated decision-making on how much review and care is needed when using generated code. Calibration has so far been studied in mostly non-generative (e.g. classification) settings, especially in software engineering. However, generated code can quite often be wrong: Given generated code, developers must decide whether to use directly, use after varying intensity of careful review, or discard model-generated code. Thus, calibration is vital in generative settings.
  We make several contributions. We develop a framework for evaluating the calibration of code-generating models. We consider several tasks, correctness criteria, datasets, and approaches, and find that, by and large, generative code models we test are not well-calibrated out of the box. We then show how calibration can be improved using standard methods, such as Platt scaling. Since Platt scaling relies on the prior availability of correctness data, we evaluate the applicability and generalizability of Platt scaling in software engineering, discuss settings where it has good potential for practical use, and settings where it does not. Our contributions will lead to better-calibrated decision-making in the current use of code generated by language models, and offers a framework for future research to further improve calibration methods for generative models in software engineering.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Preetam Prabhu Srikar Dammu, Himanshu Naidu, Mouly Dewan, YoungMin Kim, Tanya Roosta, Aman Chadha, Chirag Shah</p>
<p>Abstract: In the midst of widespread misinformation and disinformation through social media and the proliferation of AI-generated texts, it has become increasingly difficult for people to validate and trust information they encounter. Many fact-checking approaches and tools have been developed, but they often lack appropriate explainability or granularity to be useful in various contexts. A text validation method that is easy to use, accessible, and can perform fine-grained evidence attribution has become crucial. More importantly, building user trust in such a method requires presenting the rationale behind each prediction, as research shows this significantly influences people's belief in automated systems. Localizing and bringing users' attention to the specific problematic content is also paramount, instead of providing simple blanket labels. In this paper, we present ClaimVer, a human-centric framework tailored to meet users' informational and verification needs by generating rich annotations and thereby reducing cognitive load. Designed to deliver comprehensive evaluations of texts, it highlights each claim, verifies it against a trusted knowledge graph (KG), presents the evidence, and provides succinct, clear explanations for each claim prediction. Finally, our framework introduces an attribution score, enhancing applicability across a wide range of downstream tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eduardo Fernandes Montesuma, Fred Ngol\`e Mboula, Antoine Souloumiac</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we tackle Multi-Source Domain Adaptation (MSDA), a task in transfer learning where one adapts multiple heterogeneous, labeled source probability measures towards a different, unlabeled target measure. We propose a novel framework for MSDA, based on Optimal Transport (OT) and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs). Our framework has two key advantages. First, OT between GMMs can be solved efficiently via linear programming. Second, it provides a convenient model for supervised learning, especially classification, as components in the GMM can be associated with existing classes. Based on the GMM-OT problem, we propose a novel technique for calculating barycenters of GMMs. Based on this novel algorithm, we propose two new strategies for MSDA: GMM-Wasserstein Barycenter Transport (WBT) and GMM-Dataset Dictionary Learning (DaDiL). We empirically evaluate our proposed methods on four benchmarks in image classification and fault diagnosis, showing that we improve over the prior art while being faster and involving fewer parameters.

<p>Abstract: This paper makes the first attempt towards unsupervised preference alignment in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We generate chosen and rejected responses with regard to the original and augmented image pairs, and conduct preference alignment with direct preference optimization. It is based on a core idea: properly designed augmentation to the image input will induce VLM to generate false but hard negative responses, which helps the model to learn from and produce more robust and powerful answers. The whole pipeline no longer hinges on supervision from GPT-4 or human involvement during alignment, and is highly efficient with few lines of code. With only 8k randomly sampled unsupervised data, it achieves 90\% relative score to GPT-4 on complex reasoning in LLaVA-Bench, and improves LLaVA-7B/13B by 6.7\%/5.6\% score on complex multi-modal benchmark MM-Vet. Visualizations shows its improved ability to align with user-intentions. A series of ablations are firmly conducted to reveal the latent mechanism of the approach, which also indicates its potential towards further scaling.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaming He, Wenbo Jiang, Guanyu Hou, Wenshu Fan, Rui Zhang, Hongwei Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Mainstream backdoor attacks on large language models (LLMs) typically set a fixed trigger in the input instance and specific responses for triggered queries. However, the fixed trigger setting (e.g., unusual words) may be easily detected by human detection, limiting the effectiveness and practicality in real-world scenarios. To enhance the stealthiness of backdoor activation, we present a new poisoning paradigm against LLMs triggered by specifying generation conditions, which are commonly adopted strategies by users during model inference. The poisoned model performs normally for output under normal/other generation conditions, while becomes harmful for output under target generation conditions. To achieve this objective, we introduce BrieFool, an efficient attack framework. It leverages the characteristics of generation conditions by efficient instruction sampling and poisoning data generation, thereby influencing the behavior of LLMs under target conditions. Our attack can be generally divided into two types with different targets: Safety unalignment attack and Ability degradation attack. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that BrieFool is effective across safety domains and ability domains, achieving higher success rates than baseline methods, with 94.3 % on GPT-3.5-turbo</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chaoyi Deng, Jialong Wu, Ningya Feng, Jianmin Wang, Mingsheng Long</p>
<p>Abstract: Effective code optimization in compilers is crucial for computer and software engineering. The success of these optimizations primarily depends on the selection and ordering of the optimization passes applied to the code. While most compilers rely on a fixed sequence of optimization passes, current methods to find the optimal sequence either employ impractically slow search algorithms or learning methods that struggle to generalize to code unseen during training. We introduce CompilerDream, a model-based reinforcement learning approach to general code optimization. CompilerDream comprises a compiler world model that accurately simulates the intrinsic properties of optimization passes and an agent trained on this model to produce effective optimization strategies. By training on a large-scale program dataset, CompilerDream is equipped to serve as a general code optimizer across various application scenarios and source-code languages. Our extensive experiments first highlight CompilerDream's strong optimization capabilities for autotuning, where it leads the CompilerGym leaderboard. More importantly, the zero-shot generalization ability of large-scale trained compiler world model and agent, excels across diverse datasets, surpassing LLVM's built-in optimizations and other state-of-the-art methods in both settings of value prediction and end-to-end code optimization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenyu Zhang, Li Shen, Chuan-Sheng Foo</p>
<p>Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) aims to adapt a source model trained on a fully-labeled source domain to a related but unlabeled target domain. While the source model is a key avenue for acquiring target pseudolabels, the generated pseudolabels may exhibit source bias. In the conventional SFDA pipeline, a large data (e.g. ImageNet) pre-trained feature extractor is used to initialize the source model at the start of source training, and subsequently discarded. Despite having diverse features important for generalization, the pre-trained feature extractor can overfit to the source data distribution during source training and forget relevant target domain knowledge. Rather than discarding this valuable knowledge, we introduce an integrated framework to incorporate pre-trained networks into the target adaptation process. The proposed framework is flexible and allows us to plug modern pre-trained networks into the adaptation process to leverage their stronger representation learning capabilities. For adaptation, we propose the Co-learn algorithm to improve target pseudolabel quality collaboratively through the source model and a pre-trained feature extractor. Building on the recent success of the vision-language model CLIP in zero-shot image recognition, we present an extension Co-learn++ to further incorporate CLIP's zero-shot classification decisions. We evaluate on 4 benchmark datasets and include more challenging scenarios such as open-set, partial-set and open-partial SFDA. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed strategy improves adaptation performance and can be successfully integrated with existing SFDA methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Enqiang Xu, Yiming Qiu, Junyang Bai, Ping Zhang, Dadong Miao, Songlin Wang, Guoyu Tang, Lin Liu, Mingming Li</p>
<p>Abstract: In large e-commerce platforms, search systems are typically composed of a series of modules, including recall, pre-ranking, and ranking phases. The pre-ranking phase, serving as a lightweight module, is crucial for filtering out the bulk of products in advance for the downstream ranking module. Industrial efforts on optimizing the pre-ranking model have predominantly focused on enhancing ranking consistency, model structure, and generalization towards long-tail items. Beyond these optimizations, meeting the system performance requirements presents a significant challenge. Contrasting with existing industry works, we propose a novel method: a Generalizable and RAnk-ConsistEnt Pre-Ranking Model (GRACE), which achieves: 1) Ranking consistency by introducing multiple binary classification tasks that predict whether a product is within the top-k results as estimated by the ranking model, which facilitates the addition of learning objectives on common point-wise ranking models; 2) Generalizability through contrastive learning of representation for all products by pre-training on a subset of ranking product embeddings; 3) Ease of implementation in feature construction and online deployment. Our extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements in both offline metrics and online A/B test: a 0.75% increase in AUC and a 1.28% increase in CVR.</p>

In this paper, we provide a transparent physics analysis of diffusion models, formulating the fluctuation theorem, entropy production, equilibrium measure, and Franz-Parisi potential to understand the dynamic process and intrinsic phase transitions. Our analysis is rooted in a path integral representation of both forward and backward dynamics, and in treating the reverse diffusion generative process as a statistical inference, where the time-dependent state variables serve as quenched disorder akin to that in spin glass theory. Our study thus links stochastic thermodynamics, statistical inference and geometry based analysis together to yield a coherent picture about how the generative diffusion models work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benjamin C. Lee, David Brooks, Arthur van Benthem, Udit Gupta, Gage Hills, Vincent Liu, Benjamin Pierce, Christopher Stewart, Emma Strubell, Gu-Yeon Wei, Adam Wierman, Yuan Yao, Minlan Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Computing is at a moment of profound opportunity. Emerging applications -- such as capable artificial intelligence, immersive virtual realities, and pervasive sensor systems -- drive unprecedented demand for computer. Despite recent advances toward net zero carbon emissions, the computing industry's gross energy usage continues to rise at an alarming rate, outpacing the growth of new energy installations and renewable energy deployments. A shift towards sustainability is needed to spark a transformation in how computer systems are manufactured, allocated, and consumed. Carbon Connect envisions coordinated research thrusts that produce design and management strategies for sustainable, next-generation computer systems. These strategies must flatten and then reverse growth trajectories for computing power and carbon for society's most rapidly growing applications such as artificial intelligence and virtual spaces. We will require accurate models for carbon accounting in computing technology. For embodied carbon, we must re-think conventional design strategies -- over-provisioned monolithic servers, frequent hardware refresh cycles, custom silicon -- and adopt life-cycle design strategies that more effectively reduce, reuse and recycle hardware at scale. For operational carbon, we must not only embrace renewable energy but also design systems to use that energy more efficiently. Finally, new hardware design and management strategies must be cognizant of economic policy and regulatory landscape, aligning private initiatives with societal goals. Many of these broader goals will require computer scientists to develop deep, enduring collaborations with researchers in economics, law, and industrial ecology to spark change in broader practice.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> F\'elix Marcoccia, C\'edric Adjih, Paul M\"uhlethaler</p>
<p>Abstract: Most of multiple link prediction or graph generation techniques rely on the attention mechanism or on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which consist in leveraging node-level information exchanges in order to form proper link predictions. Such node-level interactions do not process nodes as an ordered sequence, which would imply some kind of natural ordering of the nodes: they are said to be permutation invariant mechanisms. They are well suited for graph problems, but struggle at providing a global orchestration of the predicted links, which can result in a loss of performance. Some typical issues can be the difficulty to ensure high-level properties such as global connectedness, fixed diameter or to avoid information bottleneck effects such as oversmoothing and oversquashing, which respectively consist in abundant smoothing in dense areas leading to a loss of information and a tendency to exclude isolated nodes from the message passing scheme, and often result in irrelevant, unbalanced link predictions. To tackle this problem, we hereby present Cross-Attentive Modulation (CAM) tokens, which introduce cross-attentive units used to condition node and edge-level modulations in order to enable context-aware computations that improve the global consistency of the prediction links. We will implement it on a few permutation invariant architectures, and showcase benchmarks that prove the merits of our work.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being deployed across various domains today. However, their capacity to solve Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges in cybersecurity has not been thoroughly evaluated. To address this, we develop a novel method to assess LLMs in solving CTF challenges by creating a scalable, open-source benchmark database specifically designed for these applications. This database includes metadata for LLM testing and adaptive learning, compiling a diverse range of CTF challenges from popular competitions. Utilizing the advanced function calling capabilities of LLMs, we build a fully automated system with an enhanced workflow and support for external tool calls. Our benchmark dataset and automated framework allow us to evaluate the performance of five LLMs, encompassing both black-box and open-source models. This work lays the foundation for future research into improving the efficiency of LLMs in interactive cybersecurity tasks and automated task planning. By providing a specialized dataset, our project offers an ideal platform for developing, testing, and refining LLM-based approaches to vulnerability detection and resolution. Evaluating LLMs on these challenges and comparing with human performance yields insights into their potential for AI-driven cybersecurity solutions to perform real-world threat management. We make our dataset open source to public https://github.com/NYU-LLM-CTF/LLM_CTF_Database along with our playground automated framework https://github.com/NYU-LLM-CTF/llm_ctf_automation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maxime Vaillant (MARACAS), Alix Jeannerot (MARACAS), Jean-Marie Gorce (MARACAS)</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a learning-based approach to optimize a joint constellation for a multi-user MIMO broadcast channel ($T$ Tx antennas, $K$ users, each with $R$ Rx antennas), with perfect channel knowledge. The aim of the optimizer (MAX-MIN) is to maximize the minimum mutual information between the  transmitter and each receiver, under a sum-power constraint. The proposed optimization method do neither impose the transmitter to use superposition coding (SC) or any other linear precoding, nor to use successive interference cancellation (SIC) at the receiver. Instead, the approach designs a joint constellation, optimized such that its projection into the subspace of each receiver $k$, maximizes the minimum mutual information $I(W_k;Y_k)$ between each transmitted binary input $W_k$ and the output signal at the intended receiver $Y_k$. The rates obtained by our method are compared to those achieved with linear precoders.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simon Hirsch, Jonathan Berrisch, Florian Ziel</p>
<p>Abstract: Large-scale streaming data are common in modern machine learning applications and have led to the development of online learning algorithms. Many fields, such as supply chain management, weather and meteorology, energy markets, and finance, have pivoted towards using probabilistic forecasts, which yields the need not only for accurate learning of the expected value but also for learning the conditional heteroskedasticity and conditional distribution moments. Against this backdrop, we present a methodology for online estimation of regularized, linear distributional models. The proposed algorithm is based on a combination of recent developments for the online estimation of LASSO models and the well-known GAMLSS framework. We provide a case study on day-ahead electricity price forecasting, in which we show the competitive performance of the incremental estimation combined with strongly reduced computational effort. Our algorithms are implemented in a computationally efficient Python package.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Oluyemi Enoch Amujo, Shanchieh Jay Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have expanded into various domains. However, there remains a need to evaluate how these models perform when prompted with commonplace queries compared to domain-specific queries, which may be useful for benchmarking prior to fine-tuning for domain-specific downstream tasks. This study evaluates LLMs, specifically Gemma-2B and Gemma-7B, across diverse domains, including cybersecurity, medicine, and finance, compared to common knowledge queries. This study utilizes a comprehensive methodology to assess foundational models, which includes problem formulation, data analysis, and the development of ThroughCut, a novel outlier detection technique that automatically identifies response throughput outliers based on their conciseness. This methodological rigor enhances the credibility of the presented evaluation frameworks. This study focused on assessing inference time, response length, throughput, quality, and resource utilization and investigated the correlations between these factors. The results indicate that model size and types of prompts used for inference significantly influenced response length and quality. In addition, common prompts, which include various types of queries, generate diverse and inconsistent responses at irregular intervals. In contrast, domain-specific prompts consistently generate concise responses within a reasonable time. Overall, this study underscores the need for comprehensive evaluation frameworks to enhance the reliability of benchmarking procedures in multidomain AI research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kyra Wilson, Aylin Caliskan</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) hiring tools have revolutionized resume screening, and large language models (LLMs) have the potential to do the same. However, given the biases which are embedded within LLMs, it is unclear whether they can be used in this scenario without disadvantaging groups based on their protected attributes. In this work, we investigate the possibilities of using LLMs in a resume screening setting via a document retrieval framework that simulates job candidate selection. Using that framework, we then perform a resume audit study to determine whether a selection of Massive Text Embedding (MTE) models are biased in resume screening scenarios. We simulate this for nine occupations, using a collection of over 500 publicly available resumes and 500 job descriptions. We find that the MTEs are biased, significantly favoring White-associated names in 85.1\% of cases and female-associated names in only 11.1\% of cases, with a minority of cases showing no statistically significant differences. Further analyses show that Black males are disadvantaged in up to 100\% of cases, replicating real-world patterns of bias in employment settings, and validate three hypotheses of intersectionality. We also find an impact of document length as well as the corpus frequency of names in the selection of resumes. These findings have implications for widely used AI tools that are automating employment, fairness, and tech policy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammed Rakib, Adil Aman Mohammed, D. Cole Diggins, Sumit Sharma, Jeff Michael Sadler, Tyson Ochsner, Arun Bagavathi</p>
<p>Abstract: Soil moisture estimation is an important task to enable precision agriculture in creating optimal plans for irrigation, fertilization, and harvest. It is common to utilize statistical and machine learning models to estimate soil moisture from traditional data sources such as weather forecasts, soil properties, and crop properties. However, there is a growing interest in utilizing aerial and geospatial imagery to estimate soil moisture. Although these images capture high-resolution crop details, they are expensive to curate and challenging to interpret. Imagine, an AI-enhanced software tool that predicts soil moisture using visual cues captured by smartphones and statistical data given by weather forecasts. This work is a first step towards that goal of developing a multi-modal approach for soil moisture estimation. In particular, we curate a dataset consisting of real-world images taken from ground stations and their corresponding weather data. We also propose MIS-ME - Meteorological & Image based Soil Moisture Estimator, a multi-modal framework for soil moisture estimation. Our extensive analysis shows that MIS-ME achieves a MAPE of 10.14%, outperforming traditional unimodal approaches with a reduction of 3.25% in MAPE for meteorological data and 2.15% in MAPE for image data, highlighting the effectiveness of tailored multi-modal approaches.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Julen Urain, Ajay Mandlekar, Yilun Du, Mahi Shafiullah, Danfei Xu, Katerina Fragkiadaki, Georgia Chalvatzaki, Jan Peters</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning from Demonstrations, the field that proposes to learn robot behavior models from data, is gaining popularity with the emergence of deep generative models. Although the problem has been studied for years under names such as Imitation Learning, Behavioral Cloning, or Inverse Reinforcement Learning, classical methods have relied on models that don't capture complex data distributions well or don't scale well to large numbers of demonstrations. In recent years, the robot learning community has shown increasing interest in using deep generative models to capture the complexity of large datasets. In this survey, we aim to provide a unified and comprehensive review of the last year's progress in the use of deep generative models in robotics. We present the different types of models that the community has explored, such as energy-based models, diffusion models, action value maps, or generative adversarial networks. We also present the different types of applications in which deep generative models have been used, from grasp generation to trajectory generation or cost learning. One of the most important elements of generative models is the generalization out of distributions. In our survey, we review the different decisions the community has made to improve the generalization of the learned models. Finally, we highlight the research challenges and propose a number of future directions for learning deep generative models in robotics.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08459">JPEG-LM: LLMs as Image Generators with Canonical Codec Representations</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaochuang Han, Marjan Ghazvininejad, Pang Wei Koh, Yulia Tsvetkov</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent work in image and video generation has been adopting the autoregressive LLM architecture due to its generality and potentially easy integration into multi-modal systems. The crux of applying autoregressive training in language generation to visual generation is discretization -- representing continuous data like images and videos as discrete tokens. Common methods of discretizing images and videos include modeling raw pixel values, which are prohibitively lengthy, or vector quantization, which requires convoluted pre-hoc training. In this work, we propose to directly model images and videos as compressed files saved on computers via canonical codecs (e.g., JPEG, AVC/H.264). Using the default Llama architecture without any vision-specific modifications, we pretrain JPEG-LM from scratch to generate images (and AVC-LM to generate videos as a proof of concept), by directly outputting compressed file bytes in JPEG and AVC formats. Evaluation of image generation shows that this simple and straightforward approach is more effective than pixel-based modeling and sophisticated vector quantization baselines (on which our method yields a 31% reduction in FID). Our analysis shows that JPEG-LM has an especial advantage over vector quantization models in generating long-tail visual elements. Overall, we show that using canonical codec representations can help lower the barriers between language generation and visual generation, facilitating future research on multi-modal language/image/video LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the Venture Capital(VC) industry, predicting the success of startups is challenging due to limited financial data and the need for subjective revenue forecasts. Previous methods based on time series analysis or deep learning often fall short as they fail to incorporate crucial inter-company relationships such as competition and collaboration. Regarding the issues, we propose a novel approach using GrahphRAG augmented time series model. With GraphRAG, time series predictive methods are enhanced by integrating these vital relationships into the analysis framework, allowing for a more dynamic understanding of the startup ecosystem in venture capital. Our experimental results demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms previous models in startup success predictions. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first application work of GraphRAG.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rishit Dagli, Atsuhiro Hibi, Rahul G. Krishnan, Pascal N. Tyrrell</p>
<p>Abstract: Current methods for performing 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis (NVS) in ultrasound imaging data often face severe artifacts when training NeRF-based approaches. The artifacts produced by current approaches differ from NeRF floaters in general scenes because of the unique nature of ultrasound capture. Furthermore, existing models fail to produce reasonable 3D reconstructions when ultrasound data is captured or obtained casually in uncontrolled environments, which is common in clinical settings. Consequently, existing reconstruction and NVS methods struggle to handle ultrasound motion, fail to capture intricate details, and cannot model transparent and reflective surfaces. In this work, we introduced NeRF-US, which incorporates 3D-geometry guidance for border probability and scattering density into NeRF training, while also utilizing ultrasound-specific rendering over traditional volume rendering. These 3D priors are learned through a diffusion model. Through experiments conducted on our new "Ultrasound in the Wild" dataset, we observed accurate, clinically plausible, artifact-free reconstructions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Machine vision enhances automation, quality control, and operational efficiency in industrial applications by enabling machines to interpret and act on visual data. While traditional computer vision algorithms and approaches remain widely utilized, machine learning has become pivotal in current research activities. In particular, generative AI demonstrates promising potential by improving pattern recognition capabilities, through data augmentation, increasing image resolution, and identifying anomalies for quality control. However, the application of generative AI in machine vision is still in its early stages due to challenges in data diversity, computational requirements, and the necessity for robust validation methods. A comprehensive literature review is essential to understand the current state of generative AI in industrial machine vision, focusing on recent advancements, applications, and research trends. Thus, a literature review based on the PRISMA guidelines was conducted, analyzing over 1,200 papers on generative AI in industrial machine vision. Our findings reveal various patterns in current research, with the primary use of generative AI being data augmentation, for machine vision tasks such as classification and object detection. Furthermore, we gather a collection of application challenges together with data requirements to enable a successful application of generative AI in industrial machine vision. This overview aims to provide researchers with insights into the different areas and applications within current research, highlighting significant advancements and identifying opportunities for future work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zijian Zhao, Tingwei Chen, Zhijie Cai, Xiaoyang Li, Hang Li, Qimei Chen, Guangxu Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, Wi-Fi sensing has garnered significant attention due to its numerous benefits, such as privacy protection, low cost, and penetration ability. Extensive research has been conducted in this field, focusing on areas such as gesture recognition, people identification, and fall detection. However, many data-driven methods encounter challenges related to domain shift, where the model fails to perform well in environments different from the training data. One major factor contributing to this issue is the limited availability of Wi-Fi sensing datasets, which makes models learn excessive irrelevant information and over-fit to the training set. Unfortunately, collecting large-scale Wi-Fi sensing datasets across diverse scenarios is a challenging task. To address this problem, we propose CrossFi, a siamese network-based approach that excels in both in-domain scenario and cross-domain scenario, including few-shot, zero-shot scenarios, and even works in few-shot new-class scenario where testing set contains new categories. The core component of CrossFi is a sample-similarity calculation network called CSi-Net, which improves the structure of the siamese network by using an attention mechanism to capture similarity information, instead of simply calculating the distance or cosine similarity. Based on it, we develop an extra Weight-Net that can generate a template for each class, so that our CrossFi can work in different scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our CrossFi achieves state-of-the-art performance across various scenarios. In gesture recognition task, our CrossFi achieves an accuracy of 98.17% in in-domain scenario, 91.72% in one-shot cross-domain scenario, 64.81% in zero-shot cross-domain scenario, and 84.75% in one-shot new-class scenario. To facilitate future research, we will release the code for our model upon publication.</p>
