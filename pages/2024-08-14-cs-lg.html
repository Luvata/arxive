<p><b>Authors:</b> Jannatul Ferdaus, Sameera Pisupati, Mahedi Hasan, Sathwick Paladugu</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning enables robots to learn from each other's experiences without relying on centralized data collection. Each robot independently maintains a model of crop conditions and chemical spray effectiveness, which is periodically shared with other robots in the fleet. A communication protocol is designed to optimize chemical spray applications by facilitating the exchange of information about crop conditions, weather, and other critical factors. The federated learning algorithm leverages this shared data to continuously refine the chemical spray strategy, reducing waste and improving crop yields. This approach has the potential to revolutionize the agriculture industry by offering a scalable and efficient solution for crop protection. However, significant challenges remain, including the development of a secure and robust communication protocol, the design of a federated learning algorithm that effectively integrates data from multiple sources, and ensuring the safety and reliability of autonomous robots. The proposed cluster-based federated learning approach also effectively reduces the computational load on the global server and minimizes communication overhead among clients.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ismail Khalfaoui-Hassani</p>
<p>Abstract: This thesis presents and evaluates the Dilated Convolution with Learnable Spacings (DCLS) method. Through various supervised learning experiments in the fields of computer vision, audio, and speech processing, the DCLS method proves to outperform both standard and advanced convolution techniques. The research is organized into several steps, starting with an analysis of the literature and existing convolution techniques that preceded the development of the DCLS method. We were particularly interested in the methods that are closely related to our own and that remain essential to capture the nuances and uniqueness of our approach. The cornerstone of our study is the introduction and application of the DCLS method to convolutional neural networks (CNNs), as well as to hybrid architectures that rely on both convolutional and visual attention approaches. DCLS is shown to be particularly effective in tasks such as classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection. Initially using bilinear interpolation, the study also explores other interpolation methods, finding that Gaussian interpolation slightly improves performance. The DCLS method is further applied to spiking neural networks (SNNs) to enable synaptic delay learning within a neural network that could eventually be transferred to so-called neuromorphic chips. The results show that the DCLS method stands out as a new state-of-the-art technique in SNN audio classification for certain benchmark tasks in this field. These tasks involve datasets with a high temporal component. In addition, we show that DCLS can significantly improve the accuracy of artificial neural networks for the multi-label audio classification task. We conclude with a discussion of the chosen experimental setup, its limitations, the limitations of our method, and our results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zibo Liu, Zhe Jiang, Shigang Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Long-term traffic flow forecasting plays a crucial role in intelligent transportation as it allows traffic managers to adjust their decisions in advance. However, the problem is challenging due to spatio-temporal correlations and complex dynamic patterns in continuous-time stream data. Neural Differential Equations (NDEs) are among the state-of-the-art methods for learning continuous-time traffic dynamics. However, the traditional NDE models face issues in long-term traffic forecasting due to failures in capturing delayed traffic patterns, dynamic edge (location-to-location correlation) patterns, and abrupt trend patterns. To fill this gap, we propose a new NDE architecture called Multi-View Neural Differential Equations. Our model captures current states, delayed states, and trends in different state variables (views) by learning latent multiple representations within Neural Differential Equations. Extensive experiments conducted on several real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art and achieves superior prediction accuracy for long-term forecasting and robustness with noisy or missing inputs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Lengyel, Panos Parpas, Boumediene Hamzi, Houman Owhadi</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper examines the application of the Kernel Sum of Squares (KSOS) method for enhancing kernel learning from data, particularly in the context of dynamical systems. Traditional kernel-based methods, despite their theoretical soundness and numerical efficiency, frequently struggle with selecting optimal base kernels and parameter tuning, especially with gradient-based methods prone to local optima. KSOS mitigates these issues by leveraging a global optimization framework with kernel-based surrogate functions, thereby achieving more reliable and precise learning of dynamical systems. Through comprehensive numerical experiments on the Logistic Map, Henon Map, and Lorentz System, KSOS is shown to consistently outperform gradient descent in minimizing the relative-$\rho$ metric and improving kernel accuracy. These results highlight KSOS's effectiveness in predicting the behavior of chaotic dynamical systems, demonstrating its capability to adapt kernels to underlying dynamics and enhance the robustness and predictive power of kernel-based approaches, making it a valuable asset for time series analysis in various scientific fields.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06486">Implicit Neural Representation For Accurate CFD Flow Field Prediction</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Laurent de Vito, Nils Pinnau, Simone Dey</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the plethora of deep learning frameworks for flow field prediction, most of them deal with flow fields on regular domains, and although the best ones can cope with irregular domains, they mostly rely on graph networks, so that real industrial applications remain currently elusive. We present a deep learning framework for 3D flow field prediction applied to blades of aircraft engine turbines and compressors. Crucially, we view any 3D field as a function from coordinates that is modeled by a neural network we call the backbone-net. It inherits the property of coordinate-based MLPs, namely the discretization-agnostic representation of flow fields in domains of arbitrary topology at infinite resolution. First, we demonstrate the performance of the backbone-net solo in regressing 3D steady simulations of single blade rows in various flow regimes: it can accurately render important flow characteristics such as boundary layers, wakes and shock waves. Second, we introduce a hyper-net that maps the surface mesh of a blade to the parameters of the backbone-net. By doing so, the flow solution can be directly predicted from the blade geometry, irrespective of its parameterization. Together, backbone-net and hyper-net form a highly-accurate memory-efficient data-driven proxy to CFD solvers with good generalization on unseen geometries.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jun Yuan, Aritra Dasgupta</p>
<p>Abstract: Explainable AI~(XAI) methods such as SHAP can help discover feature attributions in black-box models. If the method reveals a significant attribution from a ``protected feature'' (e.g., gender, race) on the model output, the model is considered unfair. However, adversarial attacks can subvert the detection of XAI methods. Previous approaches to constructing such an adversarial model require access to underlying data distribution, which may not be possible in many practical scenarios. We relax this constraint and propose a novel family of attacks, called shuffling attacks, that are data-agnostic. The proposed attack strategies can adapt any trained machine learning model to fool Shapley value-based explanations. We prove that Shapley values cannot detect shuffling attacks. However, algorithms that estimate Shapley values, such as linear SHAP and SHAP, can detect these attacks with varying degrees of effectiveness. We demonstrate the efficacy of the attack strategies by comparing the performance of linear SHAP and SHAP using real-world datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Wu, Daryl Chang, Jennifer She, Zhe Zhao, Li Wei, Lukasz Heldt</p>
<p>Abstract: We present the Learned Ranking Function (LRF), a system that takes short-term user-item behavior predictions as input and outputs a slate of recommendations that directly optimizes for long-term user satisfaction. Most previous work is based on optimizing the hyperparameters of a heuristic function. We propose to model the problem directly as a slate optimization problem with the objective of maximizing long-term user satisfaction. We also develop a novel constraint optimization algorithm that stabilizes objective trade-offs for multi-objective optimization. We evaluate our approach with live experiments and describe its deployment on YouTube.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06526">Operator Learning Using Random Features: A Tool for Scientific Computing</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicholas H. Nelsen, Andrew M. Stuart</p>
<p>Abstract: Supervised operator learning centers on the use of training data, in the form of input-output pairs, to estimate maps between infinite-dimensional spaces. It is emerging as a powerful tool to complement traditional scientific computing, which may often be framed in terms of operators mapping between spaces of functions. Building on the classical random features methodology for scalar regression, this paper introduces the function-valued random features method. This leads to a supervised operator learning architecture that is practical for nonlinear problems yet is structured enough to facilitate efficient training through the optimization of a convex, quadratic cost. Due to the quadratic structure, the trained model is equipped with convergence guarantees and error and complexity bounds, properties that are not readily available for most other operator learning architectures. At its core, the proposed approach builds a linear combination of random operators. This turns out to be a low-rank approximation of an operator-valued kernel ridge regression algorithm, and hence the method also has strong connections to Gaussian process regression. The paper designs function-valued random features that are tailored to the structure of two nonlinear operator learning benchmark problems arising from parametric partial differential equations. Numerical results demonstrate the scalability, discretization invariance, and transferability of the function-valued random features method.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06549">Prioritizing Modalities: Flexible Importance Scheduling in Federated Multimodal Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jieming Bian, Lei Wang, Jie Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning approach that enables devices to collaboratively train models without sharing their local data, ensuring user privacy and scalability. However, applying FL to real-world data presents challenges, particularly as most existing FL research focuses on unimodal data. Multimodal Federated Learning (MFL) has emerged to address these challenges, leveraging modality-specific encoder models to process diverse datasets. Current MFL methods often uniformly allocate computational frequencies across all modalities, which is inefficient for IoT devices with limited resources. In this paper, we propose FlexMod, a novel approach to enhance computational efficiency in MFL by adaptively allocating training resources for each modality encoder based on their importance and training requirements. We employ prototype learning to assess the quality of modality encoders, use Shapley values to quantify the importance of each modality, and adopt the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) method from deep reinforcement learning to optimize the allocation of training resources. Our method prioritizes critical modalities, optimizing model performance and resource utilization. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves the performance of MFL models.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06620">Unveiling the Flaws: A Critical Analysis of Initialization Effect on Time Series Anomaly Detection</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Alex Koran, Hadi Hojjati, Narges Armanfard</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning for time-series anomaly detection (TSAD) has gained significant attention over the past decade. Despite the reported improvements in several papers, the practical application of these models remains limited. Recent studies have cast doubt on these models, attributing their results to flawed evaluation techniques. However, the impact of initialization has largely been overlooked. This paper provides a critical analysis of the initialization effects on TSAD model performance. Our extensive experiments reveal that TSAD models are highly sensitive to hyperparameters such as window size, seed number, and normalization. This sensitivity often leads to significant variability in performance, which can be exploited to artificially inflate the reported efficacy of these models. We demonstrate that even minor changes in initialization parameters can result in performance variations that overshadow the claimed improvements from novel model architectures. Our findings highlight the need for rigorous evaluation protocols and transparent reporting of preprocessing steps to ensure the reliability and fairness of anomaly detection methods. This paper calls for a more cautious interpretation of TSAD advancements and encourages the development of more robust and transparent evaluation practices to advance the field and its practical applications.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06621">Towards Robust and Cost-Efficient Knowledge Unlearning for Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sungmin Cha, Sungjun Cho, Dasol Hwang, Moontae Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning and memorization capabilities via pretraining on massive textual corpora. However, training LLMs on human-written text entails significant risk of privacy and copyright violations, which demands an efficient machine unlearning framework to remove knowledge of sensitive data without retraining the model from scratch. While Gradient Ascent (GA) is widely used for unlearning by reducing the likelihood of generating unwanted information, the unboundedness of increasing the cross-entropy loss causes not only unstable optimization, but also catastrophic forgetting of knowledge that needs to be retained. We also discover its joint application under low-rank adaptation results in significantly suboptimal computational cost vs. generative performance trade-offs. In light of this limitation, we propose two novel techniques for robust and cost-efficient unlearning on LLMs. We first design an Inverted Hinge loss that suppresses unwanted tokens by increasing the probability of the next most likely token, thereby retaining fluency and structure in language generation. We also propose to initialize low-rank adapter weights based on Fisher-weighted low-rank approximation, which induces faster unlearning and better knowledge retention by allowing model updates to be focused on parameters that are important in generating textual data we wish to remove.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao-Ran Yang, Chuan-Xian Ren, You-Wei Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Aiming to generalize the label knowledge from a source domain with continuous outputs to an unlabeled target domain, Domain Adaptation Regression (DAR) is developed for complex practical learning problems. However, due to the continuity problem in regression, existing conditional distribution alignment theory and methods with discrete prior, which are proven to be effective in classification settings, are no longer applicable. In this work, focusing on the feasibility problems in DAR, we establish the sufficiency theory for the regression model, which shows the generalization error can be sufficiently dominated by the cross-domain conditional discrepancy. Further, to characterize conditional discrepancy with continuous conditioning variable, a novel Conditional Operator Discrepancy (COD) is proposed, which admits the metric property on conditional distributions via the kernel embedding theory. Finally, to minimize the discrepancy, a COD-based conditional invariant representation learning model is proposed, and the reformulation is derived to show that reasonable modifications on moment statistics can further improve the discriminability of the adaptation model. Extensive experiments on standard DAR datasets verify the validity of theoretical results and the superiority over SOTA DAR methods.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06665">RW-NSGCN: A Robust Approach to Structural Attacks via Negative Sampling</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuqi He, Jun Zhuang, Ding Wang, Jun Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Node classification using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has been widely applied in various practical scenarios, such as predicting user interests and detecting communities in social networks. However, recent studies have shown that graph-structured networks often contain potential noise and attacks, in the form of topological perturbations and weight disturbances, which can lead to decreased classification performance in GNNs. To improve the robustness of the model, we propose a novel method: Random Walk Negative Sampling Graph Convolutional Network (RW-NSGCN). Specifically, RW-NSGCN integrates the Random Walk with Restart (RWR) and PageRank (PGR) algorithms for negative sampling and employs a Determinantal Point Process (DPP)-based GCN for convolution operations. RWR leverages both global and local information to manage noise and local variations, while PGR assesses node importance to stabilize the topological structure. The DPP-based GCN ensures diversity among negative samples and aggregates their features to produce robust node embeddings, thereby improving classification performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the RW-NSGCN model effectively addresses network topology attacks and weight instability, increasing the accuracy of anomaly detection and overall stability. In terms of classification accuracy, RW-NSGCN significantly outperforms existing methods, showing greater resilience across various scenarios and effectively mitigating the impact of such vulnerabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinseong Park, Seungyun Lee, Woojin Jeong, Yujin Choi, Jaewook Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series generation is widely used in real-world applications such as simulation, data augmentation, and hypothesis test techniques. Recently, diffusion models have emerged as the de facto approach for time series generation, emphasizing diverse synthesis scenarios based on historical or correlated time series data streams. Since time series have unique characteristics, such as fixed time order and data scaling, standard Gaussian prior might be ill-suited for general time series generation. In this paper, we exploit the usage of diverse prior distributions for synthesis. Then, we propose TimeBridge, a framework that enables flexible synthesis by leveraging diffusion bridges to learn the transport between chosen prior and data distributions. Our model covers a wide range of scenarios in time series diffusion models, which leverages (i) data- and time-dependent priors for unconditional synthesis, and (ii) data-scale preserving synthesis with a constraint as a prior for conditional generation. Experimentally, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in both unconditional and conditional time series generation tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gregory Yampolsky, Dhruv Desai, Mingshu Li, Stefano Pasquali, Dhagash Mehta</p>
<p>Abstract: The explainability of black-box machine learning algorithms, commonly known as Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), has become crucial for financial and other regulated industrial applications due to regulatory requirements and the need for transparency in business practices. Among the various paradigms of XAI, Explainable Case-Based Reasoning (XCBR) stands out as a pragmatic approach that elucidates the output of a model by referencing actual examples from the data used to train or test the model. Despite its potential, XCBR has been relatively underexplored for many algorithms such as tree-based models until recently. We start by observing that most XCBR methods are defined based on the distance metric learned by the algorithm. By utilizing a recently proposed technique to extract the distance metric learned by Random Forests (RFs), which is both geometry- and accuracy-preserving, we investigate various XCBR methods. These methods amount to identify special points from the training datasets, such as prototypes, critics, counter-factuals, and semi-factuals, to explain the predictions for a given query of the RF. We evaluate these special points using various evaluation metrics to assess their explanatory power and effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jian Xu, Delu Zeng, John Paisley</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, a sparse version of Student-t Processes, termed sparse variational Student-t Processes, has been proposed to enhance computational efficiency and flexibility for real-world datasets using stochastic gradient descent. However, traditional gradient descent methods like Adam may not fully exploit the parameter space geometry, potentially leading to slower convergence and suboptimal performance. To mitigate these issues, we adopt natural gradient methods from information geometry for variational parameter optimization of Student-t Processes. This approach leverages the curvature and structure of the parameter space, utilizing tools such as the Fisher information matrix which is linked to the Beta function in our model. This method provides robust mathematical support for the natural gradient algorithm when using Student's t-distribution as the variational distribution. Additionally, we present a mini-batch algorithm for efficiently computing natural gradients. Experimental results across four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method consistently accelerates convergence speed.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jian Xu, Shian Du, Junmei Yang, Qianli Ma, Delu Zeng</p>
<p>Abstract: Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models (GPLVMs) have become increasingly popular for unsupervised tasks such as dimensionality reduction and missing data recovery due to their flexibility and non-linear nature. An importance-weighted version of the Bayesian GPLVMs has been proposed to obtain a tighter variational bound. However, this version of the approach is primarily limited to analyzing simple data structures, as the generation of an effective proposal distribution can become quite challenging in high-dimensional spaces or with complex data sets. In this work, we propose an Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS) approach to address these issues. By transforming the posterior into a sequence of intermediate distributions using annealing, we combine the strengths of Sequential Monte Carlo samplers and VI to explore a wider range of posterior distributions and gradually approach the target distribution. We further propose an efficient algorithm by reparameterizing all variables in the evidence lower bound (ELBO). Experimental results on both toy and image datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of tighter variational bounds, higher log-likelihoods, and more robust convergence.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06717">Computation-friendly Graph Neural Network Design by Accumulating Knowledge on Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jialiang Wang, Shimin Di, Hanmo Liu, Zhili Wang, Jiachuan Wang, Lei Chen, Xiaofang Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), like other neural networks, have shown remarkable success but are hampered by the complexity of their architecture designs, which heavily depend on specific data and tasks. Traditionally, designing proper architectures involves trial and error, which requires intensive manual effort to optimize various components. To reduce human workload, researchers try to develop automated algorithms to design GNNs. However, both experts and automated algorithms suffer from two major issues in designing GNNs: 1) the substantial computational resources expended in repeatedly trying candidate GNN architectures until a feasible design is achieved, and 2) the intricate and prolonged processes required for humans or algorithms to accumulate knowledge of the interrelationship between graphs, GNNs, and performance.
  To further enhance the automation of GNN architecture design, we propose a computation-friendly way to empower Large Language Models (LLMs) with specialized knowledge in designing GNNs, thereby drastically shortening the computational overhead and development cycle of designing GNN architectures. Our framework begins by establishing a knowledge retrieval pipeline that comprehends the intercorrelations between graphs, GNNs, and performance. This pipeline converts past model design experiences into structured knowledge for LLM reference, allowing it to quickly suggest initial model proposals. Subsequently, we introduce a knowledge-driven search strategy that emulates the exploration-exploitation process of human experts, enabling quick refinement of initial proposals within a promising scope. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework can efficiently deliver promising (e.g., Top-5.77%) initial model proposals for unseen datasets within seconds and without any prior training and achieve outstanding search performance in a few iterations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jialiang Wang, Ning Zhang, Shimin Di, Ruidong Wang, Lei Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning from Label Proportion (LLP) is a weakly supervised learning scenario in which training data is organized into predefined bags of instances, disclosing only the class label proportions per bag. This paradigm is essential for user modeling and personalization, where user privacy is paramount, offering insights into user preferences without revealing individual data. LLP faces a unique difficulty: the misalignment between bag-level supervision and the objective of instance-level prediction, primarily due to the inherent ambiguity in label proportion matching. Previous studies have demonstrated deep representation learning can generate auxiliary signals to promote the supervision level in the image domain. However, applying these techniques to tabular data presents significant challenges: 1) they rely heavily on label-invariant augmentation to establish multi-view, which is not feasible with the heterogeneous nature of tabular datasets, and 2) tabular datasets often lack sufficient semantics for perfect class distinction, making them prone to suboptimality caused by the inherent ambiguity of label proportion matching.
  To address these challenges, we propose an augmentation-free contrastive framework TabLLP-BDC that introduces class-aware supervision (explicitly aware of class differences) at the instance level. Our solution features a two-stage Bag Difference Contrastive (BDC) learning mechanism that establishes robust class-aware instance-level supervision by disassembling the nuance between bag label proportions, without relying on augmentations. Concurrently, our model presents a pioneering multi-task pretraining pipeline tailored for tabular-based LLP, capturing intrinsic tabular feature correlations in alignment with label proportion distribution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TabLLP-BDC achieves state-of-the-art performance for LLP in the tabular domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aishwarya Gupta, Indranil Saha, Piyush Rai</p>
<p>Abstract: Rigorous testing of machine learning models is necessary for trustworthy deployments. We present a novel black-box approach for generating test-suites for robust testing of deep neural networks (DNNs). Most existing methods create test inputs based on maximizing some "coverage" criterion/metric such as a fraction of neurons activated by the test inputs. Such approaches, however, can only analyze each neuron's behavior or each layer's output in isolation and are unable to capture their collective effect on the DNN's output, resulting in test suites that often do not capture the various failure modes of the DNN adequately. These approaches also require white-box access, i.e., access to the DNN's internals (node activations). We present a novel black-box coverage criterion called Co-Domain Coverage (CDC), which is defined as a function of the model's output and thus takes into account its end-to-end behavior. Subsequently, we develop a new fuzz testing procedure named CoDoFuzz, which uses CDC to guide the fuzzing process to generate a test suite for a DNN. We extensively compare the test suite generated by CoDoFuzz with those generated using several state-of-the-art coverage-based fuzz testing methods for the DNNs trained on six publicly available datasets. Experimental results establish the efficiency and efficacy of CoDoFuzz in generating the largest number of misclassified inputs and the inputs for which the model lacks confidence in its decision.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Styliani Katsarou, Francesca Carminati, Martin Dlask, Marta Braojos, Lavena Patra, Richard Perkins, Carlos Garcia Ling, Maria Paskevich</p>
<p>Abstract: A good understanding of player preferences is crucial for increasing content relevancy, especially in mobile games. This paper illustrates the use of attentive models for producing item recommendations in a mobile game scenario. The methodology comprises a combination of supervised and unsupervised approaches to create user-level recommendations while introducing a novel scale-invariant approach to the prediction. The methodology is subsequently applied to a bundle recommendation in Candy Crush Saga. The strategy of deployment, maintenance, and monitoring of ML models that are scaled up to serve millions of users is presented, along with the best practices and design patterns adopted to minimize technical debt typical of ML systems. The recommendation approach is evaluated both offline and online, with a focus on understanding the increase in engagement, click- and take rates, novelty effects, recommendation diversity, and the impact of degenerate feedback loops. We have demonstrated that the recommendation enhances user engagement by 30% concerning click rate and by more than 40% concerning take rate. In addition, we empirically quantify the diminishing effects of recommendation accuracy on user engagement.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> A. Quadir, Mushir Akhtar, M. Tanveer</p>
<p>Abstract: Multiview learning (MvL) is an advancing domain in machine learning, leveraging multiple data perspectives to enhance model performance through view-consistency and view-discrepancy. Despite numerous successful multiview-based SVM models, existing frameworks predominantly focus on the consensus principle, often overlooking the complementarity principle. Furthermore, they exhibit limited robustness against noisy, error-prone, and view-inconsistent samples, prevalent in multiview datasets. To tackle the aforementioned limitations, this paper introduces Wave-MvSVM, a novel multiview support vector machine framework leveraging the wave loss (W-loss) function, specifically designed to harness both consensus and complementarity principles. Unlike traditional approaches that often overlook the complementary information among different views, the proposed Wave-MvSVM ensures a more comprehensive and resilient learning process by integrating both principles effectively. The W-loss function, characterized by its smoothness, asymmetry, and bounded nature, is particularly effective in mitigating the adverse effects of noisy and outlier data, thereby enhancing model stability. Theoretically, the W-loss function also exhibits a crucial classification-calibrated property, further boosting its effectiveness. Wave-MvSVM employs a between-view co-regularization term to enforce view consistency and utilizes an adaptive combination weight strategy to maximize the discriminative power of each view. The optimization problem is efficiently solved using a combination of GD and the ADMM, ensuring reliable convergence to optimal solutions. Theoretical analyses, grounded in Rademacher complexity, validate the generalization capabilities of the Wave-MvSVM model. Extensive empirical evaluations across diverse datasets demonstrate the superior performance of Wave-MvSVM in comparison to existing benchmark models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Different activation functions work best for different deep learning models. To exploit this, we leverage recent advancements in gradient-based search techniques for neural architectures to efficiently identify high-performing activation functions for a given application. We propose a fine-grained search cell that combines basic mathematical operations to model activation functions, allowing for the exploration of novel activations. Our approach enables the identification of specialized activations, leading to improved performance in every model we tried, from image classification to language models. Moreover, the identified activations exhibit strong transferability to larger models of the same type, as well as new datasets. Importantly, our automated process for creating customized activation functions is orders of magnitude more efficient than previous approaches. It can easily be applied on top of arbitrary deep learning pipelines and thus offers a promising practical avenue for enhancing deep learning architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sajjad Hashemian, Mohammad Saeed Arvenaghi, Ebrahim Ardeshir-Larijani</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce new algorithms for Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with outliers. Utilizing techniques from computational geometry, specifically higher-degree Voronoi diagrams, we navigate to the optimal subspace for PCA even in the presence of outliers. This approach achieves an optimal solution with a time complexity of $n^{d+\mathcal{O}(1)}\text{poly}(n,d)$. Additionally, we present a randomized algorithm with a complexity of $2^{\mathcal{O}(r(d-r))} \times \text{poly}(n, d)$. This algorithm samples subspaces characterized in terms of a Grassmannian manifold. By employing such sampling method, we ensure a high likelihood of capturing the optimal subspace, with the success probability $(1 - \delta)^T$. Where $\delta$ represents the probability that a sampled subspace does not contain the optimal solution, and $T$ is the number of subspaces sampled, proportional to $2^{r(d-r)}$. Our use of higher-degree Voronoi diagrams and Grassmannian based sampling offers a clearer conceptual pathway and practical advantages, particularly in handling large datasets or higher-dimensional settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuyang Xue, Junyu Yan, Raman Dutt, Fasih Haider, Jingshuai Liu, Steven McDonagh, Sotirios A. Tsaftaris</p>
<p>Abstract: Developing models with robust group fairness properties is paramount, particularly in ethically sensitive domains such as medical diagnosis. Recent approaches to achieving fairness in machine learning require a substantial amount of training data and depend on model retraining, which may not be practical in real-world scenarios. To mitigate these challenges, we propose Bias-based Weight Masking Fine-Tuning (BMFT), a novel post-processing method that enhances the fairness of a trained model in significantly fewer epochs without requiring access to the original training data. BMFT produces a mask over model parameters, which efficiently identifies the weights contributing the most towards biased predictions. Furthermore, we propose a two-step debiasing strategy, wherein the feature extractor undergoes initial fine-tuning on the identified bias-influenced weights, succeeded by a fine-tuning phase on a reinitialised classification layer to uphold discriminative performance. Extensive experiments across four dermatological datasets and two sensitive attributes demonstrate that BMFT outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques in both diagnostic accuracy and fairness metrics. Our findings underscore the efficacy and robustness of BMFT in advancing fairness across various out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. Our code is available at: https://github.com/vios-s/BMFT</p>

<p>Abstract: Data in the healthcare domain arise from a variety of sources and modalities, such as x-ray images, continuous measurements, and clinical notes. Medical practitioners integrate these diverse data types daily to make informed and accurate decisions. With recent advancements in language models capable of handling multimodal data, it is a logical progression to apply these models to the healthcare sector. In this work, we introduce a framework that connects small language models to multiple data sources, aiming to predict the risk of various diseases simultaneously. Our experiments encompass 12 different tasks within a multitask learning setup. Although our approach does not surpass state-of-the-art methods specialized for single tasks, it demonstrates competitive performance and underscores the potential of small language models for multimodal reasoning in healthcare.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanjie Dong, Haijun Zhang, Gang Wang, Shisheng Cui, Xiping Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: By using an parametric value function to replace the Monte-Carlo rollouts for value estimation, the actor-critic (AC) algorithms can reduce the variance of stochastic policy gradient so that to improve the convergence rate. While existing works mainly focus on analyzing convergence rate of AC algorithms under Markovian noise, the impacts of momentum on AC algorithms remain largely unexplored. In this work, we first propose a heavy-ball momentum based advantage actor-critic (\mbox{HB-A2C}) algorithm by integrating the heavy-ball momentum into the critic recursion that is parameterized by a linear function. When the sample trajectory follows a Markov decision process, we quantitatively certify the acceleration capability of the proposed HB-A2C algorithm. Our theoretical results demonstrate that the proposed HB-A2C finds an $\epsilon$-approximate stationary point with $\oo{\epsilon^{-2}}$ iterations for reinforcement learning tasks with Markovian noise. Moreover, we also reveal the dependence of learning rates on the length of the sample trajectory. By carefully selecting the momentum factor of the critic recursion, the proposed HB-A2C can balance the errors introduced by the initialization and the stoschastic approximation.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present AuToMATo, a novel parameter-free clustering algorithm based on persistent homology. AuToMATo combines the existing ToMATo clustering algorithm with a bootstrapping procedure in order to separate significant peaks of an estimated density function from non-significant ones. We perform a thorough comparison of AuToMATo against many other state-of-the-art clustering algorithms. We find that not only that AuToMATo compares favorably against other parameter-free clustering algorithms, but in many instances also significantly outperforms even the best selection of parameters for other algorithms. AuToMATo is motivated by applications in topological data analysis, in particular the Mapper algorithm, where it is desirable to work with a parameter-free clustering algorithm. Indeed, we provide evidence that AuToMATo performs well when used with Mapper. Finally, we provide an open-source implementation of AuToMATo in Python that is fully compatible with the standardscikit-learn architecture.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dimitry Mindlin, Amelie Sophie Robrecht, Michael Morasch, Philipp Cimiano</p>
<p>Abstract: The field of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is increasingly recognizing the need to personalize and/or interactively adapt the explanation to better reflect users' explanation needs. While dialogue-based approaches to XAI have been proposed recently, the state-of-the-art in XAI is still characterized by what we call one-shot, non-personalized and one-way explanations. In contrast, dialogue-based systems that can adapt explanations through interaction with a user promise to be superior to GUI-based or dashboard explanations as they offer a more intuitive way of requesting information. In general, while interactive XAI systems are often evaluated in terms of user satisfaction, there are limited studies that access user's objective model understanding. This is in particular the case for dialogue-based XAI approaches. In this paper, we close this gap by carrying out controlled experiments within a dialogue framework in which we measure understanding of users in three phases by asking them to simulate the predictions of the model they are learning about. By this, we can quantify the level of (improved) understanding w.r.t. how the model works, comparing the state prior, and after the interaction. We further analyze the data to reveal patterns of how the interaction between groups with high vs. low understanding gain differ. Overall, our work thus contributes to our understanding about the effectiveness of XAI approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongyuan Li, Shiyin Tan, Ying Zhang, Ming Jin, Shirui Pan, Manabu Okumura, Renhe Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Dynamic graph learning aims to uncover evolutionary laws in real-world systems, enabling accurate social recommendation (link prediction) or early detection of cancer cells (classification). Inspired by the success of state space models, e.g., Mamba, for efficiently capturing long-term dependencies in language modeling, we propose DyG-Mamba, a new continuous state space model (SSM) for dynamic graph learning. Specifically, we first found that using inputs as control signals for SSM is not suitable for continuous-time dynamic network data with irregular sampling intervals, resulting in models being insensitive to time information and lacking generalization properties. Drawing inspiration from the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve, which suggests that memory of past events is strongly correlated with time intervals rather than specific details of the events themselves, we directly utilize irregular time spans as control signals for SSM to achieve significant robustness and generalization. Through exhaustive experiments on 12 datasets for dynamic link prediction and dynamic node classification tasks, we found that DyG-Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance on most of the datasets, while also demonstrating significantly improved computation and memory efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hong Ye Tan, Subhadip Mukherjee, Junqi Tang, Carola-Bibiane Sch\"onlieb</p>
<p>Abstract: The manifold hypothesis says that natural high-dimensional data is actually supported on or around a low-dimensional manifold. Recent success of statistical and learning-based methods empirically supports this hypothesis, due to outperforming classical statistical intuition in very high dimensions. A natural step for analysis is thus to assume the manifold hypothesis and derive bounds that are independent of any embedding space. Theoretical implications in this direction have recently been explored in terms of generalization of ReLU networks and convergence of Langevin methods. We complement existing results by providing theoretical statistical complexity results, which directly relates to generalization properties. In particular, we demonstrate that the statistical complexity required to approximate a class of bounded Sobolev functions on a compact manifold is bounded from below, and moreover that this bound is dependent only on the intrinsic properties of the manifold. These provide complementary bounds for existing approximation results for ReLU networks on manifolds, which give upper bounds on generalization capacity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Antonio Almud\'evar, Alfonso Ortega, Luis Vicente, Antonio Miguel, Eduardo Lleida</p>
<p>Abstract: Representation learning is an approach that allows to discover and extract the factors of variation from the data. Intuitively, a representation is said to be disentangled if it separates the different factors of variation in a way that is understandable to humans. Definitions of disentanglement and metrics to measure it usually assume that the factors of variation are independent of each other. However, this is generally false in the real world, which limits the use of these definitions and metrics to very specific and unrealistic scenarios. In this paper we give a definition of disentanglement based on information theory that is also valid when the factors of variation are not independent. Furthermore, we relate this definition to the Information Bottleneck Method. Finally, we propose a method to measure the degree of disentanglement from the given definition that works when the factors of variation are not independent. We show through different experiments that the method proposed in this paper correctly measures disentanglement with non-independent factors of variation, while other methods fail in this scenario.</p>

<p>Abstract: The availability of performant pre-trained models has led to a proliferation of fine-tuned expert models that are specialized to a particular domain or task. Model MoErging methods aim to recycle expert models to create an aggregate system with improved performance or generalization. A key component of MoErging methods is the creation of a router that decides which expert model(s) to use for a particular input or application. The promise, effectiveness, and large design space of MoErging has spurred the development of many new methods over the past few years. This rapid pace of development has made it challenging to compare different MoErging methods, which are rarely compared to one another and are often validated in different experimental setups. To remedy such gaps, we present a comprehensive survey of MoErging methods that includes a novel taxonomy for cataloging key design choices and clarifying suitable applications for each method. Apart from surveying MoErging research, we inventory software tools and applications that make use of MoErging. We additionally discuss related fields of study such as model merging, multitask learning, and mixture-of-experts models. Taken as a whole, our survey provides a unified overview of existing MoErging methods and creates a solid foundation for future work in this burgeoning field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mehshan Ahmed Khan, Houshyar Asadi, Mohammad Reza Chalak Qazani, Adetokunbo Arogbonlo, Saeid Nahavandi, Chee Peng Lim</p>
<p>Abstract: One debatable issue in traffic safety research is that cognitive load from sec-ondary tasks reduces primary task performance, such as driving. Although physiological signals have been extensively used in driving-related research to assess cognitive load, only a few studies have specifically focused on high cognitive load scenarios. Most existing studies tend to examine moderate or low levels of cognitive load In this study, we adopted an auditory version of the n-back task of three levels as a cognitively loading secondary task while driving in a driving simulator. During the simultaneous execution of driving and the n-back task, we recorded fNIRS, eye-tracking, and driving behavior data to predict cognitive load at three different levels. To the best of our knowledge, this combination of data sources has never been used before. Un-like most previous studies that utilize binary classification of cognitive load and driving in conditions without traffic, our study involved three levels of cognitive load, with drivers operating in normal traffic conditions under low visibility, specifically during nighttime and rainy weather. We proposed a hybrid neural network combining a 1D Convolutional Neural Network and a Recurrent Neural Network to predict cognitive load. Our experimental re-sults demonstrate that the proposed model, with fewer parameters, increases accuracy from 99.82% to 99.99% using physiological data, and from 87.26% to 92.02% using driving behavior data alone. This significant improvement highlights the effectiveness of our hybrid neural network in accurately pre-dicting cognitive load during driving under challenging conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongrui Shen, Long Zhao, Kan Zheng, Yuhua Cao, Pingzhi Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning (DL)-based channel state information (CSI) feedback has the potential to improve the recovery accuracy and reduce the feedback overhead in massive multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems. However, the length of input CSI and the number of feedback bits should be adjustable in different scenarios, which can not be efficiently achieved by the existing CSI feedback models. Therefore, an adaptive bidirectional long short-term memory network (ABLNet) for CSI feedback is first designed to process various input CSI lengths, where the number of feedback bits is in proportion to the CSI length. Then, to realize a more flexible feedback bit number, a feedback bit control unit (FBCU) module is proposed to control the output length of feedback bits. Based on which, a target feedback performance can be adaptively achieved by a designed bit number adjusting (BNA) algorithm. Furthermore, a novel separate training approach is devised to solve the model protection problem that the UE and gNB are from different manufacturers. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed ABLNet with FBCU can fit for different input CSI lengths and feedback bit numbers; the CSI feedback performance can be stabilized by the BNA algorithm; and the proposed separate training approach can maintain the feedback performance and reduce the complexity of feedback model.</p>

<p>Abstract: Electronic service quality (E-SQ) is a strategic metric for successful e-services.Among the service quality dimensions, tangibility is overlooked. However, by incorporating visuals or tangible tools, the intangible nature of e-services can be balanced. Thanks to advancements in Deep Learning for computer vision, tangible visual features can now be leveraged to enhance the browsing and searching experience of electronic services. Users usually have specific search criteria to meet, but most services will not offer flexible search filters. This research emphasizes the importance of integrating visual and descriptive features to improve the tangibility and efficiency of e-services. A prime example of an electronic service that can benefit from this is real-estate websites. Searching for real estate properties that match user preferences is usually demanding and lacks visual filters, such as the Damage Level to the property. The research introduces a novel visual descriptive feature, the Damage Level, which utilizes a deep learning network known as Mask-RCNN to estimate damage in real estate images. Additionally, a model is developed to incorporate the Damage Level as a tangible feature in electronic real estate services, with the aim of enhancing the tangible customer experience.</p>

While automatic lyrics transcription (ALT) systems have advanced beyond producing unstructured strings of words and are able to draw on wider context, ALT benchmarks have not kept pace and continue to focus exclusively on words. To address this gap, we introduce Jam-ALT, a comprehensive lyrics transcription benchmark. The benchmark features a complete revision of the JamendoLyrics dataset, in adherence to industry standards for lyrics transcription and formatting, along with evaluation metrics designed to capture and assess the lyric-specific nuances, laying the foundation for improving the readability of lyrics. We apply the benchmark to recent transcription systems and present additional error analysis, as well as an experimental comparison with a classical music dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Donghai Fang, Fangfang Zhu, Dongting Xie, Wenwen Min</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Spatial Resolved Transcriptomics (SRT) technology, it is now possible to comprehensively measure gene transcription while preserving the spatial context of tissues. Spatial domain identification and gene denoising are key objectives in SRT data analysis. We propose a Contrastively Augmented Masked Graph Autoencoder (STMGAC) to learn low-dimensional latent representations for domain identification. In the latent space, persistent signals for representations are obtained through self-distillation to guide self-supervised matching. At the same time, positive and negative anchor pairs are constructed using triplet learning to augment the discriminative ability. We evaluated the performance of STMGAC on five datasets, achieving results superior to those of existing baseline methods. All code and public datasets used in this paper are available at https://github.com/wenwenmin/STMGAC and https://zenodo.org/records/13253801.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arkapravo Ghosh, Hemkar Reddy Sadana, Mukut Debnath, Panthadip Maji, Shubham Negi, Sumeet Gupta, Mrigank Sharad, Kaushik Roy</p>
<p>Abstract: In memory computing (IMC) architectures for deep learning (DL) accelerators leverage energy-efficient and highly parallel matrix vector multiplication (MVM) operations, implemented directly in memory arrays. Such IMC designs have been explored based on CMOS as well as emerging non-volatile memory (NVM) technologies like RRAM. IMC architectures generally involve a large number of cores consisting of memory arrays, storing the trained weights of the DL model. Peripheral units like DACs and ADCs are also used for applying inputs and reading out the output values. Recently reported designs reveal that the ADCs required for reading out the MVM results, consume more than 85% of the total compute power and also dominate the area, thereby eschewing the benefits of the IMC scheme. Mitigation of imperfections in the ADCs, namely, non-linearity and variations, incur significant design overheads, due to dedicated calibration units. In this work we present peripheral aware design of IMC cores, to mitigate such overheads. It involves incorporating the non-idealities of ADCs in the training of the DL models, along with that of the memory units. The proposed approach applies equally well to both current mode as well as charge mode MVM operations demonstrated in recent years., and can significantly simplify the design of mixed-signal IMC units.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dingyi Rong, Wenzhuo Zheng, Bozitao Zhong, Zhouhan Lin, Liang Hong, Ning Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate prediction of enzyme function is crucial for elucidating biological mechanisms and driving innovation across various sectors. Existing deep learning methods tend to rely solely on either sequence data or structural data and predict the EC number as a whole, neglecting the intrinsic hierarchical structure of EC numbers. To address these limitations, we introduce MAPred, a novel multi-modality and multi-scale model designed to autoregressively predict the EC number of proteins. MAPred integrates both the primary amino acid sequence and the 3D tokens of proteins, employing a dual-pathway approach to capture comprehensive protein characteristics and essential local functional sites. Additionally, MAPred utilizes an autoregressive prediction network to sequentially predict the digits of the EC number, leveraging the hierarchical organization of EC classifications. Evaluations on benchmark datasets, including New-392, Price, and New-815, demonstrate that our method outperforms existing models, marking a significant advance in the reliability and granularity of protein function prediction within bioinformatics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiuxiang Gu, Xiaoyu Li, Yingyu Liang, Zhenmei Shi, Zhao Song, Junwei Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Determining the John ellipsoid - the largest volume ellipsoid contained within a convex polytope - is a fundamental problem with applications in machine learning, optimization, and data analytics. Recent work has developed fast algorithms for approximating the John ellipsoid using sketching and leverage score sampling techniques. However, these algorithms do not provide privacy guarantees for sensitive input data. In this paper, we present the first differentially private algorithm for fast John ellipsoid computation. Our method integrates noise perturbation with sketching and leverage score sampling to achieve both efficiency and privacy. We prove that (1) our algorithm provides $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy, and the privacy guarantee holds for neighboring datasets that are $\epsilon_0$-close, allowing flexibility in the privacy definition; (2) our algorithm still converges to a $(1+\xi)$-approximation of the optimal John ellipsoid in $O(\xi^{-2}(\log(n/\delta_0) + (L\epsilon_0)^{-2}))$ iterations where $n$ is the number of data point, $L$ is the Lipschitz constant, $\delta_0$ is the failure probability, and $\epsilon_0$ is the closeness of neighboring input datasets. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates the algorithm's convergence and privacy properties, providing a robust approach for balancing utility and privacy in John ellipsoid computation. This is the first differentially private algorithm for fast John ellipsoid computation, opening avenues for future research in privacy-preserving optimization techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kamyar Zeinalipour, Neda Jamshidi, Monica Bianchini, Marco Maggini, Marco Gori</p>
<p>Abstract: Pre-trained LLMs have demonstrated substantial capabilities across a range of conventional natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as summarization and entity recognition. In this paper, we explore the application of LLMs in the generation of high-quality protein sequences. Specifically, we adopt a suite of pre-trained LLMs, including Mistral-7B1, Llama-2-7B2, Llama-3-8B3, and gemma-7B4, to produce valid protein sequences. All of these models are publicly available.5 Unlike previous work in this field, our approach utilizes a relatively small dataset comprising 42,000 distinct human protein sequences. We retrain these models to process protein-related data, ensuring the generation of biologically feasible protein structures. Our findings demonstrate that even with limited data, the adapted models exhibit efficiency comparable to established protein-focused models such as ProGen varieties, ProtGPT2, and ProLLaMA, which were trained on millions of protein sequences. To validate and quantify the performance of our models, we conduct comparative analyses employing standard metrics such as pLDDT, RMSD, TM-score, and REU. Furthermore, we commit to making the trained versions of all four models publicly available, fostering greater transparency and collaboration in the field of computational biology.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Steve Yuwono, Dorothea Schwung, Andreas Schwung</p>
<p>Abstract: This article describes a novel game structure for autonomously optimizing decentralized manufacturing systems with multi-objective optimization challenges, namely Distributed Stackelberg Strategies in State-Based Potential Games (DS2-SbPG). DS2-SbPG integrates potential games and Stackelberg games, which improves the cooperative trade-off capabilities of potential games and the multi-objective optimization handling by Stackelberg games. Notably, all training procedures remain conducted in a fully distributed manner. DS2-SbPG offers a promising solution to finding optimal trade-offs between objectives by eliminating the complexities of setting up combined objective optimization functions for individual players in self-learning domains, particularly in real-world industrial settings with diverse and numerous objectives between the sub-systems. We further prove that DS2-SbPG constitutes a dynamic potential game that results in corresponding converge guarantees. Experimental validation conducted on a laboratory-scale testbed highlights the efficacy of DS2-SbPG and its two variants, such as DS2-SbPG for single-leader-follower and Stack DS2-SbPG for multi-leader-follower. The results show significant reductions in power consumption and improvements in overall performance, which signals the potential of DS2-SbPG in real-world applications.</p>

While much of the optimization effort is focused on training curriculum to extend forecast range in the global context, two aspects remains less explored: limited area modeling and better backbones for weather forecasting. We show in this paper that MetMamba, a DLWP model built on a state-of-the-art state-space model, Mamba, offers notable performance gains and unique advantages over other popular backbones using traditional attention mechanisms and neural operators. We also demonstrate the feasibility of deep learning based limited area modeling via coupled training with a global host model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> G\'erard Ben Arous, C\'edric Gerbelot, Vanessa Piccolo</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the dynamics of two local optimization algorithms, online stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and gradient flow, within the framework of the multi-spiked tensor model in the high-dimensional regime. This multi-index model arises from the tensor principal component analysis (PCA) problem, which aims to infer $r$ unknown, orthogonal signal vectors within the $N$-dimensional unit sphere through maximum likelihood estimation from noisy observations of an order-$p$ tensor. We determine the number of samples and the conditions on the signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) required to efficiently recover the unknown spikes from natural initializations. Specifically, we distinguish between three types of recovery: exact recovery of each spike, recovery of a permutation of all spikes, and recovery of the correct subspace spanned by the signal vectors. We show that with online SGD, it is possible to recover all spikes provided a number of sample scaling as $N^{p-2}$, aligning with the computational threshold identified in the rank-one tensor PCA problem [Ben Arous, Gheissari, Jagannath 2020, 2021]. For gradient flow, we show that the algorithmic threshold to efficiently recover the first spike is also of order $N^{p-2}$. However, recovering the subsequent directions requires the number of samples to scale as $N^{p-1}$. Our results are obtained through a detailed analysis of a low-dimensional system that describes the evolution of the correlations between the estimators and the spikes. In particular, the hidden vectors are recovered one by one according to a sequential elimination phenomenon: as one correlation exceeds a critical threshold, all correlations sharing a row or column index decrease and become negligible, allowing the subsequent correlation to grow and become macroscopic. The sequence in which correlations become macroscopic depends on their initial values and on the associated SNRs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaojiao Guan, Yongxin Ji, Cheng Peng, Wei Zou, Xubo Tang, Jiayu Shang, Yanni Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Bacteriophages are viruses that target bacteria, playing a crucial role in microbial ecology. Phage proteins are important in understanding phage biology, such as virus infection, replication, and evolution. Although a large number of new phages have been identified via metagenomic sequencing, many of them have limited protein function annotation. Accurate function annotation of phage proteins presents several challenges, including their inherent diversity and the scarcity of annotated ones. Existing tools have yet to fully leverage the unique properties of phages in annotating protein functions. In this work, we propose a new protein function annotation tool for phages by leveraging the modular genomic structure of phage genomes. By employing embeddings from the latest protein foundation models and Transformer to capture contextual information between proteins in phage genomes, PhaGO surpasses state-of-the-art methods in annotating diverged proteins and proteins with uncommon functions by 6.78% and 13.05% improvement, respectively. PhaGO can annotate proteins lacking homology search results, which is critical for characterizing the rapidly accumulating phage genomes. We demonstrate the utility of PhaGO by identifying 688 potential holins in phages, which exhibit high structural conservation with known holins. The results show the potential of PhaGO to extend our understanding of newly discovered phages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Richard Barney, Michael Winer, Victor Galitksi</p>
<p>Abstract: We explore a one-to-one correspondence between a neural network (NN) and a statistical mechanical spin model where neurons are mapped to Ising spins and weights to spin-spin couplings. The process of training an NN produces a family of spin Hamiltonians parameterized by training time. We study the magnetic phases and the melting transition temperature as training progresses. First, we prove analytically that the common initial state before training--an NN with independent random weights--maps to a layered version of the classical Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass exhibiting a replica symmetry breaking. The spin-glass-to-paramagnet transition temperature is calculated. Further, we use the Thouless-Anderson-Palmer (TAP) equations--a theoretical technique to analyze the landscape of energy minima of random systems--to determine the evolution of the magnetic phases on two types of NNs (one with continuous and one with binarized activations) trained on the MNIST dataset. The two NN types give rise to similar results, showing a quick destruction of the spin glass and the appearance of a phase with a hidden order, whose melting transition temperature $T_c$ grows as a power law in training time. We also discuss the properties of the spectrum of the spin system's bond matrix in the context of rich vs. lazy learning. We suggest that this statistical mechanical view of NNs provides a useful unifying perspective on the training process, which can be viewed as selecting and strengthening a symmetry-broken state associated with the training task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiawei Liu, Songrun Xie, Junhao Wang, Yuxiang Wei, Yifeng Ding, Lingming Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Differential Performance Evaluation (DPE), a framework designed to reliably evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) for efficient code generation. Traditional coding benchmarks often fail to provide reliable insights into code efficiency, due to their reliance on simplistic test inputs and the absence of effective compound metrics. DPE addresses these issues by focusing on efficiency-demanding programming tasks and establishing an insightful compound metric for performance evaluation. DPE operates in two phases: To curate efficiency datasets, it selects efficiency-demanding tasks from existing coding benchmarks and generates computationally expensive inputs to stress the efficiency of LLM solutions. To assess the code efficiency, DPE profiles the new solution and compares it globally against a set of reference solutions that exhibit distinct efficiency levels, where the matched level defines its efficiency score. As a proof of concept, we use DPE to create EvalPerf, a benchmark with 121 performance-challenging coding tasks. Our comprehensive evaluation draws interesting findings on the efficiency impact of model sizes, instruction tuning, and prompting. For example, while the scaling law fails to account for code efficiency, general instruction tuning benefits both code correctness and efficiency. We also evaluate the evaluation by examining the effectiveness of DPE, showing that EvalPerf is reliable and convenient to use even across platforms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Omer Gokalp Serbetci, Daoud Burghal, Andreas F. Molisch</p>
<p>Abstract: Indoor localization is a challenging problem that - unlike outdoor localization - lacks a universal and robust solution. Machine Learning (ML), particularly Deep Learning (DL), methods have been investigated as a promising approach. Although such methods bring remarkable localization accuracy, they heavily depend on the training data collected from the environment. The data collection is usually a laborious and time-consuming task, but Data Augmentation (DA) can be used to alleviate this issue. In this paper, different from previously used DA, we propose methods that utilize the domain knowledge about wireless propagation channels and devices. The methods exploit the typical hardware component drift in the transceivers and/or the statistical behavior of the channel, in combination with the measured Power Delay Profile (PDP). We comprehensively evaluate the proposed methods to demonstrate their effectiveness. This investigation mainly focuses on the impact of factors such as the number of measurements, augmentation proportion, and the environment of interest impact the effectiveness of the different DA methods. We show that in the low-data regime (few actual measurements available), localization accuracy increases up to 50%, matching non-augmented results in the high-data regime. In addition, the proposed methods may outperform the measurement-only high-data performance by up to 33% using only 1/4 of the amount of measured data. We also exhibit the effect of different training data distribution and quality on the effectiveness of DA. Finally, we demonstrate the power of the proposed methods when employed along with Transfer Learning (TL) to address the data scarcity in target and/or source environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Efficient audio representations in a compressed continuous latent space are critical for generative audio modeling and Music Information Retrieval (MIR) tasks. However, some existing audio autoencoders have limitations, such as multi-stage training procedures, slow iterative sampling, or low reconstruction quality. We introduce Music2Latent, an audio autoencoder that overcomes these limitations by leveraging consistency models. Music2Latent encodes samples into a compressed continuous latent space in a single end-to-end training process while enabling high-fidelity single-step reconstruction. Key innovations include conditioning the consistency model on upsampled encoder outputs at all levels through cross connections, using frequency-wise self-attention to capture long-range frequency dependencies, and employing frequency-wise learned scaling to handle varying value distributions across frequencies at different noise levels. We demonstrate that Music2Latent outperforms existing continuous audio autoencoders in sound quality and reconstruction accuracy while achieving competitive performance on downstream MIR tasks using its latent representations. To our knowledge, this represents the first successful attempt at training an end-to-end consistency autoencoder model.</p>

We evaluate Greedy Coordinate Gradients (GCG), PEZ , Random Search, AutoDAN and BLIP2's image captioner across various evaluation metrics related to the quality of inverted prompts and the quality of the images generated by the inverted prompts. We find that focusing on the CLIP similarity between the inverted prompts and the ground truth image acts as a poor proxy for the similarity between ground truth image and the image generated by the inverted prompts. While the discrete optimizers effectively minimize their objectives, simply using responses from a well-trained captioner often leads to generated images that more closely resemble those produced by the original prompts.</p>

<p>Abstract: Amidst the wide popularity of imitation learning algorithms in robotics, their properties regarding hyperparameter sensitivity, ease of training, data efficiency, and performance have not been well-studied in high-precision industry-inspired environments. In this work, we demonstrate the limitations and benefits of prominent imitation learning approaches and analyze their capabilities regarding these properties. We evaluate each algorithm on a complex bimanual manipulation task involving an over-constrained dynamics system in a setting involving multiple contacts between the manipulated object and the environment. While we find that imitation learning is well suited to solve such complex tasks, not all algorithms are equal in terms of handling environmental and hyperparameter perturbations, training requirements, performance, and ease of use. We investigate the empirical influence of these key characteristics by employing a carefully designed experimental procedure and learning environment.

<p>Abstract: Aligning beamlines at synchrotron light sources is a high-dimensional, expensive-to-sample optimization problem, as beams are focused using a series of dynamic optical components. Bayesian Optimization is an efficient machine learning approach to finding global optima of beam quality, but the model can easily be impaired by faulty data points caused by the beam going off the edge of the sensor or by background noise. This study, conducted at the National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II) facility at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), is an investigation of methods to identify untrustworthy readings of beam quality and discourage the optimization model from seeking out points likely to yield low-fidelity beams. The approaches explored include dynamic pruning using loss analysis of size and position models and a lengthscale-based genetic algorithm to determine which points to include in the model for optimal fit. Each method successfully classified high and low fidelity points. This research advances BNL's mission to tackle our nation's energy challenges by providing scientists at all beamlines with access to higher quality beams, and faster convergence to these optima for their experiments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Expected free energy (EFE) is a central quantity in active inference which has recently gained popularity due to its intuitive decomposition of the expected value of control into a pragmatic and an epistemic component. While numerous conjectures have been made to justify EFE as a decision making objective function, the most widely accepted is still its intuitiveness and resemblance to variational free energy in approximate Bayesian inference. In this work, we take a bottom up approach and ask: taking EFE as given, what's the resulting agent's optimality gap compared with a reward-driven reinforcement learning (RL) agent, which is well understood? By casting EFE under a particular class of belief MDP and using analysis tools from RL theory, we show that EFE approximates the Bayes optimal RL policy via information value. We discuss the implications for objective specification of active inference agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Boveiri, Peyman Mohajerin Esfahani</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the problem of estimating the optimal Q-function of $\gamma$-discounted Markov decision processes (MDPs) under the synchronous setting, where independent samples for all state-action pairs are drawn from a generative model at each iteration. We introduce and analyze a novel model-free algorithm called Variance-Reduced Cascade Q-learning (VRCQ). VRCQ comprises two key building blocks: (i) the established direct variance reduction technique and (ii) our proposed variance reduction scheme, Cascade Q-learning. By leveraging these techniques, VRCQ provides superior guarantees in the $\ell_\infty$-norm compared with the existing model-free stochastic approximation-type algorithms. Specifically, we demonstrate that VRCQ is minimax optimal. Additionally, when the action set is a singleton (so that the Q-learning problem reduces to policy evaluation), it achieves non-asymptotic instance optimality while requiring the minimum number of samples theoretically possible. Our theoretical results and their practical implications are supported by numerical experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sayna Ebrahimi, Sercan O. Arik, Tejas Nama, Tomas Pfister</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable image-language capabilities, but their widespread use faces challenges in cost-effective training and adaptation. Existing approaches often necessitate expensive language model retraining and limited adaptability. Additionally, the current focus on zero-shot performance improvements offers insufficient guidance for task-specific tuning. We propose CROME, an efficient vision-language instruction tuning framework. It features a novel gated cross-modal adapter that effectively combines visual and textual representations prior to input into a frozen LLM. This lightweight adapter, trained with minimal parameters, enables efficient cross-modal understanding. Notably, CROME demonstrates superior zero-shot performance on standard visual question answering and instruction-following benchmarks. Moreover, it yields fine-tuning with exceptional parameter efficiency, competing with task-specific specialist state-of-the-art methods. CROME demonstrates the potential of pre-LM alignment for building scalable, adaptable, and parameter-efficient multimodal models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minh Nguyen, Phuong Le</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, there has been an increasing number of frameworks developed for biomedical entity and relation extraction. This research effort aims to address the accelerating growth in biomedical publications and the intricate nature of biomedical texts, which are written for mainly domain experts. To handle these challenges, we develop a novel framework that utilizes external knowledge to construct a task-independent and reusable background knowledge graph for biomedical entity and relation extraction. The design of our model is inspired by how humans learn domain-specific topics. In particular, humans often first acquire the most basic and common knowledge regarding a field to build the foundational knowledge and then use that as a basis for extending to various specialized topics. Our framework employs such common-knowledge-sharing mechanism to build a general neural-network knowledge graph that is learning transferable to different domain-specific biomedical texts effectively. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our model, equipped with this generalized and cross-transferable knowledge base, achieves competitive performance benchmarks, including BioRelEx for binding interaction detection and ADE for Adverse Drug Effect identification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haowei Ni, Shuchen Meng, Xupeng Chen, Ziqing Zhao, Andi Chen, Panfeng Li, Shiyao Zhang, Qifu Yin, Yuanqing Wang, Yuxi Chan</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate stock market predictions following earnings reports are crucial for investors. Traditional methods, particularly classical machine learning models, struggle with these predictions because they cannot effectively process and interpret extensive textual data contained in earnings reports and often overlook nuances that influence market movements. This paper introduces an advanced approach by employing Large Language Models (LLMs) instruction fine-tuned with a novel combination of instruction-based techniques and quantized low-rank adaptation (QLoRA) compression. Our methodology integrates 'base factors', such as financial metric growth and earnings transcripts, with 'external factors', including recent market indices performances and analyst grades, to create a rich, supervised dataset. This comprehensive dataset enables our models to achieve superior predictive performance in terms of accuracy, weighted F1, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), especially evident in the comparison with benchmarks such as GPT-4. We specifically highlight the efficacy of the llama-3-8b-Instruct-4bit model, which showcases significant improvements over baseline models. The paper also discusses the potential of expanding the output capabilities to include a 'Hold' option and extending the prediction horizon, aiming to accommodate various investment styles and time frames. This study not only demonstrates the power of integrating cutting-edge AI with fine-tuned financial data but also paves the way for future research in enhancing AI-driven financial analysis tools.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matan Kleiner, Lior Michaeli, Tomer Michaeli</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffractive neural networks hold great promise for applications requiring intensive computational processing. Considerable attention has focused on diffractive networks for either spatially coherent or spatially incoherent illumination. Here we illustrate that, as opposed to imaging systems, in diffractive networks the degree of spatial coherence has a dramatic effect. In particular, we show that when the spatial coherence length on the object is comparable to the minimal feature size preserved by the optical system, neither the incoherent nor the coherent extremes serve as acceptable approximations. Importantly, this situation is inherent to many settings involving active illumination, including reflected light microscopy, autonomous vehicles and smartphones. Following this observation, we propose a general framework for training diffractive networks for any specified degree of spatial and temporal coherence, supporting all types of linear and nonlinear layers. Using our method, we numerically optimize networks for image classification, and thoroughly investigate their performance dependence on the illumination coherence properties. We further introduce the concept of coherence-blind networks, which have enhanced resilience to changes in illumination conditions. Our findings serve as a steppingstone toward adopting all-optical neural networks in real-world applications, leveraging nothing but natural light.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vlad Hondru, Florinel Alin Croitoru, Shervin Minaee, Radu Tudor Ionescu, Nicu Sebe</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we survey recent studies on masked image modeling (MIM), an approach that emerged as a powerful self-supervised learning technique in computer vision. The MIM task involves masking some information, e.g. pixels, patches, or even latent representations, and training a model, usually an autoencoder, to predicting the missing information by using the context available in the visible part of the input. We identify and formalize two categories of approaches on how to implement MIM as a pretext task, one based on reconstruction and one based on contrastive learning. Then, we construct a taxonomy and review the most prominent papers in recent years. We complement the manually constructed taxonomy with a dendrogram obtained by applying a hierarchical clustering algorithm. We further identify relevant clusters via manually inspecting the resulting dendrogram. Our review also includes datasets that are commonly used in MIM research. We aggregate the performance results of various masked image modeling methods on the most popular datasets, to facilitate the comparison of competing methods. Finally, we identify research gaps and propose several interesting directions of future work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruihuai Liang, Bo Yang, Zhiwen Yu, Bin Guo, Xuelin Cao, M\'erouane Debbah, H. Vincent Poor, Chau Yuen</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion generative models, famous for their performance in image generation, are popular in various cross-domain applications. However, their use in the communication community has been mostly limited to auxiliary tasks like data modeling and feature extraction. These models hold greater promise for fundamental problems in network optimization compared to traditional machine learning methods. Discriminative deep learning often falls short due to its single-step input-output mapping and lack of global awareness of the solution space, especially given the complexity of network optimization's objective functions. In contrast, diffusion generative models can consider a broader range of solutions and exhibit stronger generalization by learning parameters that describe the distribution of the underlying solution space, with higher probabilities assigned to better solutions. We propose a new framework Diffusion Model-based Solution Generation (DiffSG), which leverages the intrinsic distribution learning capabilities of diffusion generative models to learn high-quality solution distributions based on given inputs. The optimal solution within this distribution is highly probable, allowing it to be effectively reached through repeated sampling. We validate the performance of DiffSG on several typical network optimization problems, including mixed-integer non-linear programming, convex optimization, and hierarchical non-convex optimization. Our results show that DiffSG outperforms existing baselines. In summary, we demonstrate the potential of diffusion generative models in tackling complex network optimization problems and outline a promising path for their broader application in the communication community.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gizem Mert, Ario Sadafi, Raheleh Salehi, Nassir Navab, Carsten Marr</p>
<p>Abstract: Biomedical imaging and RNA sequencing with single-cell resolution improves our understanding of white blood cell diseases like leukemia. By combining morphological and transcriptomic data, we can gain insights into cellular functions and trajectoriess involved in blood cell differentiation. However, existing methodologies struggle with integrating morphological and transcriptomic data, leaving a significant research gap in comprehensively understanding the dynamics of cell differentiation. Here, we introduce an unsupervised method that explores and reconstructs these two modalities and uncovers the relationship between different subtypes of white blood cells from human peripheral blood smears in terms of morphology and their corresponding transcriptome. Our method is based on a beta-variational autoencoder (\beta-VAE) with a customized loss function, incorporating a R-CNN architecture to distinguish single-cell from background and to minimize any interference from artifacts. This implementation of \beta-VAE shows good reconstruction capability along with continuous latent embeddings, while maintaining clear differentiation between single-cell classes. Our novel approach is especially helpful to uncover the correlation of two latent features in complex biological processes such as formation of granules in the cell (granulopoiesis) with gene expression patterns. It thus provides a unique tool to improve the understanding of white blood cell maturation for biomedicine and diagnostics.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid evolution of deep learning and its integration with autonomous driving systems have led to substantial advancements in 3D perception using multimodal sensors. Notably, radar sensors show greater robustness compared to cameras and lidar under adverse weather and varying illumination conditions. This study delves into the often-overlooked yet crucial issue of domain shift in 4D radar-based object detection, examining how varying environmental conditions, such as different weather patterns and road types, impact 3D object detection performance. Our findings highlight distinct domain shifts across various weather scenarios, revealing unique dataset sensitivities that underscore the critical role of radar point cloud generation. Additionally, we demonstrate that transitioning between different road types, especially from highways to urban settings, introduces notable domain shifts, emphasizing the necessity for diverse data collection across varied road environments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive analysis of domain shift effects on 4D radar-based object detection. We believe this empirical study contributes to understanding the complex nature of domain shifts in radar data and suggests paths forward for data collection strategy in the face of environmental variability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mujadded Al Rabbani Alif</p>
<p>Abstract: Retinal fundus imaging plays an essential role in diagnosing various stages of diabetic retinopathy, where exudates are critical markers of early disease onset. Prompt detection of these exudates is pivotal for enabling optometrists to arrest or significantly decelerate the disease progression. This paper introduces a novel, lightweight convolutional neural network architecture tailored for automated exudate detection, designed to identify these markers efficiently and accurately. To address the challenge of limited training data, we have incorporated domain-specific data augmentations to enhance the model's generalizability. Furthermore, we applied a suite of regularization techniques within our custom architecture to boost diagnostic accuracy while optimizing computational efficiency. Remarkably, this streamlined model contains only 4.73 million parameters a reduction of nearly 60% compared to the standard ResNet-18 model, which has 11.69 million parameters. Despite its reduced complexity, our model achieves an impressive F1 score of 90%, demonstrating its efficacy in the early detection of diabetic retinopathy through fundus imaging.</p>

<p>Abstract: Current strategies for achieving fine-grained prosody control in speech synthesis entail extracting additional style embeddings or adopting more complex architectures. To enable zero-shot application of pretrained text-to-speech (TTS) models, we present PRESENT (PRosody Editing without Style Embeddings or New Training), which exploits explicit prosody prediction in FastSpeech2-based models by modifying the inference process directly. We apply our text-to-prosody framework to zero-shot language transfer using a JETS model exclusively trained on English LJSpeech data. We obtain character error rates (CER) of 12.8%, 18.7% and 5.9% for German, Hungarian and Spanish respectively, beating the previous state-of-the-art CER by over 2x for all three languages. Furthermore, we allow subphoneme-level control, a first in this field. To evaluate its effectiveness, we show that PRESENT can improve the prosody of questions, and use it to generate Mandarin, a tonal language where vowel pitch varies at subphoneme level. We attain 25.3% hanzi CER and 13.0% pinyin CER with the JETS model. All our code and audio samples are available online.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Tayyab Khan, Wenhe Feng, Lequn Chen, Ye Han Ng, Nicholas Yew Jin Tan, Seung Ki Moon</p>
<p>Abstract: The integration of Computer-Aided Design (CAD), Computer-Aided Process Planning (CAPP), and Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM) plays a crucial role in modern manufacturing, facilitating seamless transitions from digital designs to physical products. However, a significant challenge within this integration is the Automatic Feature Recognition (AFR) of CAD models, especially in the context of hybrid manufacturing that combines subtractive and additive manufacturing processes. Traditional AFR methods, focused mainly on the identification of subtractive (machined) features including holes, fillets, chamfers, pockets, and slots, fail to recognize features pertinent to additive manufacturing. Furthermore, the traditional methods fall short in accurately extracting geometric dimensions and orientations, which are also key factors for effective manufacturing process planning. This paper presents a novel approach for creating a synthetic CAD dataset that encompasses features relevant to both additive and subtractive machining through Python Open Cascade. The Hierarchical Graph Convolutional Neural Network (HGCNN) model is implemented to accurately identify the composite additive-subtractive features within the synthetic CAD dataset. The key novelty and contribution of the proposed methodology lie in its ability to recognize a wide range of manufacturing features, and precisely extracting their dimensions, orientations, and stock sizes. The proposed model demonstrates remarkable feature recognition accuracy exceeding 97% and a dimension extraction accuracy of 100% for identified features. Therefore, the proposed methodology enhances the integration of CAD, CAPP, and CAM within hybrid manufacturing by providing precise feature recognition and dimension extraction. It facilitates improved manufacturing process planning, by enabling more informed decision-making.</p>

<p>Abstract: The design of satellite missions is currently undergoing a paradigm shift from the historical approach of individualised monolithic satellites towards distributed mission configurations, consisting of multiple small satellites. With a rapidly growing number of such satellites now deployed in orbit, each collecting large amounts of data, interest in on-board orbital edge computing is rising. Federated Learning is a promising distributed computing approach in this context, allowing multiple satellites to collaborate efficiently in training on-board machine learning models. Though recent works on the use of Federated Learning in orbital edge computing have focused largely on homogeneous satellite constellations, Federated Learning could also be employed to allow heterogeneous satellites to form ad-hoc collaborations, e.g. in the case of communications satellites operated by different providers. Such an application presents additional challenges to the Federated Learning paradigm, arising largely from the heterogeneity of such a system. In this position paper, we offer a systematic review of these challenges in the context of the cross-provider use case, giving a brief overview of the state-of-the-art for each, and providing an entry point for deeper exploration of each issue.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Zhang, Jiawei Du, Ping Liu, Joey Tianyi Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Dataset distillation has emerged as a technique aiming to condense informative features from large, natural datasets into a compact and synthetic form. While recent advancements have refined this technique, its performance is bottlenecked by the prevailing class-specific synthesis paradigm. Under this paradigm, synthetic data is optimized exclusively for a pre-assigned one-hot label, creating an implicit class barrier in feature condensation. This leads to inefficient utilization of the distillation budget and oversight of inter-class feature distributions, which ultimately limits the effectiveness and efficiency, as demonstrated in our analysis.
  To overcome these constraints, this paper presents the Inter-class Feature Compensator (INFER), an innovative distillation approach that transcends the class-specific data-label framework widely utilized in current dataset distillation methods. Specifically, INFER leverages a Universal Feature Compensator (UFC) to enhance feature integration across classes, enabling the generation of multiple additional synthetic instances from a single UFC input. This significantly improves the efficiency of the distillation budget.
  Moreover, INFER enriches inter-class interactions during the distillation, thereby enhancing the effectiveness and generalizability of the distilled data. By allowing for the linear interpolation of labels similar to those in the original dataset, INFER meticulously optimizes the synthetic data and dramatically reduces the size of soft labels in the synthetic dataset to almost zero, establishing a new benchmark for efficiency and effectiveness in dataset distillation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sitan Chen, Weiyuan Gong, Qi Ye, Zhihan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the task of agnostic tomography: given copies of an unknown $n$-qubit state $\rho$ which has fidelity $\tau$ with some state in a given class $C$, find a state which has fidelity $\ge \tau - \epsilon$ with $\rho$. We give a new framework, stabilizer bootstrapping, for designing computationally efficient protocols for this task, and use this to get new agnostic tomography protocols for the following classes:
  Stabilizer states: We give a protocol that runs in time $\mathrm{poly}(n,1/\epsilon)\cdot (1/\tau)^{O(\log(1/\tau))}$, answering an open question posed by Grewal, Iyer, Kretschmer, Liang [40] and Anshu and Arunachalam [6]. Previous protocols ran in time $\mathrm{exp}(\Theta(n))$ or required $\tau>\cos^2(\pi/8)$.
  States with stabilizer dimension $n - t$: We give a protocol that runs in time $n^3\cdot(2^t/\tau)^{O(\log(1/\epsilon))}$, extending recent work on learning quantum states prepared by circuits with few non-Clifford gates, which only applied in the realizable setting where $\tau = 1$ [30, 37, 46, 61].
  Discrete product states: If $C = K^{\otimes n}$ for some $\mu$-separated discrete set $K$ of single-qubit states, we give a protocol that runs in time $(n/\mu)^{O((1 + \log (1/\tau))/\mu)}/\epsilon^2$. This strictly generalizes a prior guarantee which applied to stabilizer product states [39]. For stabilizer product states, we give a further improved protocol that runs in time $(n^2/\epsilon^2)\cdot (1/\tau)^{O(\log(1/\tau))}$.
  As a corollary, we give the first protocol for estimating stabilizer fidelity, a standard measure of magic for quantum states, to error $\epsilon$ in $n^3 \mathrm{quasipoly}(1/\epsilon)$ time.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study introduces a novel approach to enhance the spatial-temporal resolution of time-event pixels based on luminance changes captured by event cameras. These cameras present unique challenges due to their low resolution and the sparse, asynchronous nature of the data they collect. Current event super-resolution algorithms are not fully optimized for the distinct data structure produced by event cameras, resulting in inefficiencies in capturing the full dynamism and detail of visual scenes with improved computational complexity. To bridge this gap, our research proposes a method that integrates binary spikes with Sigma Delta Neural Networks (SDNNs), leveraging spatiotemporal constraint learning mechanism designed to simultaneously learn the spatial and temporal distributions of the event stream. The proposed network is evaluated using widely recognized benchmark datasets, including N-MNIST, CIFAR10-DVS, ASL-DVS, and Event-NFS. A comprehensive evaluation framework is employed, assessing both the accuracy, through root mean square error (RMSE), and the computational efficiency of our model. The findings demonstrate significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods, specifically, the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art performance in computational efficiency, achieving a 17.04-fold improvement in event sparsity and a 32.28-fold increase in synaptic operation efficiency over traditional artificial neural networks, alongside a two-fold better performance over spiking neural networks.</p>

Moreover, this paper presents results of the simulations conducted to evaluate the performance of the DRL-based method.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rasmus Pagh, Lukas Retschmeier</p>
<p>Abstract: Motivated by applications in clustering and synthetic data generation, we consider the problem of releasing a minimum spanning tree (MST) under edge-weight differential privacy constraints where a graph topology $G=(V,E)$ with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges is public, the weight matrix $\vec{W}\in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ is private, and we wish to release an approximate MST under $\rho$-zero-concentrated differential privacy. Weight matrices are considered neighboring if they differ by at most $\Delta_\infty$ in each entry, i.e., we consider an $\ell_\infty$ neighboring relationship. Existing private MST algorithms either add noise to each entry in $\vec{W}$ and estimate the MST by post-processing or add noise to weights in-place during the execution of a specific MST algorithm. Using the post-processing approach with an efficient MST algorithm takes $O(n^2)$ time on dense graphs but results in an additive error on the weight of the MST of magnitude $O(n^2\log n)$. In-place algorithms give asymptotically better utility, but the running time of existing in-place algorithms is $O(n^3)$ for dense graphs. Our main result is a new differentially private MST algorithm that matches the utility of existing in-place methods while running in time $O(m + n^{3/2}\log n)$ for fixed privacy parameter $\rho$. The technical core of our algorithm is an efficient sublinear time simulation of Report-Noisy-Max that works by discretizing all edge weights to a multiple of $\Delta_\infty$ and forming groups of edges with identical weights. Specifically, we present a data structure that allows us to sample a noisy minimum weight edge among at most $O(n^2)$ cut edges in $O(\sqrt{n} \log n)$ time. Experimental evaluations support our claims that our algorithm significantly improves previous algorithms either in utility or running time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anantha Sharma, Ajinkya Deshmukh</p>
<p>Abstract: With the increasing demand for data sharing across platforms and organizations, ensuring the privacy and security of sensitive information has become a critical challenge. This paper introduces "TableGuard". An innovative approach to data obfuscation tailored for relational databases. Building on the principles and techniques developed in prior work on context-sensitive obfuscation, TableGuard applies these methods to ensure that API calls return only obfuscated data, thereby safeguarding privacy when sharing data with third parties. TableGuard leverages advanced context-sensitive obfuscation techniques to replace sensitive data elements with contextually appropriate alternatives. By maintaining the relational integrity and coherence of the data, our approach mitigates the risks of cognitive dissonance and data leakage. We demonstrate the implementation of TableGuard using a BERT based transformer model, which identifies and obfuscates sensitive entities within relational tables. Our evaluation shows that TableGuard effectively balances privacy protection with data utility, minimizing information loss while ensuring that the obfuscated data remains functionally useful for downstream applications. The results highlight the importance of domain-specific obfuscation strategies and the role of context length in preserving data integrity. The implications of this research are significant for organizations that need to share data securely with external parties. TableGuard offers a robust framework for implementing privacy-preserving data sharing mechanisms, thereby contributing to the broader field of data privacy and security.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yushi Bai, Jiajie Zhang, Xin Lv, Linzhi Zheng, Siqi Zhu, Lei Hou, Yuxiao Dong, Jie Tang, Juanzi Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Current long context large language models (LLMs) can process inputs up to 100,000 tokens, yet struggle to generate outputs exceeding even a modest length of 2,000 words. Through controlled experiments, we find that the model's effective generation length is inherently bounded by the sample it has seen during supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In other words, their output limitation is due to the scarcity of long-output examples in existing SFT datasets. To address this, we introduce AgentWrite, an agent-based pipeline that decomposes ultra-long generation tasks into subtasks, enabling off-the-shelf LLMs to generate coherent outputs exceeding 20,000 words. Leveraging AgentWrite, we construct LongWriter-6k, a dataset containing 6,000 SFT data with output lengths ranging from 2k to 32k words. By incorporating this dataset into model training, we successfully scale the output length of existing models to over 10,000 words while maintaining output quality. We also develop LongBench-Write, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating ultra-long generation capabilities. Our 9B parameter model, further improved through DPO, achieves state-of-the-art performance on this benchmark, surpassing even much larger proprietary models. In general, our work demonstrates that existing long context LLM already possesses the potential for a larger output window--all you need is data with extended output during model alignment to unlock this capability.

<p>Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have shown great potential in solving real-world software engineering (SWE) problems. The most advanced open-source SWE agent can resolve over 27% of real GitHub issues in SWE-Bench Lite. However, these sophisticated agent frameworks exhibit varying strengths, excelling in certain tasks while underperforming in others. To fully harness the diversity of these agents, we propose DEI (Diversity Empowered Intelligence), a framework that leverages their unique expertise. DEI functions as a meta-module atop existing SWE agent frameworks, managing agent collectives for enhanced problem-solving. Experimental results show that a DEI-guided committee of agents is able to surpass the best individual agent's performance by a large margin. For instance, a group of open-source SWE agents, with a maximum individual resolve rate of 27.3% on SWE-Bench Lite, can achieve a 34.3% resolve rate with DEI, making a 25% improvement and beating most closed-source solutions. Our best-performing group excels with a 55% resolve rate, securing the highest ranking on SWE-Bench Lite. Our findings contribute to the growing body of research on collaborative AI systems and their potential to solve complex software engineering challenges.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haiyang Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: The application of process-based and data-driven hydrological models is crucial in modern hydrological research, especially for predicting key water cycle variables such as runoff, evapotranspiration (ET), and soil moisture. These models provide a scientific basis for water resource management, flood forecasting, and ecological protection. Process-based models simulate the physical mechanisms of watershed hydrological processes, while data-driven models leverage large datasets and advanced machine learning algorithms. This paper reviewed and compared methods for assessing and enhancing the extrapolability of both model types, discussing their prospects and limitations. Key strategies include the use of leave-one-out cross-validation and similarity-based methods to evaluate model performance in ungauged regions. Deep learning, transfer learning, and domain adaptation techniques are also promising in their potential to improve model predictions in data-sparse and extreme conditions. Interdisciplinary collaboration and continuous algorithmic advancements are also important to strengthen the global applicability and reliability of hydrological models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yatong Chen, Wei Tang, Chien-Ju Ho, Yang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Performative prediction, as introduced by Perdomo et al, is a framework for studying social prediction in which the data distribution itself changes in response to the deployment of a model. Existing work in this field usually hinges on three assumptions that are easily violated in practice: that the performative risk is convex over the deployed model, that the mapping from the model to the data distribution is known to the model designer in advance, and the first-order information of the performative risk is available. In this paper, we initiate the study of performative prediction problems that do not require these assumptions. Specifically, we develop a reparameterization framework that reparametrizes the performative prediction objective as a function of the induced data distribution. We then develop a two-level zeroth-order optimization procedure, where the first level performs iterative optimization on the distribution parameter space, and the second level learns the model that induces a particular target distribution at each iteration. Under mild conditions, this reparameterization allows us to transform the non-convex objective into a convex one and achieve provable regret guarantees. In particular, we provide a regret bound that is sublinear in the total number of performative samples taken and is only polynomial in the dimension of the model parameter.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amr Alkhatib, Sofiane Ennadir, Henrik Bostr\"om, Michalis Vazirgiannis</p>
<p>Abstract: Data in tabular format is frequently occurring in real-world applications. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently been extended to effectively handle such data, allowing feature interactions to be captured through representation learning. However, these approaches essentially produce black-box models, in the form of deep neural networks, precluding users from following the logic behind the model predictions. We propose an approach, called IGNNet (Interpretable Graph Neural Network for tabular data), which constrains the learning algorithm to produce an interpretable model, where the model shows how the predictions are exactly computed from the original input features. A large-scale empirical investigation is presented, showing that IGNNet is performing on par with state-of-the-art machine-learning algorithms that target tabular data, including XGBoost, Random Forests, and TabNet. At the same time, the results show that the explanations obtained from IGNNet are aligned with the true Shapley values of the features without incurring any additional computational overhead.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyi Niu, Yizhou Xu, Xingjian Jiang, Jianming Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: The safety of autonomous vehicles (AV) has been a long-standing top concern, stemming from the absence of rare and safety-critical scenarios in the long-tail naturalistic driving distribution. To tackle this challenge, a surge of research in scenario-based autonomous driving has emerged, with a focus on generating high-risk driving scenarios and applying them to conduct safety-critical testing of AV models. However, limited work has been explored on the reuse of these extensive scenarios to iteratively improve AV models. Moreover, it remains intractable and challenging to filter through gigantic scenario libraries collected from other AV models with distinct behaviors, attempting to extract transferable information for current AV improvement. Therefore, we develop a continual driving policy optimization framework featuring Closed-Loop Individualized Curricula (CLIC), which we factorize into a set of standardized sub-modules for flexible implementation choices: AV Evaluation, Scenario Selection, and AV Training. CLIC frames AV Evaluation as a collision prediction task, where it estimates the chance of AV failures in these scenarios at each iteration. Subsequently, by re-sampling from historical scenarios based on these failure probabilities, CLIC tailors individualized curricula for downstream training, aligning them with the evaluated capability of AV. Accordingly, CLIC not only maximizes the utilization of the vast pre-collected scenario library for closed-loop driving policy optimization but also facilitates AV improvement by individualizing its training with more challenging cases out of those poorly organized scenarios. Experimental results clearly indicate that CLIC surpasses other curriculum-based training strategies, showing substantial improvement in managing risky scenarios, while still maintaining proficiency in handling simpler cases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianke Yang, Nima Dehmamy, Robin Walters, Rose Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Equivariant neural networks require explicit knowledge of the symmetry group. Automatic symmetry discovery methods aim to relax this constraint and learn invariance and equivariance from data. However, existing symmetry discovery methods are limited to simple linear symmetries and cannot handle the complexity of real-world data. We propose a novel generative model, Latent LieGAN (LaLiGAN), which can discover symmetries of nonlinear group actions. It learns a mapping from the data space to a latent space where the symmetries become linear and simultaneously discovers symmetries in the latent space. Theoretically, we show that our model can express nonlinear symmetries under some conditions about the group action. Experimentally, we demonstrate that our method can accurately discover the intrinsic symmetry in high-dimensional dynamical systems. LaLiGAN also results in a well-structured latent space that is useful for downstream tasks including equation discovery and long-term forecasting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaeyong Song, Hongsun Jang, Jaewon Jung, Youngsok Kim, Jinho Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are one of the rapidly growing fields within deep learning. While many distributed GNN training frameworks have been proposed to increase the training throughput, they face three limitations when applied to multi-server clusters. 1) They suffer from an inter-server communication bottleneck because they do not consider the inter-/intra-server bandwidth gap, a representative characteristic of multi-server clusters. 2) Redundant memory usage and computation hinder the scalability of the distributed frameworks. 3) Sampling methods, de facto standard in mini-batch training, incur unnecessary errors in multi-server clusters. We found that these limitations can be addressed by exploiting the characteristics of multi-server clusters. Here, we propose GraNNDis, a fast distributed GNN training framework for multi-server clusters. Firstly, we present Flexible Preloading, which preloads the essential vertex dependencies server-wise to reduce the low-bandwidth inter-server communications. Secondly, we introduce Cooperative Batching, which enables memory-efficient, less redundant mini-batch training by utilizing high-bandwidth intra-server communications. Thirdly, we propose Expansion-aware Sampling, a cluster-aware sampling method, which samples the edges that affect the system speedup. As sampling the intra-server dependencies does not contribute much to the speedup as they are communicated through fast intra-server links, it only targets a server boundary to be sampled. Lastly, we introduce One-Hop Graph Masking, a computation and communication structure to realize the above methods in multi-server environments. We evaluated GraNNDis on multi-server clusters, and it provided significant speedup over the state-of-the-art distributed GNN training frameworks. GraNNDis is open-sourced at https://github.com/AIS-SNU/GraNNDis_Artifact to facilitate its use.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyu Geng, Hang Ruan, Runzhong Wang, Yang Li, Yang Wang, Lei Chen, Junchi Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Predictive combinatorial optimization, where the parameters of combinatorial optimization (CO) are unknown at the decision-making time, is the precise modeling of many real-world applications, including energy cost-aware scheduling and budget allocation on advertising. Tackling such a problem usually involves a prediction model and a CO solver. These two modules are integrated into the predictive CO pipeline following two design principles: ``Predict-then-Optimize (PtO)'', which learns predictions by supervised training and subsequently solves CO using predicted coefficients, while the other, named ``Predict-and-Optimize (PnO)'', directly optimizes towards the ultimate decision quality and claims to yield better decisions than traditional PtO approaches. However, there lacks a systematic benchmark of both approaches, including the specific design choices at the module level, as well as an evaluation dataset that covers representative real-world scenarios. To this end, we develop a modular framework to benchmark 11 existing PtO/PnO methods on 8 problems, including a new industrial dataset for combinatorial advertising that will be released. Our study shows that PnO approaches are better than PtO on 7 out of 8 benchmarks, but there is no silver bullet found for the specific design choices of PnO. A comprehensive categorization of current approaches and integration of typical scenarios are provided under a unified benchmark. Therefore, this paper could serve as a comprehensive benchmark for future PnO approach development and also offer fast prototyping for application-focused development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chuanqi Chen, Jin-Long Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Data-driven modeling techniques have been explored in the spatial-temporal modeling of complex dynamical systems for many engineering applications. However, a systematic approach is still lacking to leverage the information from different types of data, e.g., with different spatial and temporal resolutions, and the combined use of short-term trajectories and long-term statistics. In this work, we build on the recent progress of neural operator and present a data-driven modeling framework called neural dynamical operator that is continuous in both space and time. A key feature of the neural dynamical operator is the resolution-invariance with respect to both spatial and temporal discretizations, without demanding abundant training data in different temporal resolutions. To improve the long-term performance of the calibrated model, we further propose a hybrid optimization scheme that leverages both gradient-based and derivative-free optimization methods and efficiently trains on both short-term time series and long-term statistics. We investigate the performance of the neural dynamical operator with three numerical examples, including the viscous Burgers' equation, the Navier-Stokes equations, and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. The results confirm the resolution-invariance of the proposed modeling framework and also demonstrate stable long-term simulations with only short-term time series data. In addition, we show that the proposed model can better predict long-term statistics via the hybrid optimization scheme with a combined use of short-term and long-term data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Scientific machine learning and the advent of the Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) have shown high potential in their ability to solve complex differential equations. One example is the use of PINNs to solve the gravity field modeling problem -- learning convenient representations of the gravitational potential from position and acceleration data. These PINN gravity models, or PINN-GMs, have demonstrated advantages in model compactness, robustness to noise, and sample efficiency when compared to popular alternatives; however, further investigation has revealed various failure modes for these and other machine learning gravity models which this manuscript aims to address. Specifically, this paper introduces the third generation Physics-Informed Neural Network Gravity Model (PINN-GM-III) which includes design changes that solve the problems of feature divergence, bias towards low-altitude samples, numerical instability, and extrapolation error. Six evaluation metrics are proposed to expose these past pitfalls and illustrate the PINN-GM-III's robustness to them. This study concludes by evaluating the PINN-GM-III modeling accuracy on a heterogeneous density asteroid, and comparing its performance to other analytic and machine learning gravity models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Simulation plays a crucial role in the development of autonomous vehicles (AVs) due to the potential risks associated with real-world testing. Although significant progress has been made in the visual aspects of simulators, generating complex behavior among agents remains a formidable challenge. It is not only imperative to ensure realism in the scenarios generated but also essential to incorporate preferences and conditions to facilitate controllable generation for AV training and evaluation. Traditional methods, mainly relying on memorizing the distribution of training datasets, often fall short in generating unseen scenarios. Inspired by the success of retrieval augmented generation in large language models, we present RealGen, a novel retrieval-based in-context learning framework for traffic scenario generation. RealGen synthesizes new scenarios by combining behaviors from multiple retrieved examples in a gradient-free way, which may originate from templates or tagged scenarios. This in-context learning framework endows versatile generative capabilities, including the ability to edit scenarios, compose various behaviors, and produce critical scenarios. Evaluations show that RealGen offers considerable flexibility and controllability, marking a new direction in the field of controllable traffic scenario generation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Waris Gill (Virginia Tech), Ali Anwar (University of Minnesota Twin Cities), Muhammad Ali Gulzar (Virginia Tech)</p>
<p>Abstract: In Federated Learning, clients train models on local data and send updates to a central server, which aggregates them into a global model using a fusion algorithm. This collaborative yet privacy-preserving training comes at a cost--FL developers face significant challenges in attributing global model predictions to specific clients. Localizing responsible clients is a crucial step towards (a) excluding clients primarily responsible for incorrect predictions and (b) encouraging clients who contributed high-quality models to continue participating in the future. Existing ML explainability approaches are inherently inapplicable as they are designed for single-model, centralized training.
  We introduce TraceFL, a fine-grained neuron provenance capturing mechanism that identifies clients responsible for the global model's prediction by tracking the flow of information from individual clients to the global model. Since inference on different inputs activates a different set of neurons of the global model, TraceFL dynamically quantifies the significance of the global model's neurons in a given prediction. It then selectively picks a slice of the most crucial neurons in the global model and maps them to the corresponding neurons in every participating client to determine each client's contribution, ultimately localizing the responsible client. We evaluate TraceFL on six datasets, including two real-world medical imaging datasets and four neural networks, including advanced models such as GPT. TraceFL achieves 99% accuracy in localizing the responsible client in FL tasks spanning both image and text classification tasks. At a time when state-of-the-art ML debugging approaches are mostly domain-specific (e.g., image classification only), TraceFL is the first technique to enable highly accurate automated reasoning across a wide range of FL applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Many emerging applications, such as robot-assisted eldercare and object recognition, generally employ deep learning neural networks (DNNs) and require the deployment of DNN models on edge devices. These applications naturally require i) handling streaming-in inference requests and ii) fine-tuning the deployed models to adapt to possible deployment scenario changes. Continual learning (CL) is widely adopted to satisfy these needs. CL is a popular deep learning paradigm that handles both continuous model fine-tuning and overtime inference requests. However, an inappropriate model fine-tuning scheme could involve significant redundancy and consume considerable time and energy, making it challenging to apply CL on edge devices. In this paper, we propose ETuner, an efficient edge continual learning framework that optimizes inference accuracy, fine-tuning execution time, and energy efficiency through both inter-tuning and intra-tuning optimizations. Experimental results show that, on average, ETuner reduces overall fine-tuning execution time by 64%, energy consumption by 56%, and improves average inference accuracy by 1.75% over the immediate model fine-tuning approach.</p>

However, adversarial robustness enhanced by defense algorithms is easily erased as the neural network's weights update to learn new tasks. To address this vulnerability, it is essential to improve the capability of neural networks in terms of robust continual learning. Specially, we propose a novel gradient projection technique that effectively stabilizes sample gradients from previous data by orthogonally projecting back-propagation gradients onto a crucial subspace before using them for weight updates. This technique can maintaining robustness by collaborating with a class of defense algorithms through sample gradient smoothing. The experimental results on four benchmarks including Split-CIFAR100 and Split-miniImageNet, demonstrate that the superiority of the proposed approach in mitigating rapidly degradation of robustness during continual learning even when facing strong adversarial attacks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graph augmentation methods play a crucial role in improving the performance and enhancing generalisation capabilities in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Existing graph augmentation methods mainly perturb the graph structures, and are usually limited to pairwise node relations. These methods cannot fully address the complexities of real-world large-scale networks, which often involve higher-order node relations beyond only being pairwise. Meanwhile, real-world graph datasets are predominantly modelled as simple graphs, due to the scarcity of data that can be used to form higher-order edges. Therefore, reconfiguring the higher-order edges as an integration into graph augmentation strategies lights up a promising research path to address the aforementioned issues. In this paper, we present Topological Augmentation (TopoAug), a novel graph augmentation method that builds a combinatorial complex from the original graph by constructing virtual hyperedges directly from the raw data. TopoAug then produces auxiliary node features by extracting information from the combinatorial complex, which are used for enhancing GNN performances on downstream tasks. We design three diverse virtual hyperedge construction strategies to accompany the construction of combinatorial complexes: (1) via graph statistics, (2) from multiple data perspectives, and (3) utilising multi-modality. Furthermore, to facilitate TopoAug evaluation, we provide 23 novel real-world graph datasets across various domains including social media, biology, and e-commerce. Our empirical study shows that TopoAug consistently and significantly outperforms GNN baselines and other graph augmentation methods, across a variety of application contexts, which clearly indicates that it can effectively incorporate higher-order node relations into the graph augmentation for real-world complex networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eshaan Nichani, Alex Damian, Jason D. Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: The incredible success of transformers on sequence modeling tasks can be largely attributed to the self-attention mechanism, which allows information to be transferred between different parts of a sequence. Self-attention allows transformers to encode causal structure which makes them particularly suitable for sequence modeling. However, the process by which transformers learn such causal structure via gradient-based training algorithms remains poorly understood. To better understand this process, we introduce an in-context learning task that requires learning latent causal structure. We prove that gradient descent on a simplified two-layer transformer learns to solve this task by encoding the latent causal graph in the first attention layer. The key insight of our proof is that the gradient of the attention matrix encodes the mutual information between tokens. As a consequence of the data processing inequality, the largest entries of this gradient correspond to edges in the latent causal graph. As a special case, when the sequences are generated from in-context Markov chains, we prove that transformers learn an induction head (Olsson et al., 2022). We confirm our theoretical findings by showing that transformers trained on our in-context learning task are able to recover a wide variety of causal structures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhicong Tang, Tiankai Hang, Shuyang Gu, Dong Chen, Baining Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel theoretical simplification of the Diffusion Schr\"odinger Bridge (DSB) that facilitates its unification with Score-based Generative Models (SGMs), addressing the limitations of DSB in complex data generation and enabling faster convergence and enhanced performance. By employing SGMs as an initial solution for DSB, our approach capitalizes on the strengths of both frameworks, ensuring a more efficient training process and improving the performance of SGM. We also propose a reparameterization technique that, despite theoretical approximations, practically improves the network's fitting capabilities. Our extensive experimental evaluations confirm the effectiveness of the simplified DSB, demonstrating its significant improvements. We believe the contributions of this work pave the way for advanced generative modeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Feifei Qian, Lixin Cui, Ming Li, Yue Wang, Hangyuan Du, Lixiang Xu, Lu Bai, Philip S. Yu, Edwin R. Hancock</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new model to learn Adaptive Kernel-based Representations (AKBR) for graph classification. Unlike state-of-the-art R-convolution graph kernels that are defined by merely counting any pair of isomorphic substructures between graphs and cannot provide an end-to-end learning mechanism for the classifier, the proposed AKBR approach aims to define an end-to-end representation learning model to construct an adaptive kernel matrix for graphs. To this end, we commence by leveraging a novel feature-channel attention mechanism to capture the interdependencies between different substructure invariants of original graphs. The proposed AKBR model can thus effectively identify the structural importance of different substructures, and compute the R-convolution kernel between pairwise graphs associated with the more significant substructures specified by their structural attentions. Since each row of the resulting kernel matrix can be theoretically seen as the embedding vector of a sample graph, the proposed AKBR model is able to directly employ the resulting kernel matrix as the graph feature matrix and input it into the classifier for classification (i.e., the SoftMax layer), naturally providing an end-to-end learning architecture between the kernel computation as well as the classifier. Experimental results show that the proposed AKBR model outperforms existing state-of-the-art graph kernels and deep learning methods on standard graph benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chuqin Geng, Zhaoyue Wang, Haolin Ye, Saifei Liao, Xujie Si</p>
<p>Abstract: Formal verification is only as good as the specification of a system, which is also true for neural network verification. Existing specifications follow the paradigm of data as specification, where the local neighborhood around a reference data point is considered correct or robust. While these specifications provide a fair testbed for assessing model robustness, they are too restrictive for verifying unseen test data-a challenging task with significant real-world implications. Recent work shows great promise through a new paradigm, neural representation as specification, which uses neural activation patterns (NAPs) for this purpose. However, it computes the most refined NAPs, which include many redundant neurons. In this paper, we study the following problem: Given a neural network, find a minimal (general) NAP specification that is sufficient for formal verification of the network's robustness. Finding the minimal NAP specification not only expands verifiable bounds but also provides insights into which neurons contribute to the model's robustness. To address this problem, we propose several exact and approximate approaches. Our exact approaches leverage the verification tool to find minimal NAP specifications in either a deterministic or statistical manner. Whereas the approximate methods efficiently estimate minimal NAPs using adversarial examples and local gradients, without making calls to the verification tool. This allows us to inspect potential causal links between neurons and the robustness of state-of-the art neural networks, a task for which existing verification frameworks fail to scale. Our experimental results suggest that minimal NAP specifications require much smaller fractions of neurons compared to the most refined NAP specifications computed by previous work, yet they can significantly expand the verifiable boundaries to several orders of magnitude larger.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12358">From $r$ to $Q^*$: Your Language Model is Secretly a Q-Function</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Rafael Rafailov, Joey Hejna, Ryan Park, Chelsea Finn</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning From Human Feedback (RLHF) has been critical to the success of the latest generation of generative AI models. In response to the complex nature of the classical RLHF pipeline, direct alignment algorithms such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have emerged as an alternative approach. Although DPO solves the same objective as the standard RLHF setup, there is a mismatch between the two approaches. Standard RLHF deploys reinforcement learning in a specific token-level MDP, while DPO is derived as a bandit problem in which the whole response of the model is treated as a single arm. In this work we rectify this difference. We theoretically show that we can derive DPO in the token-level MDP as a general inverse Q-learning algorithm, which satisfies the Bellman equation. Using our theoretical results, we provide three concrete empirical insights. First, we show that because of its token level interpretation, DPO is able to perform some type of credit assignment. Next, we prove that under the token level formulation, classical search-based algorithms, such as MCTS, which have recently been applied to the language generation space, are equivalent to likelihood-based search on a DPO policy. Empirically we show that a simple beam search yields meaningful improvement over the base DPO policy. Finally, we show how the choice of reference policy causes implicit rewards to decline during training. We conclude by discussing applications of our work, including information elicitation in multi-turn dialogue, reasoning, agentic applications and end-to-end training of multi-model systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chandrajit Bajaj, Minh Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with continuous state and action spaces remains one of the most challenging problems within the field. Most current learning methods focus on integral identities such as value functions to derive an optimal strategy for the learning agent. In this paper, we instead study the dual form of the original RL formulation to propose the first differential RL framework that can handle settings with limited training samples and short-length episodes. Our approach introduces Differential Policy Optimization (DPO), a pointwise and stage-wise iteration method that optimizes policies encoded by local-movement operators. We prove a pointwise convergence estimate for DPO and provide a regret bound comparable with the best current theoretical derivation. Such pointwise estimate ensures that the learned policy matches the optimal path uniformly across different steps. We then apply DPO to a class of practical RL problems with continuous state and action spaces, and which search for optimal configurations with Lagrangian rewards. DPO is easy to implement, scalable, and shows competitive results on benchmarking experiments against several popular RL methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gabriela Kadlecov\'a, Jovita Lukasik, Martin Pil\'at, Petra Vidnerov\'a, Mahmoud Safari, Roman Neruda, Frank Hutter</p>
<p>Abstract: Performance prediction has been a key part of the neural architecture search (NAS) process, allowing to speed up NAS algorithms by avoiding resource-consuming network training. Although many performance predictors correlate well with ground truth performance, they require training data in the form of trained networks. Recently, zero-cost proxies have been proposed as an efficient method to estimate network performance without any training. However, they are still poorly understood, exhibit biases with network properties, and their performance is limited. Inspired by the drawbacks of zero-cost proxies, we propose neural graph features (GRAF), simple to compute properties of architectural graphs. GRAF offers fast and interpretable performance prediction while outperforming zero-cost proxies and other common encodings. In combination with other zero-cost proxies, GRAF outperforms most existing performance predictors at a fraction of the cost.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Herilalaina Rakotoarison, Steven Adriaensen, Neeratyoy Mallik, Samir Garibov, Edward Bergman, Frank Hutter</p>
<p>Abstract: With the increasing computational costs associated with deep learning, automated hyperparameter optimization methods, strongly relying on black-box Bayesian optimization (BO), face limitations. Freeze-thaw BO offers a promising grey-box alternative, strategically allocating scarce resources incrementally to different configurations. However, the frequent surrogate model updates inherent to this approach pose challenges for existing methods, requiring retraining or fine-tuning their neural network surrogates online, introducing overhead, instability, and hyper-hyperparameters. In this work, we propose FT-PFN, a novel surrogate for Freeze-thaw style BO. FT-PFN is a prior-data fitted network (PFN) that leverages the transformers' in-context learning ability to efficiently and reliably do Bayesian learning curve extrapolation in a single forward pass. Our empirical analysis across three benchmark suites shows that the predictions made by FT-PFN are more accurate and 10-100 times faster than those of the deep Gaussian process and deep ensemble surrogates used in previous work. Furthermore, we show that, when combined with our novel acquisition mechanism (MFPI-random), the resulting in-context freeze-thaw BO method (ifBO), yields new state-of-the-art performance in the same three families of deep learning HPO benchmarks considered in prior work.</p>

<p>Abstract: The incorporation of generative models as regularisers within variational formulations for inverse problems has proven effective across numerous image reconstruction tasks. However, the resulting optimisation problem is often non-convex and challenging to solve. In this work, we show that score-based generative models (SGMs) can be used in a graduated optimisation framework to solve inverse problems. We show that the resulting graduated non-convexity flow converge to stationary points of the original problem and provide a numerical convergence analysis of a 2D toy example. We further provide experiments on computed tomography image reconstruction, where we show that this framework is able to recover high-quality images, independent of the initial value. The experiments highlight the potential of using SGMs in graduated optimisation frameworks. The source code is publicly available on GitHub.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present Piecewise Rectified Flow (PeRFlow), a flow-based method for accelerating diffusion models. PeRFlow divides the sampling process of generative flows into several time windows and straightens the trajectories in each interval via the reflow operation, thereby approaching piecewise linear flows. PeRFlow achieves superior performance in a few-step generation. Moreover, through dedicated parameterizations, the PeRFlow models inherit knowledge from the pretrained diffusion models. Thus, the training converges fast and the obtained models show advantageous transfer ability, serving as universal plug-and-play accelerators that are compatible with various workflows based on the pre-trained diffusion models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Renqiang Luo, Huafei Huang, Shuo Yu, Zhuoyang Han, Estrid He, Xiuzhen Zhang, Feng Xia</p>
<p>Abstract: Fairness-aware Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often face a challenging trade-off, where prioritizing fairness may require compromising utility. In this work, we re-examine fairness through the lens of spectral graph theory, aiming to reconcile fairness and utility within the framework of spectral graph learning. We explore the correlation between sensitive features and spectrum in GNNs, using theoretical analysis to delineate the similarity between original sensitive features and those after convolution under different spectra. Our analysis reveals a reduction in the impact of similarity when the eigenvectors associated with the largest magnitude eigenvalue exhibit directional similarity. Based on these theoretical insights, we propose FUGNN, a novel spectral graph learning approach that harmonizes the conflict between fairness and utility. FUGNN ensures algorithmic fairness and utility by truncating the spectrum and optimizing eigenvector distribution during the encoding process. The fairness-aware eigenvector selection reduces the impact of convolution on sensitive features while concurrently minimizing the sacrifice of utility. FUGNN further optimizes the distribution of eigenvectors through a transformer architecture. By incorporating the optimized spectrum into the graph convolution network, FUGNN effectively learns node representations. Experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of FUGNN over baseline methods. The codes are available at https://github.com/yushuowiki/FUGNN.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Enoch Luk, Eviatar Bach, Ricardo Baptista, Andrew Stuart</p>
<p>Abstract: Filtering - the task of estimating the conditional distribution of states of a dynamical system given partial, noisy, observations - is important in many areas of science and engineering, including weather and climate prediction. However, the filtering distribution is generally intractable to obtain for high-dimensional, nonlinear systems. Filters used in practice, such as the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), are biased for nonlinear systems and have numerous tuning parameters. Here, we present a framework for learning a parameterized analysis map - the map that takes a forecast distribution and observations to the filtering distribution - using variational inference. We show that this methodology can be used to learn gain matrices for filtering linear and nonlinear dynamical systems, as well as inflation and localization parameters for an EnKF. Future work will apply this framework to learn new filtering algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Artem Moskalev, Mangal Prakash, Rui Liao, Tommaso Mansi</p>
<p>Abstract: Modeling global geometric context while maintaining equivariance is crucial for accurate predictions in many fields such as biology, chemistry, or vision. Yet, this is challenging due to the computational demands of processing high-dimensional data at scale. Existing approaches such as equivariant self-attention or distance-based message passing, suffer from quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length, while localized methods sacrifice global information. Inspired by the recent success of state-space and long-convolutional models, in this work, we introduce SE(3)-Hyena operator, an equivariant long-convolutional model based on the Hyena operator. The SE(3)-Hyena captures global geometric context at sub-quadratic complexity while maintaining equivariance to rotations and translations. Evaluated on equivariant associative recall and n-body modeling, SE(3)-Hyena matches or outperforms equivariant self-attention while requiring significantly less memory and computational resources for long sequences. Our model processes the geometric context of 20k tokens x3.5 times faster than the equivariant transformer and allows x175 longer a context within the same memory budget.</p>

<p>Abstract: The large volume and variety of imaging data from high-throughput screening (HTS) in the pharmaceutical industry present an excellent resource for training virtual staining models. However, the potential of models trained under one set of experimental conditions to generalize to other conditions remains underexplored. This study systematically investigates whether data from three cell types (lung, ovarian, and breast) and two phenotypes (toxic and non-toxic conditions) commonly found in HTS can effectively train virtual staining models to generalize across three typical HTS distribution shifts: unseen phenotypes, unseen cell types, and the combination of both. Utilizing a dataset of 772,416 paired bright-field, cytoplasm, nuclei, and DNA-damage stain images, we evaluate the generalization capabilities of models across pixel-based, instance-wise, and biological-feature-based levels. Our findings indicate that training virtual nuclei and cytoplasm models on non-toxic condition samples not only generalizes to toxic condition samples but leads to improved performance across all evaluation levels compared to training on toxic condition samples. Generalization to unseen cell types shows variability depending on the cell type; models trained on ovarian or lung cell samples often perform well under other conditions, while those trained on breast cell samples consistently show poor generalization. Generalization to unseen cell types and phenotypes shows good generalization across all levels of evaluation compared to addressing unseen cell types alone. This study represents the first large-scale, data-centric analysis of the generalization capability of virtual staining models trained on diverse HTS datasets, providing valuable strategies for experimental training data generation.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study introduces the Misclassification Likelihood Matrix (MLM) as a novel tool for quantifying the reliability of neural network predictions under distribution shifts. The MLM is obtained by leveraging softmax outputs and clustering techniques to measure the distances between the predictions of a trained neural network and class centroids. By analyzing these distances, the MLM provides a comprehensive view of the model's misclassification tendencies, enabling decision-makers to identify the most common and critical sources of errors. The MLM allows for the prioritization of model improvements and the establishment of decision thresholds based on acceptable risk levels. The approach is evaluated on the MNIST dataset using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a perturbed version of the dataset to simulate distribution shifts. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the MLM in assessing the reliability of predictions and highlight its potential in enhancing the interpretability and risk mitigation capabilities of neural networks. The implications of this work extend beyond image classification, with ongoing applications in autonomous systems, such as self-driving cars, to improve the safety and reliability of decision-making in complex, real-world environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Ensuring the reliability and safety of automated decision-making is crucial. It is well-known that data distribution shifts in machine learning can produce unreliable outcomes. This paper proposes a new approach for measuring the reliability of predictions under distribution shifts. We analyze how the outputs of a trained neural network change using clustering to measure distances between outputs and class centroids. We propose this distance as a metric to evaluate the confidence of predictions under distribution shifts. We assign each prediction to a cluster with centroid representing the mean softmax output for all correct predictions of a given class. We then define a safety threshold for a class as the smallest distance from an incorrect prediction to the given class centroid. We evaluate the approach on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets using a Convolutional Neural Network and a Vision Transformer, respectively. The results show that our approach is consistent across these data sets and network models, and indicate that the proposed metric can offer an efficient way of determining when automated predictions are acceptable and when they should be deferred to human operators given a distribution shift.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dianhui Wang, Gang Dang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel neuro-fuzzy model, termed fuzzy recurrent stochastic configuration networks (F-RSCNs), for industrial data analytics. Unlike the original recurrent stochastic configuration network (RSCN), the proposed F-RSCN is constructed by multiple sub-reservoirs, and each sub-reservoir is associated with a Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy rule. Through this hybrid framework, first, the interpretability of the model is enhanced by incorporating fuzzy reasoning to embed the prior knowledge into the network. Then, the parameters of the neuro-fuzzy model are determined by the recurrent stochastic configuration (RSC) algorithm. This scheme not only ensures the universal approximation property and fast learning speed of the built model but also overcomes uncertain problems, such as unknown dynamic orders, arbitrary structure determination, and the sensitivity of learning parameters in modelling nonlinear dynamics. Finally, an online update of the output weights is performed using the projection algorithm, and the convergence analysis of the learning parameters is given. By integrating TSK fuzzy inference systems into RSCNs, F-RSCNs have strong fuzzy inference capability and can achieve sound performance for both learning and generalization. Comprehensive experiments show that the proposed F-RSCNs outperform other classical neuro-fuzzy and non-fuzzy models, demonstrating great potential for modelling complex industrial systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Operator learning has become a powerful tool in machine learning for modeling complex physical systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). Although Deep Operator Networks (DeepONet) show promise, they require extensive data acquisition. Physics-informed DeepONets (PI-DeepONet) mitigate data scarcity but suffer from inefficient training processes. We introduce Separable Operator Networks (SepONet), a novel framework that significantly enhances the efficiency of physics-informed operator learning. SepONet uses independent trunk networks to learn basis functions separately for different coordinate axes, enabling faster and more memory-efficient training via forward-mode automatic differentiation. We provide a universal approximation theorem for SepONet proving that it generalizes to arbitrary operator learning problems, and then validate its performance through comprehensive benchmarking against PI-DeepONet. Our results demonstrate SepONet's superior performance across various nonlinear and inseparable PDEs, with SepONet's advantages increasing with problem complexity, dimension, and scale. For 1D time-dependent PDEs, SepONet achieves up to $112\times$ faster training and $82\times$ reduction in GPU memory usage compared to PI-DeepONet, while maintaining comparable accuracy. For the 2D time-dependent nonlinear diffusion equation, SepONet efficiently handles the complexity, achieving a 6.44\% mean relative $\ell_{2}$ test error, while PI-DeepONet fails due to memory constraints. This work paves the way for extreme-scale learning of continuous mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohamed Kissi, Mathieu Pont, Joshua A. Levine, Julien Tierny</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a practical approach for the optimization of topological simplification, a central pre-processing step for the analysis and visualization of scalar data. Given an input scalar field f and a set of "signal" persistence pairs to maintain, our approach produces an output field g that is close to f and which optimizes (i) the cancellation of "non-signal" pairs, while (ii) preserving the "signal" pairs. In contrast to pre-existing simplification algorithms, our approach is not restricted to persistence pairs involving extrema and can thus address a larger class of topological features, in particular saddle pairs in three-dimensional scalar data. Our approach leverages recent generic persistence optimization frameworks and extends them with tailored accelerations specific to the problem of topological simplification. Extensive experiments report substantial accelerations over these frameworks, thereby making topological simplification optimization practical for real-life datasets. Our approach enables a direct visualization and analysis of the topologically simplified data, e.g., via isosurfaces of simplified topology (fewer components and handles). We apply our approach to the extraction of prominent filament structures in three-dimensional data. Specifically, we show that our pre-simplification of the data leads to practical improvements over standard topological techniques for removing filament loops. We also show how our approach can be used to repair genus defects in surface processing. Finally, we provide a C++ implementation for reproducibility purposes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Harry J. Davies, James Monsen, Danilo P. Mandic</p>
<p>Abstract: Decoder-only transformers are the backbone of the popular generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) series of large language models. In this work, we employ this framework to the analysis of clinical heart time-series data, to create two pre-trained general purpose cardiac models, termed PPG-PT and ECG-PT. We place a special emphasis on making both such pre-trained models fully interpretable. This is achieved firstly through aggregate attention maps which show that, in order to make predictions, the model focuses on similar points in previous cardiac cycles and gradually broadens its attention in deeper layers. Next, we show that tokens with the same value, which occur at different distinct points in the electrocardiography (ECG) and photoplethysmography (PPG) cycle, form separate clusters in high dimensional space. The clusters form according to phase, as the tokens propagate through the transformer blocks. Finally, we highlight that individual attention heads respond to specific physiologically relevent features, such as the dicrotic notch in PPG and the P-wave in ECG. It is also demonstrated that these pre-trained models are straightforward to fine-tune for tasks such as classification of atrial fibrillation (AF), and beat detection in photoplethysmography. For the example of AF, the fine-tuning took 11 minutes of computer time, and achieved the respective leave-one-subject-out AUCs of 0.99 and 0.93 for ECG and PPG within the MIMIC Perform AF dataset. In addition, the fine-tuned beat detector achieved a state-of-the-art F1 score of 98%, as well as uniquely providing a beat confidence level which acts as a signal quality estimator. Importantly, the fine-tuned models for AF screening are also fully explainable, with attention shifting to regions in the context that are strongly indicative of atrial fibrillation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Dataset Distillation aims to compress a large dataset into a significantly more compact, synthetic one without compromising the performance of the trained models. To achieve this, existing methods use the agent model to extract information from the target dataset and embed it into the distilled dataset. Consequently, the quality of extracted and embedded information determines the quality of the distilled dataset. In this work, we find that existing methods introduce misaligned information in both information extraction and embedding stages. To alleviate this, we propose Prioritize Alignment in Dataset Distillation (PAD), which aligns information from the following two perspectives. 1) We prune the target dataset according to the compressing ratio to filter the information that can be extracted by the agent model. 2) We use only deep layers of the agent model to perform the distillation to avoid excessively introducing low-level information. This simple strategy effectively filters out misaligned information and brings non-trivial improvement for mainstream matching-based distillation algorithms. Furthermore, built on trajectory matching, \textbf{PAD} achieves remarkable improvements on various benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Laplacian learning method is a well-established technique in classical graph-based semi-supervised learning, but its potential in the quantum domain remains largely unexplored. This study investigates the performance of the Laplacian-based Quantum Semi-Supervised Learning (QSSL) method across four benchmark datasets -- Iris, Wine, Breast Cancer Wisconsin, and Heart Disease. Further analysis explores the impact of increasing Qubit counts, revealing that adding more Qubits to a quantum system doesn't always improve performance. The effectiveness of additional Qubits depends on the quantum algorithm and how well it matches the dataset. Additionally, we examine the effects of varying entangling layers on entanglement entropy and test accuracy. The performance of Laplacian learning is highly dependent on the number of entangling layers, with optimal configurations varying across different datasets. Typically, moderate levels of entanglement offer the best balance between model complexity and generalization capabilities. These observations highlight the crucial need for precise hyperparameter tuning tailored to each dataset to achieve optimal performance in Laplacian learning methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Reza Mirzaeifard, Diyako Ghaderyan, Stefan Werner</p>
<p>Abstract: Distributed sensors in the internet-of-things (IoT) generate vast amounts of sparse data. Analyzing this high-dimensional data and identifying relevant predictors pose substantial challenges, especially when data is preferred to remain on the device where it was collected for reasons such as data integrity, communication bandwidth, and privacy. This paper introduces a federated quantile regression algorithm to address these challenges. Quantile regression provides a more comprehensive view of the relationship between variables than mean regression models. However, traditional approaches face difficulties when dealing with nonconvex sparse penalties and the inherent non-smoothness of the loss function. For this purpose, we propose a federated smoothing proximal gradient (FSPG) algorithm that integrates a smoothing mechanism with the proximal gradient framework, thereby enhancing both precision and computational speed. This integration adeptly handles optimization over a network of devices, each holding local data samples, making it particularly effective in federated learning scenarios. The FSPG algorithm ensures steady progress and reliable convergence in each iteration by maintaining or reducing the value of the objective function. By leveraging nonconvex penalties, such as the minimax concave penalty (MCP) and smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD), the proposed method can identify and preserve key predictors within sparse models. Comprehensive simulations validate the robust theoretical foundations of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate improved estimation precision and reliable convergence.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent success of machine learning in many domains has been overwhelming, which often leads to false expectations regarding the capabilities of behavior learning in robotics. In this survey, we analyze the current state of machine learning for robotic behaviors. We will give a broad overview of behaviors that have been learned and used on real robots. Our focus is on kinematically or sensorially complex robots. That includes humanoid robots or parts of humanoid robots, for example, legged robots or robotic arms. We will classify presented behaviors according to various categories and we will draw conclusions about what can be learned and what should be learned. Furthermore, we will give an outlook on problems that are challenging today but might be solved by machine learning in the future and argue that classical robotics and other approaches from artificial intelligence should be integrated more with machine learning to form complete, autonomous systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: We study the problem of recovering a planted hierarchy of partitions in a network. The detectability of a single planted partition has previously been analysed in detail and a phase transition has been identified below which the partition cannot be detected. Here we show that, in the hierarchical setting, there exist additional phases in which the presence of multiple consistent partitions can either help or hinder detection. Accordingly, the detectability limit for non-hierarchical partitions typically provides insufficient information about the detectability of the complete hierarchical structure, as we highlight with several constructive examples.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuetian Luo, Xudong Li, Anru R. Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we consider the geometric landscape connection of the widely studied manifold and factorization formulations in low-rank positive semidefinite (PSD) and general matrix optimization. We establish a sandwich relation on the spectrum of Riemannian and Euclidean Hessians at first-order stationary points (FOSPs). As a result of that, we obtain an equivalence on the set of FOSPs, second-order stationary points (SOSPs) and strict saddles between the manifold and the factorization formulations. In addition, we show the sandwich relation can be used to transfer more quantitative geometric properties from one formulation to another. Similarities and differences in the landscape connection under the PSD case and the general case are discussed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first geometric landscape connection between the manifold and the factorization formulations for handling rank constraints, and it provides a geometric explanation for the similar empirical performance of factorization and manifold approaches in low-rank matrix optimization observed in the literature. In the general low-rank matrix optimization, the landscape connection of two factorization formulations (unregularized and regularized ones) is also provided. By applying these geometric landscape connections, in particular, the sandwich relation, we are able to solve unanswered questions in literature and establish stronger results in the applications on geometric analysis of phase retrieval, well-conditioned low-rank matrix optimization, and the role of regularization in factorization arising from machine learning and signal processing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonas Wacker, Motonobu Kanagawa, Maurizio Filippone</p>
<p>Abstract: Dot product kernels, such as polynomial and exponential (softmax) kernels, are among the most widely used kernels in machine learning, as they enable modeling the interactions between input features, which is crucial in applications like computer vision, natural language processing, and recommender systems. We make several novel contributions for improving the efficiency of random feature approximations for dot product kernels, to make these kernels more useful in large scale learning. First, we present a generalization of existing random feature approximations for polynomial kernels, such as Rademacher and Gaussian sketches and TensorSRHT, using complex-valued random features. We show empirically that the use of complex features can significantly reduce the variances of these approximations. Second, we provide a theoretical analysis for understanding the factors affecting the efficiency of various random feature approximations, by deriving closed-form expressions for their variances. These variance formulas elucidate conditions under which certain approximations (e.g., TensorSRHT) achieve lower variances than others (e.g., Rademacher sketches), and conditions under which the use of complex features leads to lower variances than real features. Third, by using these variance formulas, which can be evaluated in practice, we develop a data-driven optimization approach to improve random feature approximations for general dot product kernels, which is also applicable to the Gaussian kernel. We describe the improvements brought by these contributions with extensive experiments on a variety of tasks and datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joseph Carlsmith</p>
<p>Abstract: This report examines what I see as the core argument for concern about existential risk from misaligned artificial intelligence. I proceed in two stages. First, I lay out a backdrop picture that informs such concern. On this picture, intelligent agency is an extremely powerful force, and creating agents much more intelligent than us is playing with fire -- especially given that if their objectives are problematic, such agents would plausibly have instrumental incentives to seek power over humans. Second, I formulate and evaluate a more specific six-premise argument that creating agents of this kind will lead to existential catastrophe by 2070. On this argument, by 2070: (1) it will become possible and financially feasible to build relevantly powerful and agentic AI systems; (2) there will be strong incentives to do so; (3) it will be much harder to build aligned (and relevantly powerful/agentic) AI systems than to build misaligned (and relevantly powerful/agentic) AI systems that are still superficially attractive to deploy; (4) some such misaligned systems will seek power over humans in high-impact ways; (5) this problem will scale to the full disempowerment of humanity; and (6) such disempowerment will constitute an existential catastrophe. I assign rough subjective credences to the premises in this argument, and I end up with an overall estimate of ~5% that an existential catastrophe of this kind will occur by 2070. (May 2022 update: since making this report public in April 2021, my estimate here has gone up, and is now at >10%.)</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matthieu Cordonnier, Nicolas Keriven, Nicolas Tremblay, Samuel Vaiter</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the convergence of message passing graph neural networks on random graph models to their continuous counterpart as the number of nodes tends to infinity. Until now, this convergence was only known for architectures with aggregation functions in the form of normalized means, or, equivalently, of an application of classical operators like the adjacency matrix or the graph Laplacian. We extend such results to a large class of aggregation functions, that encompasses all classically used message passing graph neural networks, such as attention-based message passing, max convolutional message passing, (degree-normalized) convolutional message passing, or moment-based aggregation message passing. Under mild assumptions, we give non-asymptotic bounds with high probability to quantify this convergence. Our main result is based on the McDiarmid inequality. Interestingly, this result does not apply to the case where the aggregation is a coordinate-wise maximum. We treat this case separately and obtain a different convergence rate.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Feng Bao, Zezhong Zhang, Guannan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose an ensemble score filter (EnSF) for solving high-dimensional nonlinear filtering problems with superior accuracy. A major drawback of existing filtering methods, e.g., particle filters or ensemble Kalman filters, is the low accuracy in handling high-dimensional and highly nonlinear problems. EnSF attacks this challenge by exploiting the score-based diffusion model, defined in a pseudo-temporal domain, to characterizing the evolution of the filtering density. EnSF stores the information of the recursively updated filtering density function in the score function, instead of storing the information in a set of finite Monte Carlo samples (used in particle filters and ensemble Kalman filters). Unlike existing diffusion models that train neural networks to approximate the score function, we develop a training-free score estimation that uses a mini-batch-based Monte Carlo estimator to directly approximate the score function at any pseudo-spatial-temporal location, which provides sufficient accuracy in solving high-dimensional nonlinear problems as well as saves a tremendous amount of time spent on training neural networks. High-dimensional Lorenz-96 systems are used to demonstrate the performance of our method. EnSF provides surprising performance, compared with the state-of-the-art Local Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter method, in reliably and efficiently tracking extremely high-dimensional Lorenz systems (up to 1,000,000 dimensions) with highly nonlinear observation processes.</p>

<p>Abstract: Text-To-Image (TTI) models, such as DALL-E and StableDiffusion, have demonstrated remarkable prompt-based image generation capabilities. Multilingual encoders may have a substantial impact on the cultural agency of these models, as language is a conduit of culture. In this study, we explore the cultural perception embedded in TTI models by characterizing culture across three hierarchical tiers: cultural dimensions, cultural domains, and cultural concepts. Based on this ontology, we derive prompt templates to unlock the cultural knowledge in TTI models, and propose a comprehensive suite of evaluation techniques, including intrinsic evaluations using the CLIP space, extrinsic evaluations with a Visual-Question-Answer (VQA) model and human assessments, to evaluate the cultural content of TTI-generated images. To bolster our research, we introduce the CulText2I dataset, derived from six diverse TTI models and spanning ten languages. Our experiments provide insights regarding Do, What, Which and How research questions about the nature of cultural encoding in TTI models, paving the way for cross-cultural applications of these models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> SayedHassan Khatoonabadi, Ahmad Abdellatif, Diego Elias Costa, Emad Shihab</p>
<p>Abstract: The success of a Pull Request (PR) depends on the responsiveness of the maintainers and the contributor during the review process. Being aware of the expected waiting times can lead to better interactions and managed expectations for both the maintainers and the contributor. In this paper, we propose a machine-learning approach to predict the first response latency of the maintainers following the submission of a PR, and the first response latency of the contributor after receiving the first response from the maintainers. We curate a dataset of 20 large and popular open-source projects on GitHub and extract 21 features to characterize projects, contributors, PRs, and review processes. Using these features, we then evaluate seven types of classifiers to identify the best-performing models. We also conduct permutation feature importance and SHAP analyses to understand the importance and the impact of different features on the predicted response latencies. We find that our CatBoost models are the most effective for predicting the first response latencies of both maintainers and contributors. We also observe that PRs submitted earlier in the week, containing an average number of commits, and with concise descriptions are more likely to receive faster first responses from the maintainers. Similarly, PRs with a lower first response latency from maintainers, that received the first response of maintainers earlier in the week, and containing an average number of commits tend to receive faster first responses from the contributors. Additionally, contributors with a higher acceptance rate and a history of timely responses in the project are likely to both obtain and provide faster first responses. Moreover, we show the effectiveness of our approach in a cross-project setting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Santiago Cifuentes, Leopoldo Bertossi, Nina Pardal, Sergio Abriola, Maria Vanina Martinez, Miguel Romero</p>
<p>Abstract: Attribution scores reflect how important the feature values in an input entity are for the output of a machine learning model. One of the most popular attribution scores is the SHAP score, which is an instantiation of the general Shapley value used in coalition game theory. The definition of this score relies on a probability distribution on the entity population. Since the exact distribution is generally unknown, it needs to be assigned subjectively or be estimated from data, which may lead to misleading feature scores. In this paper, we propose a principled framework for reasoning on SHAP scores under unknown entity population distributions. In our framework, we consider an uncertainty region that contains the potential distributions, and the SHAP score of a feature becomes a function defined over this region. We study the basic problems of finding maxima and minima of this function, which allows us to determine tight ranges for the SHAP scores of all features. In particular, we pinpoint the complexity of these problems, and other related ones, showing them to be NP-complete. Finally, we present experiments on a real-world dataset, showing that our framework may contribute to a more robust feature scoring.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmet Alacaoglu, Donghwan Kim, Stephen J. Wright</p>
<p>Abstract: We focus on constrained, $L$-smooth, potentially stochastic and nonconvex-nonconcave min-max problems either satisfying $\rho$-cohypomonotonicity or admitting a solution to the $\rho$-weakly Minty Variational Inequality (MVI), where larger values of the parameter $\rho>0$ correspond to a greater degree of nonconvexity. These problem classes include examples in two player reinforcement learning, interaction dominant min-max problems, and certain synthetic test problems on which classical min-max algorithms fail. It has been conjectured that first-order methods can tolerate a value of $\rho$ no larger than $\frac{1}{L}$, but existing results in the literature have stagnated at the tighter requirement $\rho < \frac{1}{2L}$. With a simple argument, we obtain optimal or best-known complexity guarantees with cohypomonotonicity or weak MVI conditions for $\rho < \frac{1}{L}$. First main insight for the improvements in the convergence analyses is to harness the recently proposed $\textit{conic nonexpansiveness}$ property of operators. Second, we provide a refined analysis for inexact Halpern iteration that relaxes the required inexactness level to improve some state-of-the-art complexity results even for constrained stochastic convex-concave min-max problems. Third, we analyze a stochastic inexact Krasnosel'ski\u{\i}-Mann iteration with a multilevel Monte Carlo estimator when the assumptions only hold with respect to a solution.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Zou, Runpeng Geng, Binghui Wang, Jinyuan Jia</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success due to their exceptional generative capabilities. Despite their success, they also have inherent limitations such as a lack of up-to-date knowledge and hallucination. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a state-of-the-art technique to mitigate these limitations. The key idea of RAG is to ground the answer generation of an LLM on external knowledge retrieved from a knowledge database. Existing studies mainly focus on improving the accuracy or efficiency of RAG, leaving its security largely unexplored. We aim to bridge the gap in this work. We find that the knowledge database in a RAG system introduces a new and practical attack surface. Based on this attack surface, we propose PoisonedRAG, the first knowledge corruption attack to RAG, where an attacker could inject a few malicious texts into the knowledge database of a RAG system to induce an LLM to generate an attacker-chosen target answer for an attacker-chosen target question. We formulate knowledge corruption attacks as an optimization problem, whose solution is a set of malicious texts. Depending on the background knowledge (e.g., black-box and white-box settings) of an attacker on a RAG system, we propose two solutions to solve the optimization problem, respectively. Our results show PoisonedRAG could achieve a 90% attack success rate when injecting five malicious texts for each target question into a knowledge database with millions of texts. We also evaluate several defenses and our results show they are insufficient to defend against PoisonedRAG, highlighting the need for new defenses.</p>

<p>Abstract: Automatic extraction of medical information from clinical documents poses several challenges: high costs of required clinical expertise, limited interpretability of model predictions, restricted computational resources and privacy regulations. Recent advances in domain-adaptation and prompting methods showed promising results with minimal training data using lightweight masked language models, which are suited for well-established interpretability methods. We are first to present a systematic evaluation of these methods in a low-resource setting, by performing multi-class section classification on German doctor's letters. We conduct extensive class-wise evaluations supported by Shapley values, to validate the quality of our small training data set and to ensure the interpretability of model predictions. We demonstrate that a lightweight, domain-adapted pretrained model, prompted with just 20 shots, outperforms a traditional classification model by 30.5% accuracy. Our results serve as a process-oriented guideline for clinical information extraction projects working with low-resource.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuo Xu, Lixin Cui, Ming Li, Yue Wang, Ziyu Lyu, Hangyuan Du, Lu Bai, Philip S. Yu, Edwin R. Hancock</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we develop a novel local graph pooling method, namely the Separated Subgraph-based Hierarchical Pooling (SSHPool), for graph classification. We commence by assigning the nodes of a sample graph into different clusters, resulting in a family of separated subgraphs. We individually employ the local graph convolution units as the local structure to further compress each subgraph into a coarsened node, transforming the original graph into a coarsened graph. Since these subgraphs are separated by different clusters and the structural information cannot be propagated between them, the local convolution operation can significantly avoid the over-smoothing problem caused by message passing through edges in most existing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). By hierarchically performing the proposed procedures on the resulting coarsened graph, the proposed SSHPool can effectively extract the hierarchical global features of the original graph structure, encapsulating rich intrinsic structural characteristics. Furthermore, we develop an end-to-end GNN framework associated with the SSHPool module for graph classification. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed model on real-world datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bruce D. Lee, Ingvar Ziemann, George J. Pappas, Nikolai Matni</p>
<p>Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning is an effective approach for controlling an unknown system. It is based on a longstanding pipeline familiar to the control community in which one performs experiments on the environment to collect a dataset, uses the resulting dataset to identify a model of the system, and finally performs control synthesis using the identified model. As interacting with the system may be costly and time consuming, targeted exploration is crucial for developing an effective control-oriented model with minimal experimentation. Motivated by this challenge, recent work has begun to study finite sample data requirements and sample efficient algorithms for the problem of optimal exploration in model-based reinforcement learning. However, existing theory and algorithms are limited to model classes which are linear in the parameters. Our work instead focuses on models with nonlinear parameter dependencies, and presents the first finite sample analysis of an active learning algorithm suitable for a general class of nonlinear dynamics. In certain settings, the excess control cost of our algorithm achieves the optimal rate, up to logarithmic factors. We validate our approach in simulation, showcasing the advantage of active, control-oriented exploration for controlling nonlinear systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhongrui Gui, Shuyang Sun, Runjia Li, Jianhao Yuan, Zhaochong An, Karsten Roth, Ameya Prabhu, Philip Torr</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual segmentation has not yet tackled the challenge of improving open-vocabulary segmentation models with training data for accurate segmentation across large, continually expanding vocabularies. We discover that traditional continual training results in severe catastrophic forgetting, failing to outperform a zero-shot segmentation baseline. We introduce a novel training-free strategy, kNN-CLIP, which augments the model with a database of instance embeddings for semantic and panoptic segmentation that achieves zero forgetting. We demonstrate that kNN-CLIP can adapt to continually growing vocabularies without the need for retraining or large memory costs. kNN-CLIP enables open-vocabulary segmentation methods to expand their vocabularies on any domain with a single pass through the data, while only storing compact embeddings. This approach minimizes both compute and memory costs. kNN-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance across large-vocabulary semantic and panoptic segmentation datasets. We hope kNN-CLIP represents a significant step forward in enabling more efficient and adaptable continual segmentation, paving the way for advances in real-world large-vocabulary continual segmentation methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiwei Hu, V\'ictor Guti\'errez-Basulto, Zhiliang Xiang, Ru Li, Jeff Z. Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: In a hyper-relational knowledge graph (HKG), each fact is composed of a main triple associated with attribute-value qualifiers, which express additional factual knowledge. The hyper-relational knowledge graph completion (HKGC) task aims at inferring plausible missing links in a HKG. Most existing approaches to HKGC focus on enhancing the communication between qualifier pairs and main triples, while overlooking two important properties that emerge from the monotonicity of the hyper-relational graphs representation regime. Stage Reasoning allows for a two-step reasoning process, facilitating the integration of coarse-grained inference results derived solely from main triples and fine-grained inference results obtained from hyper-relational facts with qualifiers. In the initial stage, coarse-grained results provide an upper bound for correct predictions, which are subsequently refined in the fine-grained step. More generally, Qualifier Monotonicity implies that by attaching more qualifier pairs to a main triple, we may only narrow down the answer set, but never enlarge it. This paper proposes the HyperMono model for hyper-relational knowledge graph completion, which realizes stage reasoning and qualifier monotonicity. To implement qualifier monotonicity HyperMono resorts to cone embeddings. Experiments on three real-world datasets with three different scenario conditions demonstrate the strong performance of HyperMono when compared to the SoTA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Charig Yang, Weidi Xie, Andrew Zisserman</p>
<p>Abstract: Our objective is to discover and localize monotonic temporal changes in a sequence of images. To achieve this, we exploit a simple proxy task of ordering a shuffled image sequence, with `time' serving as a supervisory signal, since only changes that are monotonic with time can give rise to the correct ordering. We also introduce a transformer-based model for ordering of image sequences of arbitrary length with built-in attribution maps. After training, the model successfully discovers and localizes monotonic changes while ignoring cyclic and stochastic ones. We demonstrate applications of the model in multiple domains covering different scene and object types, discovering both object-level and environmental changes in unseen sequences. We also demonstrate that the attention-based attribution maps function as effective prompts for segmenting the changing regions, and that the learned representations can be used for downstream applications. Finally, we show that the model achieves the state-of-the-art on standard benchmarks for image ordering.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenxi Song, Ruihan Qin, Huixia Ren, Zhen Liang, Yi Guo, Min Zhang, Zhiguo Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Cross-center data heterogeneity and annotation unreliability significantly challenge the intelligent diagnosis of diseases using brain signals. A notable example is the EEG-based diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases, which features subtler abnormal neural dynamics typically observed in small-group settings. To advance this area, in this work, we introduce a transferable framework employing Manifold Attention and Confidence Stratification (MACS) to diagnose neurodegenerative disorders based on EEG signals sourced from four centers with unreliable annotations. The MACS framework's effectiveness stems from these features: 1) The Augmentor generates various EEG-represented brain variants to enrich the data space; 2) The Switcher enhances the feature space for trusted samples and reduces overfitting on incorrectly labeled samples; 3) The Encoder uses the Riemannian manifold and Euclidean metrics to capture spatiotemporal variations and dynamic synchronization in EEG; 4) The Projector, equipped with dual heads, monitors consistency across multiple brain variants and ensures diagnostic accuracy; 5) The Stratifier adaptively stratifies learned samples by confidence levels throughout the training process; 6) Forward and backpropagation in MACS are constrained by confidence stratification to stabilize the learning system amid unreliable annotations. Our subject-independent experiments, conducted on both neurocognitive and movement disorders using cross-center corpora, have demonstrated superior performance compared to existing related algorithms. This work not only improves EEG-based diagnostics for cross-center and small-setting brain diseases but also offers insights into extending MACS techniques to other data analyses, tackling data heterogeneity and annotation unreliability in multimedia and multimodal content understanding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eduard Poesina, Cornelia Caragea, Radu Tudor Ionescu</p>
<p>Abstract: Natural language inference (NLI), the task of recognizing the entailment relationship in sentence pairs, is an actively studied topic serving as a proxy for natural language understanding. Despite the relevance of the task in building conversational agents and improving text classification, machine translation and other NLP tasks, to the best of our knowledge, there is no publicly available NLI corpus for the Romanian language. To this end, we introduce the first Romanian NLI corpus (RoNLI) comprising 58K training sentence pairs, which are obtained via distant supervision, and 6K validation and test sentence pairs, which are manually annotated with the correct labels. We conduct experiments with multiple machine learning methods based on distant learning, ranging from shallow models based on word embeddings to transformer-based neural networks, to establish a set of competitive baselines. Furthermore, we improve on the best model by employing a new curriculum learning strategy based on data cartography. Our dataset and code to reproduce the baselines are available at https://github.com/Eduard6421/RONLI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abraham Nash</p>
<p>Abstract: Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN) is a theoretical framework addressing data fragmentation and siloing challenges, enabling scalable AI through data sovereignty. It facilitates effective AI utilization within sovereign networks by overcoming barriers to accessing diverse data sources, leveraging: 1) personal data stores to ensure data sovereignty, where data remains securely within Participants' control; 2) a scalable federated learning protocol implemented on a public blockchain for decentralized AI training, where only model parameter updates are shared, keeping data within the personal data stores; and 3) a scalable, trustless cryptographic rewards mechanism on a public blockchain to incentivize participation and ensure fair reward distribution through a decentralized auditing protocol. This approach guarantees that no entity can prevent or control access to training data or influence financial benefits, as coordination and reward distribution are managed on the public blockchain with an immutable record. The framework supports effective AI training by allowing Participants to maintain control over their data, benefit financially, and contribute to a decentralized, scalable ecosystem that leverages collective AI to develop beneficial algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexis M. H. Teter, Wenqing Wang, Abhishek Halder</p>
<p>Abstract: Schr\"{o}dinger bridge--a stochastic dynamical generalization of optimal mass transport--exhibits a learning-control duality. Viewed as a stochastic control problem, the Schr\"{o}dinger bridge finds an optimal control policy that steers a given joint state statistics to another while minimizing the total control effort subject to controlled diffusion and deadline constraints. Viewed as a stochastic learning problem, the Schr\"{o}dinger bridge finds the most-likely distribution-valued trajectory connecting endpoint distributional observations, i.e., solves the two point boundary-constrained maximum likelihood problem over the manifold of probability distributions. Recent works have shown that solving the Schr\"{o}dinger bridge problem with state cost requires finding the Markov kernel associated with a reaction-diffusion PDE where the state cost appears as a state-dependent reaction rate. We explain how ideas from Weyl calculus in quantum mechanics, specifically the Weyl operator and the Weyl symbol, can help determine such Markov kernels. We illustrate these ideas by explicitly finding the Markov kernel for the case of quadratic state cost via Weyl calculus, recovering our earlier results but avoiding tedious computation with Hermite polynomials.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shi Lin, Rongchang Li, Xun Wang, Changting Lin, Wenpeng Xing, Meng Han</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has brought remarkable generative capabilities across diverse tasks. However, despite the impressive achievements, these LLMs still have numerous inherent vulnerabilities, particularly when faced with jailbreak attacks. By investigating jailbreak attacks, we can uncover hidden weaknesses in LLMs and inform the development of more robust defense mechanisms to fortify their security. In this paper, we further explore the boundary of jailbreak attacks on LLMs and propose Analyzing-based Jailbreak (ABJ). This effective jailbreak attack method takes advantage of LLMs' growing analyzing and reasoning capability and reveals their underlying vulnerabilities when facing analyzing-based tasks. We conduct a detailed evaluation of ABJ across various open-source and closed-source LLMs, which achieves 94.8% attack success rate (ASR) and 1.06 attack efficiency (AE) on GPT-4-turbo-0409, demonstrating state-of-the-art attack effectiveness and efficiency. Our research highlights the importance of prioritizing and enhancing the safety of LLMs to mitigate the risks of misuse. The code is publicly available at hhttps://github.com/theshi-1128/ABJ-Attack. Warning: This paper contains examples of LLMs that might be offensive or harmful.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammed Rakib, Adil Aman Mohammed, Cole Diggins, Sumit Sharma, Jeff Michael Sadler, Tyson Ochsner, Arun Bagavathi</p>
<p>Abstract: Soil moisture estimation is an important task to enable precision agriculture in creating optimal plans for irrigation, fertilization, and harvest. It is common to utilize statistical and machine learning models to estimate soil moisture from traditional data sources such as weather forecasts, soil properties, and crop properties. However, there is a growing interest in utilizing aerial and geospatial imagery to estimate soil moisture. Although these images capture high-resolution crop details, they are expensive to curate and challenging to interpret. Imagine, an AI-enhanced software tool that predicts soil moisture using visual cues captured by smartphones and statistical data given by weather forecasts. This work is a first step towards that goal of developing a multi-modal approach for soil moisture estimation. In particular, we curate a dataset consisting of real-world images taken from ground stations and their corresponding weather data. We also propose MIS-ME - Meteorological & Image based Soil Moisture Estimator, a multi-modal framework for soil moisture estimation. Our extensive analysis shows that MIS-ME achieves a MAPE of 10.14%, outperforming traditional unimodal approaches with a reduction of 3.25% in MAPE for meteorological data and 2.15% in MAPE for image data, highlighting the effectiveness of tailored multi-modal approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zikri Kholifah Nur, Rifki Wijaya, Gia Septiana Wulandari</p>
<p>Abstract: This research delves into the utilization of smartwatch sensor data and heart rate monitoring to discern individual emotions based on body movement and heart rate. Emotions play a pivotal role in human life, influencing mental well-being, quality of life, and even physical and physiological responses. The data were sourced from prior research by Juan C. Quiroz, PhD. The study enlisted 50 participants who donned smartwatches and heart rate monitors while completing a 250-meter walk. Emotions were induced through both audio-visual and audio stimuli, with participants' emotional states evaluated using the PANAS questionnaire. The study scrutinized three scenarios: viewing a movie before walking, listening to music before walking, and listening to music while walking. Personal baselines were established using DummyClassifier with the 'most_frequent' strategy from the sklearn library, and various models, including Logistic Regression and Random Forest, were employed to gauge the impacts of these activities. Notably, a novel approach was undertaken by incorporating hyperparameter tuning to the Random Forest model using RandomizedSearchCV. The outcomes showcased substantial enhancements with hyperparameter tuning in the Random Forest model, yielding mean accuracies of 86.63% for happy vs. sad and 76.33% for happy vs. neutral vs. sad.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in executing instructions for a variety of single-image tasks. Despite this progress, significant challenges remain in modeling long image sequences. In this work, we introduce the versatile multi-modal large language model, mPLUG-Owl3, which enhances the capability for long image-sequence understanding in scenarios that incorporate retrieved image-text knowledge, interleaved image-text, and lengthy videos. Specifically, we propose novel hyper attention blocks to efficiently integrate vision and language into a common language-guided semantic space, thereby facilitating the processing of extended multi-image scenarios. Extensive experimental results suggest that mPLUG-Owl3 achieves state-of-the-art performance among models with a similar size on single-image, multi-image, and video benchmarks. Moreover, we propose a challenging long visual sequence evaluation named Distractor Resistance to assess the ability of models to maintain focus amidst distractions. Finally, with the proposed architecture, mPLUG-Owl3 demonstrates outstanding performance on ultra-long visual sequence inputs. We hope that mPLUG-Owl3 can contribute to the development of more efficient and powerful multimodal large language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenyu Liu, Xinliang Zhou, Yihao Wu, Yi Ding, Liming Zhai, Kun Wang, Ziyu Jia, Yang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Compared to other modalities, electroencephalogram (EEG) based emotion recognition can intuitively respond to emotional patterns in the human brain and, therefore, has become one of the most focused tasks in affective computing. The nature of emotions is a physiological and psychological state change in response to brain region connectivity, making emotion recognition focus more on the dependency between brain regions instead of specific brain regions. A significant trend is the application of graphs to encapsulate such dependency as dynamic functional connections between nodes across temporal and spatial dimensions. Concurrently, the neuroscientific underpinnings behind this dependency endow the application of graphs in this field with a distinctive significance. However, there is neither a comprehensive review nor a tutorial for constructing emotion-relevant graphs in EEG-based emotion recognition. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of these studies, delivering a systematic review of graph-related methods in this field from a methodological perspective. We propose a unified framework for graph applications in this field and categorize these methods on this basis. Finally, based on previous studies, we also present several open challenges and future directions in this field.</p>
