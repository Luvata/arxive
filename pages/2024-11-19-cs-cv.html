<p><b>Authors:</b> Rongxin Ouyang, Kokil Jaidka, Subhayan Mukerjee, Guangyu Cui</p>
<p>Abstract: The prevalence of multi-modal content on social media complicates automated moderation strategies. This calls for an enhancement in multi-modal classification and a deeper understanding of understated meanings in images and memes. Although previous efforts have aimed at improving model performance through fine-tuning, few have explored an end-to-end optimization pipeline that accounts for modalities, prompting, labeling, and fine-tuning. In this study, we propose an end-to-end conceptual framework for model optimization in complex tasks. Experiments support the efficacy of this traditional yet novel framework, achieving the highest accuracy and AUROC. Ablation experiments demonstrate that isolated optimizations are not ineffective on their own.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinge Ma, Xiaoyan Zhang, Gautham Vinod, Siddeshwar Raghavan, Jiangpeng He, Fengqing Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Food portion estimation is crucial for monitoring health and tracking dietary intake. Image-based dietary assessment, which involves analyzing eating occasion images using computer vision techniques, is increasingly replacing traditional methods such as 24-hour recalls. However, accurately estimating the nutritional content from images remains challenging due to the loss of 3D information when projecting to the 2D image plane. Existing portion estimation methods are challenging to deploy in real-world scenarios due to their reliance on specific requirements, such as physical reference objects, high-quality depth information, or multi-view images and videos. In this paper, we introduce MFP3D, a new framework for accurate food portion estimation using only a single monocular image. Specifically, MFP3D consists of three key modules: (1) a 3D Reconstruction Module that generates a 3D point cloud representation of the food from the 2D image, (2) a Feature Extraction Module that extracts and concatenates features from both the 3D point cloud and the 2D RGB image, and (3) a Portion Regression Module that employs a deep regression model to estimate the food's volume and energy content based on the extracted features. Our MFP3D is evaluated on MetaFood3D dataset, demonstrating its significant improvement in accurate portion estimation over existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huancheng Chen, Jingtao Li, Weiming Zhuang, Haris Vikalo, Lingjuan Lyu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating high-resolution images from text but struggle with precise control over spatial composition and object counting. To address these challenges, several studies developed layout-to-image (L2I) approaches that incorporate layout instructions into text-to-image models. However, existing L2I methods typically require either fine-tuning pretrained parameters or training additional control modules for the diffusion models. In this work, we propose a novel zero-shot L2I approach, BACON (Boundary Attention Constrained generation), which eliminates the need for additional modules or fine-tuning. Specifically, we use text-visual cross-attention feature maps to quantify inconsistencies between the layout of the generated images and the provided instructions, and then compute loss functions to optimize latent features during the diffusion reverse process. To enhance spatial controllability and mitigate semantic failures in complex layout instructions, we leverage pixel-to-pixel correlations in the self-attention feature maps to align cross-attention maps and combine three loss functions constrained by boundary attention to update latent features. Comprehensive experimental results on both L2I and non-L2I pretrained diffusion models demonstrate that our method outperforms existing zero-shot L2I techniuqes both quantitatively and qualitatively in terms of image composition on the DrawBench and HRS benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xavier Bou, Gabriele Facciolo, Rafael Grompone von Gioi, Jean-Michel Morel, Thibaud Ehret</p>
<p>Abstract: Oriented object detection predicts orientation in addition to object location and bounding box. Precisely predicting orientation remains challenging due to angular periodicity, which introduces boundary discontinuity issues and symmetry ambiguities. Inspired by classical works on edge and corner detection, this paper proposes to represent orientation in oriented bounding boxes as a structure tensor. This representation combines the strengths of Gaussian-based methods and angle-coder solutions, providing a simple yet efficient approach that is robust to angular periodicity issues without additional hyperparameters. Extensive evaluations across five datasets demonstrate that the proposed structure tensor representation outperforms previous methods in both fully-supervised and weakly supervised tasks, achieving high precision in angular prediction with minimal computational overhead. Thus, this work establishes structure tensors as a robust and modular alternative for encoding orientation in oriented object detection. We make our code publicly available, allowing for seamless integration into existing object detectors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chaoqun Li, Huanqian Yan, Lifeng Zhou, Tairan Chen, Zhuodong Liu, Hang Su</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial attacks in the physical world pose a significant threat to the security of vision-based systems, such as facial recognition and autonomous driving. Existing adversarial patch methods primarily focus on improving attack performance, but they often produce patches that are easily detectable by humans and struggle to achieve environmental consistency, i.e., blending patches into the environment. This paper introduces a novel approach for generating adversarial patches, which addresses both the visual naturalness and environmental consistency of the patches. We propose Prompt-Guided Environmentally Consistent Adversarial Patch (PG-ECAP), a method that aligns the patch with the environment to ensure seamless integration into the environment. The approach leverages diffusion models to generate patches that are both environmental consistency and effective in evading detection. To further enhance the naturalness and consistency, we introduce two alignment losses: Prompt Alignment Loss and Latent Space Alignment Loss, ensuring that the generated patch maintains its adversarial properties while fitting naturally within its environment. Extensive experiments in both digital and physical domains demonstrate that PG-ECAP outperforms existing methods in attack success rate and environmental consistency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boyuan Jiang, Xiaobin Hu, Donghao Luo, Qingdong He, Chengming Xu, Jinlong Peng, Jiangning Zhang, Chengjie Wang, Yunsheng Wu, Yanwei Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: Although image-based virtual try-on has made considerable progress, emerging approaches still encounter challenges in producing high-fidelity and robust fitting images across diverse scenarios. These methods often struggle with issues such as texture-aware maintenance and size-aware fitting, which hinder their overall effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose a novel garment perception enhancement technique, termed FitDiT, designed for high-fidelity virtual try-on using Diffusion Transformers (DiT) allocating more parameters and attention to high-resolution features. First, to further improve texture-aware maintenance, we introduce a garment texture extractor that incorporates garment priors evolution to fine-tune garment feature, facilitating to better capture rich details such as stripes, patterns, and text. Additionally, we introduce frequency-domain learning by customizing a frequency distance loss to enhance high-frequency garment details. To tackle the size-aware fitting issue, we employ a dilated-relaxed mask strategy that adapts to the correct length of garments, preventing the generation of garments that fill the entire mask area during cross-category try-on. Equipped with the above design, FitDiT surpasses all baselines in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. It excels in producing well-fitting garments with photorealistic and intricate details, while also achieving competitive inference times of 4.57 seconds for a single 1024x768 image after DiT structure slimming, outperforming existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mathis Koroglu, Hugo Caselles-Dupr\'e, Guillaume Jeanneret Sanmiguel, Matthieu Cord</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of text-to-video generation tasks with precise control for various applications such as camera movement control and video-to-video editing. Most methods tacking this problem rely on providing user-defined controls, such as binary masks or camera movement embeddings. In our approach we propose OnlyFlow, an approach leveraging the optical flow firstly extracted from an input video to condition the motion of generated videos. Using a text prompt and an input video, OnlyFlow allows the user to generate videos that respect the motion of the input video as well as the text prompt. This is implemented through an optical flow estimation model applied on the input video, which is then fed to a trainable optical flow encoder. The output feature maps are then injected into the text-to-video backbone model. We perform quantitative, qualitative and user preference studies to show that OnlyFlow positively compares to state-of-the-art methods on a wide range of tasks, even though OnlyFlow was not specifically trained for such tasks. OnlyFlow thus constitutes a versatile, lightweight yet efficient method for controlling motion in text-to-video generation. Models and code will be made available on GitHub and HuggingFace.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> G. Thomas Hudson, Dean Slack, Thomas Winterbottom, Jamie Sterling, Chenghao Xiao, Junjie Shentu, Noura Al Moubayed</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal learning, which involves integrating information from various modalities such as text, images, audio, and video, is pivotal for numerous complex tasks like visual question answering, cross-modal retrieval, and caption generation. Traditional approaches rely on modality-specific encoders and late fusion techniques, which can hinder scalability and flexibility when adapting to new tasks or modalities. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel framework that extends the concept of task reformulation beyond natural language processing (NLP) to multimodal learning. We propose to reformulate diverse multimodal tasks into a unified next-frame prediction problem, allowing a single model to handle different modalities without modality-specific components. This method treats all inputs and outputs as sequential frames in a video, enabling seamless integration of modalities and effective knowledge transfer across tasks. Our approach is evaluated on a range of tasks, including text-to-text, image-to-text, video-to-video, video-to-text, and audio-to-text, demonstrating the model's ability to generalize across modalities with minimal adaptation. We show that task reformulation can significantly simplify multimodal model design across various tasks, laying the groundwork for more generalized multimodal foundation models.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10504">USP-Gaussian: Unifying Spike-based Image Reconstruction, Pose Correction and Gaussian Splatting</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Kang Chen, Jiyuan Zhang, Zecheng Hao, Yajing Zheng, Tiejun Huang, Zhaofei Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Spike cameras, as an innovative neuromorphic camera that captures scenes with the 0-1 bit stream at 40 kHz, are increasingly employed for the 3D reconstruction task via Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) or 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Previous spike-based 3D reconstruction approaches often employ a casecased pipeline: starting with high-quality image reconstruction from spike streams based on established spike-to-image reconstruction algorithms, then progressing to camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction. However, this cascaded approach suffers from substantial cumulative errors, where quality limitations of initial image reconstructions negatively impact pose estimation, ultimately degrading the fidelity of the 3D reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose a synergistic optimization framework, \textbf{USP-Gaussian}, that unifies spike-based image reconstruction, pose correction, and Gaussian splatting into an end-to-end framework. Leveraging the multi-view consistency afforded by 3DGS and the motion capture capability of the spike camera, our framework enables a joint iterative optimization that seamlessly integrates information between the spike-to-image network and 3DGS. Experiments on synthetic datasets with accurate poses demonstrate that our method surpasses previous approaches by effectively eliminating cascading errors. Moreover, we integrate pose optimization to achieve robust 3D reconstruction in real-world scenarios with inaccurate initial poses, outperforming alternative methods by effectively reducing noise and preserving fine texture details.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10508">DR-BFR: Degradation Representation with Diffusion Models for Blind Face Restoration</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinmin Qiu, Bonan Li, Zicheng Zhang, Congying Han, Tiande Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Blind face restoration (BFR) is fundamentally challenged by the extensive range of degradation types and degrees that impact model generalization. Recent advancements in diffusion models have made considerable progress in this field. Nevertheless, a critical limitation is their lack of awareness of specific degradation, leading to potential issues such as unnatural details and inaccurate textures. In this paper, we equip diffusion models with the capability to decouple various degradation as a degradation prompt from low-quality (LQ) face images via unsupervised contrastive learning with reconstruction loss, and demonstrate that this capability significantly improves performance, particularly in terms of the naturalness of the restored images. Our novel restoration scheme, named DR-BFR, guides the denoising of Latent Diffusion Models (LDM) by incorporating Degradation Representation (DR) and content features from LQ images. DR-BFR comprises two modules: 1) Degradation Representation Module (DRM): This module extracts degradation representation with content-irrelevant features from LQ faces and estimates a reasonable distribution in the degradation space through contrastive learning and a specially designed LQ reconstruction. 2) Latent Diffusion Restoration Module (LDRM): This module perceives both degradation features and content features in the latent space, enabling the restoration of high-quality images from LQ inputs. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed DR-BFR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and qualitatively across various datasets. The DR effectively distinguishes between various degradations in blind face inverse problems and provides a reasonably powerful prompt to LDM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Quang P. M. Pham, Khoi T. N. Nguyen, Lan C. Ngo, Dezhen Song, Truong Do, Truong Son Hy</p>
<p>Abstract: Scene graphs have proven to be highly effective for various scene understanding tasks due to their compact and explicit representation of relational information. However, current methods often overlook the critical importance of preserving symmetry when generating scene graphs from 3D point clouds, which can lead to reduced accuracy and robustness, particularly when dealing with noisy, multi-view data. This work, to the best of our knowledge, presents the first implementation of an Equivariant Scene Graph Neural Network (ESGNN) to generate semantic scene graphs from 3D point clouds, specifically for enhanced scene understanding. Furthermore, a significant limitation of prior methods is the absence of temporal modeling to capture time-dependent relationships among dynamically evolving entities within a scene. To address this gap, we introduce a novel temporal layer that leverages the symmetry-preserving properties of ESGNN to fuse scene graphs across multiple sequences into a unified global representation by an approximate graph-matching algorithm. Our combined architecture, termed the Temporal Equivariant Scene Graph Neural Network (TESGNN), not only surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in scene estimation accuracy but also achieves faster convergence. Importantly, TESGNN is computationally efficient and straightforward to implement using existing frameworks, making it well-suited for real-time applications in robotics and computer vision. This approach paves the way for more robust and scalable solutions to complex multi-view scene understanding challenges.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Po-han Li, Yunhao Yang, Mohammad Omama, Sandeep Chinchali, Ufuk Topcu</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous agents perceive and interpret their surroundings by integrating multimodal inputs, such as vision, audio, and LiDAR. These perceptual modalities support retrieval tasks, such as place recognition in robotics. However, current multimodal retrieval systems encounter difficulties when parts of the data are missing due to sensor failures or inaccessibility, such as silent videos or LiDAR scans lacking RGB information. We propose Any2Any-a novel retrieval framework that addresses scenarios where both query and reference instances have incomplete modalities. Unlike previous methods limited to the imputation of two modalities, Any2Any handles any number of modalities without training generative models. It calculates pairwise similarities with cross-modal encoders and employs a two-stage calibration process with conformal prediction to align the similarities. Any2Any enables effective retrieval across multimodal datasets, e.g., text-LiDAR and text-time series. It achieves a Recall@5 of 35% on the KITTI dataset, which is on par with baseline models with complete modalities.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a large-scale multi-modal dataset captured in and around well-known landmarks in Oxford using a custom-built multi-sensor perception unit as well as a millimetre-accurate map from a Terrestrial LiDAR Scanner (TLS). The perception unit includes three synchronised global shutter colour cameras, an automotive 3D LiDAR scanner, and an inertial sensor - all precisely calibrated. We also establish benchmarks for tasks involving localisation, reconstruction, and novel-view synthesis, which enable the evaluation of Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) methods, Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Multi-view Stereo (MVS) methods as well as radiance field methods such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting. To evaluate 3D reconstruction the TLS 3D models are used as ground truth. Localisation ground truth is computed by registering the mobile LiDAR scans to the TLS 3D models. Radiance field methods are evaluated not only with poses sampled from the input trajectory, but also from viewpoints that are from trajectories which are distant from the training poses. Our evaluation demonstrates a key limitation of state-of-the-art radiance field methods: we show that they tend to overfit to the training poses/images and do not generalise well to out-of-sequence poses. They also underperform in 3D reconstruction compared to MVS systems using the same visual inputs. Our dataset and benchmarks are intended to facilitate better integration of radiance field methods and SLAM systems.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mahmudul Hasan</p>
<p>Abstract: In computer vision tasks, the ability to focus on relevant regions within an image is crucial for improving model performance, particularly when key features are small, subtle, or spatially dispersed. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) typically treat all regions of an image equally, which can lead to inefficient feature extraction. To address this challenge, I have introduced Vision Eagle Attention, a novel attention mechanism that enhances visual feature extraction using convolutional spatial attention. The model applies convolution to capture local spatial features and generates an attention map that selectively emphasizes the most informative regions of the image. This attention mechanism enables the model to focus on discriminative features while suppressing irrelevant background information. I have integrated Vision Eagle Attention into a lightweight ResNet-18 architecture, demonstrating that this combination results in an efficient and powerful model. I have evaluated the performance of the proposed model on three widely used benchmark datasets: FashionMNIST, Intel Image Classification, and OracleMNIST, with a primary focus on image classification. Experimental results show that the proposed approach improves classification accuracy. Additionally, this method has the potential to be extended to other vision tasks, such as object detection, segmentation, and visual tracking, offering a computationally efficient solution for a wide range of vision-based applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaewoo Heo, Kuan-Chieh Wang, Karen Liu, Serena Yeung-Levy</p>
<p>Abstract: Motion capture technologies have transformed numerous fields, from the film and gaming industries to sports science and healthcare, by providing a tool to capture and analyze human movement in great detail. The holy grail in the topic of monocular global human mesh and motion reconstruction (GHMR) is to achieve accuracy on par with traditional multi-view capture on any monocular videos captured with a dynamic camera, in-the-wild. This is a challenging task as the monocular input has inherent depth ambiguity, and the moving camera adds additional complexity as the rendered human motion is now a product of both human and camera movement. Not accounting for this confusion, existing GHMR methods often output motions that are unrealistic, e.g. unaccounted root translation of the human causes foot sliding. We present DiffOpt, a novel 3D global HMR method using Diffusion Optimization. Our key insight is that recent advances in human motion generation, such as the motion diffusion model (MDM), contain a strong prior of coherent human motion. The core of our method is to optimize the initial motion reconstruction using the MDM prior. This step can lead to more globally coherent human motion. Our optimization jointly optimizes the motion prior loss and reprojection loss to correctly disentangle the human and camera motions. We validate DiffOpt with video sequences from the Electromagnetic Database of Global 3D Human Pose and Shape in the Wild (EMDB) and Egobody, and demonstrate superior global human motion recovery capability over other state-of-the-art global HMR methods most prominently in long video settings.</p>

It is thus of high interest to automate the forecasting process based on current market data. Even though applying machine learning (ML) to these data represents a promising approach to predict the residual value of certain tools, it is hard to implement for small and medium-sized enterprises due to their insufficient ML expertise. To this end, we demonstrate the possibility of substituting manually created ML pipelines with automated machine learning (AutoML) solutions, which automatically generate the underlying pipelines. We combine AutoML methods with the domain knowledge of the companies. Based on the CRISP-DM process, we split the manual ML pipeline into a machine learning and non-machine learning part. To take all complex industrial requirements into account and to demonstrate the applicability of our new approach, we designed a novel metric named method evaluation score, which incorporates the most important technical and non-technical metrics for quality and usability. Based on this metric, we show in a case study for the industrial use case of price forecasting, that domain knowledge combined with AutoML can weaken the dependence on ML experts for innovative small and medium-sized enterprises which are interested in conducting such solutions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Owen Burns, Rizwan Qureshi</p>
<p>Abstract: We address the issue of the exploding computational requirements of recent State-of-the-art (SOTA) open set multimodel 3D mapping (dense 3D mapping) algorithms and present Voxel-Aggregated Feature Synthesis (VAFS), a novel approach to dense 3D mapping in simulation. Dense 3D mapping involves segmenting and embedding sequential RGBD frames which are then fused into 3D. This leads to redundant computation as the differences between frames are small but all are individually segmented and embedded. This makes dense 3D mapping impractical for research involving embodied agents in which the environment, and thus the mapping, must be modified with regularity. VAFS drastically reduces this computation by using the segmented point cloud computed by a simulator's physics engine and synthesizing views of each region. This reduces the number of features to embed from the number of captured RGBD frames to the number of objects in the scene, effectively allowing a "ground truth" semantic map to be computed an order of magnitude faster than traditional methods. We test the resulting representation by assessing the IoU scores of semantic queries for different objects in the simulated scene, and find that VAFS exceeds the accuracy and speed of prior dense 3D mapping techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Miriam Asare-Baiden, Kathleen Jordan, Andrew Chung, Sharon Eve Sonenblum, Joyce C. Ho</p>
<p>Abstract: Pressure injury (PI) detection is challenging, especially in dark skin tones, due to the unreliability of visual inspection. Thermography has been suggested as a viable alternative as temperature differences in the skin can indicate impending tissue damage. Although deep learning models have demonstrated considerable promise toward reliably detecting PI, the existing work fails to evaluate the performance on darker skin tones and varying data collection protocols. In this paper, we introduce a new thermal and optical imaging dataset of 35 participants focused on darker skin tones where temperature differences are induced through cooling and cupping protocols. We vary the image collection process to include different cameras, lighting, patient pose, and camera distance. We compare the performance of a small convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on either the thermal or the optical images on all skin tones. Our preliminary results suggest that thermography-based CNN is robust to data collection protocols for all skin tones.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunsheng Ma, Burhaneddin Yaman, Xin Ye, Feng Tao, Abhirup Mallik, Ziran Wang, Liu Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: Bird's eye view (BEV)-based 3D perception plays a crucial role in autonomous driving applications. The rise of large language models has spurred interest in BEV-based captioning to understand object behavior in the surrounding environment. However, existing approaches treat perception and captioning as separate tasks, focusing on the performance of only one of the tasks and overlooking the potential benefits of multimodal alignment. To bridge this gap between modalities, we introduce MTA, a novel multimodal task alignment framework that boosts both BEV perception and captioning. MTA consists of two key components: (1) BEV-Language Alignment (BLA), a contextual learning mechanism that aligns the BEV scene representations with ground-truth language representations, and (2) Detection-Captioning Alignment (DCA), a cross-modal prompting mechanism that aligns detection and captioning outputs. MTA integrates into state-of-the-art baselines during training, adding no extra computational complexity at runtime. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and TOD3Cap datasets show that MTA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a 4.9% improvement in perception and a 9.2% improvement in captioning. These results underscore the effectiveness of unified alignment in reconciling BEV-based perception and captioning.</p>

<p>Abstract: The emergence and growing popularity of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have significant potential to enhance various aspects of daily life, from improving communication to facilitating learning and problem-solving. Mobile phones, as essential daily companions, represent the most effective and accessible deployment platform for MLLMs, enabling seamless integration into everyday tasks. However, deploying MLLMs on mobile phones presents challenges due to limitations in memory size and computational capability, making it difficult to achieve smooth and real-time processing without extensive optimization. In this paper, we present BlueLM-V-3B, an algorithm and system co-design approach specifically tailored for the efficient deployment of MLLMs on mobile platforms. To be specific, we redesign the dynamic resolution scheme adopted by mainstream MLLMs and implement system optimization for hardware-aware deployment to optimize model inference on mobile phones. BlueLM-V-3B boasts the following key highlights: (1) Small Size: BlueLM-V-3B features a language model with 2.7B parameters and a vision encoder with 400M parameters. (2) Fast Speed: BlueLM-V-3B achieves a generation speed of 24.4 token/s on the MediaTek Dimensity 9300 processor with 4-bit LLM weight quantization. (3) Strong Performance: BlueLM-V-3B has attained the highest average score of 66.1 on the OpenCompass benchmark among models with $\leq$ 4B parameters and surpassed a series of models with much larger parameter sizes (e.g., MiniCPM-V-2.6, InternVL2-8B).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziming Zhang, Yuping Shao, Yiqing Zhang, Fangzhou Lin, Haichong Zhang, Elke Rundensteiner</p>
<p>Abstract: Iterative methods such as iterative closest point (ICP) for point cloud registration often suffer from bad local optimality (e.g. saddle points), due to the nature of nonconvex optimization. To address this fundamental challenge, in this paper we propose learning to form the loss landscape of a deep iterative method w.r.t. predictions at test time into a convex-like shape locally around each ground truth given data, namely Deep Loss Convexification (DLC), thanks to the overparametrization in neural networks. To this end, we formulate our learning objective based on adversarial training by manipulating the ground-truth predictions, rather than input data. In particular, we propose using star-convexity, a family of structured nonconvex functions that are unimodal on all lines that pass through a global minimizer, as our geometric constraint for reshaping loss landscapes, leading to (1) extra novel hinge losses appended to the original loss and (2) near-optimal predictions. We demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance using DLC with existing network architectures for the tasks of training recurrent neural networks (RNNs), 3D point cloud registration, and multimodel image alignment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Berat Kurar-Barakat, Nachum Dershowitz</p>
<p>Abstract: The discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls over 60 years ago is widely regarded as one of the greatest archaeological breakthroughs in modern history. Recent study of the scrolls presents ongoing computational challenges, including determining the provenance of fragments, clustering fragments based on their degree of similarity, and pairing fragments that originate from the same manuscript -- all tasks that require focusing on individual letter and fragment shapes. This paper presents a computational method for segmenting ink and parchment regions in multispectral images of Dead Sea Scroll fragments. Using the newly developed Qumran Segmentation Dataset (QSD) consisting of 20 fragments, we apply multispectral thresholding to isolate ink and parchment regions based on their unique spectral signatures. To refine segmentation accuracy, we introduce an energy minimization technique that leverages ink contours, which are more distinguishable from the background and less noisy than inner ink regions. Experimental results demonstrate that this Multispectral Thresholding and Energy Minimization (MTEM) method achieves significant improvements over traditional binarization approaches like Otsu and Sauvola in parchment segmentation and is successful at delineating ink borders, in distinction from holes and background regions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinqiang Long, Yanqi Dai, Guoxing Yang, Hongpeng Lin, Nanyi Fei, Yizhao Gao, Zhiwu Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: As the research of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) becomes popular, an advancing MLLM model is typically required to handle various textual and visual tasks (e.g., VQA, Detection, OCR, and ChartQA) simultaneously for real-world applications. However, due to the significant differences in representation and distribution among data from various tasks, simply mixing data of all tasks together leads to the well-known``multi-task conflict" issue, resulting in performance degradation across various tasks. To address this issue, we propose Awaker2.5-VL, a Mixture of Experts~(MoE) architecture suitable for MLLM, which acquires the multi-task capabilities through multiple sparsely activated experts. To speed up the training and inference of Awaker2.5-VL, each expert in our model is devised as a low-rank adaptation (LoRA) structure. Extensive experiments on multiple latest benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of Awaker2.5-VL.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huan Kang, Hui Li, Tianyang Xu, Rui Wang, Xiao-Jun Wu, Josef Kittler</p>
<p>Abstract: Euclidean representation learning methods have achieved commendable results in image fusion tasks, which can be attributed to their clear advantages in handling with linear space. However, data collected from a realistic scene usually have a non-Euclidean structure, where Euclidean metric might be limited in representing the true data relationships, degrading fusion performance. To address this issue, a novel SPD (symmetric positive definite) manifold learning framework is proposed for multi-modal image fusion, named SPDFusion, which extends the image fusion approach from the Euclidean space to the SPD manifolds. Specifically, we encode images according to the Riemannian geometry to exploit their intrinsic statistical correlations, thereby aligning with human visual perception. Actually, the SPD matrix underpins our network learning, with a cross-modal fusion strategy employed to harness modality-specific dependencies and augment complementary information. Subsequently, an attention module is designed to process the learned weight matrix, facilitating the weighting of spatial global correlation semantics via SPD matrix multiplication. Based on this, we design an end-to-end fusion network based on cross-modal manifold learning. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our framework exhibits superior performance compared to the current state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10682">Underwater Image Enhancement with Cascaded Contrastive Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Liu, Qiuping Jiang, Xinyi Wang, Ting Luo, Jingchun Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Underwater image enhancement (UIE) is a highly challenging task due to the complexity of underwater environment and the diversity of underwater image degradation. Due to the application of deep learning, current UIE methods have made significant progress. Most of the existing deep learning-based UIE methods follow a single-stage network which cannot effectively address the diverse degradations simultaneously. In this paper, we propose to address this issue by designing a two-stage deep learning framework and taking advantage of cascaded contrastive learning to guide the network training of each stage. The proposed method is called CCL-Net in short. Specifically, the proposed CCL-Net involves two cascaded stages, i.e., a color correction stage tailored to the color deviation issue and a haze removal stage tailored to improve the visibility and contrast of underwater images. To guarantee the underwater image can be progressively enhanced, we also apply contrastive loss as an additional constraint to guide the training of each stage. In the first stage, the raw underwater images are used as negative samples for building the first contrastive loss, ensuring the enhanced results of the first color correction stage are better than the original inputs. While in the second stage, the enhanced results rather than the raw underwater images of the first color correction stage are used as the negative samples for building the second contrastive loss, thus ensuring the final enhanced results of the second haze removal stage are better than the intermediate color corrected results. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our CCL-Net can achieve superior performance compared to many state-of-the-art methods. The source code of CCL-Net will be released at https://github.com/lewis081/CCL-Net.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinhong Lin, Cheng-En Wu, Huanran Li, Jifan Zhang, Yu Hen Hu, Pedro Morgado</p>
<p>Abstract: Masked Image Modeling (MIM) has emerged as a powerful self-supervised learning paradigm for visual representation learning, enabling models to acquire rich visual representations by predicting masked portions of images from their visible regions. While this approach has shown promising results, we hypothesize that its effectiveness may be limited by optimization challenges during early training stages, where models are expected to learn complex image distributions from partial observations before developing basic visual processing capabilities. To address this limitation, we propose a prototype-driven curriculum leagrning framework that structures the learning process to progress from prototypical examples to more complex variations in the dataset. Our approach introduces a temperature-based annealing scheme that gradually expands the training distribution, enabling more stable and efficient learning trajectories. Through extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K, we demonstrate that our curriculum learning strategy significantly improves both training efficiency and representation quality while requiring substantially fewer training epochs compared to standard Masked Auto-Encoding. Our findings suggest that carefully controlling the order of training examples plays a crucial role in self-supervised visual learning, providing a practical solution to the early-stage optimization challenges in MIM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qixuan Jin, Walter Gerych, Marzyeh Ghassemi</p>
<p>Abstract: Spurious features associated with class labels can lead image classifiers to rely on shortcuts that don't generalize well to new domains. This is especially problematic in medical settings, where biased models fail when applied to different hospitals or systems. In such cases, data-driven methods to reduce spurious correlations are preferred, as clinicians can directly validate the modified images. While Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (Diffusion Models) show promise for natural images, they are impractical for medical use due to the difficulty of describing spurious medical features. To address this, we propose Masked Medical Image Inpainting (MaskMedPaint), which uses text-to-image diffusion models to augment training images by inpainting areas outside key classification regions to match the target domain. We demonstrate that MaskMedPaint enhances generalization to target domains across both natural (Waterbirds, iWildCam) and medical (ISIC 2018, Chest X-ray) datasets, given limited unlabeled target images.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose a novel and efficient logit distillation method, Multi-perspective Contrastive Logit Distillation (MCLD), which leverages contrastive learning to distill logits from multiple perspectives in knowledge distillation. Recent research on logit distillation has primarily focused on maximizing the information learned from the teacher model's logits to enhance the performance of the student model. To this end, we propose MCLD, which consists of three key components: Instance-wise CLD, Sample-wise CLD, and Category-wise CLD. These components are designed to facilitate the transfer of more information from the teacher's logits to the student model. Comprehensive evaluations on image classification tasks using CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, alongside representation transferability assessments on STL-10 and Tiny-ImageNet, highlight the significant advantages of our method. The knowledge distillation with our MCLD, surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ying Yang, De Cheng, Chaowei Fang, Yubiao Wang, Changzhe Jiao, Lechao Cheng, Nannan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised out-of-distribution (OOD) detection aims to identify out-of-domain data by learning only from unlabeled In-Distribution (ID) training samples, which is crucial for developing a safe real-world machine learning system. Current reconstruction-based methods provide a good alternative approach by measuring the reconstruction error between the input and its corresponding generative counterpart in the pixel/feature space. However, such generative methods face a key dilemma: improving the reconstruction power of the generative model while keeping a compact representation of the ID data. To address this issue, we propose the diffusion-based layer-wise semantic reconstruction approach for unsupervised OOD detection. The innovation of our approach is that we leverage the diffusion model's intrinsic data reconstruction ability to distinguish ID samples from OOD samples in the latent feature space. Moreover, to set up a comprehensive and discriminative feature representation, we devise a multi-layer semantic feature extraction strategy. By distorting the extracted features with Gaussian noise and applying the diffusion model for feature reconstruction, the separation of ID and OOD samples is implemented according to the reconstruction errors. Extensive experimental results on multiple benchmarks built upon various datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of detection accuracy and speed.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiawei Mao, Yu Yang, Xuesong Yin, Ling Shao, Hao Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Image restoration models often face the simultaneous interaction of multiple degradations in real-world scenarios. Existing approaches typically handle single or composite degradations based on scene descriptors derived from text or image embeddings. However, due to the varying proportions of different degradations within an image, these scene descriptors may not accurately differentiate between degradations, leading to suboptimal restoration in practical applications. To address this issue, we propose a novel Transformer-based restoration framework, AllRestorer. In AllRestorer, we enable the model to adaptively consider all image impairments, thereby avoiding errors from scene descriptor misdirection. Specifically, we introduce an All-in-One Transformer Block (AiOTB), which adaptively removes all degradations present in a given image by modeling the relationships between all degradations and the image embedding in latent space. To accurately address different variations potentially present within the same type of degradation and minimize ambiguity, AiOTB utilizes a composite scene descriptor consisting of both image and text embeddings to define the degradation. Furthermore, AiOTB includes an adaptive weight for each degradation, allowing for precise control of the restoration intensity. By leveraging AiOTB, AllRestorer avoids misdirection caused by inaccurate scene descriptors, achieving a 5.00 dB increase in PSNR compared to the baseline on the CDD-11 dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the development of digital imaging in medical microscopy, artificial intelligent-based analysis of pathological whole slide images (WSIs) provides a powerful tool for cancer diagnosis. Limited by the expensive cost of pixel-level annotation, current research primarily focuses on representation learning with slide-level labels, showing success in various downstream tasks. However, given the diversity of lesion types and the complex relationships between each other, these techniques still deserve further exploration in addressing advanced pathology tasks. To this end, we introduce the concept of hierarchical pathological image classification and propose a representation learning called PathTree. PathTree considers the multi-classification of diseases as a binary tree structure. Each category is represented as a professional pathological text description, which messages information with a tree-like encoder. The interactive text features are then used to guide the aggregation of hierarchical multiple representations. PathTree uses slide-text similarity to obtain probability scores and introduces two extra tree specific losses to further constrain the association between texts and slides. Through extensive experiments on three challenging hierarchical classification datasets: in-house cryosectioned lung tissue lesion identification, public prostate cancer grade assessment, and public breast cancer subtyping, our proposed PathTree is consistently competitive compared to the state-of-the-art methods and provides a new perspective on the deep learning-assisted solution for more complex WSI classification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongjin Lee, Hyeon-Mun Jeong, Yurim Jeon, Sanghyun Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-modal sensor fusion in bird's-eye-view (BEV) representation has become the leading approach in 3D object detection. However, existing methods often rely on depth estimators or transformer encoders for view transformation, incurring substantial computational overhead. Furthermore, the lack of precise geometric correspondence between 2D and 3D spaces leads to spatial and ray-directional misalignments, restricting the effectiveness of BEV representations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel 3D object detector via efficient view transformation (EVT), which leverages a well-structured BEV representation to enhance accuracy and efficiency. EVT focuses on two main areas. First, it employs Adaptive Sampling and Adaptive Projection (ASAP), using LiDAR guidance to generate 3D sampling points and adaptive kernels. The generated points and kernels are then used to facilitate the transformation of image features into BEV space and refine the BEV features. Second, EVT includes an improved transformer-based detection framework, which contains a group-wise query initialization method and an enhanced query update framework. It is designed to effectively utilize the obtained multi-modal BEV features within the transformer decoder. By leveraging the geometric properties of object queries, this framework significantly enhances detection performance, especially in a multi-layer transformer decoder structure. EVT achieves state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes test set with real-time inference speed.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10742">It Takes Two: Accurate Gait Recognition in the Wild via Cross-granularity Alignment</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinkai Zheng, Xinchen Liu, Boyue Zhang, Chenggang Yan, Jiyong Zhang, Wu Liu, Yongdong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing studies for gait recognition primarily utilized sequences of either binary silhouette or human parsing to encode the shapes and dynamics of persons during walking. Silhouettes exhibit accurate segmentation quality and robustness to environmental variations, but their low information entropy may result in sub-optimal performance. In contrast, human parsing provides fine-grained part segmentation with higher information entropy, but the segmentation quality may deteriorate due to the complex environments. To discover the advantages of silhouette and parsing and overcome their limitations, this paper proposes a novel cross-granularity alignment gait recognition method, named XGait, to unleash the power of gait representations of different granularity. To achieve this goal, the XGait first contains two branches of backbone encoders to map the silhouette sequences and the parsing sequences into two latent spaces, respectively. Moreover, to explore the complementary knowledge across the features of two representations, we design the Global Cross-granularity Module (GCM) and the Part Cross-granularity Module (PCM) after the two encoders. In particular, the GCM aims to enhance the quality of parsing features by leveraging global features from silhouettes, while the PCM aligns the dynamics of human parts between silhouette and parsing features using the high information entropy in parsing sequences. In addition, to effectively guide the alignment of two representations with different granularity at the part level, an elaborate-designed learnable division mechanism is proposed for the parsing features. Comprehensive experiments on two large-scale gait datasets not only show the superior performance of XGait with the Rank-1 accuracy of 80.5% on Gait3D and 88.3% CCPG but also reflect the robustness of the learned features even under challenging conditions like occlusions and cloth changes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeonghyeok Do, Munchurl Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: We firstly present a diffusion-based action recognition with zero-shot learning for skeleton inputs. In zero-shot skeleton-based action recognition, aligning skeleton features with the text features of action labels is essential for accurately predicting unseen actions. Previous methods focus on direct alignment between skeleton and text latent spaces, but the modality gaps between these spaces hinder robust generalization learning. Motivated from the remarkable performance of text-to-image diffusion models, we leverage their alignment capabilities between different modalities mostly by focusing on the training process during reverse diffusion rather than using their generative power. Based on this, our framework is designed as a Triplet Diffusion for Skeleton-Text Matching (TDSM) method which aligns skeleton features with text prompts through reverse diffusion, embedding the prompts into the unified skeleton-text latent space to achieve robust matching. To enhance discriminative power, we introduce a novel triplet diffusion (TD) loss that encourages our TDSM to correct skeleton-text matches while pushing apart incorrect ones. Our TDSM significantly outperforms the very recent state-of-the-art methods with large margins of 2.36%-point to 13.05%-point, demonstrating superior accuracy and scalability in zero-shot settings through effective skeleton-text matching.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chin-Wei Huang, Mu-Yi Shen, Kuan-Chang Shih, Shih-Chih Lin, Chi-Yu Chen, Po-Chih Kuo</p>
<p>Abstract: Chest X-rays (CXRs) often display various diseases with disparate class frequencies, leading to a long-tailed, multi-label data distribution. In response to this challenge, we explore the Pruned MIMIC-CXR-LT dataset, a curated collection derived from the MIMIC-CXR dataset, specifically designed to represent a long-tailed and multi-label data scenario. We introduce LTCXNet, a novel framework that integrates the ConvNeXt model, ML-Decoder, and strategic data augmentation, further enhanced by an ensemble approach. We demonstrate that LTCXNet improves the performance of CXR interpretation across all classes, especially enhancing detection in rarer classes like `Pneumoperitoneum' and `Pneumomediastinum' by 79\% and 48\%, respectively. Beyond performance metrics, our research extends into evaluating fairness, highlighting that some methods, while improving model accuracy, could inadvertently affect fairness across different demographic groups negatively. This work contributes to advancing the understanding and management of long-tailed, multi-label data distributions in medical imaging, paving the way for more equitable and effective diagnostic tools.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shitong Shao, Zikai Zhou, Tian Ye, Lichen Bai, Zhiqiang Xu, Zeke Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models (DMs) develop at an unprecedented pace, supported by thorough theoretical exploration and empirical analysis. Unfortunately, the discrepancy between DMs and autoregressive models (ARMs) complicates the path toward achieving the goal of unified vision and language generation. Recently, the masked generative Transformer (MGT) serves as a promising intermediary between DM and ARM by predicting randomly masked image tokens (i.e., masked image modeling), combining the efficiency of DM with the discrete token nature of ARM. However, we find that the comprehensive analyses regarding the inference for MGT are virtually non-existent, and thus we aim to present positive design choices to fill this gap. We modify and re-design a set of DM-based inference techniques for MGT and further elucidate their performance on MGT. We also discuss the approach to correcting token's distribution to enhance inference. Extensive experiments and empirical analyses lead to concrete and effective design choices, and these design choices can be merged to achieve further performance gains. For instance, in terms of enhanced inference, we achieve winning rates of approximately 70% compared to vanilla sampling on HPS v2 with the recent SOTA MGT Meissonic. Our contributions have the potential to further enhance the capabilities and future development of MGTs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeonghyeok Do, Jaehyup Lee, Munchurl Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery provides robust environmental and temporal coverage (e.g., during clouds, seasons, day-night cycles), yet its noise and unique structural patterns pose interpretation challenges, especially for non-experts. SAR-to-EO (Electro-Optical) image translation (SET) has emerged to make SAR images more perceptually interpretable. However, traditional approaches trained from scratch on limited SAR-EO datasets are prone to overfitting. To address these challenges, we introduce Confidence Diffusion for SAR-to-EO Translation, called C-DiffSET, a framework leveraging pretrained Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) extensively trained on natural images, thus enabling effective adaptation to the EO domain. Remarkably, we find that the pretrained VAE encoder aligns SAR and EO images in the same latent space, even with varying noise levels in SAR inputs. To further improve pixel-wise fidelity for SET, we propose a confidence-guided diffusion (C-Diff) loss that mitigates artifacts from temporal discrepancies, such as appearing or disappearing objects, thereby enhancing structural accuracy. C-DiffSET achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on multiple datasets, significantly outperforming the very recent image-to-image translation methods and SET methods with large margins.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yijian Gao, Dominic Marshall, Xiaodan Xing, Junzhi Ning, Giorgos Papanastasiou, Guang Yang, Matthieu Komorowski</p>
<p>Abstract: Radiology reporting generative AI holds significant potential to alleviate clinical workloads and streamline medical care. However, achieving high clinical accuracy is challenging, as radiological images often feature subtle lesions and intricate structures. Existing systems often fall short, largely due to their reliance on fixed size, patch-level image features and insufficient incorporation of pathological information. This can result in the neglect of such subtle patterns and inconsistent descriptions of crucial pathologies. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative approach that leverages pathology-aware regional prompts to explicitly integrate anatomical and pathological information of various scales, significantly enhancing the precision and clinical relevance of generated reports. We develop an anatomical region detector that extracts features from distinct anatomical areas, coupled with a novel multi-label lesion detector that identifies global pathologies. Our approach emulates the diagnostic process of radiologists, producing clinically accurate reports with comprehensive diagnostic capabilities. Experimental results show that our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on most natural language generation and clinical efficacy metrics, with formal expert evaluations affirming its potential to enhance radiology practice.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10794">Going Beyond Conventional OOD Detection</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sudarshan Regmi</p>
<p>Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical to ensure the safe deployment of deep learning models in critical applications. Deep learning models can often misidentify OOD samples as in-distribution (ID) samples. This vulnerability worsens in the presence of spurious correlation in the training set. Likewise, in fine-grained classification settings, detection of fine-grained OOD samples becomes inherently challenging due to their high similarity to ID samples. However, current research on OOD detection has largely ignored these challenging scenarios, focusing instead on relatively easier (conventional) cases. In this work, we present a unified Approach to Spurious, fine-grained, and Conventional OOD Detection (ASCOOD). First, we propose synthesizing virtual outliers from ID data by approximating the destruction of invariant features. We identify invariant features with the pixel attribution method using the model being learned. This approach eliminates the burden of curating external OOD datasets. Then, we simultaneously incentivize ID classification and predictive uncertainty towards the virtual outliers leveraging standardized feature representation. Our approach effectively mitigates the impact of spurious correlations and encourages capturing fine-grained attributes. Extensive experiments across six datasets demonstrate the merit of ASCOOD in spurious, fine-grained, and conventional settings. The code is available at: https://github.com/sudarshanregmi/ASCOOD/</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tripti Shukla, Srikrishna Karanam, Balaji Vasan Srinivasan</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of conditional text-to-image synthesis with diffusion models. Most recent works need to either finetune specific parts of the base diffusion model or introduce new trainable parameters, leading to deployment inflexibility due to the need for training. To address this gap in the current literature, we propose our method called TINTIN: Test-time Conditional Text-to-Image Synthesis using Diffusion Models which is a new training-free test-time only algorithm to condition text-to-image diffusion model outputs on conditioning factors such as color palettes and edge maps. In particular, we propose to interpret noise predictions during denoising as gradients of an energy-based model, leading to a flexible approach to manipulate the noise by matching predictions inferred from them to the ground truth conditioning input. This results in, to the best of our knowledge, the first approach to control model outputs with input color palettes, which we realize using a novel color distribution matching loss. We also show this test-time noise manipulation can be easily extensible to other types of conditioning, e.g., edge maps. We conduct extensive experiments using a variety of text prompts, color palettes, and edge maps and demonstrate significant improvement over the current state-of-the-art, both qualitatively and quantitatively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ting Liu, Liangtao Shi, Richang Hong, Yue Hu, Quanjun Yin, Linfeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The vision tokens in multimodal large language models usually exhibit significant spatial and temporal redundancy and take up most of the input tokens, which harms their inference efficiency. To solve this problem, some recent works were introduced to drop the unimportant tokens during inference where the importance of each token is decided only by the information in either the vision encoding stage or the prefilling stage. In this paper, we propose Multi-stage Token Dropping (MustDrop) to measure the importance of each token from the whole lifecycle, including the vision encoding stage, prefilling stage, and decoding stage. Concretely, in the visual encoding stage, MustDrop merges spatially adjacent tokens with high similarity, and establishes a key token set to retain the most vision-critical tokens, preventing them from being discarded in later stages. In the prefilling stage, MustDrop further compresses vision tokens by the guidance of text semantics, with a dual-attention filtering strategy. In the decoding stage, an output-aware cache policy is proposed to further reduce the size of the KV cache. By leveraging tailored strategies in the multi-stage process, MustDrop can more precisely recognize the important and redundant tokens, thus achieving an optimal balance between performance and efficiency. For instance, MustDrop reduces about 88.5\% FLOPs on LLaVA with a compression ratio of 92.2\% while maintaining comparable accuracy.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Donggyu Lee, Juhyeon Park, Taesup Moon</p>
<p>Abstract: While deep learning-based Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis has recently made significant advancements, particularly in predicting the conversion of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD based on MRI images, there remains a critical gap in research regarding the group robustness of the diagnosis. Although numerous studies pointed out that deep learning-based classifiers may exhibit poor performance in certain groups by relying on unimportant attributes, this issue has been largely overlooked in the early diagnosis of MCI to AD conversion. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive investigation of the group robustness in the early diagnosis of MCI to AD conversion using MRI images, focusing on disparities in accuracy between groups, specifically sMCI and pMCI individuals divided by age. Our experiments reveal that standard classifiers consistently underperform for certain groups across different architectures, highlighting the need for more tailored approaches. To address this, we propose a novel method, dubbed DEAL (DEcoupled classifier with Adaptive Linear modulation), comprising two key components: (1) a linear modulation of features from the penultimate layer, incorporating easily obtainable age and cognitive indicative tabular features, and (2) a decoupled classifier that provides more tailored decision boundaries for each group, further improving performance. Through extensive experiments and evaluations across different architectures, we demonstrate the efficacy of DEAL in improving the group robustness of the MCI to AD conversion prediction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiang Feng, Chang Yu, Zoubin Bi, Yintong Shang, Feng Gao, Hongzhi Wu, Kun Zhou, Chenfanfu Jiang, Yin Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent image-to-3D reconstruction models have greatly advanced geometry generation, but they still struggle to faithfully generate realistic appearance. To address this, we introduce ARM, a novel method that reconstructs high-quality 3D meshes and realistic appearance from sparse-view images. The core of ARM lies in decoupling geometry from appearance, processing appearance within the UV texture space. Unlike previous methods, ARM improves texture quality by explicitly back-projecting measurements onto the texture map and processing them in a UV space module with a global receptive field. To resolve ambiguities between material and illumination in input images, ARM introduces a material prior that encodes semantic appearance information, enhancing the robustness of appearance decomposition. Trained on just 8 H100 GPUs, ARM outperforms existing methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.</p>

Specifically, we carefully design a multi-scale control feature fusion network to construct a common motion representation for different conditions.

In addition, to reduce the flickering issues caused by large-scale motion, we propose a frequency-based stabilization module. It can enhance temporal coherence by ensuring the video's frequency domain consistency. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaisidh Singh, Sonam Singh, Amit Arvind Kale, Harsh K Gandhi</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for discovering systematic errors in segmentation models. For instance, a systematic error in the segmentation model can be a sufficiently large number of misclassifications from the model as a parking meter for a target class of pedestrians. With the rapid deployment of these models in critical applications such as autonomous driving, it is vital to detect and interpret these systematic errors. However, the key challenge is automatically discovering such failures on unlabelled data and forming interpretable semantic sub-groups for intervention. For this, we leverage multimodal foundation models to retrieve errors and use conceptual linkage along with erroneous nature to study the systematic nature of these errors. We demonstrate that such errors are present in SOTA segmentation models (UperNet ConvNeXt and UperNet Swin) trained on the Berkeley Deep Drive and benchmark the approach qualitatively and quantitatively, showing its effectiveness by discovering coherent systematic errors for these models. Our work opens up the avenue to model analysis and intervention that have so far been underexplored in semantic segmentation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiajie Fan, Babak Gholami, Thomas B\"ack, Hao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Boundary Representation (B-Rep) is the de facto representation of 3D solids in Computer-Aided Design (CAD). B-Rep solids are defined with a set of NURBS (Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines) surfaces forming a closed volume. To represent a surface, current works often employ the UV-grid approximation, i.e., sample points uniformly on the surface. However, the UV-grid method is not efficient in surface representation and sometimes lacks precision and regularity. In this work, we propose NeuroNURBS, a representation learning method to directly encode the parameters of NURBS surfaces. Our evaluation in solid generation and segmentation tasks indicates that the NeuroNURBS performs comparably and, in some cases, superior to UV-grids, but with a significantly improved efficiency: for training the surface autoencoder, GPU consumption is reduced by 86.7%; memory requirement drops by 79.9% for storing 3D solids. Moreover, adapting BrepGen for solid generation with our NeuroNURBS improves the FID from 30.04 to 27.24, and resolves the undulating issue in generated surfaces.</p>

<p>Abstract: Remote Sensing Visual Question Answering (RSVQA) is a challenging task that involves interpreting complex satellite imagery to answer natural language questions. Traditional approaches often rely on separate visual feature extractors and language processing models, which can be computationally intensive and limited in their ability to handle open-ended questions. In this paper, we propose a novel method that leverages a generative Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) to streamline the RSVQA process. Our approach consists of a two-step training strategy: domain-adaptive pretraining and prompt-based finetuning. This method enables the LVLM to generate natural language answers by conditioning on both visual and textual inputs, without the need for predefined answer categories. We evaluate our model on the RSVQAxBEN dataset, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Additionally, a human evaluation study shows that our method produces answers that are more accurate, relevant, and fluent. The results highlight the potential of generative LVLMs in advancing the field of remote sensing analysis.</p>

<p>Abstract: Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) plays a crucial role in computer vision, with significant applications in human-computer interaction, affective computing, and areas such as mental health monitoring and personalized learning environments. However, a major challenge in FER task is the class imbalance commonly found in available datasets, which can hinder both model performance and generalization. In this paper, we tackle the issue of data imbalance by incorporating synthetic data augmentation and leveraging the ResEmoteNet model to enhance the overall performance on facial emotion recognition task. We employed Stable Diffusion 2 and Stable Diffusion 3 Medium models to generate synthetic facial emotion data, augmenting the training sets of the FER2013 and RAF-DB benchmark datasets. Training ResEmoteNet with these augmented datasets resulted in substantial performance improvements, achieving accuracies of 96.47% on FER2013 and 99.23% on RAF-DB. These findings shows an absolute improvement of 16.68% in FER2013, 4.47% in RAF-DB and highlight the efficacy of synthetic data augmentation in strengthening FER models and underscore the potential of advanced generative models in FER research and applications.

<p>Abstract: Latest developments in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have broadened their capabilities to include video understanding. Specifically, Text-to-video (T2V) models have made significant progress in quality, comprehension, and duration, excelling at creating videos from simple textual prompts. Yet, they still frequently produce hallucinated content that clearly signals the video is AI-generated. We introduce ViBe: a large-scale Text-to-Video Benchmark of hallucinated videos from T2V models. We identify five major types of hallucination: Vanishing Subject, Numeric Variability, Temporal Dysmorphia, Omission Error, and Physical Incongruity. Using 10 open-source T2V models, we developed the first large-scale dataset of hallucinated videos, comprising 3,782 videos annotated by humans into these five categories. ViBe offers a unique resource for evaluating the reliability of T2V models and provides a foundation for improving hallucination detection and mitigation in video generation. We establish classification as a baseline and present various ensemble classifier configurations, with the TimeSFormer + CNN combination yielding the best performance, achieving 0.345 accuracy and 0.342 F1 score. This benchmark aims to drive the development of robust T2V models that produce videos more accurately aligned with input prompts.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the growing application of transformer in computer vision, hybrid architecture that combine convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers demonstrates competitive ability in medical image segmentation. However, direct fusion of features from CNNs and transformers often leads to feature imbalance and redundant information. To address these issues, we propose a Feaure Imbalance-Aware Segmentation (FIAS) network, which incorporates a dual-path encoder and a novel Mixing Attention (MixAtt) decoder. The dual-branches encoder integrates a DilateFormer for long-range global feature extraction and a Depthwise Multi-Kernel (DMK) convolution for capturing fine-grained local details. A Context-Aware Fusion (CAF) block dynamically balances the contribution of these global and local features, preventing feature imbalance. The MixAtt decoder further enhances segmentation accuracy by combining self-attention and Monte Carlo attention, enabling the model to capture both small details and large-scale dependencies. Experimental results on the Synapse multi-organ and ACDC datasets demonstrate the strong competitiveness of our approach in medical image segmentation tasks.</p>

Building upon recent advances in MariGold, DDVM and Depth Anything V2 respectively, our method combines latent diffusion, log-scaled metric depth representation, and synthetic data training. MetricGold achieves efficient training on a single RTX 3090 within two days using photo-realistic synthetic data from HyperSIM, VirtualKitti, and TartanAir.

<p>Abstract: Incorporating stochasticity into the training process of deep convolutional networks is a widely used technique to reduce overfitting and improve regularization. Existing techniques often require modifying the architecture of the network by adding specialized layers, are effective only to specific network topologies or types of layers - linear or convolutional, and result in a trained model that is different from the deployed one. We present ChannelDropBack, a simple stochastic regularization approach that introduces randomness only into the backward information flow, leaving the forward pass intact. ChannelDropBack randomly selects a subset of channels within the network during the backpropagation step and applies weight updates only to them. As a consequence, it allows for seamless integration into the training process of any model and layers without the need to change its architecture, making it applicable to various network topologies, and the exact same network is deployed during training and inference. Experimental evaluations validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating improved accuracy on popular datasets and models, including ImageNet and ViT.

<p>Abstract: While state-of-the-art models for breast cancer detection leverage multi-view mammograms for enhanced diagnostic accuracy, they often focus solely on visual mammography data. However, radiologists document valuable lesion descriptors that contain additional information that can enhance mammography-based breast cancer screening. A key question is whether deep learning models can benefit from these expert-derived features. To address this question, we introduce a novel multi-modal approach that combines textual BI-RADS lesion descriptors with visual mammogram content. Our method employs iterative attention layers to effectively fuse these different modalities, significantly improving classification performance over image-only models. Experiments on the CBIS-DDSM dataset demonstrate substantial improvements across all metrics, demonstrating the contribution of handcrafted features to end-to-end.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammadhamed Tangestanizadeh, Mohammad Dehghani Tezerjani, Saba Yousefian Jazi</p>
<p>Abstract: Lane detection involves identifying lanes on the road and accurately determining their location and shape. This is a crucial technique for modern assisted and autonomous driving systems. However, several unique properties of lanes pose challenges for detection methods. The lack of distinctive features can cause lane detection algorithms to be confused by other objects with similar appearances. Additionally, the varying number of lanes and the diversity in lane line patterns, such as solid, broken, single, double, merging, and splitting lines, further complicate the task. To address these challenges, Deep Learning (DL) approaches can be employed in various ways. Merging DL models with an attention mechanism has recently surfaced as a new approach. In this context, two deep learning-based lane recognition methods are proposed in this study. The first method employs the Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) model, delivering an impressive 87.59% accuracy in detecting road lanes. The second method, which incorporates attention layers into the U-Net model, significantly boosts the performance of semantic segmentation tasks. The advanced model, achieving an extraordinary 98.98% accuracy and far surpassing the basic U-Net model, clearly showcases its superiority over existing methods in a comparative analysis. The groundbreaking findings of this research pave the way for the development of more effective and reliable road lane detection methods, significantly advancing the capabilities of modern assisted and autonomous driving systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alessandro Fontanella, Petru-Daniel Tudosiu, Yongxin Yang, Shifeng Zhang, Sarah Parisot</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion generative models can generate high quality images at the cost of tedious prompt engineering. Controllability can be improved by introducing layout conditioning, however existing methods lack layout editing ability and fine-grained control over object attributes. The concept of multi-layer generation holds great potential to address these limitations, however generating image instances concurrently to scene composition limits control over fine-grained object attributes, relative positioning in 3D space and scene manipulation abilities. In this work, we propose a novel multi-stage generation paradigm that is designed for fine-grained control, flexibility and interactivity. To ensure control over instance attributes, we devise a novel training paradigm to adapt a diffusion model to generate isolated scene components as RGBA images with transparency information. To build complex images, we employ these pre-generated instances and introduce a multi-layer composite generation process that smoothly assembles components in realistic scenes. Our experiments show that our RGBA diffusion model is capable of generating diverse and high quality instances with precise control over object attributes. Through multi-layer composition, we demonstrate that our approach allows to build and manipulate images from highly complex prompts with fine-grained control over object appearance and location, granting a higher degree of control than competing methods.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10922">Exploiting VLM Localizability and Semantics for Open Vocabulary Action Detection</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Wentao Bao, Kai Li, Yuxiao Chen, Deep Patel, Martin Renqiang Min, Yu Kong</p>
<p>Abstract: Action detection aims to detect (recognize and localize) human actions spatially and temporally in videos. Existing approaches focus on the closed-set setting where an action detector is trained and tested on videos from a fixed set of action categories. However, this constrained setting is not viable in an open world where test videos inevitably come beyond the trained action categories. In this paper, we address the practical yet challenging Open-Vocabulary Action Detection (OVAD) problem. It aims to detect any action in test videos while training a model on a fixed set of action categories. To achieve such an open-vocabulary capability, we propose a novel method OpenMixer that exploits the inherent semantics and localizability of large vision-language models (VLM) within the family of query-based detection transformers (DETR). Specifically, the OpenMixer is developed by spatial and temporal OpenMixer blocks (S-OMB and T-OMB), and a dynamically fused alignment (DFA) module. The three components collectively enjoy the merits of strong generalization from pre-trained VLMs and end-to-end learning from DETR design. Moreover, we established OVAD benchmarks under various settings, and the experimental results show that the OpenMixer performs the best over baselines for detecting seen and unseen actions. We release the codes, models, and dataset splits at https://github.com/Cogito2012/OpenMixer.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Priyabrata Karmakar, Manzur Murshed, Shyh Wei Teng</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently hyperspectral imaging (HSI)-based grain quality assessment has gained research attention. However, unlike other imaging modalities, HSI data lacks sufficient labelled samples required to effectively train deep convolutional neural network (DCNN)-based classifiers. In this paper, we present a novel approach to grain quality assessment using HSI combined with few-shot learning (FSL) techniques. Traditional methods for grain quality evaluation, while reliable, are invasive, time-consuming, and costly. HSI offers a non-invasive, real-time alternative by capturing both spatial and spectral information. However, a significant challenge in applying DCNNs for HSI-based grain classification is the need for large labelled databases, which are often difficult to obtain. To address this, we explore the use of FSL, which enables models to perform well with limited labelled data, making it a practical solution for real-world applications where rapid deployment is required. We also explored the application of FSL for the classification of hyperspectral images of bulk grains to enable rapid quality assessment at various receival points in the grain supply chain. We evaluated the performance of few-shot classifiers in two scenarios: first, classification of grain types seen during training, and second, generalisation to unseen grain types, a crucial feature for real-world applications. In the first scenario, we introduce a novel approach using pre-computed collective class prototypes (CCPs) to enhance inference efficiency and robustness. In the second scenario, we assess the model's ability to classify novel grain types using limited support examples. Our experimental results show that despite using very limited labelled data for training, our FSL classifiers accuracy is comparable to that of a fully trained classifier trained using a significantly larger labelled database.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ni Ou, Zhuo Chen, Xinru Zhang, Junzheng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Cameras and LiDAR are essential sensors for autonomous vehicles. Camera-LiDAR data fusion compensate for deficiencies of stand-alone sensors but relies on precise extrinsic calibration. Many learning-based calibration methods predict extrinsic parameters in a single step. Driven by the growing demand for higher accuracy, a few approaches utilize multi-range models or integrate multiple methods to improve extrinsic parameter predictions, but these strategies incur extended training times and require additional storage for separate models. To address these issues, we propose a single-model iterative approach based on surrogate diffusion to significantly enhance the capacity of individual calibration methods. By applying a buffering technique proposed by us, the inference time of our surrogate diffusion is 43.7% less than that of multi-range models. Additionally, we create a calibration network as our denoiser, featuring both projection-first and encoding-first branches for effective point feature extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our diffusion model outperforms other single-model iterative methods and delivers competitive results compared to multi-range models. Our denoiser exceeds state-of-the-art calibration methods, reducing the rotation error by 24.5% compared to the second-best method. Furthermore, with the proposed diffusion applied, it achieves 20.4% less rotation error and 9.6% less translation error.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenjun Hou, Yi Cheng, Kaishuai Xu, Yan Hu, Wenjie Li, Jiang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Comprehensively understanding surgical scenes in Surgical Visual Question Answering (Surgical VQA) requires reasoning over multiple objects. Previous approaches address this task using cross-modal fusion strategies to enhance reasoning ability. However, these methods often struggle with limited scene understanding and question comprehension, and some rely on external resources (e.g., pre-extracted object features), which can introduce errors and generalize poorly across diverse surgical environments. To address these challenges, we propose SCAN, a simple yet effective memory-augmented framework that leverages Multimodal LLMs to improve surgical context comprehension via Self-Contained Inquiry. SCAN operates autonomously, generating two types of memory for context augmentation: Direct Memory (DM), which provides multiple candidates (or hints) to the final answer, and Indirect Memory (IM), which consists of self-contained question-hint pairs to capture broader scene context. DM directly assists in answering the question, while IM enhances understanding of the surgical scene beyond the immediate query. Reasoning over these object-aware memories enables the model to accurately interpret images and respond to questions. Extensive experiments on three publicly available Surgical VQA datasets demonstrate that SCAN achieves state-of-the-art performance, offering improved accuracy and robustness across various surgical scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Inpyo Song, Sanghyeon Lee, Minjun Joo, Jangwon Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in computer vision have led to a renewed interest in developing assistive technologies for individuals with visual impairments. Although extensive research has been conducted in the field of computer vision-based assistive technologies, most of the focus has been on understanding contexts in images, rather than addressing their physical safety and security concerns. To address this challenge, we propose the first step towards detecting anomalous situations for visually impaired people by observing their entire surroundings using an egocentric 360-degree camera. We first introduce a novel egocentric 360-degree video dataset called VIEW360 (Visually Impaired Equipped with Wearable 360-degree camera), which contains abnormal activities that visually impaired individuals may encounter, such as shoulder surfing and pickpocketing. Furthermore, we propose a new architecture called the FDPN (Frame and Direction Prediction Network), which facilitates frame-level prediction of abnormal events and identifying of their directions. Finally, we evaluate our approach on our VIEW360 dataset and the publicly available UCF-Crime and Shanghaitech datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyu Wu, Meher Gitika Karumuri, Chuhang Zou, Seungbae Bang, Yuelong Li, Dimitris Samaras, Sunil Hadap</p>
<p>Abstract: Current image-to-3D approaches suffer from high computational costs and lack scalability for high-resolution outputs. In contrast, we introduce a novel framework to directly generate explicit surface geometry and texture using multi-view 2D depth and RGB images along with 3D Gaussian features using a repurposed Stable Diffusion model. We introduce a depth branch into U-Net for efficient and high quality multi-view, cross-domain generation and incorporate epipolar attention into the latent-to-pixel decoder for pixel-level multi-view consistency. By back-projecting the generated depth pixels into 3D space, we create a structured 3D representation that can be either rendered via Gaussian splatting or extracted to high-quality meshes, thereby leveraging additional novel view synthesis loss to further improve our performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses existing baselines in geometry and texture quality while achieving significantly faster generation time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Su, Chen Wu, Zhuoran Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Ultra-high-definition (UHD) image restoration is vital for applications demanding exceptional visual fidelity, yet existing methods often face a trade-off between restoration quality and efficiency, limiting their practical deployment. In this paper, we propose TSFormer, an all-in-one framework that integrates \textbf{T}rusted learning with \textbf{S}parsification to boost both generalization capability and computational efficiency in UHD image restoration. The key is that only a small amount of token movement is allowed within the model. To efficiently filter tokens, we use Min-$p$ with random matrix theory to quantify the uncertainty of tokens, thereby improving the robustness of the model. Our model can run a 4K image in real time (40fps) with 3.38 M parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TSFormer achieves state-of-the-art restoration quality while enhancing generalization and reducing computational demands. In addition, our token filtering method can be applied to other image restoration models to effectively accelerate inference and maintain performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaodong Liu, Yucheng Xing, Xin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Reliable motion forecasting of surrounding agents is essential for ensuring the safe operation of autonomous vehicles. Many existing trajectory prediction methods rely heavily on high-definition (HD) maps as strong driving priors. However, the availability and accuracy of these priors are not guaranteed due to substantial costs to build, localization errors of vehicles, or ongoing road constructions. In this paper, we introduce MFTP, a Map-Free Trajectory Prediction method that offers several advantages. First, it eliminates the need for HD maps during inference while still benefiting from map priors during training via knowledge distillation. Second, we present a novel hierarchical encoder that effectively extracts spatial-temporal agent features and aggregates them into multiple trajectory queries. Additionally, we introduce an iterative decoder that sequentially decodes trajectory queries to generate the final predictions. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Argoverse dataset under the map-free setting.</p>

<p>Abstract: Modern autonomous vehicle perception systems often struggle with occlusions and limited perception range. Previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of cooperative perception in extending the perception range and overcoming occlusions, thereby improving the safety of autonomous driving. In recent years, a series of cooperative perception datasets have emerged. However, these datasets only focus on camera and LiDAR, overlooking 4D Radar, a sensor employed in single-vehicle autonomous driving for robust perception in adverse weather conditions. In this paper, to bridge the gap of missing 4D Radar datasets in cooperative perception, we present V2X-Radar, the first large real-world multi-modal dataset featuring 4D Radar. Our V2X-Radar dataset is collected using a connected vehicle platform and an intelligent roadside unit equipped with 4D Radar, LiDAR, and multi-view cameras. The collected data includes sunny and rainy weather conditions, spanning daytime, dusk, and nighttime, as well as typical challenging scenarios. The dataset comprises 20K LiDAR frames, 40K camera images, and 20K 4D Radar data, with 350K annotated bounding boxes across five categories. To facilitate diverse research domains, we establish V2X-Radar-C for cooperative perception, V2X-Radar-I for roadside perception, and V2X-Radar-V for single-vehicle perception. We further provide comprehensive benchmarks of recent perception algorithms on the above three sub-datasets.

<p>Abstract: The advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has enabled significant progress in multimodal understanding, expanding their capacity to analyze video content. However, existing evaluation benchmarks for MLLMs primarily focus on abstract video comprehension, lacking a detailed assessment of their ability to understand video compositions, the nuanced interpretation of how visual elements combine and interact within highly compiled video contexts. We introduce VidComposition, a new benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the video composition understanding capabilities of MLLMs using carefully curated compiled videos and cinematic-level annotations. VidComposition includes 982 videos with 1706 multiple-choice questions, covering various compositional aspects such as camera movement, angle, shot size, narrative structure, character actions and emotions, etc. Our comprehensive evaluation of 33 open-source and proprietary MLLMs reveals a significant performance gap between human and model capabilities.

<p>Abstract: Precision medicine is a promising approach for accessible disease diagnosis and personalized intervention planning in high-mortality diseases such as coronary artery disease (CAD), drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE), and chronic illnesses like Type 1 diabetes (T1D). By leveraging artificial intelligence (AI), precision medicine tailors diagnosis and treatment solutions to individual patients by explicitly modeling variance in pathophysiology. However, the adoption of AI in medical applications faces significant challenges, including poor generalizability across centers, demographics, and comorbidities, limited explainability in clinical terms, and a lack of trust in ethical decision-making. This paper proposes a framework to develop and ethically evaluate expert-guided multi-modal AI, addressing these challenges in AI integration within precision medicine. We illustrate this framework with case study on insulin management for T1D. To ensure ethical considerations and clinician engagement, we adopt a co-design approach where AI serves an assistive role, with final diagnoses or treatment plans emerging from collaboration between clinicians and AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nayeon Kim, Hongje Seong, Daehyun Ji, Sujin Jang</p>
<p>Abstract: Predicting and constructing road geometric information (e.g., lane lines, road markers) is a crucial task for safe autonomous driving, while such static map elements can be repeatedly occluded by various dynamic objects on the road. Recent studies have shown significantly improved vectorized high-definition (HD) map construction performance, but there has been insufficient investigation of temporal information across adjacent input frames (i.e., clips), which may lead to inconsistent and suboptimal prediction results. To tackle this, we introduce a novel paradigm of clip-level vectorized HD map construction, MapUnveiler, which explicitly unveils the occluded map elements within a clip input by relating dense image representations with efficient clip tokens. Additionally, MapUnveiler associates inter-clip information through clip token propagation, effectively utilizing long-term temporal map information. MapUnveiler runs efficiently with the proposed clip-level pipeline by avoiding redundant computation with temporal stride while building a global map relationship. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that MapUnveiler achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the nuScenes and Argoverse2 benchmark datasets. We also showcase that MapUnveiler significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in a challenging setting, achieving +10.7% mAP improvement in heavily occluded driving road scenes.

<p>Abstract: This paper presents EROAM, a novel event-based rotational odometry and mapping system that achieves real-time, accurate camera rotation estimation. Unlike existing approaches that rely on event generation models or contrast maximization, EROAM employs a spherical event representation by projecting events onto a unit sphere and introduces Event Spherical Iterative Closest Point (ES-ICP), a novel geometric optimization framework designed specifically for event camera data. The spherical representation simplifies rotational motion formulation while enabling continuous mapping for enhanced spatial resolution. Combined with parallel point-to-line optimization, EROAM achieves efficient computation without compromising accuracy. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that EROAM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. Our method maintains consistent performance under challenging conditions, including high angular velocities and extended sequences, where other methods often fail or show significant drift.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyue Zeng, Haoyuan Liu, Dingjie Peng, Luoxu Jing, Hiroshi Watanabe</p>
<p>Abstract: Currently, high-fidelity text-to-image models are developed in an accelerating pace. Among them, Diffusion Models have led to a remarkable improvement in the quality of image generation, making it vary challenging to distinguish between real and synthesized images. It simultaneously raises serious concerns regarding privacy and security. Some methods are proposed to distinguish the diffusion model generated images through reconstructing. However, the inversion and denoising processes are time-consuming and heavily reliant on the pre-trained generative model. Consequently, if the pre-trained generative model meet the problem of out-of-domain, the detection performance declines. To address this issue, we propose a universal synthetic image detector Time Step Generating (TSG), which does not rely on pre-trained models' reconstructing ability, specific datasets, or sampling algorithms. Our method utilizes a pre-trained diffusion model's network as a feature extractor to capture fine-grained details, focusing on the subtle differences between real and synthetic images. By controlling the time step t of the network input, we can effectively extract these distinguishing detail features. Then, those features can be passed through a classifier (i.e. Resnet), which efficiently detects whether an image is synthetic or real. We test the proposed TSG on the large-scale GenImage benchmark and it achieves significant improvements in both accuracy and generalizability.</p>

Although INRs facilitate effective compression, they are unsuitable for editing purposes. One potential solution is to use a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based model, such as the Video Gaussian Representation (VGR), which is capable of encoding video as a multitude of 3D Gaussians and is applicable for numerous video processing operations, including editing. Nevertheless, in this case, the capacity for modification is constrained to a limited set of basic transformations. To address this issue, we introduce the Video Gaussian Splatting (VeGaS) model, which enables realistic modifications of video data. To construct VeGaS, we propose a novel family of Folded-Gaussian distributions designed to capture nonlinear dynamics in a video stream and model consecutive frames by 2D Gaussians obtained as respective conditional distributions. Our experiments demonstrate that VeGaS outperforms state-of-the-art solutions in frame reconstruction tasks and allows realistic modifications of video data.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yin-Yin Bao, Er-Chao Li, Hong-Qiang Yang, Bin-Bin Jia</p>
<p>Abstract: In semiconductor manufacturing, wafer defect maps (WDMs) play a crucial role in diagnosing issues and enhancing process yields by revealing critical defect patterns. However, accurately categorizing WDM defects presents significant challenges due to noisy data, unbalanced defect classes, and the complexity of failure modes. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel method combining a self-encoder-based data augmentation technique with a convolutional neural network (CNN). By introducing noise into the latent space, the self-encoder enhances data diversity and mitigates class imbalance, thereby improving the model's generalization capabilities. The augmented dataset is subsequently used to train the CNN, enabling it to deliver precise classification of both common and rare defect patterns. Experimental results on the WM-811K dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a classification accuracy of 98.56%, surpassing Random Forest, SVM, and Logistic Regression by 19%, 21%, and 27%, respectively. These findings highlight the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed approach, offering a reliable solution for wafer defect detection and classification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chang Liu, Rui Li, Kaidong Zhang, Yunwei Lan, Dong Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements of generative AI have significantly promoted content creation and editing, where prevailing studies further extend this exciting progress to video editing. In doing so, these studies mainly transfer the inherent motion patterns from the source videos to the edited ones, where results with inferior consistency to user prompts are often observed, due to the lack of particular alignments between the delivered motions and edited contents. To address this limitation, we present a shape-consistent video editing method, namely StableV2V, in this paper. Our method decomposes the entire editing pipeline into several sequential procedures, where it edits the first video frame, then establishes an alignment between the delivered motions and user prompts, and eventually propagates the edited contents to all other frames based on such alignment. Furthermore, we curate a testing benchmark, namely DAVIS-Edit, for a comprehensive evaluation of video editing, considering various types of prompts and difficulties. Experimental results and analyses illustrate the outperforming performance, visual consistency, and inference efficiency of our method compared to existing state-of-the-art studies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tingyu Qu, Mingxiao Li, Tinne Tuytelaars, Marie-Francine Moens</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great success in understanding multi-modal contents. For video understanding tasks, training-based video LLMs are difficult to build due to the scarcity of high-quality, curated video-text paired data. In contrast, paired image-text data are much easier to obtain, and there is substantial similarity between images and videos. Consequently, extending image LLMs for video understanding tasks presents an appealing alternative. Developing effective strategies for compressing visual tokens from multiple frames is a promising way to leverage the powerful pre-trained image LLM. In this work, we explore the limitations of the existing compression strategies for building a training-free video LLM. The findings lead to our method TS-LLaVA, which constructs visual tokens through a Thumbnail-and-Sampling strategy. Given a video, we select few equidistant frames from all input frames to construct a Thumbnail image as a detailed visual cue, complemented by Sampled visual tokens from all input frames. Our method establishes the new state-of-the-art performance among training-free video LLMs on various benchmarks. Notably, our 34B model outperforms GPT-4V on the MVBench benchmark, and achieves performance comparable to the 72B training-based video LLM, Video-LLaMA2, on the challenging MLVU benchmark.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenjia Jiang, Xiaoke Zhu, Jiakang Gao, Di Liao</p>
<p>Abstract: Video-based visible-infrared person re-identification (VVI-ReID) is challenging due to significant modality feature discrepancies. Spatial-temporal information in videos is crucial, but the accuracy of spatial-temporal information is often influenced by issues like low quality and occlusions in videos. Existing methods mainly focus on reducing modality differences, but pay limited attention to improving spatial-temporal features, particularly for infrared videos. To address this, we propose a novel Skeleton-guided spatial-Temporal feAture leaRning (STAR) method for VVI-ReID. By using skeleton information, which is robust to issues such as poor image quality and occlusions, STAR improves the accuracy of spatial-temporal features in videos of both modalities. Specifically, STAR employs two levels of skeleton-guided strategies: frame level and sequence level. At the frame level, the robust structured skeleton information is used to refine the visual features of individual frames. At the sequence level, we design a feature aggregation mechanism based on skeleton key points graph, which learns the contribution of different body parts to spatial-temporal features, further enhancing the accuracy of global features. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that STAR outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Code will be open source soon.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdesselam Ferdi, Abdelmalik Taleb-Ahmed, Amir Nakib, Youcef Ferdi</p>
<p>Abstract: The demand for deploying deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) on resource-constrained devices for real-time applications remains substantial. However, existing state-of-the-art structured pruning methods often involve intricate implementations, require modifications to the original network architectures, and necessitate an extensive fine-tuning phase. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel method that, for the first time, incorporates the concepts of charge and electrostatic force from physics into the training process of DCNNs. The magnitude of this force is directly proportional to the product of the charges of the convolution filter and the source filter, and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. We applied this electrostatic-like force to the convolution filters, either attracting filters with opposite charges toward non-zero weights or repelling filters with like charges toward zero weights. Consequently, filters subject to repulsive forces have their weights reduced to zero, enabling their removal, while the attractive forces preserve filters with significant weights that retain information. Unlike conventional methods, our approach is straightforward to implement, does not require any architectural modifications, and simultaneously optimizes weights and ranks filter importance, all without the need for extensive fine-tuning. We validated the efficacy of our method on modern DCNN architectures using the MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet datasets, achieving competitive performance compared to existing structured pruning approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minhee Jang, Juheon Son, Thanaporn Viriyasaranon, Junho Kim, Jang-Hwan Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: The integration of deep learning technologies in medical imaging aims to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of cancer diagnosis, particularly for pancreatic and breast cancers, which present significant diagnostic challenges due to their high mortality rates and complex imaging characteristics. This paper introduces Diffusion-Driven Diagnosis (D-Cube), a novel approach that leverages hyper-features from a diffusion model combined with contrastive learning to improve cancer diagnosis. D-Cube employs advanced feature selection techniques that utilize the robust representational capabilities of diffusion models, enhancing classification performance on medical datasets under challenging conditions such as data imbalance and limited sample availability. The feature selection process optimizes the extraction of clinically relevant features, significantly improving classification accuracy and demonstrating resilience in imbalanced and limited data scenarios. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of D-Cube across multiple medical imaging modalities, including CT, MRI, and X-ray, showing superior performance compared to existing baseline models. D-Cube represents a new strategy in cancer detection, employing advanced deep learning techniques to achieve state-of-the-art diagnostic accuracy and efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xi Fang, Jiankun Wang, Xiaochen Cai, Shangqian Chen, Shuwen Yang, Lin Yao, Linfeng Zhang, Guolin Ke</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent decades, chemistry publications and patents have increased rapidly. A significant portion of key information is embedded in molecular structure figures, complicating large-scale literature searches and limiting the application of large language models in fields such as biology, chemistry, and pharmaceuticals. The automatic extraction of precise chemical structures is of critical importance. However, the presence of numerous Markush structures in real-world documents, along with variations in molecular image quality, drawing styles, and noise, significantly limits the performance of existing optical chemical structure recognition (OCSR) methods. We present MolParser, a novel end-to-end OCSR method that efficiently and accurately recognizes chemical structures from real-world documents, including difficult Markush structure. We use a extended SMILES encoding rule to annotate our training dataset. Under this rule, we build MolParser-7M, the largest annotated molecular image dataset to our knowledge. While utilizing a large amount of synthetic data, we employed active learning methods to incorporate substantial in-the-wild data, specifically samples cropped from real patents and scientific literature, into the training process. We trained an end-to-end molecular image captioning model, MolParser, using a curriculum learning approach. MolParser significantly outperforms classical and learning-based methods across most scenarios, with potential for broader downstream applications. The dataset is publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Deepa Anand, Bipul Das, Vyshnav Dangeti, Antony Jerald, Rakesh Mullick, Uday Patil, Pakhi Sharma, Prasad Sudhakar</p>
<p>Abstract: In a setting where segmentation models have to be built for multiple datasets, each with its own corresponding label set, a straightforward way is to learn one model for every dataset and its labels. Alternatively, multi-task architectures with shared encoders and multiple segmentation heads or shared weights with compound labels can also be made use of. This work proposes a novel label sharing framework where a shared common label space is constructed and each of the individual label sets are systematically mapped to the common labels. This transforms multiple datasets with disparate label sets into a single large dataset with shared labels, and therefore all the segmentation tasks can be addressed by learning a single model. This eliminates the need for task specific adaptations in network architectures and also results in parameter and data efficient models. Furthermore, label sharing framework is naturally amenable for incremental learning where segmentations for new datasets can be easily learnt. We experimentally validate our method on various medical image segmentation datasets, each involving multi-label segmentation. Furthermore, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in terms of performance and incremental learning ability vis-a-vis alternative methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yan Zheng, Zhenxiao Liang, Xiaoyan Cong, Lanqing guo, Yuehao Wang, Peihao Wang, Zhangyang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: We explore the oscillatory behavior observed in inversion methods applied to large-scale text-to-image diffusion models, with a focus on the "Flux" model. By employing a fixed-point-inspired iterative approach to invert real-world images, we observe that the solution does not achieve convergence, instead oscillating between distinct clusters. Through both toy experiments and real-world diffusion models, we demonstrate that these oscillating clusters exhibit notable semantic coherence. We offer theoretical insights, showing that this behavior arises from oscillatory dynamics in rectified flow models. Building on this understanding, we introduce a simple and fast distribution transfer technique that facilitates image enhancement, stroke-based recoloring, as well as visual prompt-guided image editing. Furthermore, we provide quantitative results demonstrating the effectiveness of our method for tasks such as image enhancement, makeup transfer, reconstruction quality, and guided sampling quality.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Raihan Kabir, Naznin Haque, Md Saiful Islam,  Marium-E-Jannat</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual question answering (VQA) refers to the problem where, given an image and a natural language question about the image, a correct natural language answer has to be generated. A VQA model has to demonstrate both the visual understanding of the image and the semantic understanding of the question, demonstrating reasoning capability. Since the inception of this field, a plethora of VQA datasets and models have been published. In this article, we meticulously analyze the current state of VQA datasets and models, while cleanly dividing them into distinct categories and then summarizing the methodologies and characteristics of each category. We divide VQA datasets into four categories: (1) available datasets that contain a rich collection of authentic images, (2) synthetic datasets that contain only synthetic images produced through artificial means, (3) diagnostic datasets that are specially designed to test model performance in a particular area, e.g., understanding the scene text, and (4) KB (Knowledge-Based) datasets that are designed to measure a model's ability to utilize outside knowledge. Concurrently, we explore six main paradigms of VQA models: fusion, where we discuss different methods of fusing information between visual and textual modalities; attention, the technique of using information from one modality to filter information from another; external knowledge base, where we discuss different models utilizing outside information; composition or reasoning, where we analyze techniques to answer advanced questions that require complex reasoning steps; explanation, which is the process of generating visual and textual descriptions to verify sound reasoning; and graph models, which encode and manipulate relationships through nodes in a graph. We also discuss some miscellaneous topics, such as scene text understanding, counting, and bias reduction.</p>

<p>Abstract: Robots need to perceive persons in their surroundings for safety and to interact with them. In this paper, we present a person segmentation and action classification approach that operates on 3D scans of hemisphere field of view LiDAR sensors. We recorded a data set with an Ouster OSDome-64 sensor consisting of scenes where persons perform three different actions and annotated it. We propose a method based on a MaskDINO model to detect and segment persons and to recognize their actions from combined spherical projected multi-channel representations of the LiDAR data with an additional positional encoding. Our approach demonstrates good performance for the person segmentation task and further performs well for the estimation of the person action states walking, waving, and sitting. An ablation study provides insights about the individual channel contributions for the person segmentation task. The trained models, code and dataset are made publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vincent van der Brugge, Marc Pollefeys, Joshua B. Tenenbaum, Ayush Tewari, Krishna Murthy Jatavallabhula</p>
<p>Abstract: Reconstructing compositional 3D representations of scenes, where each object is represented with its own 3D model, is a highly desirable capability in robotics and augmented reality. However, most existing methods rely heavily on strong appearance priors for object discovery, therefore only working on those classes of objects on which the method has been trained, or do not allow for object manipulation, which is necessary to scan objects fully and to guide object discovery in challenging scenarios. We address these limitations with a novel interaction-guided and class-agnostic method based on object displacements that allows a user to move around a scene with an RGB-D camera, hold up objects, and finally outputs one 3D model per held-up object. Our main contribution to this end is a novel approach to detecting user-object interactions and extracting the masks of manipulated objects. On a custom-captured dataset, our pipeline discovers manipulated objects with 78.3% precision at 100% recall and reconstructs them with a mean chamfer distance of 0.90cm. Compared to Co-Fusion, the only comparable interaction-based and class-agnostic baseline, this corresponds to a reduction in chamfer distance of 73% while detecting 99% fewer false positives.</p>

<p>Abstract: The advances in immersive technologies and 3D reconstruction have enabled the creation of digital replicas of real-world objects and environments with fine details. These processes generate vast amounts of 3D data, requiring more efficient compression methods to satisfy the memory and bandwidth constraints associated with data storage and transmission. However, the development and validation of efficient 3D data compression methods are constrained by the lack of comprehensive and high-quality volumetric video datasets, which typically require much more effort to acquire and consume increased resources compared to 2D image and video databases. To bridge this gap, we present an open multi-view volumetric human dataset, denoted BVI-CR, which contains 18 multi-view RGB-D captures and their corresponding textured polygonal meshes, depicting a range of diverse human actions. Each video sequence contains 10 views in 1080p resolution with durations between 10-15 seconds at 30FPS. Using BVI-CR, we benchmarked three conventional and neural coordinate-based multi-view video compression methods, following the MPEG MIV Common Test Conditions, and reported their rate quality performance based on various quality metrics. The results show the great potential of neural representation based methods in volumetric video compression compared to conventional video coding methods (with an up to 38\% average coding gain in PSNR). This dataset provides a development and validation platform for a variety of tasks including volumetric reconstruction, compression, and quality assessment.

<p>Abstract: Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) is an important yet challenging problem with applications across various domains including motion capture, augmented reality, and biomechanics. Accurately predicting human pose parameters from a single image remains a challenging 3D computer vision task. In this work, we introduce DeforHMR, a novel regression-based monocular HMR framework designed to enhance the prediction of human pose parameters using deformable attention transformers. DeforHMR leverages a novel query-agnostic deformable cross-attention mechanism within the transformer decoder to effectively regress the visual features extracted from a frozen pretrained vision transformer (ViT) encoder. The proposed deformable cross-attention mechanism allows the model to attend to relevant spatial features more flexibly and in a data-dependent manner. Equipped with a transformer decoder capable of spatially-nuanced attention, DeforHMR achieves state-of-the-art performance for single-frame regression-based methods on the widely used 3D HMR benchmarks 3DPW and RICH. By pushing the boundary on the field of 3D human mesh recovery through deformable attention, we introduce an new, effective paradigm for decoding local spatial information from large pretrained vision encoders in computer vision.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tiancheng Lin, Jinglei Zhang, Yi Xu, Kai Chen, Rui Zhang, Chang-Wen Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Context-aware methods have achieved remarkable advancements in supervised scene text recognition by leveraging semantic priors from words. Considering the heterogeneity of text and background in STR, we propose that such contextual priors can be reinterpreted as the relations between textual elements, serving as effective self-supervised labels for representation learning. However, textual relations are restricted to the finite size of the dataset due to lexical dependencies, which causes over-fitting problem, thus compromising the representation quality. To address this, our work introduces a unified framework of Relational Contrastive Learning and Masked Image Modeling for STR (RCMSTR), which explicitly models the enriched textual relations. For the RCL branch, we first introduce the relational rearrangement module to cultivate new relations on the fly. Based on this, we further conduct relational contrastive learning to model the intra- and inter-hierarchical relations for frames, sub-words and words.On the other hand, MIM can naturally boost the context information via masking, where we find that the block masking strategy is more effective for STR. For the effective integration of RCL and MIM, we also introduce a novel decoupling design aimed at mitigating the impact of masked images on contrastive learning. Additionally, to enhance the compatibility of MIM with CNNs, we propose the adoption of sparse convolutions and directly sharing the weights with dense convolutions in training. The proposed RCMSTR demonstrates superior performance in various evaluation protocols for different STR-related downstream tasks, outperforming the existing state-of-the-art self-supervised STR techniques. Ablation studies and qualitative experimental results further validate the effectiveness of our method.The code and pre-trained models will be available at https://github.com/ThunderVVV/RCMSTR .</p>

<p>Abstract: We study the connection between audio-visual observations and the underlying physics of a mundane yet intriguing everyday activity: pouring liquids. Given only the sound of liquid pouring into a container, our objective is to automatically infer physical properties such as the liquid level, the shape and size of the container, the pouring rate and the time to fill.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoxing Chen, Zizheng Huang, Yan Hong, Yanshuo Wang, Zhongcai Lyu, Zhuoer Xu, Jun Lan, Zhangxuan Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models provide a robust foundation for efficient transfer learning across various downstream tasks. In the field of video action recognition, mainstream approaches often introduce additional parameter modules to capture temporal information. While the increased model capacity brought by these additional parameters helps better fit the video-specific inductive biases, existing methods require learning a large number of parameters and are prone to catastrophic forgetting of the original generalizable knowledge. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective Multi-modal Spatio-Temporal Adapter (MSTA) to improve the alignment between representations in the text and vision branches, achieving a balance between general knowledge and task-specific knowledge. Furthermore, to mitigate over-fitting and enhance generalizability, we introduce a spatio-temporal description-guided consistency constraint. This constraint involves feeding template inputs (i.e., ``a video of $\{\textbf{cls}\}$'') into the trainable language branch, while LLM-generated spatio-temporal descriptions are input into the pre-trained language branch, enforcing consistency between the outputs of the two branches. This mechanism prevents over-fitting to downstream tasks and improves the distinguishability of the trainable branch within the spatio-temporal semantic space. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach across four tasks: zero-shot transfer, few-shot learning, base-to-novel generalization, and fully-supervised learning. Compared to many state-of-the-art methods, our MSTA achieves outstanding performance across all evaluations, while using only 2-7\% of the trainable parameters in the original model.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qianwen Lu, Xingchao Yang, Takafumi Taketomi</p>
<p>Abstract: The advancement of makeup transfer, editing, and image encoding has demonstrated their effectiveness and superior quality. However, existing makeup works primarily focus on low-dimensional features such as color distributions and patterns, limiting their versatillity across a wide range of makeup applications. Futhermore, existing high-dimensional latent encoding methods mainly target global features such as structure and style, and are less effective for tasks that require detailed attention to local color and pattern features of makeup. To overcome these limitations, we propose BeautyBank, a novel makeup encoder that disentangles pattern features of bare and makeup faces. Our method encodes makeup features into a high-dimensional space, preserving essential details necessary for makeup reconstruction and broadening the scope of potential makeup research applications. We also propose a Progressive Makeup Tuning (PMT) strategy, specifically designed to enhance the preservation of detailed makeup features while preventing the inclusion of irrelevant attributes. We further explore novel makeup applications, including facial image generation with makeup injection and makeup similarity measure. Extensive empirical experiments validate that our method offers superior task adaptability and holds significant potential for widespread application in various makeup-related fields. Furthermore, to address the lack of large-scale, high-quality paired makeup datasets in the field, we constructed the Bare-Makeup Synthesis Dataset (BMS), comprising 324,000 pairs of 512x512 pixel images of bare and makeup-enhanced faces.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sami Arja, Alexandre Marcireau, Nicholas Owen Ralph, Saeed Afshar, Gregory Cohen</p>
<p>Abstract: Event cameras capture sparse, asynchronous brightness changes which offer high temporal resolution, high dynamic range, low power consumption, and sparse data output. These advantages make them ideal for Space Situational Awareness, particularly in detecting resident space objects moving within a telescope's field of view. However, the output from event cameras often includes substantial background activity noise, which is known to be more prevalent in low-light conditions. This noise can overwhelm the sparse events generated by satellite signals, making detection and tracking more challenging. Existing noise-filtering algorithms struggle in these scenarios because they are typically designed for denser scenes, where losing some signal is acceptable. This limitation hinders the application of event cameras in complex, real-world environments where signals are extremely sparse. In this paper, we propose new event-driven noise-filtering algorithms specifically designed for very sparse scenes. We categorise the algorithms into logical-based and learning-based approaches and benchmark their performance against 11 state-of-the-art noise-filtering algorithms, evaluating how effectively they remove noise and hot pixels while preserving the signal. Their performance was quantified by measuring signal retention and noise removal accuracy, with results reported using ROC curves across the parameter space. Additionally, we introduce a new high-resolution satellite dataset with ground truth from a real-world platform under various noise conditions, which we have made publicly available.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingming Long, Jie Zhang, Shiguang Shan, Xilin Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: The primary goal of out-of-distribution (OOD) detection tasks is to identify inputs with semantic shifts, i.e., if samples from novel classes are absent in the in-distribution (ID) dataset used for training, we should reject these OOD samples rather than misclassifying them into existing ID classes. However, we find the current definition of "semantic shift" is ambiguous, which renders certain OOD testing protocols intractable for the post-hoc OOD detection methods based on a classifier trained on the ID dataset. In this paper, we offer a more precise definition of the Semantic Space and the Covariate Space for the ID distribution, allowing us to theoretically analyze which types of OOD distributions make the detection task intractable. To avoid the flaw in the existing OOD settings, we further define the "Tractable OOD" setting which ensures the distinguishability of OOD and ID distributions for the post-hoc OOD detection methods. Finally, we conduct several experiments to demonstrate the necessity of our definitions and validate the correctness of our theorems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yonghuang Wu, Xuan Xie, Xinyuan Niu, Chengqian Zhao, Jinhua Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Pathology computing has dramatically improved pathologists' workflow and diagnostic decision-making processes. Although computer-aided diagnostic systems have shown considerable value in whole slide image (WSI) analysis, the problem of multi-classification under sample imbalance remains an intractable challenge. To address this, we propose learning fine-grained information by generating sub-bags with feature distributions similar to the original WSIs. Additionally, we utilize a pseudo-bag generation algorithm to further leverage the abundant and redundant information in WSIs, allowing efficient training in unbalanced-sample multi-classification tasks. Furthermore, we introduce an affinity-based sample selection and curriculum contrastive learning strategy to enhance the stability of model representation learning. Unlike previous approaches, our framework transitions from learning bag-level representations to understanding and exploiting the feature distribution of multi-instance bags. Our method demonstrates significant performance improvements on three datasets, including tumor classification and lymph node metastasis. On average, it achieves a 4.39-point improvement in F1 score compared to the second-best method across the three tasks, underscoring its superior performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinxing Zhou, Dan Guo, Ruohao Guo, Yuxin Mao, Jingjing Hu, Yiran Zhong, Xiaojun Chang, Meng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The Audio-Visual Event Localization (AVEL) task aims to temporally locate and classify video events that are both audible and visible. Most research in this field assumes a closed-set setting, which restricts these models' ability to handle test data containing event categories absent (unseen) during training. Recently, a few studies have explored AVEL in an open-set setting, enabling the recognition of unseen events as ``unknown'', but without providing category-specific semantics. In this paper, we advance the field by introducing the Open-Vocabulary Audio-Visual Event Localization (OV-AVEL) problem, which requires localizing audio-visual events and predicting explicit categories for both seen and unseen data at inference. To address this new task, we propose the OV-AVEBench dataset, comprising 24,800 videos across 67 real-life audio-visual scenes (seen:unseen = 46:21), each with manual segment-level annotation. We also establish three evaluation metrics for this task. Moreover, we investigate two baseline approaches, one training-free and one using a further fine-tuning paradigm. Specifically, we utilize the unified multimodal space from the pretrained ImageBind model to extract audio, visual, and textual (event classes) features. The training-free baseline then determines predictions by comparing the consistency of audio-text and visual-text feature similarities. The fine-tuning baseline incorporates lightweight temporal layers to encode temporal relations within the audio and visual modalities, using OV-AVEBench training data for model fine-tuning. We evaluate these baselines on the proposed OV-AVEBench dataset and discuss potential directions for future work in this new field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ranjan Sapkota, Achyut Paudel, Manoj Karkee</p>
<p>Abstract: Currently, deep learning-based instance segmentation for various applications (e.g., Agriculture) is predominantly performed using a labor-intensive process involving extensive field data collection using sophisticated sensors, followed by careful manual annotation of images, presenting significant logistical and financial challenges to researchers and organizations. The process also slows down the model development and training process. In this study, we presented a novel method for deep learning-based instance segmentation of apples in commercial orchards that eliminates the need for labor-intensive field data collection and manual annotation. Utilizing a Large Language Model (LLM), we synthetically generated orchard images and automatically annotated them using the Segment Anything Model (SAM) integrated with a YOLO11 base model. This method significantly reduces reliance on physical sensors and manual data processing, presenting a major advancement in "Agricultural AI". The synthetic, auto-annotated dataset was used to train the YOLO11 model for Apple instance segmentation, which was then validated on real orchard images. The results showed that the automatically generated annotations achieved a Dice Coefficient of 0.9513 and an IoU of 0.9303, validating the accuracy and overlap of the mask annotations. All YOLO11 configurations, trained solely on these synthetic datasets with automated annotations, accurately recognized and delineated apples, highlighting the method's efficacy. Specifically, the YOLO11m-seg configuration achieved a mask precision of 0.902 and a mask mAP@50 of 0.833 on test images collected from a commercial orchard. Additionally, the YOLO11l-seg configuration outperformed other models in validation on 40 LLM-generated images, achieving the highest mask precision and mAP@50 metrics.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Scarlett Raine, Frederic Maire, Niko Suenderhauf, Tobias Fischer</p>
<p>Abstract: Underwater surveys provide long-term data for informing management strategies, monitoring coral reef health, and estimating blue carbon stocks. Advances in broad-scale survey methods, such as robotic underwater vehicles, have increased the range of marine surveys but generate large volumes of imagery requiring analysis. Computer vision methods such as semantic segmentation aid automated image analysis, but typically rely on fully supervised training with extensive labelled data. While ground truth label masks for tasks like street scene segmentation can be quickly and affordably generated by non-experts through crowdsourcing services like Amazon Mechanical Turk, ecology presents greater challenges. The complexity of underwater images, coupled with the specialist expertise needed to accurately identify species at the pixel level, makes this process costly, time-consuming, and heavily dependent on domain experts. In recent years, some works have performed automated analysis of underwater imagery, and a smaller number of studies have focused on weakly supervised approaches which aim to reduce the expert-provided labelled data required. This survey focuses on approaches which reduce dependency on human expert input, while reviewing the prior and related approaches to position these works in the wider field of underwater perception. Further, we offer an overview of coastal ecosystems and the challenges of underwater imagery. We provide background on weakly and self-supervised deep learning and integrate these elements into a taxonomy that centres on the intersection of underwater monitoring, computer vision, and deep learning, while motivating approaches for weakly supervised deep learning with reduced dependency on domain expert data annotations. Lastly, the survey examines available datasets and platforms, and identifies gaps, barriers, and opportunities for automating underwater surveys.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Chen, Jingcai Guo, Song Guo, Dacheng Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: Zero-shot skeleton action recognition is a non-trivial task that requires robust unseen generalization with prior knowledge from only seen classes and shared semantics. Existing methods typically build the skeleton-semantics interactions by uncontrollable mappings and conspicuous representations, thereby can hardly capture the intricate and fine-grained relationship for effective cross-modal transferability. To address these issues, we propose a novel dyNamically Evolving dUal skeleton-semantic syneRgistic framework with the guidance of cOntext-aware side informatioN (dubbed Neuron), to explore more fine-grained cross-modal correspondence from micro to macro perspectives at both spatial and temporal levels, respectively. Concretely, 1) we first construct the spatial-temporal evolving micro-prototypes and integrate dynamic context-aware side information to capture the intricate and synergistic skeleton-semantic correlations step-by-step, progressively refining cross-model alignment; and 2) we introduce the spatial compression and temporal memory mechanisms to guide the growth of spatial-temporal micro-prototypes, enabling them to absorb structure-related spatial representations and regularity-dependent temporal patterns. Notably, such processes are analogous to the learning and growth of neurons, equipping the framework with the capacity to generalize to novel unseen action categories. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets demonstrated the superiority of the proposed method.</p>

<p>Abstract: The advancement of medical image segmentation techniques has been propelled by the adoption of deep learning techniques, particularly UNet-based approaches, which exploit semantic information to improve the accuracy of segmentations. However, the order of organs in scanned images has been disregarded by current medical image segmentation approaches based on UNet. Furthermore, the inherent network structure of UNet does not provide direct capabilities for integrating temporal information. To efficiently integrate temporal information, we propose TP-UNet that utilizes temporal prompts, encompassing organ-construction relationships, to guide the segmentation UNet model. Specifically, our framework is featured with cross-attention and semantic alignment based on unsupervised contrastive learning to combine temporal prompts and image features effectively. Extensive evaluations on two medical image segmentation datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of TP-UNet. Our implementation will be open-sourced after acceptance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bowen Yuan, Zijian Wang, Yadan Luo, Mahsa Baktashmotlagh, Yadan Luo, Zi Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Dataset Distillation (DD) is designed to generate condensed representations of extensive image datasets, enhancing training efficiency. Despite recent advances, there remains considerable potential for improvement, particularly in addressing the notable redundancy within the color space of distilled images. In this paper, we propose AutoPalette, a framework that minimizes color redundancy at the individual image and overall dataset levels, respectively. At the image level, we employ a palette network, a specialized neural network, to dynamically allocate colors from a reduced color space to each pixel. The palette network identifies essential areas in synthetic images for model training and consequently assigns more unique colors to them. At the dataset level, we develop a color-guided initialization strategy to minimize redundancy among images. Representative images with the least replicated color patterns are selected based on the information gain. A comprehensive performance study involving various datasets and evaluation scenarios is conducted, demonstrating the superior performance of our proposed color-aware DD compared to existing DD methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanyu Guo, Wanchuan Yu, Suzhou Que, Kaiwen Du, Yan Yan, Hanzi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, few-shot action recognition has achieved remarkable performance through spatio-temporal relation modeling. Although a wide range of spatial and temporal alignment modules have been proposed, they primarily address spatial or temporal misalignments at the video level, while the spatio-temporal relationships across different videos at the task level remain underexplored. Recent studies utilize class prototypes to learn task-specific features but overlook the spatio-temporal relationships across different videos at the task level, especially in the spatial dimension, where these relationships provide rich information. In this paper, we propose a novel Dual Motion-Guided Attention Learning method (called DMGAL) for few-shot action recognition, aiming to learn the spatio-temporal relationships from the video-specific to the task-specific level. To achieve this, we propose a carefully designed Motion-Guided Attention (MGA) method to identify and correlate motion-related region features from the video level to the task level. Specifically, the Self Motion-Guided Attention module (S-MGA) achieves spatio-temporal relation modeling at the video level by identifying and correlating motion-related region features between different frames within a video. The Cross Motion-Guided Attention module (C-MGA) identifies and correlates motion-related region features between frames of different videos within a specific task to achieve spatio-temporal relationships at the task level. This approach enables the model to construct class prototypes that fully incorporate spatio-temporal relationships from the video-specific level to the task-specific level. We validate the effectiveness of our DMGAL method by employing both fully fine-tuning and adapter-tuning paradigms. The models developed using these paradigms are termed DMGAL-FT and DMGAL-Adapter, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qinglong Cao, Ding Wang, Xirui Li, Yuntian Chen, Chao Ma, Xiaokang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Video diffusion models have exhibited tremendous progress in various video generation tasks. However, existing models struggle to capture latent physical knowledge, failing to infer physical phenomena that are challenging to articulate with natural language. Generating videos following the fundamental physical laws is still an opening challenge. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method to teach video diffusion models with latent physical phenomenon knowledge, enabling the accurate generation of physically informed phenomena. Specifically, we first pretrain Masked Autoencoders (MAE) to reconstruct the physical phenomena, resulting in output embeddings that encapsulate latent physical phenomenon knowledge. Leveraging these embeddings, we could generate the pseudo-language prompt features based on the aligned spatial relationships between CLIP vision and language encoders. Particularly, given that diffusion models typically use CLIP's language encoder for text prompt embeddings, our approach integrates the CLIP visual features informed by latent physical knowledge into a quaternion hidden space. This enables the modeling of spatial relationships to produce physical knowledge-informed pseudo-language prompts. By incorporating these prompt features and fine-tuning the video diffusion model in a parameter-efficient manner, the physical knowledge-informed videos are successfully generated. We validate our method extensively through both numerical simulations and real-world observations of physical phenomena, demonstrating its remarkable performance across diverse scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bowen Duan, Shiming Chen, Yufei Guo, Guo-Sen Xie, Weiping Ding, Yisong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to leverage additional semantic information to recognize unseen classes. To transfer knowledge from seen to unseen classes, most ZSL methods often learn a shared embedding space by simply aligning visual embeddings with semantic prototypes. However, methods trained under this paradigm often struggle to learn robust embedding space because they align the two modalities in an isolated manner among classes, which ignore the crucial class relationship during the alignment process. To address the aforementioned challenges, this paper proposes a Visual-Semantic Graph Matching Net, termed as VSGMN, which leverages semantic relationships among classes to aid in visual-semantic embedding. VSGMN employs a Graph Build Network (GBN) and a Graph Matching Network (GMN) to achieve two-stage visual-semantic alignment. Specifically, GBN first utilizes an embedding-based approach to build visual and semantic graphs in the semantic space and align the embedding with its prototype for first-stage alignment. Additionally, to supplement unseen class relations in these graphs, GBN also build the unseen class nodes based on semantic relationships. In the second stage, GMN continuously integrates neighbor and cross-graph information into the constructed graph nodes, and aligns the node relationships between the two graphs under the class relationship constraint. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that VSGMN achieves superior performance in both conventional and generalized ZSL scenarios.

<p>Abstract: Oracle character recognition-an analysis of ancient Chinese inscriptions found on oracle bones-has become a pivotal field intersecting archaeology, paleography, and historical cultural studies. Traditional methods of oracle character recognition have relied heavily on manual interpretation by experts, which is not only labor-intensive but also limits broader accessibility to the general public. With recent breakthroughs in pattern recognition and deep learning, there is a growing movement towards the automation of oracle character recognition (OrCR), showing considerable promise in tackling the challenges inherent to these ancient scripts. However, a comprehensive understanding of OrCR still remains elusive. Therefore, this paper presents a systematic and structured survey of the current landscape of OrCR research. We commence by identifying and analyzing the key challenges of OrCR. Then, we provide an overview of the primary benchmark datasets and digital resources available for OrCR. A review of contemporary research methodologies follows, in which their respective efficacies, limitations, and applicability to the complex nature of oracle characters are critically highlighted and examined. Additionally, our review extends to ancillary tasks associated with OrCR across diverse disciplines, providing a broad-spectrum analysis of its applications. We conclude with a forward-looking perspective, proposing potential avenues for future investigations that could yield significant advancements in the field.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, implicit neural representations (INRs) have attracted increasing attention for multi-dimensional data recovery. However, INRs simply map coordinates via a multi-layer perception (MLP) to corresponding values, ignoring the inherent semantic information of the data. To leverage semantic priors from the data, we propose a novel Superpixel-informed INR (S-INR). Specifically, we suggest utilizing generalized superpixel instead of pixel as an alternative basic unit of INR for multi-dimensional data (e.g., images and weather data). The coordinates of generalized superpixels are first fed into exclusive attention-based MLPs, and then the intermediate results interact with a shared dictionary matrix. The elaborately designed modules in S-INR allow us to ingenuously exploit the semantic information within and across generalized superpixels. Extensive experiments on various applications validate the effectiveness and efficacy of our S-INR compared to state-of-the-art INR methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Object localization is a hot issue in computer vision area, which aims to identify and determine the precise location of specific objects from image or video. Most existing object localization methods heavily rely on extensive labeled data, which are costly to annotate and constrain their applicability. Therefore, we propose a new Zero-Shot Object Localization (ZSOL) framework for addressing the aforementioned challenges. In the proposed framework, we introduce the Contrastive Language Image Pre-training (CLIP) module which could integrate visual and linguistic information effectively. Furthermore, we design a Text Self-Similarity Matching (TSSM) module, which could improve the localization accuracy by enhancing the representation of text features extracted by CLIP module. Hence, the proposed framework can be guided by prompt words to identify and locate specific objects in an image in the absence of labeled samples. The results of extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method could improve the localization performance significantly and establishes an effective benchmark for further research.</p>

However, without comprehensive data support, these approaches often alter the essential feature transmission pathways of MLLMs, disrupting the intrinsic knowledge within the models and limiting their potential in RSICC. In this paper, we propose a novel model, CCExpert, based on a new, advanced multimodal large model framework. Firstly, we design a difference-aware integration module to capture multi-scale differences between bi-temporal images and incorporate them into the original image context, thereby enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio of differential features. Secondly, we constructed a high-quality, diversified dataset called CC-Foundation, containing 200,000 image pairs and 1.2 million captions, to provide substantial data support for continue pretraining in this domain. Lastly, we employed a three-stage progressive training process to ensure the deep integration of the difference-aware integration module with the pretrained MLLM. CCExpert achieved a notable performance of $S^*_m=81.80$ on the LEVIR-CC benchmark, significantly surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods. The code and part of the dataset will soon be open-sourced at https://github.com/Meize0729/CCExpert.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinhong Wang, Jian Liu, Dongqi Tang, Weiqiang Wang, Wentong Li, Danny Chen, J intai Chen, Jian Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a new autoregressive model as an effective and scalable monocular depth estimator. Our idea is simple: We tackle the monocular depth estimation (MDE) task with an autoregressive prediction paradigm, based on two core designs. First, our depth autoregressive model (DAR) treats the depth map of different resolutions as a set of tokens, and conducts the low-to-high resolution autoregressive objective with a patch-wise casual mask. Second, our DAR recursively discretizes the entire depth range into more compact intervals, and attains the coarse-to-fine granularity autoregressive objective in an ordinal-regression manner. By coupling these two autoregressive objectives, our DAR establishes new state-of-the-art (SOTA) on KITTI and NYU Depth v2 by clear margins. Further, our scalable approach allows us to scale the model up to 2.0B and achieve the best RMSE of 1.799 on the KITTI dataset (5% improvement) compared to 1.896 by the current SOTA (Depth Anything). DAR further showcases zero-shot generalization ability on unseen datasets. These results suggest that DAR yields superior performance with an autoregressive prediction paradigm, providing a promising approach to equip modern autoregressive large models (e.g., GPT-4o) with depth estimation capabilities.</p>

<p>Abstract: There is growing interest in applying AI to radiology report generation, particularly for chest X-rays (CXRs). This paper investigates whether incorporating pixel-level information through segmentation masks can improve fine-grained image interpretation of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for radiology report generation. We introduce MAIRA-Seg, a segmentation-aware MLLM framework designed to utilize semantic segmentation masks alongside CXRs for generating radiology reports. We train expert segmentation models to obtain mask pseudolabels for radiology-specific structures in CXRs. Subsequently, building on the architectures of MAIRA, a CXR-specialised model for report generation, we integrate a trainable segmentation tokens extractor that leverages these mask pseudolabels, and employ mask-aware prompting to generate draft radiology reports. Our experiments on the publicly available MIMIC-CXR dataset show that MAIRA-Seg outperforms non-segmentation baselines. We also investigate set-of-marks prompting with MAIRA and find that MAIRA-Seg consistently demonstrates comparable or superior performance. The results confirm that using segmentation masks enhances the nuanced reasoning of MLLMs, potentially contributing to better clinical outcomes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boyao Zhou, Shunyuan Zheng, Hanzhang Tu, Ruizhi Shao, Boning Liu, Shengping Zhang, Liqiang Nie, Yebin Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Differentiable rendering techniques have recently shown promising results for free-viewpoint video synthesis of characters. However, such methods, either Gaussian Splatting or neural implicit rendering, typically necessitate per-subject optimization which does not meet the requirement of real-time rendering in an interactive application. We propose a generalizable Gaussian Splatting approach for high-resolution image rendering under a sparse-view camera setting. To this end, we introduce Gaussian parameter maps defined on the source views and directly regress Gaussian properties for instant novel view synthesis without any fine-tuning or optimization. We train our Gaussian parameter regression module on human-only data or human-scene data, jointly with a depth estimation module to lift 2D parameter maps to 3D space. The proposed framework is fully differentiable with both depth and rendering supervision or with only rendering supervision. We further introduce a regularization term and an epipolar attention mechanism to preserve geometry consistency between two source views, especially when neglecting depth supervision. Experiments on several datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods while achieving an exceeding rendering speed.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ke Zhang, Zhaoye Zheng, Yurong Guo, Jiacun Wang, Jiyuan Yang, Yangjie Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Transmission line defect recognition models have traditionally used general pre-trained weights as the initial basis for their training. These models often suffer weak generalization capability due to the lack of domain knowledge in the pre-training dataset. To address this issue, we propose a two-stage transmission-line-oriented contrastive language-image pre-training (TL-CLIP) framework, which lays a more effective foundation for transmission line defect recognition. The pre-training process employs a novel power-specific multimodal algorithm assisted with two power-specific pre-training tasks for better modeling the power-related semantic knowledge contained in the inspection data. To fine-tune the pre-trained model, we develop a transfer learning strategy, namely fine-tuning with pre-training objective (FTP), to alleviate the overfitting problem caused by limited inspection data. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the performance of transmission line defect recognition in both classification and detection tasks, indicating clear advantages over traditional pre-trained models in the scene of transmission line inspection.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11374">LeC$^2$O-NeRF: Learning Continuous and Compact Large-Scale Occupancy for Urban Scenes</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenxing Mi, Dan Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: In NeRF, a critical problem is to effectively estimate the occupancy to guide empty-space skipping and point sampling. Grid-based methods work well for small-scale scenes. However, on large-scale scenes, they are limited by predefined bounding boxes, grid resolutions, and high memory usage for grid updates, and thus struggle to speed up training for large-scale, irregularly bounded and complex urban scenes without sacrificing accuracy. In this paper, we propose to learn a continuous and compact large-scale occupancy network, which can classify 3D points as occupied or unoccupied points. We train this occupancy network end-to-end together with the radiance field in a self-supervised manner by three designs. First, we propose a novel imbalanced occupancy loss to regularize the occupancy network. It makes the occupancy network effectively control the ratio of unoccupied and occupied points, motivated by the prior that most of 3D scene points are unoccupied. Second, we design an imbalanced architecture containing a large scene network and a small empty space network to separately encode occupied and unoccupied points classified by the occupancy network. This imbalanced structure can effectively model the imbalanced nature of occupied and unoccupied regions. Third, we design an explicit density loss to guide the occupancy network, making the density of unoccupied points smaller. As far as we know, we are the first to learn a continuous and compact occupancy of large-scale NeRF by a network. In our experiments, our occupancy network can quickly learn more compact, accurate and smooth occupancy compared to the occupancy grid. With our learned occupancy as guidance for empty space skipping on challenging large-scale benchmarks, our method consistently obtains higher accuracy compared to the occupancy grid, and our method can speed up state-of-the-art NeRF methods without sacrificing accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jikang Cheng, Zhiyuan Yan, Ying Zhang, Li Hao, Jiaxin Ai, Qin Zou, Chen Li, Zhongyuan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of face forgery techniques has introduced a growing variety of forgeries. Incremental Face Forgery Detection (IFFD), involving gradually adding new forgery data to fine-tune the previously trained model, has been introduced as a promising strategy to deal with evolving forgery methods. However, a naively trained IFFD model is prone to catastrophic forgetting when new forgeries are integrated, as treating all forgeries as a single ''Fake" class in the Real/Fake classification can cause different forgery types overriding one another, thereby resulting in the forgetting of unique characteristics from earlier tasks and limiting the model's effectiveness in learning forgery specificity and generality. In this paper, we propose to stack the latent feature distributions of previous and new tasks brick by brick, $\textit{i.e.}$, achieving $\textbf{aligned feature isolation}$. In this manner, we aim to preserve learned forgery information and accumulate new knowledge by minimizing distribution overriding, thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting. To achieve this, we first introduce Sparse Uniform Replay (SUR) to obtain the representative subsets that could be treated as the uniformly sparse versions of the previous global distributions. We then propose a Latent-space Incremental Detector (LID) that leverages SUR data to isolate and align distributions. For evaluation, we construct a more advanced and comprehensive benchmark tailored for IFFD. The leading experimental results validate the superiority of our method.</p>

<p>Abstract: Shape assembly is a ubiquitous task in daily life, integral for constructing complex 3D structures like IKEA furniture. While significant progress has been made in developing autonomous agents for shape assembly, existing datasets have not yet tackled the 4D grounding of assembly instructions in videos, essential for a holistic understanding of assembly in 3D space over time. We introduce IKEA Video Manuals, a dataset that features 3D models of furniture parts, instructional manuals, assembly videos from the Internet, and most importantly, annotations of dense spatio-temporal alignments between these data modalities. To demonstrate the utility of IKEA Video Manuals, we present five applications essential for shape assembly: assembly plan generation, part-conditioned segmentation, part-conditioned pose estimation, video object segmentation, and furniture assembly based on instructional video manuals. For each application, we provide evaluation metrics and baseline methods. Through experiments on our annotated data, we highlight many challenges in grounding assembly instructions in videos to improve shape assembly, including handling occlusions, varying viewpoints, and extended assembly sequences.</p>

<p>Abstract: Text logo design heavily relies on the creativity and expertise of professional designers, in which arranging element layouts is one of the most important procedures. However, few attention has been paid to this specific task which needs to take precise textural details and user constraints into consideration, but only on the broader tasks such as document/poster layout generation. In this paper, we propose a VLM-based framework that generates content-aware text logo layouts by integrating multi-modal inputs with user constraints, supporting a more flexible and stable layout design in real-world applications. We introduce two model techniques to reduce the computation for processing multiple glyph images simultaneously, while does not face performance degradation. To support instruction-tuning of out model, we construct two extensive text logo datasets, which are 5x more larger than the existing public dataset. Except for the geometric annotations (e.g. text masks and character recognition), we also compliment with comprehensive layout descriptions in natural language format, for more effective training to have reasoning ability when dealing with complex layouts and custom user constraints. Experimental studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model and datasets, when comparing with previous methods in various benchmarks to evaluate geometric aesthetics and human preferences. The code and datasets will be publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Li Yu, Xuanzhe Sun, Pan Gao, Moncef Gabbouj</p>
<p>Abstract: Audio data, often synchronized with video frames, plays a crucial role in guiding the audience's visual attention. Incorporating audio information into video saliency prediction tasks can enhance the prediction of human visual behavior. However, existing audio-visual saliency prediction methods often directly fuse audio and visual features, which ignore the possibility of inconsistency between the two modalities, such as when the audio serves as background music. To address this issue, we propose a novel relevance-guided audio-visual saliency prediction network dubbed AVRSP. Specifically, the Relevance-guided Audio-Visual feature Fusion module (RAVF) dynamically adjusts the retention of audio features based on the semantic relevance between audio and visual elements, thereby refining the integration process with visual features. Furthermore, the Multi-scale feature Synergy (MS) module integrates visual features from different encoding stages, enhancing the network's ability to represent objects at various scales. The Multi-scale Regulator Gate (MRG) could transfer crucial fusion information to visual features, thus optimizing the utilization of multi-scale visual features. Extensive experiments on six audio-visual eye movement datasets have demonstrated that our AVRSP network achieves competitive performance in audio-visual saliency prediction.</p>

<p>Abstract: Depth estimation is an essential task toward full scene understanding since it allows the projection of rich semantic information captured by cameras into 3D space. While the field has gained much attention recently, datasets for depth estimation lack scene diversity or sensor modalities. This work presents the ADUULM-360 dataset, a novel multi-modal dataset for depth estimation. The ADUULM-360 dataset covers all established autonomous driving sensor modalities, cameras, lidars, and radars. It covers a frontal-facing stereo setup, six surround cameras covering the full 360-degree, two high-resolution long-range lidar sensors, and five long-range radar sensors. It is also the first depth estimation dataset that contains diverse scenes in good and adverse weather conditions. We conduct extensive experiments using state-of-the-art self-supervised depth estimation methods under different training tasks, such as monocular training, stereo training, and full surround training. Discussing these results, we demonstrate common limitations of state-of-the-art methods, especially in adverse weather conditions, which hopefully will inspire future research in this area.

<p>Abstract: Monocular geometric scene understanding combines panoptic segmentation and self-supervised depth estimation, focusing on real-time application in autonomous vehicles. We introduce MGNiceNet, a unified approach that uses a linked kernel formulation for panoptic segmentation and self-supervised depth estimation. MGNiceNet is based on the state-of-the-art real-time panoptic segmentation method RT-K-Net and extends the architecture to cover both panoptic segmentation and self-supervised monocular depth estimation. To this end, we introduce a tightly coupled self-supervised depth estimation predictor that explicitly uses information from the panoptic path for depth prediction. Furthermore, we introduce a panoptic-guided motion masking method to improve depth estimation without relying on video panoptic segmentation annotations. We evaluate our method on two popular autonomous driving datasets, Cityscapes and KITTI. Our model shows state-of-the-art results compared to other real-time methods and closes the gap to computationally more demanding methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yoonki Cho, Jaeyoon Kim, Woo Jae Kim, Junsik Jung, Sung-eui Yoon</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain generalizable person re-identification (DG re-ID) aims to learn discriminative representations that are robust to distributional shifts. While data augmentation is a straightforward solution to improve generalization, certain augmentations exhibit a polarized effect in this task, enhancing in-distribution performance while deteriorating out-of-distribution performance. In this paper, we investigate this phenomenon and reveal that it leads to sparse representation spaces with reduced uniformity. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework, Balancing Alignment and Uniformity (BAU), which effectively mitigates this effect by maintaining a balance between alignment and uniformity. Specifically, BAU incorporates alignment and uniformity losses applied to both original and augmented images and integrates a weighting strategy to assess the reliability of augmented samples, further improving the alignment loss. Additionally, we introduce a domain-specific uniformity loss that promotes uniformity within each source domain, thereby enhancing the learning of domain-invariant features. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that BAU effectively exploits the advantages of data augmentation, which previous studies could not fully utilize, and achieves state-of-the-art performance without requiring complex training procedures.

However, a key challenge remains in effectively decoupling light-independent and lighting-dependent components to enhance the quality of generated 3D models and their relighting performance. In this paper, we present MVLight, a novel light-conditioned multi-view diffusion model that explicitly integrates lighting conditions directly into the generation process. This enables the model to synthesize high-quality images that faithfully reflect the specified lighting environment across multiple camera views. By leveraging this capability to Score Distillation Sampling (SDS), we can effectively synthesize 3D models with improved geometric precision and relighting capabilities. We validate the effectiveness of MVLight through extensive experiments and a user study.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Defan Chen, Luchan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting small objects in complex scenes, such as those captured by drones, is a daunting challenge due to the difficulty in capturing the complex features of small targets. While the YOLO family has achieved great success in large target detection, its performance is less than satisfactory when faced with small targets. Because of this, this paper proposes a revolutionary model SL-YOLO (Stronger and Lighter YOLO) that aims to break the bottleneck of small target detection. We propose the Hierarchical Extended Path Aggregation Network (HEPAN), a pioneering cross-scale feature fusion method that can ensure unparalleled detection accuracy even in the most challenging environments. At the same time, without sacrificing detection capabilities, we design the C2fDCB lightweight module and add the SCDown downsampling module to greatly reduce the model's parameters and computational complexity. Our experimental results on the VisDrone2019 dataset reveal a significant improvement in performance, with mAP@0.5 jumping from 43.0% to 46.9% and mAP@0.5:0.95 increasing from 26.0% to 28.9%. At the same time, the model parameters are reduced from 11.1M to 9.6M, and the FPS can reach 132, making it an ideal solution for real-time small object detection in resource-constrained environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Survival prediction is a critical task in pathology. In clinical practice, pathologists often examine multiple cases, leveraging a broader spectrum of cancer phenotypes to enhance pathological assessment. Despite significant advancements in deep learning, current solutions typically model each slide as a sample, struggling to effectively capture comparable and slide-agnostic pathological features. In this paper, we introduce GroupMIL, a novel framework inspired by the clinical practice of collective analysis, which models multiple slides as a single sample and organizes groups of patches and slides sequentially to capture cross-slide prognostic features. We also present GPAMamba, a model designed to facilitate intra- and inter-slide feature interactions, effectively capturing local micro-environmental characteristics within slide-level graphs while uncovering essential prognostic patterns across an extended patch sequence within the group framework. Furthermore, we develop a dual-head predictor that delivers comprehensive survival risk and probability assessments for each patient. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across five datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents the Large Vision Diffusion Transformer (LaVin-DiT), a scalable and unified foundation model designed to tackle over 20 computer vision tasks in a generative framework. Unlike existing large vision models directly adapted from natural language processing architectures, which rely on less efficient autoregressive techniques and disrupt spatial relationships essential for vision data, LaVin-DiT introduces key innovations to optimize generative performance for vision tasks. First, to address the high dimensionality of visual data, we incorporate a spatial-temporal variational autoencoder that encodes data into a continuous latent space. Second, for generative modeling, we develop a joint diffusion transformer that progressively produces vision outputs. Third, for unified multi-task training, in-context learning is implemented. Input-target pairs serve as task context, which guides the diffusion transformer to align outputs with specific tasks within the latent space. During inference, a task-specific context set and test data as queries allow LaVin-DiT to generalize across tasks without fine-tuning. Trained on extensive vision datasets, the model is scaled from 0.1B to 3.4B parameters, demonstrating substantial scalability and state-of-the-art performance across diverse vision tasks. This work introduces a novel pathway for large vision foundation models, underscoring the promising potential of diffusion transformers. The code and models will be open-sourced.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chuang Yang, Xu Han, Tao Han, Yuejiao SU, Junyu Gao, Hongyuan Zhang, Yi Wang, Lap-Pui Chau</p>
<p>Abstract: Traffic signs play a key role in assisting autonomous driving systems (ADS) by enabling the assessment of vehicle behavior in compliance with traffic regulations and providing navigation instructions. However, current works are limited to basic sign understanding without considering the egocentric vehicle's spatial position, which fails to support further regulation assessment and direction navigation. Following the above issues, we introduce a new task: traffic sign interpretation from the vehicle's first-person view, referred to as TSI-FPV. Meanwhile, we develop a traffic guidance assistant (TGA) scenario application to re-explore the role of traffic signs in ADS as a complement to popular autonomous technologies (such as obstacle perception). Notably, TGA is not a replacement for electronic map navigation; rather, TGA can be an automatic tool for updating it and complementing it in situations such as offline conditions or temporary sign adjustments. Lastly, a spatial and semantic logic-aware stepwise reasoning pipeline (SignEye) is constructed to achieve the TSI-FPV and TGA, and an application-specific dataset (Traffic-CN) is built. Experiments show that TSI-FPV and TGA are achievable via our SignEye trained on Traffic-CN. The results also demonstrate that the TGA can provide complementary information to ADS beyond existing popular autonomous technologies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuai Li, Michael Burke, Subramanian Ramamoorthy, Juergen Gall</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework to learn data association for multi-object tracking in a self-supervised manner. Fully-supervised learning methods are known to achieve excellent tracking performances, but acquiring identity-level annotations is tedious and time-consuming. Motivated by the fact that in real-world scenarios object motion can be usually represented by a Markov process, we present a novel expectation maximization (EM) algorithm that trains a neural network to associate detections for tracking, without requiring prior knowledge of their temporal correspondences. At the core of our method lies a neural Kalman filter, with an observation model conditioned on associations of detections parameterized by a neural network. Given a batch of frames as input, data associations between detections from adjacent frames are predicted by a neural network followed by a Sinkhorn normalization that determines the assignment probabilities of detections to states. Kalman smoothing is then used to obtain the marginal probability of observations given the inferred states, producing a training objective to maximize this marginal probability using gradient descent. The proposed framework is fully differentiable, allowing the underlying neural model to be trained end-to-end. We evaluate our approach on the challenging MOT17 and MOT20 datasets and achieve state-of-the-art results in comparison to self-supervised trackers using public detections. We furthermore demonstrate the capability of the learned model to generalize across datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> R\"uveyda Yilmaz, Kaan Keven, Yuli Wu, Johannes Stegmaier</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated cell segmentation in microscopy images is essential for biomedical research, yet conventional methods are labor-intensive and prone to error. While deep learning-based approaches have proven effective, they often require large annotated datasets, which are scarce due to the challenges of manual annotation. To overcome this, we propose a novel framework for synthesizing densely annotated 2D and 3D cell microscopy images using cascaded diffusion models. Our method synthesizes 2D and 3D cell masks from sparse 2D annotations using multi-level diffusion models and NeuS, a 3D surface reconstruction approach. Following that, a pretrained 2D Stable Diffusion model is finetuned to generate realistic cell textures and the final outputs are combined to form cell populations. We show that training a segmentation model with a combination of our synthetic data and real data improves cell segmentation performance by up to 9\% across multiple datasets. Additionally, the FID scores indicate that the synthetic data closely resembles real data. The code for our proposed approach will be available at https://github.com/ruveydayilmaz0/cascaded\_diffusion.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingda Zhang, Mingli Zhu, Zihao Zhu, Baoyuan Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Backdoor attack has been considered as a serious security threat to deep neural networks (DNNs). Poisoned sample detection (PSD) that aims at filtering out poisoned samples from an untrustworthy training dataset has shown very promising performance for defending against data poisoning based backdoor attacks. However, we observe that the detection performance of many advanced methods is likely to be unstable when facing weak backdoor attacks, such as low poisoning ratio or weak trigger strength. To further verify this observation, we make a statistical investigation among various backdoor attacks and poisoned sample detections, showing a positive correlation between backdoor effect and detection performance. It inspires us to strengthen the backdoor effect to enhance detection performance. Since we cannot achieve that goal via directly manipulating poisoning ratio or trigger strength, we propose to train one model using the Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) algorithm, rather than the vanilla training algorithm. We also provide both empirical and theoretical analysis about how SAM training strengthens the backdoor effect. Then, this SAM trained model can be seamlessly integrated with any off-the-shelf PSD method that extracts discriminative features from the trained model for detection, called SAM-enhanced PSD. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets show the reliable detection performance of the proposed method against both weak and strong backdoor attacks, with significant improvements against various attacks ($+34.38\%$ TPR on average), over the conventional PSD methods (i.e., without SAM enhancement). Overall, this work provides new insights about PSD and proposes a novel approach that can complement existing detection methods, which may inspire more in-depth explorations in this field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhendong Liu, Yuanbi Nie, Yingshui Tan, Xiangyu Yue, Qiushi Cui, Chongjun Wang, Xiaoyong Zhu, Bo Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Benefiting from the powerful capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), pre-trained visual encoder models connected to LLMs form Vision Language Models (VLMs). However, recent research shows that the visual modality in VLMs is highly vulnerable, allowing attackers to bypass safety alignment in LLMs through visually transmitted content, launching harmful attacks. To address this challenge, we propose a progressive concept-based alignment strategy, PSA-VLM, which incorporates safety modules as concept bottlenecks to enhance visual modality safety alignment. By aligning model predictions with specific safety concepts, we improve defenses against risky images, enhancing explainability and controllability while minimally impacting general performance. Our method is obtained through two-stage training. The low computational cost of the first stage brings very effective performance improvement, and the fine-tuning of the language model in the second stage further improves the safety performance. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on popular VLM safety benchmark.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11548">Real-Time Fitness Exercise Classification and Counting from Video Frames</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Riccardo Riccio</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for real-time exercise classification using a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) neural network. Existing exercise recognition approaches often rely on synthetic datasets, raw coordinate inputs sensitive to user and camera variations, and fail to fully exploit the temporal dependencies in exercise movements. These issues limit their generalizability and robustness in real-world conditions, where lighting, camera angles, and user body types vary.
  To address these challenges, we propose a BiLSTM-based model that leverages invariant features, such as joint angles, alongside raw coordinates. By using both angles and (x, y, z) coordinates, the model adapts to changes in perspective, user positioning, and body differences, improving generalization. Training on 30-frame sequences enables the BiLSTM to capture the temporal context of exercises and recognize patterns evolving over time.
  We compiled a dataset combining synthetic data from the InfiniteRep dataset and real-world videos from Kaggle and other sources. This dataset includes four common exercises: squat, push-up, shoulder press, and bicep curl. The model was trained and validated on these diverse datasets, achieving an accuracy of over 99% on the test set. To assess generalizability, the model was tested on 2 separate test sets representative of typical usage conditions. Comparisons with the previous approach from the literature are present in the result section showing that the proposed model is the best-performing one.
  The classifier is integrated into a web application providing real-time exercise classification and repetition counting without manual exercise selection.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shibin Mei, Hang Wang, Bingbing Ni</p>
<p>Abstract: The cameras equipped on mobile terminals employ different sensors in different photograph modes, and the transferability of raw domain denoising models between these sensors is significant but remains sufficient exploration. Industrial solutions either develop distinct training strategies and models for different sensors or ignore the differences between sensors and simply extend existing models to new sensors, which leads to tedious training or unsatisfactory performance. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmark, the Multi-Sensor SIDD (MSSIDD) dataset, which is the first raw-domain dataset designed to evaluate the sensor transferability of denoising models. The MSSIDD dataset consists of 60,000 raw images of six distinct sensors, derived through the degeneration of sRGB images via different camera sensor parameters. Furthermore, we propose a sensor consistency training framework that enables denoising models to learn the sensor-invariant features, thereby facilitating the generalization of the consistent model to unseen sensors. We evaluate previous arts on the newly proposed MSSIDD dataset, and the experimental results validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

<p>Abstract: Noninvasive optical imaging modalities can probe patient's tissue in 3D and over time generate gigabytes of clinically relevant data per sample. There is a need for AI models to analyze this data and assist clinical workflow. The lack of expert labelers and the large dataset required (>100,000 images) for model training and tuning are the main hurdles in creating foundation models. In this paper we introduce FoundationShift, a method to apply any AI model from computational pathology without retraining. We show our method is more accurate than state of the art models (SAM, MedSAM, SAM-Med2D, CellProfiler, Hover-Net, PLIP, UNI and ChatGPT), with multiple imaging modalities (OCT and RCM). This is achieved without the need for model retraining or fine-tuning. Applying our method to noninvasive in vivo images could enable physicians to readily incorporate optical imaging modalities into their clinical practice, providing real time tissue analysis and improving patient care.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study proposes a novel approach for real-time facial expression recognition utilizing short-range Frequency-Modulated Continuous-Wave (FMCW) radar equipped with one transmit (Tx), and three receive (Rx) antennas. The system leverages four distinct modalities simultaneously: Range-Doppler images (RDIs), micro range-Doppler Images (micro-RDIs), range azimuth images (RAIs), and range elevation images (REIs). Our innovative architecture integrates feature extractor blocks, intermediate feature extractor blocks, and a ResNet block to accurately classify facial expressions into smile, anger, neutral, and no-face classes. Our model achieves an average classification accuracy of 98.91% on the dataset collected using a 60 GHz short-range FMCW radar. The proposed solution operates in real-time in a person-independent manner, which shows the potential use of low-cost FMCW radars for effective facial expression recognition in various applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiman Li, Jiayue Zhao, Shaolei Liu, Xiaokun Dai, Chenxi Zhang, Zhijian Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning-based medical image segmentation helps assist diagnosis and accelerate the treatment process while the model training usually requires large-scale dense annotation datasets. Weakly semi-supervised medical image segmentation is an essential application because it only requires a small amount of scribbles and a large number of unlabeled data to train the model, which greatly reduces the clinician's effort to fully annotate images. To handle the inadequate supervisory information challenge in weakly semi-supervised segmentation (WSSS), a SuperPixel-Propagated Pseudo-label (SP${}^3$) learning method is proposed, using the structural information contained in superpixel for supplemental information. Specifically, the annotation of scribbles is propagated to superpixels and thus obtains a dense annotation for supervised training. Since the quality of pseudo-labels is limited by the low-quality annotation, the beneficial superpixels selected by dynamic thresholding are used to refine pseudo-labels. Furthermore, aiming to alleviate the negative impact of noise in pseudo-label, superpixel-level uncertainty is incorporated to guide the pseudo-label supervision for stable learning. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both tumor and organ segmentation datasets under the WSSS setting, using only 3\% of the annotation workload compared to fully supervised methods and attaining approximately 80\% Dice score. Additionally, our method outperforms eight weakly and semi-supervised methods under both weakly supervised and semi-supervised settings. Results of extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and annotation efficiency of our weakly semi-supervised segmentation, which can assist clinicians in achieving automated segmentation for organs or tumors quickly and ultimately benefit patients.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11691">Towards Degradation-Robust Reconstruction in Generalizable NeRF</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Chan Ho Park, Ka Leong Cheng, Zhicheng Wang, Qifeng Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Generalizable Neural Radiance Field (GNeRF) across scenes has been proven to be an effective way to avoid per-scene optimization by representing a scene with deep image features of source images. However, despite its potential for real-world applications, there has been limited research on the robustness of GNeRFs to different types of degradation present in the source images. The lack of such research is primarily attributed to the absence of a large-scale dataset fit for training a degradation-robust generalizable NeRF model. To address this gap and facilitate investigations into the degradation robustness of 3D reconstruction tasks, we construct the Objaverse Blur Dataset, comprising 50,000 images from over 1000 settings featuring multiple levels of blur degradation. In addition, we design a simple and model-agnostic module for enhancing the degradation robustness of GNeRFs. Specifically, by extracting 3D-aware features through a lightweight depth estimator and denoiser, the proposed module shows improvement on different popular methods in GNeRFs in terms of both quantitative and visual quality over varying degradation types and levels. Our dataset and code will be made publicly available.</p>

<p>Abstract: Current vision-language models (VLMs) show exceptional abilities across diverse tasks including visual question answering. To enhance user experience in practical applications, recent studies investigate VLM personalization to understand user-provided concepts. However, existing studies mainly focus on single-concept personalization, neglecting the existence and interplay of multiple concepts, which limits the real-world applicability of personalized VLMs. In this paper, we propose the first multi-concept personalization method named MC-LLaVA along with a high-quality multi-concept personalization dataset. Specifically, MC-LLaVA uses a joint training strategy incorporating multiple concepts in a single training step, allowing VLMs to perform accurately in multi-concept personalization. To reduce the cost of joint training, MC-LLaVA leverages visual token information for concept token initialization, yielding improved concept representation and accelerating joint training. To advance multi-concept personalization research, we further contribute a high-quality dataset. We carefully collect images from various movies that contain multiple characters and manually generate the multi-concept question-answer samples. Our dataset features diverse movie types and question-answer types. We conduct comprehensive qualitative and quantitative experiments to demonstrate that MC-LLaVA can achieve impressive multi-concept personalized responses, paving the way for VLMs to become better user-specific assistants.

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in sRGB-to-RAW de-rendering have increasingly emphasized metadata-driven approaches to reconstruct RAW data from sRGB images, supplemented by partial RAW information. In image-based de-rendering, metadata is commonly obtained through sampling, whereas in video tasks, it is typically derived from the initial frame. The distinct metadata requirements necessitate specialized network architectures, leading to architectural incompatibilities that increase deployment complexity. In this paper, we propose RAWMamba, a Mamba-based unified framework developed for sRGB-to-RAW de-rendering across both image and video domains. The core of RAWMamba is the Unified Metadata Embedding (UME) module, which harmonizes diverse metadata types into a unified representation. In detail, a multi-perspective affinity modeling method is proposed to promote the extraction of reference information. In addition, we introduce the Local Tone-Aware Mamba (LTA-Mamba) module, which captures long-range dependencies to enable effective global propagation of metadata. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RAWMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding high-quality RAW data reconstruction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> G\"unel Jabbarl{\i}, Murat Kurt</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate and fast recognition of forgeries is an issue of great importance in the fields of artificial intelligence, image processing and object detection. Recognition of forgeries of facial imagery is the process of classifying and defining the faces in it by analyzing real-world facial images. This process is usually accomplished by extracting features from an image, using classifier algorithms, and correctly interpreting the results. Recognizing forgeries of facial imagery correctly can encounter many different challenges. For example, factors such as changing lighting conditions, viewing faces from different angles can affect recognition performance, and background complexity and perspective changes in facial images can make accurate recognition difficult. Despite these difficulties, significant progress has been made in the field of forgery detection. Deep learning algorithms, especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have significantly improved forgery detection performance.
  This study focuses on image processing-based forgery detection using Fake-Vs-Real-Faces (Hard) [10] and 140k Real and Fake Faces [61] data sets. Both data sets consist of two classes containing real and fake facial images. In our study, two lightweight deep learning models are proposed to conduct forgery detection using these images. Additionally, 8 different pretrained CNN architectures were tested on both data sets and the results were compared with newly developed lightweight CNN models. It's shown that the proposed lightweight deep learning models have minimum number of layers. It's also shown that the proposed lightweight deep learning models detect forgeries of facial imagery accurately, and computationally efficiently. Although the data set consists only of face images, the developed models can also be used in other two-class object recognition problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taiming Lu, Tianmin Shu, Alan Yuille, Daniel Khashabi, Jieneng Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Planning with partial observation is a central challenge in embodied AI. A majority of prior works have tackled this challenge by developing agents that physically explore their environment to update their beliefs about the world state.In contrast, humans can $\textit{imagine}$ unseen parts of the world through a mental exploration and $\textit{revise}$ their beliefs with imagined observations. Such updated beliefs can allow them to make more informed decisions, without necessitating the physical exploration of the world at all times. To achieve this human-like ability, we introduce the $\textit{Generative World Explorer (Genex)}$, an egocentric world exploration framework that allows an agent to mentally explore a large-scale 3D world (e.g., urban scenes) and acquire imagined observations to update its belief. This updated belief will then help the agent to make a more informed decision at the current step. To train $\textit{Genex}$, we create a synthetic urban scene dataset, Genex-DB. Our experimental results demonstrate that (1) $\textit{Genex}$ can generate high-quality and consistent observations during long-horizon exploration of a large virtual physical world and (2) the beliefs updated with the generated observations can inform an existing decision-making model (e.g., an LLM agent) to make better plans.</p>

Collecting keypoints-only data, while efficient and cost-effective, results in low-fidelity representations and lacks surface information. Furthermore, data inconsistencies across sources challenge their integration and use. We present UniHands, a novel method for creating standardized yet personalized hand models from wild-collected keypoints from diverse sources. Unlike existing neural implicit representation methods, UniHands uses the widely-adopted parametric models MANO and NIMBLE, providing a more scalable and versatile solution. It also derives unified hand joints from the meshes, which facilitates seamless integration into various hand-related tasks. Experiments on the FreiHAND and InterHand2.6M datasets demonstrate its ability to precisely reconstruct hand mesh vertices and keypoints, effectively capturing high-degree articulation motions. Empirical studies involving nine participants show a clear preference for our unified joints over existing configurations for accuracy and naturalism (p-value 0.016).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tony Lindeberg</p>
<p>Abstract: When observing the surface patterns of objects delimited by smooth surfaces, the projections of the surface patterns to the image domain will be subject to substantial variabilities, as induced by variabilities in the geometric viewing conditions, and as generated by either monocular or binocular imaging conditions, or by relative motions between the object and the observer over time. To first order of approximation, the image deformations of such projected surface patterns can be modelled as local linearizations in terms of local 2-D spatial affine transformations.
  This paper presents a theoretical analysis of relationships between the degrees of freedom in 2-D spatial affine image transformations and the degrees of freedom in the affine Gaussian derivative model for visual receptive fields. For this purpose, we first describe a canonical decomposition of 2-D affine transformations on a product form, closely related to a singular value decomposition, while in closed form, and which reveals the degrees of freedom in terms of (i) uniform scaling transformations, (ii) an overall amount of global rotation, (iii) a complementary non-uniform scaling transformation and (iv) a relative normalization to a preferred symmetry orientation in the image domain. Then, we show how these degrees of freedom relate to the degrees of freedom in the affine Gaussian derivative model.
  Finally, we use these theoretical results to consider whether we could regard the biological receptive fields in the primary visual cortex of higher mammals as being able to span the degrees of freedom of 2-D spatial affine transformations, based on interpretations of existing neurophysiological experimental results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jhanavi Hegde</p>
<p>Abstract: Satellites are widely used to estimate and monitor ground cover, providing critical information to address the challenges posed by climate change. High-resolution satellite images help to identify smaller features on the ground and classification of ground cover types. Small satellites have become very popular recently due to their cost-effectiveness. However, smaller satellites have weaker spatial resolution, and preprocessing using recent generative models made it possible to enhance the resolution of these satellite images. The objective of this paper is to propose computationally efficient guided or image-conditioned denoising diffusion models (DDMs) to perform super-resolution on low-quality images. Denoising based on stochastic ordinary differential equations (ODEs) typically takes hundreds of iterations and it can be reduced using deterministic ODEs. I propose Consistency Models (CM) that utilize deterministic ODEs for efficient denoising and perform super resolution on satellite images. The DOTA v2.0 image dataset that is used to develop object detectors needed for urban planning and ground cover estimation, is used in this project. The Stable Diffusion model is used as the base model, and the DDM in Stable Diffusion is converted into a Consistency Model (CM) using Teacher-Student Distillation to apply deterministic denoising. Stable diffusion with modified CM has successfully improved the resolution of satellite images by a factor of 16, and the computational time was reduced by a factor of 20 compared to stochastic denoising methods. The FID score of low-resolution images improved from 10.0 to 1.9 after increasing the image resolution using my algorithm for consistency models.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the domain of Extended Reality (XR), particularly Virtual Reality (VR), extensive research has been devoted to harnessing this transformative technology in various real-world applications. However, a critical challenge that must be addressed before unleashing the full potential of XR in practical scenarios is to ensure robust security and safeguard user privacy. This paper presents a systematic survey of the utility of biometric characteristics applied in the XR environment. To this end, we present a comprehensive overview of the different types of biometric modalities used for authentication and representation of users in a virtual environment. We discuss different biometric vulnerability gateways in general XR systems for the first time in the literature along with taxonomy. A comprehensive discussion on generating and authenticating biometric-based photorealistic avatars in XR environments is presented with a stringent taxonomy. We also discuss the availability of different datasets that are widely employed in evaluating biometric authentication in XR environments together with performance evaluation metrics. Finally, we discuss the open challenges and potential future work that need to be addressed in the field of biometrics in XR.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Giulio Rossolini, Tommaso Baldi, Alessandro Biondi, Giorgio Buttazzo</p>
<p>Abstract: Distributed learning frameworks, which partition neural network models across multiple computing nodes, enhance efficiency in collaborative edge-cloud systems but may also introduce new vulnerabilities. In this work, we explore the feasibility of generating universal adversarial attacks when an attacker has access to the edge part of the model only, which consists in the first network layers. Unlike traditional universal adversarial perturbations (UAPs) that require full model knowledge, our approach shows that adversaries can induce effective mispredictions in the unknown cloud part by leveraging key features on the edge side. Specifically, we train lightweight classifiers from intermediate features available at the edge, i.e., before the split point, and use them in a novel targeted optimization to craft effective UAPs. Our results on ImageNet demonstrate strong attack transferability to the unknown cloud part. Additionally, we analyze the capability of an attacker to achieve targeted adversarial effect with edge-only knowledge, revealing intriguing behaviors. By introducing the first adversarial attacks with edge-only knowledge in split inference, this work underscores the importance of addressing partial model access in adversarial robustness, encouraging further research in this area.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yao Lu, Peixin Zhang, Jingyi Wang, Lei Ma, Xiaoniu Yang, Qi Xuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized computing in many real-world applications, arguably due to its remarkable performance and extreme convenience as an end-to-end solution. However, deep learning models can be costly to train and to use, especially for those large-scale models, making it necessary to optimize the original overly complicated models into smaller ones in scenarios with limited resources such as mobile applications or simply for resource saving. The key question in such model optimization is, how can we effectively identify and measure the redundancy in a deep learning model structure. While several common metrics exist in the popular model optimization techniques to measure the performance of models after optimization, they are not able to quantitatively inform the degree of remaining redundancy. To address the problem, we present a novel testing approach, i.e., RedTest, which proposes a novel testing metric called Model Structural Redundancy Score (MSRS) to quantitatively measure the degree of redundancy in a deep learning model structure. We first show that MSRS is effective in both revealing and assessing the redundancy issues in many state-of-the-art models, which urgently calls for model optimization. Then, we utilize MSRS to assist deep learning model developers in two practical application scenarios: 1) in Neural Architecture Search, we design a novel redundancy-aware algorithm to guide the search for the optimal model structure and demonstrate its effectiveness by comparing it to existing standard NAS practice; 2) in the pruning of large-scale pre-trained models, we prune the redundant layers of pre-trained models with the guidance of layer similarity to derive less redundant ones of much smaller size. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that removing such redundancy has a negligible effect on the model utility.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel normative modeling approach that incorporates focal loss and adversarial autoencoders (FAAE) for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) diagnosis and biomarker identification. Our method is an end-to-end approach that embeds an adversarial focal loss discriminator within the autoencoder structure, specifically designed to effectively target and capture more complex and challenging cases. We first use the enhanced autoencoder to create a normative model based on data from healthy control (HC) individuals. We then apply this model to estimate total and regional neuroanatomical deviation in AD patients. Through extensive experiments on the OASIS-3 and ADNI datasets, our approach significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods. This advancement not only streamlines the detection process but also provides a greater insight into the biomarker potential for AD. Our code can be found at \url{https://github.com/soz223/FAAE}.</p>

<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative, personalized model training across multiple devices without sharing raw data, making it ideal for pervasive computing applications that optimize user-centric performances in diverse environments. However, data heterogeneity among clients poses a significant challenge, leading to inconsistencies among trained client models and reduced performance. To address this, we introduce the Alignment with Prototypes (ALP) layers, which align incoming embeddings closer to learnable prototypes through an optimal transport plan. During local training, the ALP layer updates local prototypes and aligns embeddings toward global prototypes aggregated from all clients using our novel FL framework, Federated Alignment (FedAli). For model inferences, embeddings are guided toward local prototypes to better reflect the client's local data distribution. We evaluate FedAli on heterogeneous sensor-based human activity recognition and vision benchmark datasets, demonstrating that it outperforms existing FL strategies. We publicly release our source code to facilitate reproducibility and furthered research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huy Tran, Yikun Bai, Ashkan Shahbazi, John R. Hershey, Soheil Kolouri</p>
<p>Abstract: The practical applications of Wasserstein distances (WDs) are constrained by their sample and computational complexities. Sliced-Wasserstein distances (SWDs) provide a workaround by projecting distributions onto one-dimensional subspaces, leveraging the more efficient, closed-form WDs for one-dimensional distributions. However, in high dimensions, most random projections become uninformative due to the concentration of measure phenomenon. Although several SWD variants have been proposed to focus on \textit{informative} slices, they often introduce additional complexity, numerical instability, and compromise desirable theoretical (metric) properties of SWD. Amidst the growing literature that focuses on directly modifying the slicing distribution, which often face challenges, we revisit the classical Sliced-Wasserstein and propose instead to rescale the 1D Wasserstein to make all slices equally informative. Importantly, we show that with an appropriate data assumption and notion of \textit{slice informativeness}, rescaling for all individual slices simplifies to \textbf{a single global scaling factor} on the SWD. This, in turn, translates to the standard learning rate search for gradient-based learning in common machine learning workflows. We perform extensive experiments across various machine learning tasks showing that the classical SWD, when properly configured, can often match or surpass the performance of more complex variants. We then answer the following question: "Is Sliced-Wasserstein all you need for common learning tasks?"</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10661">Enhancing PTSD Outcome Prediction with Ensemble Models in Disaster Contexts</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ayesha Siddiqua, Atib Mohammad Oni, Abu Saleh Musa Miah, Jungpil Shin</p>
<p>Abstract: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a significant mental health challenge that affects individuals exposed to traumatic events. Early detection and effective intervention for PTSD are crucial, as it can lead to long-term psychological distress if untreated. Accurate detection of PTSD is essential for timely and targeted mental health interventions, especially in disaster-affected populations. Existing research has explored machine learning approaches for classifying PTSD, but many face limitations in terms of model performance and generalizability. To address these issues, we implemented a comprehensive preprocessing pipeline. This included data cleaning, missing value treatment using the SimpleImputer, label encoding of categorical variables, data augmentation using SMOTE to balance the dataset, and feature scaling with StandardScaler. The dataset was split into 80\% training and 20\% testing. We developed an ensemble model using a majority voting technique among several classifiers, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and a customized Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The ensemble model achieved an accuracy of 96.76\% with a benchmark dataset, significantly outperforming individual models. The proposed method's advantages include improved robustness through the combination of multiple models, enhanced ability to generalize across diverse data points, and increased accuracy in detecting PTSD. Additionally, the use of SMOTE for data augmentation ensured better handling of imbalanced datasets, leading to more reliable predictions. The proposed approach offers valuable insights for policymakers and healthcare providers by leveraging predictive analytics to address mental health issues in vulnerable populations, particularly those affected by disasters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoxu Huang, Cem M. Deniz, Kyunghyun Cho, Sumit Chopra, Divyam Madaan</p>
<p>Abstract: Chest X-ray imaging is a widely accessible and non-invasive diagnostic tool for detecting thoracic abnormalities. While numerous AI models assist radiologists in interpreting these images, most overlook patients' historical data. To bridge this gap, we introduce Temporal MIMIC dataset, which integrates five years of patient history, including radiographic scans and reports from MIMIC-CXR and MIMIC-IV, encompassing 12,221 patients and thirteen pathologies. Building on this, we present HIST-AID, a framework that enhances automatic diagnostic accuracy using historical reports. HIST-AID emulates the radiologist's comprehensive approach, leveraging historical data to improve diagnostic accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements, with AUROC increasing by 6.56% and AUPRC by 9.51% compared to models that rely solely on radiographic scans. These gains were consistently observed across diverse demographic groups, including variations in gender, age, and racial categories. We show that while recent data boost performance, older data may reduce accuracy due to changes in patient conditions. Our work paves the potential of incorporating historical data for more reliable automatic diagnosis, providing critical support for clinical decision-making.</p>

<p>Abstract: We developed a shoe-mounted gait monitoring system capable of tracking up to 17 gait parameters, including gait length, step time, stride velocity, and others. The system employs a stereo camera mounted on one shoe to track a marker placed on the opposite shoe, enabling the estimation of spatial gait parameters. Additionally, a Force Sensitive Resistor (FSR) affixed to the heel of the shoe, combined with a custom-designed algorithm, is utilized to measure temporal gait parameters. Through testing on multiple participants and comparison with the gait mat, the proposed gait monitoring system exhibited notable performance, with the accuracy of all measured gait parameters exceeding 93.61%. The system also demonstrated a low drift of 4.89% during long-distance walking. A gait identification task conducted on participants using a trained Transformer model achieved 95.7% accuracy on the dataset collected by the proposed system, demonstrating that our hardware has the potential to collect long-sequence gait data suitable for integration with current Large Language Models (LLMs).

<p>Abstract: Advances in optical microscopy scanning have significantly contributed to computational pathology (CPath) by converting traditional histopathological slides into whole slide images (WSIs). This development enables comprehensive digital reviews by pathologists and accelerates AI-driven diagnostic support for WSI analysis. Recent advances in foundational pathology models have increased the need for benchmarking tasks. The Camelyon series is one of the most widely used open-source datasets in computational pathology. However, the quality, accessibility, and clinical relevance of the labels have not been comprehensively evaluated. In this study, we reprocessed 1,399 WSIs and labels from the Camelyon-16 and Camelyon-17 datasets, removing low-quality slides, correcting erroneous labels, and providing expert pixel annotations for tumor regions in the previously unreleased test set. Based on the sizes of re-annotated tumor regions, we upgraded the binary cancer screening task to a four-class task: negative, micro-metastasis, macro-metastasis, and Isolated Tumor Cells (ITC). We reevaluated pre-trained pathology feature extractors and multiple instance learning (MIL) methods using the cleaned dataset, providing a benchmark that advances AI development in histopathology.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce and demonstrate a new paradigm for quantitative parameter mapping in MRI. Parameter mapping techniques, such as diffusion MRI and quantitative MRI, have the potential to robustly and repeatably measure biologically-relevant tissue maps that strongly relate to underlying microstructure. Quantitative maps are calculated by fitting a model to multiple images, e.g. with least-squares or machine learning. However, the overwhelming majority of model fitting techniques assume that each voxel is independent, ignoring any co-dependencies in the data. This makes model fitting sensitive to voxelwise measurement noise, hampering reliability and repeatability. We propose a self-supervised deep variational approach that breaks the assumption of independent pixels, leveraging redundancies in the data to effectively perform data-driven regularisation of quantitative maps. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms current model fitting techniques in dMRI simulations and real data. Especially with a Gaussian mixture prior, our model enables sharper quantitative maps, revealing finer anatomical details that are not presented in the baselines. Our approach can hence support the clinical adoption of parameter mapping methods such as dMRI and qMRI.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in neural camera imaging pipelines have demonstrated notable progress. Nevertheless, the real-world imaging pipeline still faces challenges including the lack of joint optimization in system components, computational redundancies, and optical distortions such as lens shading.In light of this, we propose an end-to-end camera imaging pipeline (RealCamNet) to enhance real-world camera imaging performance. Our methodology diverges from conventional, fragmented multi-stage image signal processing towards end-to-end architecture. This architecture facilitates joint optimization across the full pipeline and the restoration of coordinate-biased distortions. RealCamNet is designed for high-quality conversion from RAW to RGB and compact image compression. Specifically, we deeply analyze coordinate-dependent optical distortions, e.g., vignetting and dark shading, and design a novel Coordinate-Aware Distortion Restoration (CADR) module to restore coordinate-biased distortions. Furthermore, we propose a Coordinate-Independent Mapping Compression (CIMC) module to implement tone mapping and redundant information compression. Existing datasets suffer from misalignment and overly idealized conditions, making them inadequate for training real-world imaging pipelines. Therefore, we collected a real-world imaging dataset. Experiment results show that RealCamNet achieves the best rate-distortion performance with lower inference latency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kepeng Xu, Li Xu, Gang He, Zhiqiang Zhang, Wenxin Yu, Shihao Wang, Dajiang Zhou, Yunsong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The rise of HDR-WCG display devices has highlighted the need to convert SDRTV to HDRTV, as most video sources are still in SDR. Existing methods primarily focus on designing neural networks to learn a single-style mapping from SDRTV to HDRTV. However, the limited information in SDRTV and the diversity of styles in real-world conversions render this process an ill-posed problem, thereby constraining the performance and generalization of these methods. Inspired by generative approaches, we propose a novel method for SDRTV to HDRTV conversion guided by real HDRTV priors. Despite the limited information in SDRTV, introducing real HDRTV as reference priors significantly constrains the solution space of the originally high-dimensional ill-posed problem. This shift transforms the task from solving an unreferenced prediction problem to making a referenced selection, thereby markedly enhancing the accuracy and reliability of the conversion process. Specifically, our approach comprises two stages: the first stage employs a Vector Quantized Generative Adversarial Network to capture HDRTV priors, while the second stage matches these priors to the input SDRTV content to recover realistic HDRTV outputs. We evaluate our method on public datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness with significant improvements in both objective and subjective metrics across real and synthetic datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Long Peng, Wenbo Li, Jiaming Guo, Xin Di, Haoze Sun, Yong Li, Renjing Pei, Yang Wang, Yang Cao, Zheng-Jun Zha</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (Real SR) aims to generate high-fidelity, detail-rich high-resolution (HR) images from low-resolution (LR) counterparts. Existing Real SR methods primarily focus on generating details from the LR RGB domain, often leading to a lack of richness or fidelity in fine details. In this paper, we pioneer the use of details hidden in RAW data to complement existing RGB-only methods, yielding superior outputs. We argue that key image processing steps in Image Signal Processing, such as denoising and demosaicing, inherently result in the loss of fine details in LR images, making LR RAW a valuable information source. To validate this, we present RealSR-RAW, a comprehensive dataset comprising over 10,000 pairs with LR and HR RGB images, along with corresponding LR RAW, captured across multiple smartphones under varying focal lengths and diverse scenes. Additionally, we propose a novel, general RAW adapter to efficiently integrate LR RAW data into existing CNNs, Transformers, and Diffusion-based Real SR models by suppressing the noise contained in LR RAW and aligning its distribution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that incorporating RAW data significantly enhances detail recovery and improves Real SR performance across ten evaluation metrics, including both fidelity and perception-oriented metrics. Our findings open a new direction for the Real SR task, with the dataset and code will be made available to support future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hmrishav Bandyopadhyay, Yi-Zhe Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Sketch animations offer a powerful medium for visual storytelling, from simple flip-book doodles to professional studio productions. While traditional animation requires teams of skilled artists to draw key frames and in-between frames, existing automation attempts still demand significant artistic effort through precise motion paths or keyframe specification. We present FlipSketch, a system that brings back the magic of flip-book animation -- just draw your idea and describe how you want it to move! Our approach harnesses motion priors from text-to-video diffusion models, adapting them to generate sketch animations through three key innovations: (i) fine-tuning for sketch-style frame generation, (ii) a reference frame mechanism that preserves visual integrity of input sketch through noise refinement, and (iii) a dual-attention composition that enables fluid motion without losing visual consistency. Unlike constrained vector animations, our raster frames support dynamic sketch transformations, capturing the expressive freedom of traditional animation. The result is an intuitive system that makes sketch animation as simple as doodling and describing, while maintaining the artistic essence of hand-drawn animation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Langrui Zhou, Ziteng Zhou, Xinyu Huang, Xiangyu Zhang, Huiru Wang, Guang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: In the last few years, with the rapid development of deep learning technologies, supervised methods based on convolutional neural networks have greatly enhanced the performance of medical image denoising. However, these methods require large quantities of noisy-clean image pairs for training, which greatly limits their practicality. Although some researchers have attempted to train denoising networks using only single noisy images, existing self-supervised methods, including blind-spot-based and data-splitting-based methods, heavily rely on the assumption that noise is pixel-wise independent. However, this assumption often does not hold in real-world medical images. Therefore, in the field of medical imaging, there remains a lack of simple and practical denoising methods that can achieve high-quality denoising performance using only single noisy images. In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised medical image denoising method, Neighboring Slice Noise2Noise (NS-N2N). The proposed method utilizes neighboring slices within a single noisy image volume to construct weighted training data, and then trains the denoising network using a self-supervised scheme with regional consistency loss and inter-slice continuity loss. NS-N2N only requires a single noisy image volume obtained from one medical imaging procedure to achieve high-quality denoising of the image volume itself. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised denoising methods in both denoising performance and processing efficiency. Furthermore, since NS-N2N operates solely in the image domain, it is free from device-specific issues such as reconstruction geometry, making it easier to apply in various clinical practices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pandiyaraju V, Santhosh Malarvannan, Shravan Venkatraman, Abeshek A, Priyadarshini B, Kannan A</p>
<p>Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy is a leading cause of blindness around the world and demands precise AI-based diagnostic tools. Traditional loss functions in multi-class classification, such as Categorical Cross-Entropy (CCE), are very common but break down with class imbalance, especially in cases with inherently challenging or overlapping classes, which leads to biased and less sensitive models. Since a heavy imbalance exists in the number of examples for higher severity stage 4 diabetic retinopathy, etc., classes compared to those very early stages like class 0, achieving class balance is key. For this purpose, we propose the Adaptive Hybrid Focal-Entropy Loss which combines the ideas of focal loss and entropy loss with adaptive weighting in order to focus on minority classes and highlight the challenging samples. The state-of-the art models applied for diabetic retinopathy detection with AHFE revealed good performance improvements, indicating the top performances of ResNet50 at 99.79%, DenseNet121 at 98.86%, Xception at 98.92%, MobileNetV2 at 97.84%, and InceptionV3 at 93.62% accuracy. This sheds light into how AHFE promotes enhancement in AI-driven diagnostics for complex and imbalanced medical datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xu Cao, Wenqian Ye, Kenny Moise, Megan Coffee</p>
<p>Abstract: In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic and amid accelerating climate change, emerging infectious diseases, particularly those arising from zoonotic spillover, remain a global threat. Mpox (caused by the monkeypox virus) is a notable example of a zoonotic infection that often goes undiagnosed, especially as its rash progresses through stages, complicating detection across diverse populations with different presentations. In August 2024, the WHO Director-General declared the mpox outbreak a public health emergency of international concern for a second time. Despite the deployment of deep learning techniques for detecting diseases from skin lesion images, a robust and publicly accessible foundation model for mpox diagnosis is still lacking due to the unavailability of open-source mpox skin lesion images, multimodal clinical data, and specialized training pipelines. To address this gap, we propose MpoxVLM, a vision-language model (VLM) designed to detect mpox by analyzing both skin lesion images and patient clinical information. MpoxVLM integrates the CLIP visual encoder, an enhanced Vision Transformer (ViT) classifier for skin lesions, and LLaMA-2-7B models, pre-trained and fine-tuned on visual instruction-following question-answer pairs from our newly released mpox skin lesion dataset. Our work achieves 90.38% accuracy for mpox detection, offering a promising pathway to improve early diagnostic accuracy in combating mpox.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ryan Benkert, Mohit Prabhushankar, Ghassan AlRegib</p>
<p>Abstract: The performance of active learning algorithms can be improved in two ways. The often used and intuitive way is by reducing the overall error rate within the test set. The second way is to ensure that correct predictions are not forgotten when the training set is increased in between rounds. The former is measured by the accuracy of the model and the latter is captured in negative flips between rounds. Negative flips are samples that are correctly predicted when trained with the previous/smaller dataset and incorrectly predicted after additional samples are labeled. In this paper, we discuss improving the performance of active learning algorithms both in terms of prediction accuracy and negative flips. The first observation we make in this paper is that negative flips and overall error rates are decoupled and reducing one does not necessarily imply that the other is reduced. Our observation is important as current active learning algorithms do not consider negative flips directly and implicitly assume the opposite. The second observation is that performing targeted active learning on subsets of the unlabeled pool has a significant impact on the behavior of the active learning algorithm and influences both negative flips and prediction accuracy. We then develop ROSE - a plug-in algorithm that utilizes a small labeled validation set to restrict arbitrary active learning acquisition functions to negative flips within the unlabeled pool. We show that integrating a validation set results in a significant performance boost in terms of accuracy, negative flip rate reduction, or both.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arushi Gupta, Rafal Kocielnik, Jiayun Wang, Firdavs Nasriddinov, Cherine Yang, Elyssa Wong, Anima Anandkumar, Andrew Hung</p>
<p>Abstract: During surgical training, real-time feedback from trainers to trainees is important for preventing errors and enhancing long-term skill acquisition. Accurately predicting the effectiveness of this feedback, specifically whether it leads to a change in trainee behavior, is crucial for developing methods for improving surgical training and education. However, relying on human annotations to assess feedback effectiveness is laborious and prone to biases, underscoring the need for an automated, scalable, and objective method. Creating such an automated system poses challenges, as it requires an understanding of both the verbal feedback delivered by the trainer and the visual context of the real-time surgical scene. To address this, we propose a method that integrates information from transcribed verbal feedback and corresponding surgical video to predict feedback effectiveness. Our findings show that both transcribed feedback and surgical video are individually predictive of trainee behavior changes, and their combination achieves an AUROC of 0.70+/-0.02, improving prediction accuracy by up to 6.6%. Additionally, we introduce self-supervised fine-tuning as a strategy for enhancing surgical video representation learning, which is scalable and further enhances prediction performance. Our results demonstrate the potential of multi-modal learning to advance the automated assessment of surgical feedback.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maneesha Perera, Julian De Hoog, Kasun Bandara, Saman Halgamuge</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate forecasts of distributed solar generation are necessary to reduce negative impacts resulting from the increased uptake of distributed solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. However, the high variability of solar generation over short time intervals (seconds to minutes) caused by cloud movement makes this forecasting task difficult. To address this, using cloud images, which capture the second-to-second changes in cloud cover affecting solar generation, has shown promise. Recently, deep neural networks with "attention" that focus on important regions of an image have been applied with success in many computer vision applications. However, their use for forecasting cloud movement has not yet been extensively explored. In this work, we propose an attention-based convolutional long short-term memory network to forecast cloud movement and apply an existing self-attention-based method previously proposed for video prediction to forecast cloud movement. We investigate and discuss the impact of cloud forecasts from attention-based methods towards forecasting distributed solar generation, compared to cloud forecasts from non-attention-based methods. We further provide insights into the different solar forecast performances that can be achieved for high and low altitude clouds. We find that for clouds at high altitudes, the cloud predictions obtained using attention-based methods result in solar forecast skill score improvements of 5.86% or more compared to non-attention-based methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> William Huang, Yifeng Jiang, Tom Van Wouwe, C. Karen Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated significant promise in various generative tasks; however, they often struggle to satisfy challenging constraints. Our approach addresses this limitation by rethinking training-free loss-guided diffusion from an optimization perspective. We formulate a series of constrained optimizations throughout the inference process of a diffusion model. In each optimization, we allow the sample to take multiple steps along the gradient of the proxy constraint function until we can no longer trust the proxy, according to the variance at each diffusion level. Additionally, we estimate the state manifold of diffusion model to allow for early termination when the sample starts to wander away from the state manifold at each diffusion step. Trust sampling effectively balances between following the unconditional diffusion model and adhering to the loss guidance, enabling more flexible and accurate constrained generation. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method through extensive experiments on complex tasks, and in drastically different domains of images and 3D motion generation, showing significant improvements over existing methods in terms of generation quality.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei-Hsiang Lien, Benedictus Kent Chandra, Robin Fischer, Ya-Hui Tang, Shiann-Jang Wang, Wei-En Hsu, Li-Chen Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, with the rapid development of augmented reality (AR) technology, there is an increasing demand for multi-user collaborative experiences. Unlike for single-user experiences, ensuring the spatial localization of every user and maintaining synchronization and consistency of positioning and orientation across multiple users is a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a multi-user localization system based on ORB-SLAM2 using monocular RGB images as a development platform based on the Unity 3D game engine. This system not only performs user localization but also places a common virtual object on a planar surface (such as table) in the environment so that every user holds a proper perspective view of the object. These generated virtual objects serve as reference points for multi-user position synchronization. The positioning information is passed among every user's AR devices via a central server, based on which the relative position and movement of other users in the space of a specific user are presented via virtual avatars all with respect to these virtual objects. In addition, we use deep learning techniques to estimate the depth map of an image from a single RGB image to solve occlusion problems in AR applications, making virtual objects appear more natural in AR scenes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenjin Guo, Donglai Liu, Weiying Xie, Yunsong Li, Xuefei Ning, Zihan Meng, Shulin Zeng, Jie Lei, Zhenman Fang, Yu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural network training is a memory- and compute-intensive task. Quantization, which enables low-bitwidth formats in training, can significantly mitigate the workload. To reduce quantization error, recent methods have developed new data formats and additional pre-processing operations on quantizers. However, it remains quite challenging to achieve high accuracy and efficiency simultaneously. In this paper, we explore sub-8-bit integer training from its essence of gradient descent optimization. Our integer training framework includes two components: ShiftQuant to realize accurate gradient estimation, and L1 normalization to smoothen the loss landscape. ShiftQuant attains performance that approaches the theoretical upper bound of group quantization. Furthermore, it liberates group quantization from inefficient memory rearrangement. The L1 normalization facilitates the implementation of fully quantized normalization layers with impressive convergence accuracy. Our method frees sub-8-bit integer training from pre-processing and supports general devices. This framework achieves negligible accuracy loss across various neural networks and tasks ($0.92\%$ on 4-bit ResNets, $0.61\%$ on 6-bit Transformers). The prototypical implementation of ShiftQuant achieves more than $1.85\times/15.3\%$ performance improvement on CPU/GPU compared to its FP16 counterparts, and $33.9\%$ resource consumption reduction on FPGA than the FP16 counterparts. The proposed fully-quantized L1 normalization layers achieve more than $35.54\%$ improvement in throughout on CPU compared to traditional L2 normalization layers. Moreover, theoretical analysis verifies the advancement of our method.</p>

<p>Abstract: Although quantization for linear layers has been widely used, its application to accelerate the attention process remains limited. SageAttention utilizes 8-bit matrix multiplication, 16-bit matrix multiplication with 16-bit accumulator, and precision-enhancing methods, implementing an accurate and 2x speedup kernel compared to FlashAttention2. To further enhance the efficiency of attention computation while maintaining precision, we propose SageAttention2, which utilizes significantly faster 4-bit matrix multiplication (Matmul) alongside additional precision-enhancing techniques. First, we propose to quantize matrixes $(Q, K)$ to INT4 in a warp-level granularity and quantize matrixes $(\widetilde P, V)$ to FP8. Second, we propose a method to smooth $Q$ and $V$, enhancing the accuracy of attention with INT4 $QK$ and FP8 $PV$. Third, we analyze the quantization accuracy across timesteps and layers, then propose an adaptive quantization method to ensure the end-to-end metrics over various models. The operations per second (OPS) of SageAttention2 surpass FlashAttention2 and xformers by about 3x and 5x on RTX4090, respectively. Comprehensive experiments confirm that our approach incurs negligible end-to-end metrics loss across diverse models, including those for large language processing, image generation, and video generation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fatemeh Omidian, Athena Abdi</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a multi-level approximate computing approach for real-time traffic sign recognition in autonomous vehicles called AppSign. Since autonomous vehicles are real-time systems, they must gather environmental information and process them instantaneously to respond properly. However, due to the limited resources of these systems, executing computation-intensive algorithms such as deep-learning schemes that lead to precise output is impossible and takes a long time. To tackle this, imprecise computation schemes compromise the complexity and real-time operations. In this context, AppSign presents a multi-level approximate computing scheme to balance the accuracy and computation cost of the computation-intensive schemes and make them appropriate for real-time applications. AppSign is applied to the CNN-based traffic sign recognition unit by approximating the convolution operation of CNN which is the primal solution for image processing applications. In AppSign a novel approximate multiplication method called "TIRuD" is proposed that truncates the operations while keeping the accuracy acceptable. Moreover, it provides the adaptive approximation of the underlying CNN by involving various levels of computation and considering different approximation methods. The efficiency of the proposed AppSign, in real-time traffic sign recognition, is evaluated through several experiments. Based on these experiments, our proposed TIRuD reduces the accuracy by about $10\%$ while saving execution time about $64\%$ over the exact multiplication, averagely. Moreover, employing our proposed hierarchical approximation in various model layers outperforms the exact computation $27.78\%$ considering "AoC" that joins accuracy and computation cost in a parameter.</p>

<p>Abstract: The prevailing of artificial intelligence-of-things calls for higher energy-efficient edge computing paradigms, such as neuromorphic agents leveraging brain-inspired spiking neural network (SNN) models based on spatiotemporally sparse binary activations. However, the lack of efficient and high-accuracy deep SNN learning algorithms prevents them from practical edge deployments with a strictly bounded cost. In this paper, we propose a spatiotemporal orthogonal propagation (STOP) algorithm to tack this challenge. Our algorithm enables fully synergistic learning of synaptic weights as well as firing thresholds and leakage factors in spiking neurons to improve SNN accuracy, while under a unified temporally-forward trace-based framework to mitigate the huge memory requirement for storing neural states of all time-steps in the forward pass. Characteristically, the spatially-backward neuronal errors and temporally-forward traces propagate orthogonally to and independently of each other, substantially reducing computational overhead. Our STOP algorithm obtained high recognition accuracies of 99.53%, 94.84%, 74.92%, 98.26% and 77.10% on the MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, DVS-Gesture and DVS-CIFAR10 datasets with adequate SNNs of intermediate scales from LeNet-5 to ResNet-18. Compared with other deep SNN training works, our method is more plausible for edge intelligent scenarios where resources are limited but high-accuracy in-situ learning is desired.</p>

<p>Abstract: The accurate segmentation of retinal blood vessels plays a crucial role in the early diagnosis and treatment of various ophthalmic diseases. Designing a network model for this task requires meticulous tuning and extensive experimentation to handle the tiny and intertwined morphology of retinal blood vessels. To tackle this challenge, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods are developed to fully explore the space of potential network architectures and go after the most powerful one. Inspired by neuronal diversity which is the biological foundation of all kinds of intelligent behaviors in our brain, this paper introduces a novel and foundational approach to neural network design, termed ``neuron programming'', to automatically search neuronal types into a network to enhance a network's representation ability at the neuronal level, which is complementary to architecture-level enhancement done by NAS. Additionally, to mitigate the time and computational intensity of neuron programming, we develop a hypernetwork that leverages the search-derived architectural information to predict optimal neuronal configurations. Comprehensive experiments validate that neuron programming can achieve competitive performance in retinal blood segmentation, demonstrating the strong potential of neuronal diversity in medical image analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiawei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper builds upon our previous work on the Reconciled Polynomial Network (RPN). The original RPN model was designed under the assumption of input data independence, presuming the independence among both individual instances within data batches and attributes in each data instance. However, this assumption often proves invalid for function learning tasks involving complex, interdependent data such as language, images, time series, and graphs. Ignoring such data interdependence may inevitably lead to significant performance degradation.
  To overcome these limitations, we introduce the new Reconciled Polynomial Network (version 2), namely RPN 2, in this paper. By incorporating data and structural interdependence functions, RPN 2 explicitly models data interdependence via new component functions in its architecture.
  This enhancement not only significantly improves RPN 2's learning performance but also substantially expands its unifying potential, enabling it to encompass a broader range of contemporary dominant backbone models within its canonical representation. These backbones include, but are not limited to, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), graph neural networks (GNNs), and Transformers. Our analysis reveals that the fundamental distinctions among these backbone models primarily stem from their diverse approaches to defining the interdependence functions. Furthermore, this unified representation opens up new opportunities for designing innovative architectures with the potential to surpass the performance of these dominant backbones.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce Freqformer, a novel Transformer-based architecture designed for 3-D, high-definition visualization of human retinal circulation from a single scan in commercial optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA). Freqformer addresses the challenge of limited signal-to-noise ratio in OCTA volume by utilizing a complex-valued frequency-domain module (CFDM) and a simplified multi-head attention (Sim-MHA) mechanism. Using merged volumes as ground truth, Freqformer enables accurate reconstruction of retinal vasculature across the depth planes, allowing for 3-D quantification of capillary segments (count, density, and length). Our method outperforms state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and several Transformer-based models, with superior performance in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index measure (SSIM), and learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS). Furthermore, Freqformer demonstrates excellent generalizability across lower scanning density, effectively enhancing OCTA scans with larger fields of view (from 3$\times$3 $mm^{2}$ to 6$\times$6 $mm^{2}$ and 12$\times$12 $mm^{2}$). These results suggest that Freqformer can significantly improve the understanding and characterization of retinal circulation, offering potential clinical applications in diagnosing and managing retinal vascular diseases.</p>

<p>Abstract: Splenomegaly, the enlargement of the spleen, is an important clinical indicator for various associated medical conditions, such as sickle cell disease (SCD). Spleen length measured from 2D ultrasound is the most widely used metric for characterising spleen size. However, it is still considered a surrogate measure, and spleen volume remains the gold standard for assessing spleen size. Accurate spleen volume measurement typically requires 3D imaging modalities, such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, but these are not widely available, especially in the Global South which has a high prevalence of SCD. In this work, we introduce a deep learning pipeline, DeepSPV, for precise spleen volume estimation from single or dual 2D ultrasound images. The pipeline involves a segmentation network and a variational autoencoder for learning low-dimensional representations from the estimated segmentations. We investigate three approaches for spleen volume estimation and our best model achieves 86.62%/92.5% mean relative volume accuracy (MRVA) under single-view/dual-view settings, surpassing the performance of human experts. In addition, the pipeline can provide confidence intervals for the volume estimates as well as offering benefits in terms of interpretability, which further support clinicians in decision-making when identifying splenomegaly. We evaluate the full pipeline using a highly realistic synthetic dataset generated by a diffusion model, achieving an overall MRVA of 83.0% from a single 2D ultrasound image. Our proposed DeepSPV is the first work to use deep learning to estimate 3D spleen volume from 2D ultrasound images and can be seamlessly integrated into the current clinical workflow for spleen assessment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyi Yan, Dongming Wu, Wencheng Han, Junpeng Jiang, Xia Zhou, Kun Zhan, Cheng-zhong Xu, Jianbing Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous driving evaluation requires simulation environments that closely replicate actual road conditions, including real-world sensory data and responsive feedback loops. However, many existing simulations need to predict waypoints along fixed routes on public datasets or synthetic photorealistic data, \ie, open-loop simulation usually lacks the ability to assess dynamic decision-making. While the recent efforts of closed-loop simulation offer feedback-driven environments, they cannot process visual sensor inputs or produce outputs that differ from real-world data. To address these challenges, we propose DrivingSphere, a realistic and closed-loop simulation framework. Its core idea is to build 4D world representation and generate real-life and controllable driving scenarios. In specific, our framework includes a Dynamic Environment Composition module that constructs a detailed 4D driving world with a format of occupancy equipping with static backgrounds and dynamic objects, and a Visual Scene Synthesis module that transforms this data into high-fidelity, multi-view video outputs, ensuring spatial and temporal consistency. By providing a dynamic and realistic simulation environment, DrivingSphere enables comprehensive testing and validation of autonomous driving algorithms, ultimately advancing the development of more reliable autonomous cars. The benchmark will be publicly released.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yucong Meng, Zhiwei Yang, Minghong Duan, Yonghong Shi, Zhijian Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a crucial tool for clinical diagnosis while facing the challenge of long scanning time. To reduce the acquisition time, fast MRI reconstruction aims to restore high-quality images from the undersampled k-space. Existing methods typically train deep learning models to map the undersampled data to artifact-free MRI images. However, these studies often overlook the unique properties of k-space and directly apply general networks designed for image processing to k-space recovery, leaving the precise learning of k-space largely underexplored. In this work, we propose a continuous k-space recovery network from a new perspective of implicit neural representation with image domain guidance, which boosts the performance of MRI reconstruction. Specifically, (1) an implicit neural representation based encoder-decoder structure is customized to continuously query unsampled k-values. (2) an image guidance module is designed to mine the semantic information from the low-quality MRI images to further guide the k-space recovery. (3) a multi-stage training strategy is proposed to recover dense k-space progressively. Extensive experiments conducted on CC359, fastMRI, and IXI datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and its superiority over other competitors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Baljinnyam Dayan</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in medical image analysis have predominantly relied on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), achieving impressive performance in chest X-ray classification tasks, such as the 92% AUC reported by AutoThorax-Net and the 88% AUC achieved by ChexNet in classifcation tasks. However, in the medical field, even small improvements in accuracy can have significant clinical implications. This study explores the application of Vision Transformers (ViT), a state-of-the-art architecture in machine learning, to chest X-ray analysis, aiming to push the boundaries of diagnostic accuracy. I present a comparative analysis of two ViT-based approaches: one utilizing full chest X-ray images and another focusing on segmented lung regions. Experiments demonstrate that both methods surpass the performance of traditional CNN-based models, with the full-image ViT achieving up to 97.83% accuracy and the lung-segmented ViT reaching 96.58% accuracy in classifcation of diseases on three label and AUC of 94.54% when label numbers are increased to eight. Notably, the full-image approach showed superior performance across all metrics, including precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC. These findings suggest that Vision Transformers can effectively capture relevant features from chest X-rays without the need for explicit lung segmentation, potentially simplifying the preprocessing pipeline while maintaining high accuracy. This research contributes to the growing body of evidence supporting the efficacy of transformer-based architectures in medical image analysis and highlights their potential to enhance diagnostic precision in clinical settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joona Pohjonen, Abderrahim-Oussama Batouche, Antti Rannikko, Kevin Sandeman, Andrew Erickson, Esa Pitkanen, Tuomas Mirtti</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models are trained on massive amounts of data to distinguish complex patterns and can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks with minimal computational resources. Here, we develop a foundation model for prostate cancer digital pathology called HistoEncoder by pre-training on 48 million prostate tissue tile images. We demonstrate that HistoEncoder features extracted from tile images with similar histological patterns map closely together in the feature space. HistoEncoder outperforms models pre-trained with natural images, even without fine-tuning or with 1000 times less training data. We describe two use cases that leverage the capabilities of HistoEncoder by fine-tuning the model with a limited amount of data and computational resources. First, we show how HistoEncoder can be used to automatically annotate large-scale datasets with high accuracy. Second, we combine histomics with commonly used clinical nomograms, significantly improving prostate cancer-specific death survival models. Foundation models such as HistoEncoder can allow organizations with limited resources to build effective clinical software tools without needing extensive datasets or significant amounts of computing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lijie Hu, Chenyang Ren, Huanyi Xie, Khouloud Saadi, Shu Yang, Jingfeng Zhang, Di Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language models (MLLMs) are always trained on data from diverse and unreliable sources, which may contain misaligned or mislabeled text-image pairs. This frequently causes robustness issues and hallucinations, leading to performance degradation. Data valuation is an efficient way to detect and trace these misalignments. Nevertheless, existing methods are computationally expensive for MLLMs. While computationally efficient, the classical influence functions are inadequate for contrastive learning models because they were originally designed for pointwise loss. Additionally, contrastive learning involves minimizing the distance between the modalities of positive samples and maximizing the distance between the modalities of negative samples. This requires us to evaluate the influence of samples from both perspectives. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the Extended Influence Function for Contrastive Loss (ECIF), an influence function crafted for contrastive loss. ECIF considers both positive and negative samples and provides a closed-form approximation of contrastive learning models, eliminating the need for retraining. Building upon ECIF, we develop a series of algorithms for data evaluation in MLLM, misalignment detection, and misprediction trace-back tasks. Experimental results demonstrate our ECIF advances the transparency and interpretability of MLLMs by offering a more accurate assessment of data impact and model alignment compared to traditional baseline methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyi Zhang, Li Shen, Sen Zhang, Deheng Ye, Yong Luo, Miaojing Shi, Bo Du, Dacheng Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: Aligning diffusion models with downstream objectives is essential for their practical applications. However, standard alignment methods often struggle with step generalization when directly applied to few-step diffusion models, leading to inconsistent performance across different denoising step scenarios. To address this, we introduce Stepwise Diffusion Policy Optimization (SDPO), a novel alignment method tailored for few-step diffusion models. Unlike prior approaches that rely on a single sparse reward from only the final step of each denoising trajectory for trajectory-level optimization, SDPO incorporates dense reward feedback at every intermediate step. By learning the differences in dense rewards between paired samples, SDPO facilitates stepwise optimization of few-step diffusion models, ensuring consistent alignment across all denoising steps. To promote stable and efficient training, SDPO introduces an online reinforcement learning framework featuring several novel strategies designed to effectively exploit the stepwise granularity of dense rewards. Experimental results demonstrate that SDPO consistently outperforms prior methods in reward-based alignment across diverse step configurations, underscoring its robust step generalization capabilities.

<p>Abstract: In order to address issues with manual vote counting during election procedures, this study intends to examine the viability of using advanced image processing techniques for automated voter counting. The study aims to shed light on how automated systems that utilize cutting-edge technologies like OpenCV, CVZone, and the MOG2 algorithm could greatly increase the effectiveness and openness of electoral operations. The empirical findings demonstrate how automated voter counting can enhance voting processes and rebuild public confidence in election outcomes, particularly in places where trust is low. The study also emphasizes how rigorous metrics, such as the F1 score, should be used to systematically compare the accuracy of automated systems against manual counting methods. This methodology enables a detailed comprehension of the differences in performance between automated and human counting techniques by providing a nuanced assessment. The incorporation of said measures serves to reinforce an extensive assessment structure, guaranteeing the legitimacy and dependability of automated voting systems inside the electoral sphere.</p>

<p>Abstract: Adversarial robustness of neural networks is an increasingly important area of research, combining studies on computer vision models, large language models (LLMs), and others. With the release of JPEG AI - the first standard for end-to-end neural image compression (NIC) methods - the question of its robustness has become critically significant. JPEG AI is among the first international, real-world applications of neural-network-based models to be embedded in consumer devices. However, research on NIC robustness has been limited to open-source codecs and a narrow range of attacks. This paper proposes a new methodology for measuring NIC robustness to adversarial attacks. We present the first large-scale evaluation of JPEG AI's robustness, comparing it with other NIC models. Our evaluation results and code are publicly available online (link is hidden for a blind review).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Meng Zhou, Yuxuan Zhang, Xiaolan Xu, Jiayi Wang, Farzad Khalvati</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal medical image fusion is a crucial task that combines complementary information from different imaging modalities into a unified representation, thereby enhancing diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning. While deep learning methods, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers, have significantly advanced fusion performance, some of the existing CNN-based methods fall short in capturing fine-grained multiscale and edge features, leading to suboptimal feature integration. Transformer-based models, on the other hand, are computationally intensive in both the training and fusion stages, making them impractical for real-time clinical use. Moreover, the clinical application of fused images remains unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel CNN-based architecture that addresses these limitations by introducing a Dilated Residual Attention Network Module for effective multiscale feature extraction, coupled with a gradient operator to enhance edge detail learning. To ensure fast and efficient fusion, we present a parameter-free fusion strategy based on the weighted nuclear norm of softmax, which requires no additional computations during training or inference. Extensive experiments, including a downstream brain tumor classification task, demonstrate that our approach outperforms various baseline methods in terms of visual quality, texture preservation, and fusion speed, making it a possible practical solution for real-world clinical applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Axel Elaldi, Guido Gerig, Neel Dey</p>
<p>Abstract: Each voxel in a diffusion MRI (dMRI) image contains a spherical signal corresponding to the direction and strength of water diffusion in the brain. This paper advances the analysis of such spatio-spherical data by developing convolutional network layers that are equivariant to the $\mathbf{E(3) \times SO(3)}$ group and account for the physical symmetries of dMRI including rotations, translations, and reflections of space alongside voxel-wise rotations. Further, neuronal fibers are typically antipodally symmetric, a fact we leverage to construct highly efficient spatio-hemispherical graph convolutions to accelerate the analysis of high-dimensional dMRI data. In the context of sparse spherical fiber deconvolution to recover white matter microstructure, our proposed equivariant network layers yield substantial performance and efficiency gains, leading to better and more practical resolution of crossing neuronal fibers and fiber tractography. These gains are experimentally consistent across both simulation and in vivo human datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Efficient acquisition of real-world embodied data has been increasingly critical. However, large-scale demonstrations captured by remote operation tend to take extremely high costs and fail to scale up the data size in an efficient manner. Sampling the episodes under a simulated environment is a promising way for large-scale collection while existing simulators fail to high-fidelity modeling on texture and physics. To address these limitations, we introduce the RoboGSim, a real2sim2real robotic simulator, powered by 3D Gaussian Splatting and the physics engine. RoboGSim mainly includes four parts: Gaussian Reconstructor, Digital Twins Builder, Scene Composer, and Interactive Engine. It can synthesize the simulated data with novel views, objects, trajectories, and scenes. RoboGSim also provides an online, reproducible, and safe evaluation for different manipulation policies. The real2sim and sim2real transfer experiments show a high consistency in the texture and physics. Moreover, the effectiveness of synthetic data is validated under the real-world manipulated tasks. We hope RoboGSim serves as a closed-loop simulator for fair comparison on policy learning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bin-Bin Zhang, Dongheng Zhang, Yadong Li, Yang Hu, Yan Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Human gesture recognition with Radio Frequency (RF) signals has attained acclaim due to the omnipresence, privacy protection, and broad coverage nature of RF signals. These gesture recognition systems rely on neural networks trained with a large number of labeled data. However, the recognition model trained with data under certain conditions would suffer from significant performance degradation when applied in practical deployment, which limits the application of gesture recognition systems. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised domain adaptation framework for RF-based gesture recognition aiming to enhance the performance of the recognition model in new conditions by making effective use of the unlabeled data from new conditions. We first propose pseudo-labeling and consistency regularization to utilize unlabeled data for model training and eliminate the feature discrepancies in different domains. Then we propose a confidence constraint loss to enhance the effectiveness of pseudo-labeling, and design two corresponding data augmentation methods based on the characteristic of the RF signals to strengthen the performance of the consistency regularization, which can make the framework more effective and robust. Furthermore, we propose a cross-match loss to integrate the pseudo-labeling and consistency regularization, which makes the whole framework simple yet effective. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework could achieve 4.35% and 2.25% accuracy improvement comparing with the state-of-the-art methods on public WiFi dataset and millimeter wave (mmWave) radar dataset, respectively.</p>

In this work, we study the underrepresented task of generative incremental few-shot learning. To effectively handle the inherent challenges of incremental learning and few-shot learning, we propose a novel framework named ConPro that leverages the two-player nature of GANs. Specifically, we design a conservative generator that preserves past knowledge in parameter and compute efficient manner, and a progressive discriminator that learns to reason semantic distances between past and present task samples, minimizing overfitting with few data points and pursuing good forward transfer. We present experiments to validate the effectiveness of ConPro.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generalizability to unseen forgery types is crucial for face forgery detectors. Recent works have made significant progress in terms of generalization by synthetic forgery data augmentation. In this work, we explore another path for improving the generalization. Our goal is to reduce the features that are easy to learn in the training phase, so as to reduce the risk of overfitting on specific forgery types. Specifically, in our method, a teacher network takes as input the face images and generates an attention map of the deep features by a diverse multihead attention ViT. The attention map is used to guide a student network to focus on the low-attended features by reducing the highly-attended deep features. A deep feature mixup strategy is also proposed to synthesize forgeries in the feature domain. Experiments demonstrate that, without data augmentation, our method is able to achieve promising performances on unseen forgeries and highly compressed data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Image denoising is a fundamental problem in computational photography, where achieving high perception with low distortion is highly demanding. Current methods either struggle with perceptual quality or suffer from significant distortion. Recently, the emerging diffusion model has achieved state-of-the-art performance in various tasks and demonstrates great potential for image denoising. However, stimulating diffusion models for image denoising is not straightforward and requires solving several critical problems. For one thing, the input inconsistency hinders the connection between diffusion models and image denoising. For another, the content inconsistency between the generated image and the desired denoised image introduces distortion. To tackle these problems, we present a novel strategy called the Diffusion Model for Image Denoising (DMID) by understanding and rethinking the diffusion model from a denoising perspective. Our DMID strategy includes an adaptive embedding method that embeds the noisy image into a pre-trained unconditional diffusion model and an adaptive ensembling method that reduces distortion in the denoised image. Our DMID strategy achieves state-of-the-art performance on both distortion-based and perception-based metrics, for both Gaussian and real-world image denoising.The code is available at https://github.com/Li-Tong-621/DMID.</p>

<p>Abstract: The digital image forensics based research works in literature classifying natural and computer generated images primarily focuses on binary tasks. These tasks typically involve the classification of natural images versus computer graphics images only or natural images versus GAN generated images only, but not natural images versus both types of generated images simultaneously. Furthermore, despite the support of advanced convolutional neural networks and transformer based architectures that can achieve impressive classification accuracies for this forensic classification task of distinguishing natural and computer generated images, these models are seen to fail over the images that have undergone post-processing operations intended to deceive forensic algorithms, such as JPEG compression, Gaussian noise addition, etc. In this digital image forensic based work to distinguish between natural and computer-generated images encompassing both computer graphics and GAN generated images, we propose a robust forensic classifier framework leveraging enriched vision transformers. By employing a fusion approach for the networks operating in RGB and YCbCr color spaces, we achieve higher classification accuracy and robustness against the post-processing operations of JPEG compression and addition of Gaussian noise. Our approach outperforms baselines, demonstrating 94.25% test accuracy with significant performance gains in individual class accuracies. Visualizations of feature representations and attention maps reveal improved separability as well as improved information capture relevant to the forensic task. This work advances the state-of-the-art in image forensics by providing a generalized and resilient solution to distinguish between natural and generated images.</p>

<p>Abstract: Transformer-based methods have shown impressive performance in image restoration tasks, such as image super-resolution and denoising. However, we find that these networks can only utilize a limited spatial range of input information through attribution analysis. This implies that the potential of Transformer is still not fully exploited in existing networks. In order to activate more input pixels for better restoration, we propose a new Hybrid Attention Transformer (HAT). It combines both channel attention and window-based self-attention schemes, thus making use of their complementary advantages. Moreover, to better aggregate the cross-window information, we introduce an overlapping cross-attention module to enhance the interaction between neighboring window features. In the training stage, we additionally adopt a same-task pre-training strategy to further exploit the potential of the model for further improvement. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed modules. We further scale up the model to show that the performance of the SR task can be greatly improved. Besides, we extend HAT to more image restoration applications, including real-world image super-resolution, Gaussian image denoising and image compression artifacts reduction. Experiments on benchmark and real-world datasets demonstrate that our HAT achieves state-of-the-art performance both quantitatively and qualitatively.

<p>Abstract: In contrast to conventional visual question answering, video-grounded dialog necessitates a profound understanding of both dialog history and video content for accurate response generation. Despite commendable progress made by existing approaches, they still face the challenges of incrementally understanding complex dialog history and assimilating video information. In response to these challenges, we present an iterative search and reasoning framework, which consists of a textual encoder, a visual encoder, and a generator. Specifically, we devise a path search and aggregation strategy in the textual encoder, mining core cues from dialog history that are pivotal to understanding the posed questions. Concurrently, our visual encoder harnesses an iterative reasoning network to extract and emphasize critical visual markers from videos, enhancing the depth of visual comprehension. Finally, we utilize the pre-trained GPT-2 model as our answer generator to decode the mined hidden clues into coherent and contextualized answers. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our proposed framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manjary P. Gangan, Anoop Kadan, Lajish V L</p>
<p>Abstract: Image forensics research has recently witnessed a lot of advancements towards developing computational models capable of accurately detecting natural images captured by cameras and GAN generated images. However, it is also important to ensure whether these computational models are fair enough and do not produce biased outcomes that could eventually harm certain societal groups or cause serious security threats. Exploring fairness in image forensic algorithms is an initial step towards mitigating these biases. This study explores bias in visual transformer based image forensic algorithms that classify natural and GAN images, since visual transformers are recently being widely used in image classification based tasks, including in the area of image forensics. The proposed study procures bias evaluation corpora to analyze bias in gender, racial, affective, and intersectional domains using a wide set of individual and pairwise bias evaluation measures. Since the robustness of the algorithms against image compression is an important factor to be considered in forensic tasks, this study also analyzes the impact of image compression on model bias. Hence to study the impact of image compression on model bias, a two-phase evaluation setting is followed, where the experiments are carried out in uncompressed and compressed evaluation settings. The study could identify bias existences in the visual transformer based models distinguishing natural and GAN images, and also observes that image compression impacts model biases, predominantly amplifying the presence of biases in class GAN predictions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kevin Zhang, Sakshum Kulshrestha, Christopher Metzler</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite recent advances, developing general-purpose universal denoising and artifact-removal networks remains largely an open problem: Given fixed network weights, one inherently trades-off specialization at one task (e.g.,~removing Poisson noise) for performance at another (e.g.,~removing speckle noise). In addition, training such a network is challenging due to the curse of dimensionality: As one increases the dimensions of the specification-space (i.e.,~the number of parameters needed to describe the noise distribution) the number of unique specifications one needs to train for grows exponentially. Uniformly sampling this space will result in a network that does well at very challenging problem specifications but poorly at easy problem specifications, where even large errors will have a small effect on the overall mean squared error.
  In this work we propose training denoising networks using an adaptive-sampling/active-learning strategy. Our work improves upon a recently proposed universal denoiser training strategy by extending these results to higher dimensions and by incorporating a polynomial approximation of the true specification-loss landscape. This approximation allows us to reduce training times by almost two orders of magnitude. We test our method on simulated joint Poisson-Gaussian-Speckle noise and demonstrate that with our proposed training strategy, a single blind, generalist denoiser network can achieve peak signal-to-noise ratios within a uniform bound of specialized denoiser networks across a large range of operating conditions. We also capture a small dataset of images with varying amounts of joint Poisson-Gaussian-Speckle noise and demonstrate that a universal denoiser trained using our adaptive-sampling strategy outperforms uniformly trained baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nataliia Molchanova, Vatsal Raina, Andrey Malinin, Francesco La Rosa, Adrien Depeursinge, Mark Gales, Cristina Granziera, Henning Muller, Mara Graziani, Meritxell Bach Cuadra</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper explores uncertainty quantification (UQ) as an indicator of the trustworthiness of automated deep-learning (DL) tools in the context of white matter lesion (WML) segmentation from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Our study focuses on two principal aspects of uncertainty in structured output segmentation tasks. First, we postulate that a reliable uncertainty measure should indicate predictions likely to be incorrect with high uncertainty values. Second, we investigate the merit of quantifying uncertainty at different anatomical scales (voxel, lesion, or patient). We hypothesize that uncertainty at each scale is related to specific types of errors. Our study aims to confirm this relationship by conducting separate analyses for in-domain and out-of-domain settings. Our primary methodological contributions are (i) the development of novel measures for quantifying uncertainty at lesion and patient scales, derived from structural prediction discrepancies, and (ii) the extension of an error retention curve analysis framework to facilitate the evaluation of UQ performance at both lesion and patient scales. The results from a multi-centric MRI dataset of 444 patients demonstrate that our proposed measures more effectively capture model errors at the lesion and patient scales compared to measures that average voxel-scale uncertainty values.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yue Ma, Xiaodong Cun, Sen Liang, Jinbo Xing, Yingqing He, Chenyang Qi, Siran Chen, Qifeng Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-based video editing has recently attracted considerable interest in changing the style or replacing the objects with a similar structure. Beyond this, we demonstrate that properties such as shape, size, location, motion, etc., can also be edited in videos. Our key insight is that the keyframe transformations of the specific internal feature (e.g., edge maps of objects or human pose), can easily propagate to other frames to provide generation guidance. We thus propose MagicStick, a controllable video editing method that edits the video properties by utilizing the transformation on the extracted internal control signals. In detail, to keep the appearance, we inflate both the pretrained image diffusion model and ControlNet to the temporal dimension and train low-rank adaptions (LORA) layers to fit the specific scenes. Then, in editing, we perform an inversion and editing framework. Differently, finetuned ControlNet is introduced in both inversion and generation for attention guidance with the proposed attention remix between the spatial attention maps of inversion and editing. Yet succinct, our method is the first method to show the ability of video property editing from the pre-trained text-to-image model. We present experiments on numerous examples within our unified framework. We also compare with shape-aware text-based editing and handcrafted motion video generation, demonstrating our superior temporal consistency and editing capability than previous works.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaiyue Zhou, Ming Dong, Peiyuan Zhi, Shengjin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Numerous point-cloud understanding techniques focus on whole entities and have succeeded in obtaining satisfactory results and limited sparsity tolerance. However, these methods are generally sensitive to incomplete point clouds that are scanned with flaws or large gaps. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose an end-to-end architecture that compensates for and identifies partial point clouds on the fly. First, we propose a cascaded solution that integrates both the upstream and downstream networks simultaneously, allowing the task-oriented downstream to identify the points generated by the completion-oriented upstream. These two streams complement each other, resulting in improved performance for both completion and downstream-dependent tasks. Second, to explicitly understand the predicted points' pattern, we introduce hierarchical self-distillation (HSD), which can be applied to arbitrary hierarchy-based point cloud methods. HSD ensures that the deepest classifier with a larger perceptual field and longer code length provides additional regularization to intermediate ones rather than simply aggregating the multi-scale features, and therefore maximizing the mutual information between a teacher and students. We show the advantage of the self-distillation process in the hyperspaces based on the information bottleneck principle. On the classification task, our proposed method performs competitively on the synthetic dataset and achieves superior results on the challenging real-world benchmark when compared to the state-of-the-art models. Additional experiments also demonstrate the superior performance and generality of our framework on the part segmentation task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emilio Morales-Juarez, Gibran Fuentes-Pineda</p>
<p>Abstract: Although the capacity of deep generative models for image generation, such as Diffusion Models (DMs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), has dramatically improved in recent years, much of their success can be attributed to computationally expensive architectures. This has limited their adoption and use to research laboratories and companies with large resources, while significantly raising the carbon footprint for training, fine-tuning, and inference. In this work, we present a novel GAN architecture which we call LadaGAN. This architecture is based on a linear attention Transformer block named Ladaformer. The main component of this block is a linear additive-attention mechanism that computes a single attention vector per head instead of the quadratic dot-product attention. We employ Ladaformer in both the generator and discriminator, which reduces the computational complexity and overcomes the training instabilities often associated with Transformer GANs. LadaGAN consistently outperforms existing convolutional and Transformer GANs on benchmark datasets at different resolutions while being significantly more efficient. Moreover, LadaGAN shows competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art multi-step generative models (e.g. DMs) using orders of magnitude less computational resources.</p>

<p>Abstract: Digital pixel sensor (DPS) has evolved as a pivotal component in modern imaging systems and has the potential to revolutionize various fields such as medical imaging, astronomy, surveillance, IoT devices, etc. Compared to analog pixel sensors, the DPS offers high speed and good image quality. However, the introduced intrinsic complexity within each pixel, primarily attributed to the accommodation of the ADC circuit, engenders a substantial increase in the pixel pitch. Unfortunately, such a pronounced escalation in pixel pitch drastically undermines the feasibility of achieving high-density integration, which is an obstacle that significantly narrows down the field of potential applications. Nonetheless, designing compact conversion circuits along with strategic integration of 3D architectural paradigms can be a potential remedy to the prevailing situation. This review article presents a comprehensive overview of the vast area of DPS technology. The operating principles, advantages, and challenges of different types of DPS circuits have been analyzed. We categorize the schemes into several categories based on ADC operation. A comparative study based on different performance metrics has also been showcased for a well-rounded understanding.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the rapidly evolving area of image synthesis, a serious challenge is the presence of complex artifacts that compromise perceptual realism of synthetic images. To alleviate artifacts and improve quality of synthetic images, we fine-tune Vision-Language Model (VLM) as artifact classifier to automatically identify and classify a wide range of artifacts and provide supervision for further optimizing generative models. Specifically, we develop a comprehensive artifact taxonomy and construct a dataset of synthetic images with artifact annotations for fine-tuning VLM, named SynArtifact-1K. The fine-tuned VLM exhibits superior ability of identifying artifacts and outperforms the baseline by 25.66%. To our knowledge, this is the first time such end-to-end artifact classification task and solution have been proposed. Finally, we leverage the output of VLM as feedback to refine the generative model for alleviating artifacts. Visualization results and user study demonstrate that the quality of images synthesized by the refined diffusion model has been obviously improved.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, there have been frequent incidents of foreign objects intruding into railway and Airport runways. These objects can include pedestrians, vehicles, animals, and debris. This paper introduces an improved YOLOv5 architecture incorporating FasterNet and attention mechanisms to enhance the detection of foreign objects on railways and Airport runways. This study proposes a new dataset, AARFOD (Aero and Rail Foreign Object Detection), which combines two public datasets for detecting foreign objects in aviation and railway systems.The dataset aims to improve the recognition capabilities of foreign object targets. Experimental results on this large dataset have demonstrated significant performance improvements of the proposed model over the baseline YOLOv5 model, reducing computational requirements.Improved YOLO model shows a significant improvement in precision by 1.2%, recall rate by 1.0%, and mAP@.5 by 0.6%, while mAP@.5-.95 remained unchanged. The parameters were reduced by approximately 25.12%, and GFLOPs were reduced by about 10.63%. In the ablation experiment, it is found that the FasterNet module can significantly reduce the number of parameters of the model, and the reference of the attention mechanism can slow down the performance loss caused by lightweight.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiazhen Liu, Yuhan Fu, Ruobing Xie, Runquan Xie, Xingwu Sun, Fengzong Lian, Zhanhui Kang, Xirong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hallucinate, resulting in an emerging topic of visual hallucination evaluation (VHE). This paper contributes a ChatGPT-Prompted visual hallucination evaluation Dataset (PhD) for objective VHE at a large scale. The essence of VHE is to ask an MLLM questions about specific images to assess its susceptibility to hallucination. Depending on what to ask (objects, attributes, sentiment, etc.) and how the questions are asked, we structure PhD along two dimensions, i.e., task and mode. Five visual recognition tasks, ranging from low-level (object / attribute recognition) to middle-level (sentiment / position recognition and counting), are considered. Besides a normal visual QA mode, which we term PhD-base, PhD also asks questions with inaccurate context (PhD-iac) or with incorrect context (PhD-icc), or with AI-generated counter common sense images (PhD-ccs). We construct PhD by a ChatGPT-assisted semi-automated pipeline, encompassing four pivotal modules: task-specific hallucinatory item (hitem) selection, hitem-embedded question generation, inaccurate / incorrect context generation, and counter-common-sense (CCS) image generation. With over 14k daily images, 750 CCS images and 102k VQA triplets in total, PhD reveals considerable variability in MLLMs' performance across various modes and tasks, offering valuable insights into the nature of hallucination. As such, PhD stands as a potent tool not only for VHE but may also play a significant role in the refinement of MLLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lutao Jiang, Xu Zheng, Yuanhuiyi Lyu, Jiazhou Zhou, Lin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-3D synthesis has recently seen intriguing advances by combining the text-to-image priors with 3D representation methods, e.g., 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D GS), via Score Distillation Sampling (SDS). However, a hurdle of existing methods is the low efficiency, per-prompt optimization for a single 3D object. Therefore, it is imperative for a paradigm shift from per-prompt optimization to feed-forward generation for any unseen text prompts, which yet remains challenging. An obstacle is how to directly generate a set of millions of 3D Gaussians to represent a 3D object. This paper presents BrightDreamer, an end-to-end feed-forward approach that can achieve generalizable and fast (77 ms) text-to-3D generation. Our key idea is to formulate the generation process as estimating the 3D deformation from an anchor shape with predefined positions. For this, we first propose a Text-guided Shape Deformation (TSD) network to predict the deformed shape and its new positions, used as the centers (one attribute) of 3D Gaussians. To estimate the other four attributes (i.e., scaling, rotation, opacity, and SH), we then design a novel Text-guided Triplane Generator (TTG) to generate a triplane representation for a 3D object. The center of each Gaussian enables us to transform the spatial feature into the four attributes. The generated 3D Gaussians can be finally rendered at 705 frames per second. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing methods. Also, BrightDreamer possesses a strong semantic understanding capability even for complex text prompts. The code is available in the project page.</p>

<p>Abstract: Sugarcane, a key crop for the world's sugar industry, is prone to several diseases that have a substantial negative influence on both its yield and quality. To effectively manage and implement preventative initiatives, diseases must be detected promptly and accurately. In this study, we present a unique model called sugarcaneNet2024 that outperforms previous methods for automatically and quickly detecting sugarcane disease through leaf image processing. Our proposed model consolidates an optimized weighted average ensemble of seven customized and LASSO-regularized pre-trained models, particularly InceptionV3, InceptionResNetV2, DenseNet201, DenseNet169, Xception, and ResNet152V2. Initially, we added three more dense layers with 0.0001 LASSO regularization, three 30% dropout layers, and three batch normalizations with renorm enabled at the bottom of these pre-trained models to improve the performance. The accuracy of sugarcane leaf disease classification was greatly increased by this addition. Following this, several comparative studies between the average ensemble and individual models were carried out, indicating that the ensemble technique performed better. The average ensemble of all modified pre-trained models produced outstanding outcomes: 100%, 99%, 99%, and 99.45% for f1 score, precision, recall, and accuracy, respectively. Performance was further enhanced by the implementation of an optimized weighted average ensemble technique incorporated with grid search. This optimized sugarcaneNet2024 model performed the best for detecting sugarcane diseases, having achieved accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score of 99.67%, 100%, 100%, and 100% , respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junyi Wu, Weitai Kang, Hao Tang, Yuan Hong, Yan Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: To interpret Vision Transformers, post-hoc explanations assign salience scores to input pixels, providing human-understandable heatmaps. However, whether these interpretations reflect true rationales behind the model's output is still underexplored. To address this gap, we study the faithfulness criterion of explanations: the assigned salience scores should represent the influence of the corresponding input pixels on the model's predictions. To evaluate faithfulness, we introduce Salience-guided Faithfulness Coefficient (SaCo), a novel evaluation metric leveraging essential information of salience distribution. Specifically, we conduct pair-wise comparisons among distinct pixel groups and then aggregate the differences in their salience scores, resulting in a coefficient that indicates the explanation's degree of faithfulness. Our explorations reveal that current metrics struggle to differentiate between advanced explanation methods and Random Attribution, thereby failing to capture the faithfulness property. In contrast, our proposed SaCo offers a reliable faithfulness measurement, establishing a robust metric for interpretations. Furthermore, our SaCo demonstrates that the use of gradient and multi-layer aggregation can markedly enhance the faithfulness of attention-based explanation, shedding light on potential paths for advancing Vision Transformer explainability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siran Peng, Xiangyu Zhu, Haoyu Deng, Liang-Jian Deng, Zhen Lei</p>
<p>Abstract: Remote sensing image fusion aims to generate a high-resolution multi/hyper-spectral image by combining a high-resolution image with limited spectral data and a low-resolution image rich in spectral information. Current deep learning (DL) methods typically employ convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or Transformers for feature extraction and information integration. While CNNs are efficient, their limited receptive fields restrict their ability to capture global context. Transformers excel at learning global information but are computationally expensive. Recent advancements in the state space model (SSM), particularly Mamba, present a promising alternative by enabling global perception with low complexity. However, the potential of SSM for information integration remains largely unexplored. Therefore, we propose FusionMamba, an innovative method for efficient remote sensing image fusion. Our contributions are twofold. First, to effectively merge spatial and spectral features, we expand the single-input Mamba block to accommodate dual inputs, creating the FusionMamba block, which serves as a plug-and-play solution for information integration. Second, we incorporate Mamba and FusionMamba blocks into an interpretable network architecture tailored for remote sensing image fusion. Our designs utilize two U-shaped network branches, each primarily composed of four-directional Mamba blocks, to extract spatial and spectral features separately and hierarchically. The resulting feature maps are sufficiently merged in an auxiliary network branch constructed with FusionMamba blocks. Furthermore, we improve the representation of spectral information through an enhanced channel attention module. Quantitative and qualitative valuation results across six datasets demonstrate that our method achieves SOTA performance. The code is available at https://github.com/PSRben/FusionMamba.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ming Li, Taojiannan Yang, Huafeng Kuang, Jie Wu, Zhaoning Wang, Xuefeng Xiao, Chen Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: To enhance the controllability of text-to-image diffusion models, existing efforts like ControlNet incorporated image-based conditional controls. In this paper, we reveal that existing methods still face significant challenges in generating images that align with the image conditional controls. To this end, we propose ControlNet++, a novel approach that improves controllable generation by explicitly optimizing pixel-level cycle consistency between generated images and conditional controls. Specifically, for an input conditional control, we use a pre-trained discriminative reward model to extract the corresponding condition of the generated images, and then optimize the consistency loss between the input conditional control and extracted condition. A straightforward implementation would be generating images from random noises and then calculating the consistency loss, but such an approach requires storing gradients for multiple sampling timesteps, leading to considerable time and memory costs. To address this, we introduce an efficient reward strategy that deliberately disturbs the input images by adding noise, and then uses the single-step denoised images for reward fine-tuning. This avoids the extensive costs associated with image sampling, allowing for more efficient reward fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that ControlNet++ significantly improves controllability under various conditional controls. For example, it achieves improvements over ControlNet by 11.1% mIoU, 13.4% SSIM, and 7.6% RMSE, respectively, for segmentation mask, line-art edge, and depth conditions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tsung-Han Chou, Brian Wang, Wei-Chen Chiu, Jun-Cheng Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Class agnostic counting (CAC) is a vision task that can be used to count the total occurrence number of any given reference objects in the query image. The task is usually formulated as a density map estimation problem through similarity computation among a few image samples of the reference object and the query image. In this paper, we point out a severe issue of the existing CAC framework: Given a multi-class setting, models don't consider reference images and instead blindly match all dominant objects in the query image. Moreover, the current evaluation metrics and dataset cannot be used to faithfully assess the model's generalization performance and robustness. To this end, we discover that the combination of mosaic augmentation with generalized loss is essential for addressing the aforementioned issue of CAC models to count objects of majority (i.e. dominant objects) regardless of the references. Furthermore, we introduce a new evaluation protocol and metrics for resolving the problem behind the existing CAC evaluation scheme and better benchmarking CAC models in a more fair manner. Besides, extensive evaluation results demonstrate that our proposed recipe can consistently improve the performance of different CAC models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Danqing Ma, Meng Wang, Ao Xiang, Zongqing Qi, Qin Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: This study proposes a multi-modal fusion framework Multitrans based on the Transformer architecture and self-attention mechanism. This architecture combines the study of non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) images and discharge diagnosis reports of patients undergoing stroke treatment, using a variety of methods based on Transformer architecture approach to predicting functional outcomes of stroke treatment. The results show that the performance of single-modal text classification is significantly better than single-modal image classification, but the effect of multi-modal combination is better than any single modality. Although the Transformer model only performs worse on imaging data, when combined with clinical meta-diagnostic information, both can learn better complementary information and make good contributions to accurately predicting stroke treatment effects..</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Achyut Paudel, Jostan Brown, Priyanka Upadhyaya, Atif Bilal Asad, Safal Kshetri, Joseph R. Davidson, Cindy Grimm, Ashley Thompson, Bernardita Sallato, Matthew D. Whiting, Manoj Karkee</p>
<p>Abstract: Apple(\textit{Malus domestica} Borkh.) trees are deciduous, shedding leaves each year. This process is preceded by a gradual change in leaf color from green to yellow as chlorophyll is degraded prior to abscission. The initiation and rate of this color change are affected by many factors including leaf nitrogen (N) concentration. We predict that leaf color during this transition may be indicative of the nitrogen status of apple trees. This study assesses a machine vision-based system for quantifying the change in leaf color and its correlation with leaf nitrogen content. An image dataset was collected in color and 3D over five weeks in the fall of 2021 and 2023 at a commercial orchard using a ground vehicle-based stereovision sensor. Trees in the foreground were segmented from the point cloud using color and depth thresholding methods. Then, to estimate the proportion of yellow leaves per canopy, the color information of the segmented canopy area was quantified using a custom-defined metric, \textit{yellowness index} (a normalized ratio of yellow to green foliage in the tree) that varied from -1 to +1 (-1 being completely green and +1 being completely yellow). Both K-means-based methods and gradient boosting methods were used to estimate the \textit{yellowness index}. The gradient boosting based method proposed in this study was better than the K-means-based method (both in terms of computational time and accuracy), achieving an $R^2$ of 0.72 in estimating the \textit{yellowness index}. The metric was able to capture the gradual color transition from green to yellow over the study duration. Trees with lower leaf nitrogen showed the color transition to yellow earlier than the trees with higher nitrogen.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Donggyun Kim, Seongwoong Cho, Semin Kim, Chong Luo, Seunghoon Hong</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models have evolved data-efficient generalists, benefiting from the universal language interface and large-scale pre-training. However, constructing a data-efficient generalist for dense visual prediction presents a distinct challenge due to the variation in label structures across different tasks. Consequently, generalization to unseen dense prediction tasks in the low-data regime is not straightforward and has received less attention from previous vision generalists. In this study, we explore a universal model that can flexibly adapt to unseen dense label structures with a few examples, enabling it to serve as a data-efficient vision generalist in diverse real-world scenarios. To this end, we base our method on a powerful meta-learning framework and explore several axes to improve its performance and versatility for real-world problems, such as flexible adaptation mechanisms and scalability. We evaluate our model across a spectrum of unseen real-world scenarios where low-shot learning is desirable, including video, 3D, medical, biological, and user-interactive tasks. Equipped with a generic architecture and an effective adaptation mechanism, our model flexibly adapts to all of these tasks with at most 50 labeled images, showcasing a significant advancement over existing data-efficient generalist approaches.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Debabrata Pal, Anvita Singh, Saumya Saumya, Shouvik Das</p>
<p>Abstract: The intrinsic capability of the Human Vision System (HVS) to perceive depth of field and failure of Instrument Landing Systems (ILS) stimulates a pilot to perform a vision-based manual landing over an autoland approach. However, harsh weather creates challenges, and a pilot must have a clear view of runway elements before the minimum decision altitude. To aid in manual landing, a vision-based system trained to clear weather-induced visual degradations requires a robust landing dataset under various climatic conditions. Nevertheless, to acquire a dataset, flying an aircraft in dangerous weather impacts safety. Also, this system fails to generate reliable warnings, as localization of runway elements suffers from projective distortion while landing at crosswind. To combat, we propose to synthesize harsh weather landing images by training a prompt-based climatic diffusion network. Also, we optimize a weather distillation model using a novel diffusion-distillation loss to learn to clear these visual degradations. Precisely, the distillation model learns an inverse relationship with the diffusion network. Inference time, pre-trained distillation network directly clears weather-impacted onboard camera images, which can be further projected to display devices for improved visibility.Then, to tackle crosswind landing, a novel Regularized Spatial Transformer Networks (RuSTaN) module accurately warps landing images. It minimizes the localization error of runway object detector and helps generate reliable internal software warnings. Finally, we curated an aircraft landing dataset (AIRLAD) by simulating a landing scenario under various weather degradations and experimentally validated our contributions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yilun Chen, Shuai Yang, Haifeng Huang, Tai Wang, Runsen Xu, Ruiyuan Lyu, Dahua Lin, Jiangmiao Pang</p>
<p>Abstract: Prior studies on 3D scene understanding have primarily developed specialized models for specific tasks or required task-specific fine-tuning. In this study, we propose Grounded 3D-LLM, which explores the potential of 3D large multi-modal models (3D LMMs) to consolidate various 3D vision tasks within a unified generative framework. The model uses scene referent tokens as special noun phrases to reference 3D scenes, enabling it to handle sequences that interleave 3D and textual data. Per-task instruction-following templates are employed to ensure natural and diversity in translating 3D vision tasks into language formats. To facilitate the use of referent tokens in subsequent language modeling, we provide a large-scale, automatically curated grounded scene-text dataset with over 1 million phrase-to-region correspondences and introduce Contrastive Language-Scene Pre-training (CLASP) to perform phrase-level scene-text alignment using this data. Our comprehensive evaluation covers open-ended tasks like dense captioning and 3D question answering, alongside close-ended tasks such as object detection and language grounding. Experiments across multiple 3D benchmarks reveal the leading performance and the broad applicability of Grounded 3D-LLM.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingyuan Yang, Jiawei Feng, Weibin Luo, Dani Lischinski, Daniel Cohen-Or, Hui Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Affective Image Manipulation (AIM) seeks to modify user-provided images to evoke specific emotional responses. This task is inherently complex due to its twofold objective: significantly evoking the intended emotion, while preserving the original image composition. Existing AIM methods primarily adjust color and style, often failing to elicit precise and profound emotional shifts. Drawing on psychological insights, we introduce EmoEdit, which extends AIM by incorporating content modifications to enhance emotional impact. Specifically, we first construct EmoEditSet, a large-scale AIM dataset comprising 40,120 paired data through emotion attribution and data construction. To make existing generative models emotion-aware, we design the Emotion adapter and train it using EmoEditSet. We further propose an instruction loss to capture the semantic variations in data pairs. Our method is evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques. Additionally, we showcase the portability of our Emotion adapter to other diffusion-based models, enhancing their emotion knowledge with diverse semantics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanwei Zhang, Luo Cheng, Qisong He, Wei Huang, Renjue Li, Ronan Sicre, Xiaowei Huang, Holger Hermanns, Lijun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Classification of 3D point clouds is a challenging machine learning (ML) task with important real-world applications in a spectrum from autonomous driving and robot-assisted surgery to earth observation from low orbit. As with other ML tasks, classification models are notoriously brittle in the presence of adversarial attacks. These are rooted in imperceptible changes to inputs with the effect that a seemingly well-trained model ends up misclassifying the input. This paper adds to the understanding of adversarial attacks by presenting Eidos, a framework providing Efficient Imperceptible aDversarial attacks on 3D pOint cloudS. Eidos supports a diverse set of imperceptibility metrics. It employs an iterative, two-step procedure to identify optimal adversarial examples, thereby enabling a runtime-imperceptibility trade-off. We provide empirical evidence relative to several popular 3D point cloud classification models and several established 3D attack methods, showing Eidos' superiority with respect to efficiency as well as imperceptibility.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14701">DreamText: High Fidelity Scene Text Synthesis</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yibin Wang, Weizhong Zhang, Cheng Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Scene text synthesis involves rendering specified texts onto arbitrary images. Current methods typically formulate this task in an end-to-end manner but lack effective character-level guidance during training. Besides, their text encoders, pre-trained on a single font type, struggle to adapt to the diverse font styles encountered in practical applications. Consequently, these methods suffer from character distortion, repetition, and absence, particularly in polystylistic scenarios. To this end, this paper proposes DreamText for high-fidelity scene text synthesis. Our key idea is to reconstruct the diffusion training process, introducing more refined guidance tailored to this task, to expose and rectify the model's attention at the character level and strengthen its learning of text regions. This transformation poses a hybrid optimization challenge, involving both discrete and continuous variables. To effectively tackle this challenge, we employ a heuristic alternate optimization strategy. Meanwhile, we jointly train the text encoder and generator to comprehensively learn and utilize the diverse font present in the training dataset. This joint training is seamlessly integrated into the alternate optimization process, fostering a synergistic relationship between learning character embedding and re-estimating character attention. Specifically, in each step, we first encode potential character-generated position information from cross-attention maps into latent character masks. These masks are then utilized to update the representation of specific characters in the current step, which, in turn, enables the generator to correct the character's attention in the subsequent steps. Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate the superiority of our method to the state of the art.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengming Xu, Kai Hu, Qilin Wang, Donghao Luo, Jiangning Zhang, Xiaobin Hu, Yanwei Fu, Chengjie Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Stylized Text-to-Image Generation (STIG) aims to generate images from text prompts and style reference images. In this paper, we present ArtWeaver, a novel framework that leverages pretrained Stable Diffusion (SD) to address challenges such as misinterpreted styles and inconsistent semantics. Our approach introduces two innovative modules: the mixed style descriptor and the dynamic attention adapter. The mixed style descriptor enhances SD by combining content-aware and frequency-disentangled embeddings from CLIP with additional sources that capture global statistics and textual information, thus providing a richer blend of style-related and semantic-related knowledge. To achieve a better balance between adapter capacity and semantic control, the dynamic attention adapter is integrated into the diffusion UNet, dynamically calculating adaptation weights based on the style descriptors. Additionally, we introduce two objective functions to optimize the model alongside the denoising loss, further enhancing semantic and style consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of ArtWeaver over existing methods, producing images with diverse target styles while maintaining the semantic integrity of the text prompts.</p>

<p>Abstract: Access to detailed war impact assessments is crucial for humanitarian organizations to effectively assist populations most affected by armed conflicts. However, maintaining a comprehensive understanding of the situation on the ground is challenging, especially in conflicts that cover vast territories and extend over long periods. This study presents a scalable and transferable method for estimating war-induced damage to buildings. We first train a machine learning model to output pixel-wise probability of destruction from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite image time series, leveraging existing, manual damage assessments as ground truth and cloud-based geospatial analysis tools for large-scale inference. We further post-process these assessments using open building footprints to obtain a final damage estimate per building. We introduce an accessible, open-source tool that allows users to adjust the confidence interval based on their specific requirements and use cases. Our approach enables humanitarian organizations and other actors to rapidly screen large geographic regions for war impacts. We provide two publicly accessible dashboards: a Ukraine Damage Explorer to dynamically view our pre-computed estimates, and a Rapid Damage Mapping Tool to easily run our method and produce custom maps.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present MV2Cyl, a novel method for reconstructing 3D from 2D multi-view images, not merely as a field or raw geometry but as a sketch-extrude CAD model. Extracting extrusion cylinders from raw 3D geometry has been extensively researched in computer vision, while the processing of 3D data through neural networks has remained a bottleneck. Since 3D scans are generally accompanied by multi-view images, leveraging 2D convolutional neural networks allows these images to be exploited as a rich source for extracting extrusion cylinder information. However, we observe that extracting only the surface information of the extrudes and utilizing it results in suboptimal outcomes due to the challenges in the occlusion and surface segmentation. By synergizing with the extracted base curve information, we achieve the optimal reconstruction result with the best accuracy in 2D sketch and extrude parameter estimation. Our experiments, comparing our method with previous work that takes a raw 3D point cloud as input, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by taking advantage of multi-view images.

<p>Abstract: We present LightStereo, a cutting-edge stereo-matching network crafted to accelerate the matching process. Departing from conventional methodologies that rely on aggregating computationally intensive 4D costs, LightStereo adopts the 3D cost volume as a lightweight alternative. While similar approaches have been explored previously, our breakthrough lies in enhancing performance through a dedicated focus on the channel dimension of the 3D cost volume, where the distribution of matching costs is encapsulated. Our exhaustive exploration has yielded plenty of strategies to amplify the capacity of the pivotal dimension, ensuring both precision and efficiency. We compare the proposed LightStereo with existing state-of-the-art methods across various benchmarks, which demonstrate its superior performance in speed, accuracy, and resource utilization. LightStereo achieves a competitive EPE metric in the SceneFlow datasets while demanding a minimum of only 22 GFLOPs and 17 ms of runtime, and ranks 1st on KITTI 2015 among real-time models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jieneng Chen, Luoxin Ye, Ju He, Zhao-Yang Wang, Daniel Khashabi, Alan Yuille</p>
<p>Abstract: While significant advancements have been made in compressed representations for text embeddings in large language models (LLMs), the compression of visual tokens in multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs) has remained a largely overlooked area. In this work, we present the study on the analysis of redundancy concerning visual tokens and efficient training within these models. Our initial experiments show that eliminating up to 70% of visual tokens at the testing stage by simply average pooling only leads to a minimal 3% reduction in visual question answering accuracy on the GQA benchmark, indicating significant redundancy in visual context. Addressing this, we introduce Visual Context Compressor, which reduces the number of visual tokens to enhance training and inference efficiency without sacrificing performance. To minimize information loss caused by the compression on visual tokens while maintaining training efficiency, we develop LLaVolta as a light and staged training scheme that incorporates stage-wise visual context compression to progressively compress the visual tokens from heavily to lightly compression during training, yielding no loss of information when testing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach enhances the performance of MLLMs in both image-language and video-language understanding, while also significantly cutting training costs and improving inference efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive success across modalities such as image, video, and audio in a variety of understanding and generation tasks. However, current MLLMs are surprisingly poor at understanding webpage screenshots and generating their corresponding HTML code. To address this problem, we propose $\texttt{Web2Code}$, a benchmark consisting of a new large-scale webpage-to-code dataset for instruction tuning and an evaluation framework for the webpage understanding and HTML code translation abilities of MLLMs. For dataset construction, we leverage pretrained LLMs to enhance existing webpage-to-code datasets as well as generate a diverse pool of new webpages rendered into images. Specifically, the inputs are webpage images and instructions, while the responses are the webpage's HTML code. We further include diverse natural language QA pairs about the webpage content in the responses to enable a more comprehensive understanding of the web content. To evaluate model performance in these tasks, we develop an evaluation framework for testing MLLMs' abilities in webpage understanding and web-to-code generation. Extensive experiments show that our proposed dataset is beneficial not only to our proposed tasks but also in the general visual domain. We hope our work will contribute to the development of general MLLMs suitable for web-based content generation and task automation.

<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are widely used in real-world applications, yet they remain vulnerable to errors and adversarial attacks. Formal verification offers a systematic approach to identify and mitigate these vulnerabilities, enhancing model robustness and reliability. While most existing verification methods focus on image classification models, this work extends formal verification to the more complex domain of emph{object detection} models. We propose a formulation for verifying the robustness of such models and demonstrate how state-of-the-art verification tools, originally developed for classification, can be adapted for this purpose.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Philipp Allgeuer, Kyra Ahrens, Stefan Wermter</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce NOVIC, an innovative real-time uNconstrained Open Vocabulary Image Classifier that uses an autoregressive transformer to generatively output classification labels as language. Leveraging the extensive knowledge of CLIP models, NOVIC harnesses the embedding space to enable zero-shot transfer from pure text to images. Traditional CLIP models, despite their ability for open vocabulary classification, require an exhaustive prompt of potential class labels, restricting their application to images of known content or context. To address this, we propose an "object decoder" model that is trained on a large-scale 92M-target dataset of templated object noun sets and LLM-generated captions to always output the object noun in question. This effectively inverts the CLIP text encoder and allows textual object labels from essentially the entire English language to be generated directly from image-derived embedding vectors, without requiring any a priori knowledge of the potential content of an image, and without any label biases. The trained decoders are tested on a mix of manually and web-curated datasets, as well as standard image classification benchmarks, and achieve fine-grained prompt-free prediction scores of up to 87.5%, a strong result considering the model must work for any conceivable image and without any contextual clues.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Zarif Hossain, Ahmed Imteaj</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved significant strides in recent times specially in multimodal tasks, yet they remain susceptible to adversarial attacks on their vision components. To address this, we propose Sim-CLIP, an unsupervised adversarial fine-tuning method that enhances the robustness of the widely-used CLIP vision encoder against such attacks while maintaining semantic richness and specificity. By employing a Siamese architecture with cosine similarity loss, Sim-CLIP learns semantically meaningful and attack-resilient visual representations without requiring large batch sizes or momentum encoders. Our results demonstrate that VLMs enhanced with Sim-CLIP's fine-tuned CLIP encoder exhibit significantly enhanced robustness against adversarial attacks, while preserving semantic meaning of the perturbed images. Notably, Sim-CLIP does not require additional training or fine-tuning of the VLM itself; replacing the original vision encoder with our fine-tuned Sim-CLIP suffices to provide robustness. This work underscores the significance of reinforcing foundational models like CLIP to safeguard the reliability of downstream VLM applications, paving the way for more secure and effective multimodal systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peng Hao, Xiaobing Wang, Yingying Jiang, Hanchao Jia, Xiaoshuai Hao</p>
<p>Abstract: Scene Graph Generation (SGG) remains a challenging task due to its compositional property. Previous approaches improve prediction efficiency through end-to-end learning. However, these methods exhibit limited performance as they assume unidirectional conditioning between entities and predicates, which restricts effective information interaction. To address this limitation, we propose a novel bidirectional conditioning factorization in a semantic-aligned space for SGG, enabling efficient and generalizable interaction between entities and predicates. Specifically, we introduce an end-to-end scene graph generation model, the Bidirectional Conditioning Transformer (BCTR), to implement this factorization. BCTR consists of two key modules. First, the Bidirectional Conditioning Generator (BCG) performs multi-stage interactive feature augmentation between entities and predicates, enabling mutual enhancement between these predictions. Second, Random Feature Alignment (RFA) is present to regularize feature space by distilling multi-modal knowledge from pre-trained models. Within this regularized feature space, BCG is feasible to capture interaction patterns across diverse relationships during training, and the learned interaction patterns can generalize to unseen but semantically related relationships during inference. Extensive experiments on Visual Genome and Open Image V6 show that BCTR achieves state-of-the-art performance on both benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bohan Zhou, Zhongbin Zhang, Jiangxing Wang, Zongqing Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: The in-context learning ability of Transformer models has brought new possibilities to visual navigation. In this paper, we focus on the video navigation setting, where an in-context navigation policy needs to be learned purely from videos in an offline manner, without access to the actual environment. For this setting, we propose Navigate Only Look Once (NOLO), a method for learning a navigation policy that possesses the in-context ability and adapts to new scenes by taking corresponding context videos as input without finetuning or re-training. To enable learning from videos, we first propose a pseudo action labeling procedure using optical flow to recover the action label from egocentric videos. Then, offline reinforcement learning is applied to learn the navigation policy. Through extensive experiments on different scenes both in simulation and the real world, we show that our algorithm outperforms baselines by a large margin, which demonstrates the in-context learning ability of the learned policy.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yibin Wang, Weizhong Zhang, Cheng Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Current human image customization methods leverage Stable Diffusion (SD) for its rich semantic prior. However, since SD is not specifically designed for human-oriented generation, these methods often require extensive fine-tuning on large-scale datasets, which renders them susceptible to overfitting and hinders their ability to personalize individuals with previously unseen styles. Moreover, these methods extensively focus on single-concept human image synthesis and lack the flexibility to customize individuals using multiple given concepts, thereby impeding their broader practical application. This paper proposes MagicFace, a novel training-free method for multi-concept universal-style human image personalized synthesis. Our core idea is to simulate how humans create images given specific concepts, i.e., first establish a semantic layout considering factors such as concepts' shape and posture, then optimize details by comparing with concepts at the pixel level. To implement this process, we introduce a coarse-to-fine generation pipeline, involving two sequential stages: semantic layout construction and concept feature injection. This is achieved by our Reference-aware Self-Attention (RSA) and Region-grouped Blend Attention (RBA) mechanisms. In the first stage, RSA enables the latent image to query features from all reference concepts simultaneously, extracting the overall semantic understanding to facilitate the initial semantic layout establishment. In the second stage, we employ an attention-based semantic segmentation method to pinpoint the latent generated regions of all concepts at each step. Following this, RBA divides the pixels of the latent image into semantic groups, with each group querying fine-grained features from the corresponding reference concept. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our MagicFace.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuai Yuan, Hanlin Qin, Renke Kou, Xiang Yan, Zechuan Li, Chenxu Peng, Huixin Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: We pioneer a learning-based single-point prompt paradigm for infrared small target label generation (IRSTLG) to lobber annotation burdens. Unlike previous clustering-based methods, our intuition is that point-guided mask generation just requires one more prompt than target detection, i.e., IRSTLG can be treated as an infrared small target detection (IRSTD) with the location hint. Therefore, we propose an elegant yet effective Energy-Double-Guided Single-point Prompt (EDGSP) framework, aiming to adeptly transform a coarse IRSTD network into a refined label generation method. Specifically, EDGSP comprises three key modules: 1) target energy initialization (TEI), which establishes a foundational outline to streamline the mapping process for effective shape evolution, 2) double prompt embedding (DPE) for rapidly localizing interesting regions and reinforcing high-resolution individual edges to avoid label adhesion, and 3) bounding box-based matching (BBM) for eliminating false masks via considering comprehensive cluster boundary conditions to obtain a reliable output. In this way, pseudo labels generated by three backbones equipped with our EDGSP achieve 100% object-level probability of detection (Pd) and 0% false-alarm rate (Fa) on SIRST, NUDT-SIRST, and IRSTD-1k datasets, with a pixel-level intersection over union (IoU) improvement of 13.28% over state-of-the-art (SOTA) label generation methods. Further applying our inferred masks to train detection models, EDGSP, for the first time, enables a single-point-generated pseudo mask to surpass the manual labels. Even with coarse single-point annotations, it still achieves 99.5% performance of full labeling. Code is available at https://github.com/xdFai/EDGSP.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongheon Lee, Seokju Yun, Youngmin Ro</p>
<p>Abstract: For Image Super-Resolution (SR), it is common to train and evaluate scale-specific models composed of an encoder and upsampler for each targeted scale. Consequently, many SR studies encounter substantial training times and complex deployment requirements. In this paper, we address this limitation by training and evaluating multiple scales simultaneously. Notably, we observe that encoder features are similar across scales and that the Sub-Pixel Convolution (SPConv), widely-used scale-specific upsampler, exhibits strong inter-scale correlations in its functionality. Building on these insights, we propose a multi-scale framework that employs a single encoder in conjunction with Implicit Grid Convolution (IGConv), our novel upsampler, which unifies SPConv across all scales within a single module. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves comparable performance to existing fixed-scale methods while reducing the training budget and stored parameters three-fold and maintaining the same latency. Additionally, we propose IGConv$^{+}$ to improve performance further by addressing spectral bias and allowing input-dependent upsampling and ensembled prediction. As a result, ATD-IGConv$^{+}$ achieves a notable 0.21dB improvement in PSNR on Urban100$\times$4, while also reducing the training budget, stored parameters, and inference cost compared to the existing ATD.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuning Xu, Xina Liu, Binbin Song, Xiangyu Chen, Qiubo Chen, Jiantao Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Moire patterns, resulting from the interference of two similar repetitive patterns, are frequently observed during the capture of images or videos on screens. These patterns vary in color, shape, and location across video frames, posing challenges in extracting information from adjacent frames and preserving temporal consistency throughout the restoration process. Existing deep learning methods often depend on well-designed alignment modules, such as optical flow estimation, deformable convolution, and cross-frame self-attention layers, incurring high computational costs. Recent studies indicate that utilizing raw data as input can significantly improve the effectiveness of video demoireing by providing the pristine degradation information and more detailed content. However, previous works fail to design both efficient and effective raw video demoireing methods that can maintain temporal consistency and prevent degradation of color and spatial details. This paper introduces a novel alignment-free raw video demoireing network with frequency-assisted spatio-temporal Mamba (DemMamba). It features sequentially arranged Spatial Mamba Blocks (SMB) and Temporal Mamba Blocks (TMB) to effectively model the inter- and intra-relationships in raw videos affected by moire patterns. An Adaptive Frequency Block (AFB) within the SMB facilitates demoireing in the frequency domain, while a Channel Attention Block (CAB) in the TMB enhances the temporal information interactions by leveraging inter-channel relationships among features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed DemMamba surpasses state-of-the-art methods by 1.3 dB in PSNR, and also provides a satisfactory visual experience.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoning Wu, Shaocheng Shen, Qiang Hu, Xiaoyun Zhang, Ya Zhang, Yanfeng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as frontrunners in text-to-image generation, but their fixed image resolution during training often leads to challenges in high-resolution image generation, such as semantic deviations and object replication. This paper introduces MegaFusion, a novel approach that extends existing diffusion-based text-to-image models towards efficient higher-resolution generation without additional fine-tuning or adaptation. Specifically, we employ an innovative truncate and relay strategy to bridge the denoising processes across different resolutions, allowing for high-resolution image generation in a coarse-to-fine manner. Moreover, by integrating dilated convolutions and noise re-scheduling, we further adapt the model's priors for higher resolution. The versatility and efficacy of MegaFusion make it universally applicable to both latent-space and pixel-space diffusion models, along with other derivative models. Extensive experiments confirm that MegaFusion significantly boosts the capability of existing models to produce images of megapixels and various aspect ratios, while only requiring about 40% of the original computational cost.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chuandong Liu, Xingxing Weng, Shuguo Jiang, Pengcheng Li, Lei Yu, Gui-Song Xia</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper explores scene affinity (AIScene), namely intra-scene consistency and inter-scene correlation, for semi-supervised LiDAR semantic segmentation in driving scenes. Adopting teacher-student training, AIScene employs a teacher network to generate pseudo-labeled scenes from unlabeled data, which then supervise the student network's learning. Unlike most methods that include all points in pseudo-labeled scenes for forward propagation but only pseudo-labeled points for backpropagation, AIScene removes points without pseudo-labels, ensuring consistency in both forward and backward propagation within the scene. This simple point erasure strategy effectively prevents unsupervised, semantically ambiguous points (excluded in backpropagation) from affecting the learning of pseudo-labeled points. Moreover, AIScene incorporates patch-based data augmentation, mixing multiple scenes at both scene and instance levels. Compared to existing augmentation techniques that typically perform scene-level mixing between two scenes, our method enhances the semantic diversity of labeled (or pseudo-labeled) scenes, thereby improving the semi-supervised performance of segmentation models. Experiments show that AIScene outperforms previous methods on two popular benchmarks across four settings, achieving notable improvements of 1.9% and 5.3% in the most challenging 1\% labeled data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Situation awareness is essential for understanding and reasoning about 3D scenes in embodied AI agents. However, existing datasets and benchmarks for situated understanding are limited in data modality, diversity, scale, and task scope. To address these limitations, we propose Multi-modal Situated Question Answering (MSQA), a large-scale multi-modal situated reasoning dataset, scalably collected leveraging 3D scene graphs and vision-language models (VLMs) across a diverse range of real-world 3D scenes. MSQA includes 251K situated question-answering pairs across 9 distinct question categories, covering complex scenarios within 3D scenes. We introduce a novel interleaved multi-modal input setting in our benchmark to provide text, image, and point cloud for situation and question description, resolving ambiguity in previous single-modality convention (e.g., text). Additionally, we devise the Multi-modal Situated Next-step Navigation (MSNN) benchmark to evaluate models' situated reasoning for navigation. Comprehensive evaluations on MSQA and MSNN highlight the limitations of existing vision-language models and underscore the importance of handling multi-modal interleaved inputs and situation modeling. Experiments on data scaling and cross-domain transfer further demonstrate the efficacy of leveraging MSQA as a pre-training dataset for developing more powerful situated reasoning models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Meng Chen, Jiawei Tu, Chao Qi, Yonghao Dang, Feng Zhou, Wei Wei, Jianqin Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: The deployment of embodied navigation agents in safety-critical environments raises concerns about their vulnerability to adversarial attacks on deep neural networks. However, current attack methods often lack practicality due to challenges in transitioning from the digital to the physical world, while existing physical attacks for object detection fail to achieve both multi-view effectiveness and naturalness. To address this, we propose a practical attack method for embodied navigation by attaching adversarial patches with learnable textures and opacity to objects. Specifically, to ensure effectiveness across varying viewpoints, we employ a multi-view optimization strategy based on object-aware sampling, which uses feedback from the navigation model to optimize the patch's texture. To make the patch inconspicuous to human observers, we introduce a two-stage opacity optimization mechanism, where opacity is refined after texture optimization. Experimental results show our adversarial patches reduce navigation success rates by about 40%, outperforming previous methods in practicality, effectiveness, and naturalness.

<p>Abstract: As 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) gains significant attention and its commercial usage increases, the need for watermarking technologies to prevent unauthorized use of the 3D-GS models and rendered images has become increasingly important. In this paper, we introduce a robust watermarking method for 3D-GS that secures ownership of both the model and its rendered images. Our proposed method remains robust against distortions in rendered images and model attacks while maintaining high rendering quality. To achieve these objectives, we present Frequency-Guided Densification (FGD), which removes 3D Gaussians based on their contribution to rendering quality, enhancing real-time rendering and the robustness of the message. FGD utilizes Discrete Fourier Transform to split 3D Gaussians in high-frequency areas, improving rendering quality. Furthermore, we employ a gradient mask for 3D Gaussians and design a wavelet-subband loss to enhance rendering quality. Our experiments show that our method embeds the message in the rendered images invisibly and robustly against various attacks, including model distortion. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taha Koleilat, Hojat Asgariandehkordi, Hassan Rivaz, Yiming Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Segmentation of anatomical structures and pathological regions in medical images is essential for modern clinical diagnosis, disease research, and treatment planning. While significant advancements have been made in deep learning-based segmentation techniques, many of these methods still suffer from limitations in data efficiency, generalizability, and interactivity. As a result, developing precise segmentation methods that require fewer labeled datasets remains a critical challenge in medical image analysis. Recently, the introduction of foundation models like CLIP and Segment-Anything-Model (SAM), with robust cross-domain representations, has paved the way for interactive and universal image segmentation. However, further exploration of these models for data-efficient segmentation in medical imaging is still needed and highly relevant. In this paper, we introduce MedCLIP-SAMv2, a novel framework that integrates the CLIP and SAM models to perform segmentation on clinical scans using text prompts, in both zero-shot and weakly supervised settings. Our approach includes fine-tuning the BiomedCLIP model with a new Decoupled Hard Negative Noise Contrastive Estimation (DHN-NCE) loss, and leveraging the Multi-modal Information Bottleneck (M2IB) to create visual prompts for generating segmentation masks from SAM in the zero-shot setting. We also investigate using zero-shot segmentation labels within a weakly supervised paradigm to enhance segmentation quality further. Extensive testing across four diverse segmentation tasks and medical imaging modalities (breast tumor ultrasound, brain tumor MRI, lung X-ray, and lung CT) demonstrates the high accuracy of our proposed framework.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francisco M. Castro-Mac\'ias, Pablo Morales-\'Alvarez, Yunan Wu, Rafael Molina, Aggelos K. Katsaggelos</p>
<p>Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is widely used in medical imaging classification to reduce the labeling effort. While only bag labels are available for training, one typically seeks predictions at both bag and instance levels (classification and localization tasks, respectively). Early MIL methods treated the instances in a bag independently. Recent methods account for global and local dependencies among instances. Although they have yielded excellent results in classification, their performance in terms of localization is comparatively limited. We argue that these models have been designed to target the classification task, while implications at the instance level have not been deeply investigated. Motivated by a simple observation -- that neighboring instances are likely to have the same label -- we propose a novel, principled, and flexible mechanism to model local dependencies. It can be used alone or combined with any mechanism to model global dependencies (e.g., transformers). A thorough empirical validation shows that our module leads to state-of-the-art performance in localization while being competitive or superior in classification.

<p>Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable progress in synthesizing high-quality images from text prompts, which boosts researches on prompt-based image editing that edits a source image according to a target prompt. Despite their advances, existing methods still encounter three key issues: 1) limited capacity of the text prompt in guiding target image generation, 2) insufficient mining of word-to-patch and patch-to-patch relationships for grounding editing areas, and 3) unified editing strength for all regions during each denoising step. To address these issues, we present a Vision-guided and Mask-enhanced Adaptive Editing (ViMAEdit) method with three key novel designs. First, we propose to leverage image embeddings as explicit guidance to enhance the conventional textual prompt-based denoising process, where a CLIP-based target image embedding estimation strategy is introduced. Second, we devise a self-attention-guided iterative editing area grounding strategy, which iteratively exploits patch-to-patch relationships conveyed by self-attention maps to refine those word-to-patch relationships contained in cross-attention maps. Last, we present a spatially adaptive variance-guided sampling, which highlights sampling variances for critical image regions to promote the editing capability. Experimental results demonstrate the superior editing capacity of ViMAEdit over all existing methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: The recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) and pre-trained vision models have accelerated the development of vision-language large models (VLLMs), enhancing the interaction between visual and linguistic modalities. Despite their notable success across various domains, VLLMs face challenges in modality alignment, which can lead to issues like hallucinations and unsafe content generation. Current alignment techniques often rely on coarse feedback and external datasets, limiting scalability and performance. In this paper, we propose FiSAO (Fine-Grained Self-Alignment Optimization), a novel self-alignment method that utilizes the model's own visual encoder as a fine-grained verifier to improve vision-language alignment without the need for additional data. By leveraging token-level feedback from the vision encoder, FiSAO significantly improves vision-language alignment, even surpassing traditional preference tuning methods that require additional data. Through both theoretical analysis and experimental validation, we demonstrate that FiSAO effectively addresses the misalignment problem in VLLMs, marking the first instance of token-level rewards being applied to such models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuang Ai, Huaibo Huang, Ran He</p>
<p>Abstract: Prompt-based all-in-one image restoration (IR) frameworks have achieved remarkable performance by incorporating degradation-specific information into prompt modules. Nevertheless, handling the complex and diverse degradations encountered in real-world scenarios remains a significant challenge. To tackle this, we propose LoRA-IR, a flexible framework that dynamically leverages compact low-rank experts to facilitate efficient all-in-one image restoration. Specifically, LoRA-IR consists of two training stages: degradation-guided pre-training and parameter-efficient fine-tuning. In the pre-training stage, we enhance the pre-trained CLIP model by introducing a simple mechanism that scales it to higher resolutions, allowing us to extract robust degradation representations that adaptively guide the IR network. In the fine-tuning stage, we refine the pre-trained IR network through low-rank adaptation (LoRA). Built upon a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, LoRA-IR dynamically integrates multiple low-rank restoration experts through a degradation-guided router. This dynamic integration mechanism significantly enhances our model's adaptability to diverse and unknown degradations in complex real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LoRA-IR achieves SOTA performance across 14 IR tasks and 29 benchmarks, while maintaining computational efficiency.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaqiang Zhang, Xianjia Yu, Ha Sier, Haizhou Zhang, Tomi Westerlund</p>
<p>Abstract: Event cameras, inspired by biological vision, are asynchronous sensors that detect changes in brightness, offering notable advantages in environments characterized by high-speed motion, low lighting, or wide dynamic range. These distinctive properties render event cameras particularly effective for sensor fusion in robotics and computer vision, especially in enhancing traditional visual or LiDAR-inertial odometry. Conventional frame-based cameras suffer from limitations such as motion blur and drift, which can be mitigated by the continuous, low-latency data provided by event cameras. Similarly, LiDAR-based odometry encounters challenges related to the loss of geometric information in environments such as corridors. To address these limitations, unlike the existing event camera-related surveys, this paper presents a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in event-based sensor fusion for odometry applications particularly, investigating fusion strategies that incorporate frame-based cameras, inertial measurement units (IMUs), and LiDAR. The survey critically assesses the contributions of these fusion methods to improving odometry performance in complex environments, while highlighting key applications, and discussing the strengths, limitations, and unresolved challenges. Additionally, it offers insights into potential future research directions to advance event-based sensor fusion for next-generation odometry applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leila Khaertdinova, Ilya Pershin, Tatiana Shmykova, Bulat Ibragimov</p>
<p>Abstract: The annotation of patient organs is a crucial part of various diagnostic and treatment procedures, such as radiotherapy planning. Manual annotation is extremely time-consuming, while its automation using modern image analysis techniques has not yet reached levels sufficient for clinical adoption. This paper investigates the idea of semi-supervised medical image segmentation using human gaze as interactive input for segmentation correction. In particular, we fine-tuned the Segment Anything Model in Medical Images (MedSAM), a public solution that uses various prompt types as additional input for semi-automated segmentation correction. We used human gaze data from reading abdominal images as a prompt for fine-tuning MedSAM. The model was validated on a public WORD database, which consists of 120 CT scans of 16 abdominal organs. The results of the gaze-assisted MedSAM were shown to be superior to the results of the state-of-the-art segmentation models. In particular, the average Dice coefficient for 16 abdominal organs was 85.8%, 86.7%, 81.7%, and 90.5% for nnUNetV2, ResUNet, original MedSAM, and our gaze-assisted MedSAM model, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Xiang, Wenhui Zhou, Guojun Dai</p>
<p>Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG)-based visual perception reconstruction has become an important area of research. Neuroscientific studies indicate that humans can decode imagined 3D objects by perceiving or imagining various visual information, such as color, shape, and rotation. Existing EEG-based visual decoding methods typically focus only on the reconstruction of 2D visual stimulus images and face various challenges in generation quality, including inconsistencies in texture, shape, and color between the visual stimuli and the reconstructed images. This paper proposes an EEG-based 3D object reconstruction method with style consistency and diffusion priors. The method consists of an EEG-driven multi-task joint learning stage and an EEG-to-3D diffusion stage. The first stage uses a neural EEG encoder based on regional semantic learning, employing a multi-task joint learning scheme that includes a masked EEG signal recovery task and an EEG based visual classification task. The second stage introduces a latent diffusion model (LDM) fine-tuning strategy with style-conditioned constraints and a neural radiance field (NeRF) optimization strategy. This strategy explicitly embeds semantic- and location-aware latent EEG codes and combines them with visual stimulus maps to fine-tune the LDM. The fine-tuned LDM serves as a diffusion prior, which, combined with the style loss of visual stimuli, is used to optimize NeRF for generating 3D objects. Finally, through experimental validation, we demonstrate that this method can effectively use EEG data to reconstruct 3D objects with style consistency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seongmin Lee, Ali Payani, Duen Horng Chau</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern deep learning models often make predictions by focusing on irrelevant areas, leading to biased performance and limited generalization. Existing methods aimed at rectifying model attention require explicit labels for irrelevant areas or complex pixel-wise ground truth attention maps. We present CRAYON (Correcting Reasoning with Annotations of Yes Or No), offering effective, scalable, and practical solutions to rectify model attention using simple yes-no annotations. CRAYON empowers classical and modern model interpretation techniques to identify and guide model reasoning: CRAYON-ATTENTION directs classic interpretations based on saliency maps to focus on relevant image regions, while CRAYON-PRUNING removes irrelevant neurons identified by modern concept-based methods to mitigate their influence. Through extensive experiments with both quantitative and human evaluation, we showcase CRAYON's effectiveness, scalability, and practicality in refining model attention. CRAYON achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming 12 methods across 3 benchmark datasets, surpassing approaches that require more complex annotations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Imad Ali Shah, Fahad Mumtaz Malik, Muhammad Waqas Ashraf</p>
<p>Abstract: Computer vision researchers have extensively worked on fundamental infrared visual recognition for the past few decades. Among various approaches, deep learning has emerged as the most promising candidate. However, Infrared Small Object Segmentation (ISOS) remains a major focus due to several challenges including: 1) the lack of effective utilization of local contrast and global contextual information; 2) the potential loss of small objects in deep models; and 3) the struggling to capture fine-grained details and ignore noise. To address these challenges, we propose a modified U-Net architecture, named SFA-UNet, by combining Scharr Convolution (SC) and Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC) in addition to vertical and horizontal Attention gates (AG) into UNet. SFA-UNet utilizes double convolution layers with the addition of SC and FFC in its encoder and decoder layers. SC helps to learn the foreground-to-background contrast information whereas FFC provide multi-scale contextual information while mitigating the small objects vanishing problem. Additionally, the introduction of vertical AGs in encoder layers enhances the model's focus on the targeted object by ignoring irrelevant regions. We evaluated the proposed approach on publicly available, SIRST and IRSTD datasets, and achieved superior performance by an average 0.75% with variance of 0.025 of all combined metrics in multiple runs as compared to the existing state-of-the-art methods</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haowen Xiao, Guanghui Liu, Xinyi Gao, Yang Li, Fengmao Lv, Jielei Chu</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has shown remarkable data representation capabilities across a wide range of datasets. However, when applied to real-world datasets with long-tailed distributions, performance on multiple downstream tasks degrades significantly. Recently, the community has begun to focus more on self-supervised long-tailed learning. Some works attempt to transfer temperature mechanisms to self-supervised learning or use category-space uniformity constraints to balance the representation of different categories in the embedding space to fight against long-tail distributions. However, most of these approaches focus on the joint optimization of all samples in the dataset or on constraining the category distribution, with little attention given to whether each individual sample is optimally guided during training. To address this issue, we propose Temperature Auxiliary Sample-level Encouragement (TASE). We introduce pseudo-labels into self-supervised long-tailed learning, utilizing pseudo-label information to drive a dynamic temperature and re-weighting strategy. Specifically, We assign an optimal temperature parameter to each sample. Additionally, we analyze the lack of quantity awareness in the temperature parameter and use re-weighting to compensate for this deficiency, thereby achieving optimal training patterns at the sample level. Comprehensive experimental results on six benchmarks across three datasets demonstrate that our method achieves outstanding performance in improving long-tail recognition, while also exhibiting high robustness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingkun Zhang, Keping Bi, Wei Chen, Quanrun Chen, Jiafeng Guo, Xueqi Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite ongoing efforts to defend neural classifiers from adversarial attacks, they remain vulnerable, especially to unseen attacks. In contrast, humans are difficult to be cheated by subtle manipulations, since we make judgments only based on essential factors. Inspired by this observation, we attempt to model label generation with essential label-causative factors and incorporate label-non-causative factors to assist data generation. For an adversarial example, we aim to discriminate the perturbations as non-causative factors and make predictions only based on the label-causative factors. Concretely, we propose a casual diffusion model (CausalDiff) that adapts diffusion models for conditional data generation and disentangles the two types of casual factors by learning towards a novel casual information bottleneck objective. Empirically, CausalDiff has significantly outperformed state-of-the-art defense methods on various unseen attacks, achieving an average robustness of 86.39% (+4.01%) on CIFAR-10, 56.25% (+3.13%) on CIFAR-100, and 82.62% (+4.93%) on GTSRB (German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Serena Zhang, Sraavya Sambara, Oishi Banerjee, Julian Acosta, L. John Fahrner, Pranav Rajpurkar</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating accurate radiology reports from medical images is a clinically important but challenging task. While current Vision Language Models (VLMs) show promise, they are prone to generating hallucinations, potentially compromising patient care. We introduce RadFlag, a black-box method to enhance the accuracy of radiology report generation. Our method uses a sampling-based flagging technique to find hallucinatory generations that should be removed. We first sample multiple reports at varying temperatures and then use a Large Language Model (LLM) to identify claims that are not consistently supported across samples, indicating that the model has low confidence in those claims. Using a calibrated threshold, we flag a fraction of these claims as likely hallucinations, which should undergo extra review or be automatically rejected. Our method achieves high precision when identifying both individual hallucinatory sentences and reports that contain hallucinations. As an easy-to-use, black-box system that only requires access to a model's temperature parameter, RadFlag is compatible with a wide range of radiology report generation models and has the potential to broadly improve the quality of automated radiology reporting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruofan Wang, Bo Wang, Xiaosen Wang, Xingjun Ma, Yu-Gang Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: As large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) grow in prominence, ensuring their safe deployment has become critical. Recent studies have explored VLM robustness against jailbreak attacks--techniques that exploit model vulnerabilities to elicit harmful outputs. However, the limited availability of diverse multi-modal data has led current approaches to rely heavily on adversarial or manually crafted images derived from harmful text datasets, which may lack effectiveness and diversity across different contexts. In this paper, we propose a novel jailbreak method named IDEATOR, which autonomously generates malicious image-text pairs for black-box jailbreak attacks. IDEATOR is based on the insight that VLMs themselves could serve as powerful red team models for generating multimodal jailbreak prompts. Specifically, IDEATOR uses a VLM to create targeted jailbreak texts and pairs them with jailbreak images generated by a state-of-the-art diffusion model. Our extensive experiments demonstrate IDEATOR's high effectiveness and transferability. Notably, it achieves a 94% success rate in jailbreaking MiniGPT-4 with an average of only 5.34 queries, and high success rates of 82%, 88%, and 75% when transferred to LLaVA, InstructBLIP, and Meta's Chameleon, respectively. IDEATOR uncovers specific vulnerabilities in VLMs under black-box conditions, underscoring the need for improved safety mechanisms.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01327">Visual Fourier Prompt Tuning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Runjia Zeng, Cheng Han, Qifan Wang, Chunshu Wu, Tong Geng, Lifu Huang, Ying Nian Wu, Dongfang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: With the scale of vision Transformer-based models continuing to grow, finetuning these large-scale pretrained models for new tasks has become increasingly parameter-intensive. Visual prompt tuning is introduced as a parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) method to this trend. Despite its successes, a notable research challenge persists within almost all PEFT approaches: significant performance degradation is observed when there is a substantial disparity between the datasets applied in pretraining and finetuning phases. To address this challenge, we draw inspiration from human visual cognition, and propose the Visual Fourier Prompt Tuning (VFPT) method as a general and effective solution for adapting large-scale transformer-based models. Our approach innovatively incorporates the Fast Fourier Transform into prompt embeddings and harmoniously considers both spatial and frequency domain information. Apart from its inherent simplicity and intuitiveness, VFPT exhibits superior performance across all datasets, offering a general solution to dataset challenges, irrespective of data disparities. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art baselines on two benchmarks, with low parameter usage (e.g., 0.57% of model parameters on VTAB-1k) and notable performance enhancements (e.g., 73.20% of mean accuracy on VTAB-1k).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Miso Lee, Jihwan Kim, Jae-Pil Heo</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-scene absolute pose regression addresses the demand for fast and memory-efficient camera pose estimation across various real-world environments. Nowadays, transformer-based model has been devised to regress the camera pose directly in multi-scenes. Despite its potential, transformer encoders are underutilized due to the collapsed self-attention map, having low representation capacity. This work highlights the problem and investigates it from a new perspective: distortion of query-key embedding space. Based on the statistical analysis, we reveal that queries and keys are mapped in completely different spaces while only a few keys are blended into the query region. This leads to the collapse of the self-attention map as all queries are considered similar to those few keys. Therefore, we propose simple but effective solutions to activate self-attention. Concretely, we present an auxiliary loss that aligns queries and keys, preventing the distortion of query-key space and encouraging the model to find global relations by self-attention. In addition, the fixed sinusoidal positional encoding is adopted instead of undertrained learnable one to reflect appropriate positional clues into the inputs of self-attention. As a result, our approach resolves the aforementioned problem effectively, thus outperforming existing methods in both outdoor and indoor scenes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuchen He, Xiangfeng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning is a specific distributed learning paradigm in which a central server aggregates updates from multiple clients' local models, thereby enabling the server to learn without requiring clients to upload their private data, maintaining data privacy. While existing federated learning methods are primarily designed for static data, real-world applications often require clients to learn new categories over time. This challenge necessitates the integration of continual learning techniques, leading to federated continual learning (FCL). To address both catastrophic forgetting and non-IID issues, we propose to use masked autoencoders (MAEs) as parameter-efficient federated continual learners, called pMAE. pMAE learns reconstructive prompt on the client side through image reconstruction using MAE. On the server side, it reconstructs the uploaded restore information to capture the data distribution across previous tasks and different clients, using these reconstructed images to finetune discriminative prompt and classifier parameters tailored for classification, thereby alleviating catastrophic forgetting and non-IID issues on a global scale. Experimental results demonstrate that pMAE achieves performance comparable to existing prompt-based methods and can enhance their effectiveness, particularly when using self-supervised pre-trained transformers as the backbone.

<p>Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to cluster unlabeled images into known and novel categories using labeled images from known classes. To address the challenge of transferring features from known to unknown classes while mitigating model bias, we introduce GraphVL, a novel approach for vision-language modeling in GCD, leveraging CLIP. Our method integrates a graph convolutional network (GCN) with CLIP's text encoder to preserve class neighborhood structure. We also employ a lightweight visual projector for image data, ensuring discriminative features through margin-based contrastive losses for image-text mapping. This neighborhood preservation criterion effectively regulates the semantic space, making it less sensitive to known classes. Additionally, we learn textual prompts from known classes and align them to create a more contextually meaningful semantic feature space for the GCN layer using a contextual similarity loss. Finally, we represent unlabeled samples based on their semantic distance to class prompts from the GCN, enabling semi-supervised clustering for class discovery and minimizing errors. Our experiments on seven benchmark datasets consistently demonstrate the superiority of GraphVL when integrated with the CLIP backbone.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present GazeGen, a user interaction system that generates visual content (images and videos) for locations indicated by the user's eye gaze. GazeGen allows intuitive manipulation of visual content by targeting regions of interest with gaze. Using advanced techniques in object detection and generative AI, GazeGen performs gaze-controlled image adding/deleting, repositioning, and surface style changes of image objects, and converts static images into videos. Central to GazeGen is the DFT Gaze (Distilled and Fine-Tuned Gaze) agent, an ultra-lightweight model with only 281K parameters, performing accurate real-time gaze predictions tailored to individual users' eyes on small edge devices. GazeGen is the first system to combine visual content generation with real-time gaze estimation, made possible exclusively by DFT Gaze. This real-time gaze estimation enables various visual content generation tasks, all controlled by the user's gaze. The input for DFT Gaze is the user's eye images, while the inputs for visual content generation are the user's view and the predicted gaze point from DFT Gaze. To achieve efficient gaze predictions, we derive the small model from a large model (10x larger) via novel knowledge distillation and personal adaptation techniques. We integrate knowledge distillation with a masked autoencoder, developing a compact yet powerful gaze estimation model. This model is further fine-tuned with Adapters, enabling highly accurate and personalized gaze predictions with minimal user input. DFT Gaze ensures low-latency and precise gaze tracking, supporting a wide range of gaze-driven tasks. We validate the performance of DFT Gaze on AEA and OpenEDS2020 benchmarks, demonstrating low angular gaze error and low latency on the edge device (Raspberry Pi 4). Furthermore, we describe applications of GazeGen, illustrating its versatility and effectiveness in various usage scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhennan Chen, Yajie Li, Haofan Wang, Zhibo Chen, Zhengkai Jiang, Jun Li, Qian Wang, Jian Yang, Ying Tai</p>
<p>Abstract: Regional prompting, or compositional generation, which enables fine-grained spatial control, has gained increasing attention for its practicality in real-world applications. However, previous methods either introduce additional trainable modules, thus only applicable to specific models, or manipulate on score maps within cross-attention layers using attention masks, resulting in limited control strength when the number of regions increases. To handle these limitations, we present RAG, a Regional-Aware text-to-image Generation method conditioned on regional descriptions for precise layout composition. RAG decouple the multi-region generation into two sub-tasks, the construction of individual region (Regional Hard Binding) that ensures the regional prompt is properly executed, and the overall detail refinement (Regional Soft Refinement) over regions that dismiss the visual boundaries and enhance adjacent interactions. Furthermore, RAG novelly makes repainting feasible, where users can modify specific unsatisfied regions in the last generation while keeping all other regions unchanged, without relying on additional inpainting models. Our approach is tuning-free and applicable to other frameworks as an enhancement to the prompt following property. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that RAG achieves superior performance over attribute binding and object relationship than previous tuning-free methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Approximately 16 million Americans suffer from rosacea according to the National Rosacea Society. To increase rosacea awareness, automatic rosacea detection methods using deep learning and explainable statistical approaches are presented in this paper. The deep learning method applies the ResNet-18 for rosacea detection, and the statistical approaches utilize the means of the two classes, namely, the rosacea class vs. the normal class, and the principal component analysis to extract features from the facial images for automatic rosacea detection. The contributions of the proposed methods are three-fold. First, the proposed methods are able to automatically distinguish patients who are suffering from rosacea from people who are clean of this disease. Second, the statistical approaches address the explainability issue that allows doctors and patients to understand and trust the results. And finally, the proposed methods will not only help increase rosacea awareness in the general population but also help remind the patients who suffer from this disease of possible early treatment since rosacea is more treatable at its early stages.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mallika Garg, Debashis Ghosh, Pyari Mohan Pradhan</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer models have demonstrated remarkable success in many domains such as natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision. With the growing interest in transformer-based architectures, they are now utilized for gesture recognition. So, we also explore and devise a novel ConvMixFormer architecture for dynamic hand gestures. The transformers use quadratic scaling of the attention features with the sequential data, due to which these models are computationally complex and heavy. We have considered this drawback of the transformer and designed a resource-efficient model that replaces the self-attention in the transformer with the simple convolutional layer-based token mixer. The computational cost and the parameters used for the convolution-based mixer are comparatively less than the quadratic self-attention. Convolution-mixer helps the model capture the local spatial features that self-attention struggles to capture due to their sequential processing nature. Further, an efficient gate mechanism is employed instead of a conventional feed-forward network in the transformer to help the model control the flow of features within different stages of the proposed model. This design uses fewer learnable parameters which is nearly half the vanilla transformer that helps in fast and efficient training. The proposed method is evaluated on NVidia Dynamic Hand Gesture and Briareo datasets and our model has achieved state-of-the-art results on single and multimodal inputs. We have also shown the parameter efficiency of the proposed ConvMixFormer model compared to other methods. The source code is available at https://github.com/mallikagarg/ConvMixFormer.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanchen Wang, Adam Turnbull, Tiange Xiang, Yunlong Xu, Sa Zhou, Adnan Masoud, Shekoofeh Azizi, Feng Vankee Lin, Ehsan Adeli</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural decoding, the process of understanding how brain activity corresponds to different stimuli, has been a primary objective in cognitive sciences. Over the past three decades, advancements in functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging and machine learning have greatly improved our ability to map visual stimuli to brain activity, especially in the visual cortex. Concurrently, research has expanded into decoding more complex processes like language and memory across the whole brain, utilizing techniques to handle greater variability and improve signal accuracy. We argue that "seeing" involves more than just mapping visual stimuli onto the visual cortex; it engages the entire brain, as various emotions and cognitive states can emerge from observing different scenes. In this paper, we develop algorithms to enhance our understanding of visual processes by incorporating whole-brain activation maps while individuals are exposed to visual stimuli. We utilize large-scale fMRI encoders and Image generative models pre-trained on large public datasets, which are then fine-tuned through Image-fMRI contrastive learning. Our models hence can decode visual experience across the entire cerebral cortex, surpassing the traditional confines of the visual cortex. We first compare our method with state-of-the-art approaches to decoding visual processing and show improved predictive semantic accuracy by 43%. A network ablation analysis suggests that beyond the visual cortex, the default mode network contributes most to decoding stimuli, in line with the proposed role of this network in sense-making and semantic processing. Additionally, we implemented zero-shot imagination decoding on an extra validation dataset, achieving a p-value of 0.0206 for mapping the reconstructed images and ground-truth text stimuli, which substantiates the model's capability to capture semantic meanings across various scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunhan Yang, Yukun Huang, Yuan-Chen Guo, Liangjun Lu, Xiaoyang Wu, Edmund Y. Lam, Yan-Pei Cao, Xihui Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D part segmentation is a crucial and challenging task in 3D perception, playing a vital role in applications such as robotics, 3D generation, and 3D editing. Recent methods harness the powerful Vision Language Models (VLMs) for 2D-to-3D knowledge distillation, achieving zero-shot 3D part segmentation. However, these methods are limited by their reliance on text prompts, which restricts the scalability to large-scale unlabeled datasets and the flexibility in handling part ambiguities. In this work, we introduce SAMPart3D, a scalable zero-shot 3D part segmentation framework that segments any 3D object into semantic parts at multiple granularities, without requiring predefined part label sets as text prompts. For scalability, we use text-agnostic vision foundation models to distill a 3D feature extraction backbone, allowing scaling to large unlabeled 3D datasets to learn rich 3D priors. For flexibility, we distill scale-conditioned part-aware 3D features for 3D part segmentation at multiple granularities. Once the segmented parts are obtained from the scale-conditioned part-aware 3D features, we use VLMs to assign semantic labels to each part based on the multi-view renderings. Compared to previous methods, our SAMPart3D can scale to the recent large-scale 3D object dataset Objaverse and handle complex, non-ordinary objects. Additionally, we contribute a new 3D part segmentation benchmark to address the lack of diversity and complexity of objects and parts in existing benchmarks. Experiments show that our SAMPart3D significantly outperforms existing zero-shot 3D part segmentation methods, and can facilitate various applications such as part-level editing and interactive segmentation.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we argue that iterative computation with diffusion models offers a powerful paradigm for not only generation but also visual perception tasks. We unify tasks such as depth estimation, optical flow, and amodal segmentation under the framework of image-to-image translation, and show how diffusion models benefit from scaling training and test-time compute for these perceptual tasks. Through a careful analysis of these scaling properties, we formulate compute-optimal training and inference recipes to scale diffusion models for visual perception tasks. Our models achieve competitive performance to state-of-the-art methods using significantly less data and compute.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xun Huang, Jinlong Wang, Qiming Xia, Siheng Chen, Bisheng Yang, Xin Li, Cheng Wang, Chenglu Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: Current Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) systems have significantly enhanced 3D object detection using LiDAR and camera data. However, these methods suffer from performance degradation in adverse weather conditions. The weatherrobust 4D radar provides Doppler and additional geometric information, raising the possibility of addressing this challenge. To this end, we present V2X-R, the first simulated V2X dataset incorporating LiDAR, camera, and 4D radar. V2X-R contains 12,079 scenarios with 37,727 frames of LiDAR and 4D radar point clouds, 150,908 images, and 170,859 annotated 3D vehicle bounding boxes. Subsequently, we propose a novel cooperative LiDAR-4D radar fusion pipeline for 3D object detection and implement it with various fusion strategies. To achieve weather-robust detection, we additionally propose a Multi-modal Denoising Diffusion (MDD) module in our fusion pipeline. MDD utilizes weather-robust 4D radar feature as a condition to prompt the diffusion model to denoise noisy LiDAR features. Experiments show that our LiDAR-4D radar fusion pipeline demonstrates superior performance in the V2X-R dataset. Over and above this, our MDD module further improved the performance of basic fusion model by up to 5.73%/6.70% in foggy/snowy conditions with barely disrupting normal performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kai Jiang, Jiaxing Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Autoregressive models have demonstrated great performance in natural language processing (NLP) with impressive scalability, adaptability and generalizability. Inspired by their notable success in NLP field, autoregressive models have been intensively investigated recently for computer vision, which perform next-token predictions by representing visual data as visual tokens and enables autoregressive modelling for a wide range of vision tasks, ranging from visual generation and visual understanding to the very recent multimodal generation that unifies visual generation and understanding with a single autoregressive model. This paper provides a systematic review of vision autoregressive models, including the development of a taxonomy of existing methods and highlighting their major contributions, strengths, and limitations, covering various vision tasks such as image generation, video generation, image editing, motion generation, medical image analysis, 3D generation, robotic manipulation, unified multimodal generation, etc. Besides, we investigate and analyze the latest advancements in autoregressive models, including thorough benchmarking and discussion of existing methods across various evaluation datasets. Finally, we outline key challenges and promising directions for future research, offering a roadmap to guide further advancements in vision autoregressive models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junwen Wang, Zhonghao Wang, Oscar MacCormac, Jonathan Shapey, Tom Vercauteren</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite significant advancements, segmentation based on deep neural networks in medical and surgical imaging faces several challenges, two of which we aim to address in this work. First, acquiring complete pixel-level segmentation labels for medical images is time-consuming and requires domain expertise. Second, typical segmentation pipelines cannot detect out-of-distribution (OOD) pixels, leaving them prone to spurious outputs during deployment. In this work, we propose a novel segmentation approach exploiting OOD detection that learns only from sparsely annotated pixels from multiple positive-only classes. These multi-class positive annotations naturally fall within the in-distribution (ID) set. Unlabelled pixels may contain positive classes but also negative ones, including what is typically referred to as \emph{background} in standard segmentation formulations. Here, we forgo the need for background annotation and consider these together with any other unseen classes as part of the OOD set. Our framework can integrate, at a pixel-level, any OOD detection approaches designed for classification tasks. To address the lack of existing OOD datasets and established evaluation metric for medical image segmentation, we propose a cross-validation strategy that treats held-out labelled classes as OOD. Extensive experiments on both multi-class hyperspectral and RGB surgical imaging datasets demonstrate the robustness and generalisation capability of our proposed framework.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10261">Partial Scene Text Retrieval</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Wang, Minghui Liao, Zhouyi Xie, Wenyu Liu, Xiang Bai</p>
<p>Abstract: The task of partial scene text retrieval involves localizing and searching for text instances that are the same or similar to a given query text from an image gallery. However, existing methods can only handle text-line instances, leaving the problem of searching for partial patches within these text-line instances unsolved due to a lack of patch annotations in the training data. To address this issue, we propose a network that can simultaneously retrieve both text-line instances and their partial patches. Our method embeds the two types of data (query text and scene text instances) into a shared feature space and measures their cross-modal similarities. To handle partial patches, our proposed approach adopts a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) approach to learn their similarities with query text, without requiring extra annotations. However, constructing bags, which is a standard step of conventional MIL approaches, can introduce numerous noisy samples for training, and lower inference speed. To address this issue, we propose a Ranking MIL (RankMIL) approach to adaptively filter those noisy samples. Additionally, we present a Dynamic Partial Match Algorithm (DPMA) that can directly search for the target partial patch from a text-line instance during the inference stage, without requiring bags. This greatly improves the search efficiency and the performance of retrieving partial patches. The source code and dataset are available at https://github.com/lanfeng4659/PSTR.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sheng Sun, Armando Marino, Wenze Shui, Zhongwen Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work we explore the performance of DCNNs on semantic segmentation using spaceborne polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) datasets. The semantic segmentation task using PolSAR data can be categorized as weakly supervised learning when the characteristics of SAR data and data annotating procedures are factored in. Datasets are initially analyzed for selecting feasible pre-training images. Then the differences between spaceborne and airborne datasets are examined in terms of spatial resolution and viewing geometry. In this study we used two dual-polarimetric images acquired by TerraSAR-X DLR. A novel method to produce training dataset with more supervised information is developed. Specifically, a series of typical classified images as well as intensity images serve as training datasets. A field survey is conducted for an area of about 20 square kilometers to obtain a ground truth dataset used for accuracy evaluation. Several transfer learning strategies are made for aforementioned training datasets which will be combined in a practicable order. Three DCNN models, including SegNet, U-Net, and LinkNet, are implemented next.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Zhao, Lin Wang, Qinfei Li, Heng Chen, Shuangrong Liu, Pengkun Hou, Jiayuan Ye, Yan Pei, Xu Wu, Jianfeng Yuan, Haozhong Gao, Bo Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Establishing a realistic three-dimensional (3D) microstructure is a crucial step for studying microstructure development of hardened cement pastes. However, acquiring 3D microstructural images for cement often involves high costs and quality compromises. This paper proposes a generative adversarial networks-based method for generating 3D microstructures from a single two-dimensional (2D) image, capable of producing high-quality and realistic 3D images at low cost. In the method, a framework (CEM3DMG) is designed to synthesize 3D images by learning microstructural information from a 2D cross-sectional image. Experimental results show that CEM3DMG can generate realistic 3D images of large size. Visual observation confirms that the generated 3D images exhibit similar microstructural features to the 2D images, including similar pore distribution and particle morphology. Furthermore, quantitative analysis reveals that reconstructed 3D microstructures closely match the real 2D microstructure in terms of gray level histogram, phase proportions, and pore size distribution.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yazhe Li, Jorg Bornschein, Marcus Hutter</p>
<p>Abstract: Although much of the success of Deep Learning builds on learning good representations, a rigorous method to evaluate their quality is lacking. In this paper, we treat the evaluation of representations as a model selection problem and propose to use the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle to devise an evaluation metric. Contrary to the established practice of limiting the capacity of the readout model, we design a hybrid discrete and continuous-valued model space for the readout models and employ a switching strategy to combine their predictions. The MDL score takes model complexity, as well as data efficiency into account. As a result, the most appropriate model for the specific task and representation will be chosen, making it a unified measure for comparison. The proposed metric can be efficiently computed with an online method and we present results for pre-trained vision encoders of various architectures (ResNet and ViT) and objective functions (supervised and self-supervised) on a range of downstream tasks. We compare our methods with accuracy-based approaches and show that the latter are inconsistent when multiple readout models are used. Finally, we discuss important properties revealed by our evaluations such as model scaling, preferred readout model, and data efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hadi Hadizadeh, Ivan V. Baji\'c</p>
<p>Abstract: Video coding has traditionally been developed to support services such as video streaming, videoconferencing, digital TV, and so on. The main intent was to enable human viewing of the encoded content. However, with the advances in deep neural networks (DNNs), encoded video is increasingly being used for automatic video analytics performed by machines. In applications such as automatic traffic monitoring, analytics such as vehicle detection, tracking and counting, would run continuously, while human viewing could be required occasionally to review potential incidents. To support such applications, a new paradigm for video coding is needed that will facilitate efficient representation and compression of video for both machine and human use in a scalable manner. In this manuscript, we introduce an end-to-end learnable video codec that supports a machine vision task in its base layer, while its enhancement layer, together with the base layer, supports input reconstruction for human viewing. The proposed system is constructed based on the concept of conditional coding to achieve better compression gains. Comprehensive experimental evaluations conducted on four standard video datasets demonstrate that our framework outperforms both state-of-the-art learned and conventional video codecs in its base layer, while maintaining comparable performance on the human vision task in its enhancement layer. Implementation of the proposed system is available at https://github.com/hadipardis/svc</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenyi Wang, Enneng Yang, Li Shen, Heng Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Forgetting refers to the loss or deterioration of previously acquired knowledge. While existing surveys on forgetting have primarily focused on continual learning, forgetting is a prevalent phenomenon observed in various other research domains within deep learning. Forgetting manifests in research fields such as generative models due to generator shifts, and federated learning due to heterogeneous data distributions across clients. Addressing forgetting encompasses several challenges, including balancing the retention of old task knowledge with fast learning of new task, managing task interference with conflicting goals, and preventing privacy leakage, etc. Moreover, most existing surveys on continual learning implicitly assume that forgetting is always harmful. In contrast, our survey argues that forgetting is a double-edged sword and can be beneficial and desirable in certain cases, such as privacy-preserving scenarios. By exploring forgetting in a broader context, we present a more nuanced understanding of this phenomenon and highlight its potential advantages. Through this comprehensive survey, we aspire to uncover potential solutions by drawing upon ideas and approaches from various fields that have dealt with forgetting. By examining forgetting beyond its conventional boundaries, we hope to encourage the development of novel strategies for mitigating, harnessing, or even embracing forgetting in real applications. A comprehensive list of papers about forgetting in various research fields is available at \url{https://github.com/EnnengYang/Awesome-Forgetting-in-Deep-Learning}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guanxiong Luo, Xiaoqing Wang, Mortiz Blumenthal, Martin Schilling, Erik Hans Ulrich Rauf, Raviteja Kotikalapudi, Niels Focke, Martin Uecker</p>
<p>Abstract: Purpose: In this work, we present a workflow to construct generic and robust generative image priors from magnitude-only images. The priors can then be used for regularization in reconstruction to improve image quality. Methods: The workflow begins with the preparation of training datasets from magnitude-only MR images. This dataset is then augmented with phase information and used to train generative priors of complex images. Finally, trained priors are evaluated using both linear and nonlinear reconstruction for compressed sensing parallel imaging with various undersampling schemes. Results: The results of our experiments demonstrate that priors trained on complex images outperform priors trained only on magnitude images. Additionally, a prior trained on a larger dataset exhibits higher robustness. Finally, we show that the generative priors are superior to L1 -wavelet regularization for compressed sensing parallel imaging with high undersampling. Conclusion: These findings stress the importance of incorporating phase information and leveraging large datasets to raise the performance and reliability of the generative priors for MRI reconstruction. Phase augmentation makes it possible to use existing image databases for training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tariq Adnan, Md Saiful Islam, Wasifur Rahman, Sangwu Lee, Sutapa Dey Tithi, Kazi Noshin, Imran Sarker, M Saifur Rahman, Ehsan Hoque</p>
<p>Abstract: We present an efficient and accessible PD screening method by leveraging AI-driven models enabled by the largest video dataset of facial expressions from 1,059 unique participants. This dataset includes 256 individuals with PD, 165 clinically diagnosed, and 91 self-reported. Participants used webcams to record themselves mimicking three facial expressions (smile, disgust, and surprise) from diverse sources encompassing their homes across multiple countries, a US clinic, and a PD wellness center in the US. Facial landmarks are automatically tracked from the recordings to extract features related to hypomimia, a prominent PD symptom characterized by reduced facial expressions. Machine learning algorithms are trained on these features to distinguish between individuals with and without PD. The model was tested for generalizability on external (unseen during training) test videos collected from a US clinic and Bangladesh. An ensemble of machine learning models trained on smile videos achieved an accuracy of 87.9+-0.1% (95% Confidence Interval) with an AUROC of 89.3+-0.3% as evaluated on held-out data (using k-fold cross-validation). In external test settings, the ensemble model achieved 79.8+-0.6% accuracy with 81.9+-0.3% AUROC on the clinical test set and 84.9+-0.4% accuracy with 81.2+-0.6% AUROC on participants from Bangladesh. In every setting, the model was free from detectable bias across sex and ethnic subgroups, except in the cohorts from Bangladesh, where the model performed significantly better for female participants than males. Smiling videos can effectively differentiate between individuals with and without PD, offering a potentially easy, accessible, and cost-efficient way to screen for PD, especially when a clinical diagnosis is difficult to access.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuning Xu, Binbin Song, Xiangyu Chen, Xina Liu, Jiantao Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Moire patterns frequently appear when capturing screens with smartphones or cameras, potentially compromising image quality. Previous studies suggest that moire pattern elimination in the RAW domain offers greater effectiveness compared to demoireing in the sRGB domain. Nevertheless, relying solely on RAW data for image demoireing is insufficient in mitigating the color cast due to the absence of essential information required for the color correction by the image signal processor (ISP). In this paper, we propose to jointly utilize both RAW and sRGB data for image demoireing (RRID), which are readily accessible in modern smartphones and DSLR cameras. We develop Skip-Connection-based Demoireing Module (SCDM) with Gated Feedback Module (GFM) and Frequency Selection Module (FSM) embedded in skip-connections for the efficient and effective demoireing of RAW and sRGB features, respectively. Subsequently, we design a RGB Guided ISP (RGISP) to learn a device-dependent ISP, assisting the process of color recovery. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our RRID outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, in terms of the performance in moire pattern removal and color cast correction by 0.62dB in PSNR and 0.003 in SSIM.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown extraordinary capabilities in understanding and generating text that closely mirrors human communication. However, a primary limitation lies in the significant computational demands during training, arising from their extensive parameterization. This challenge is further intensified by the dynamic nature of the world, necessitating frequent updates to LLMs to correct outdated information or integrate new knowledge, thereby ensuring their continued relevance. Note that many applications demand continual model adjustments post-training to address deficiencies or undesirable behaviors. There is an increasing interest in efficient, lightweight methods for on-the-fly model modifications. To this end, recent years have seen a burgeoning in the techniques of knowledge editing for LLMs, which aim to efficiently modify LLMs' behaviors within specific domains while preserving overall performance across various inputs. In this paper, we first define the knowledge editing problem and then provide a comprehensive review of cutting-edge approaches. Drawing inspiration from educational and cognitive research theories, we propose a unified categorization criterion that classifies knowledge editing methods into three groups: resorting to external knowledge, merging knowledge into the model, and editing intrinsic knowledge. Furthermore, we introduce a new benchmark, KnowEdit, for a comprehensive empirical evaluation of representative knowledge editing approaches. Additionally, we provide an in-depth analysis of knowledge location, which can give a deeper understanding of the knowledge structures inherent within LLMs. Finally, we discuss several potential applications of knowledge editing, outlining its broad and impactful implications.</p>

<p>Abstract: The digital landscape continually evolves with multimodality, enriching the online experience for users. Creators and marketers aim to weave subtle contextual cues from various modalities into congruent content to engage users with a harmonious message. This interplay of multimodal cues is often a crucial factor in attracting users' attention. However, this richness of multimodality presents a challenge to computational modeling, as the semantic contextual cues spanning across modalities need to be unified to capture the true holistic meaning of the multimodal content. This contextual meaning is critical in attracting user engagement as it conveys the intended message of the brand or the organization. In this work, we incorporate external commonsense knowledge from knowledge graphs to enhance the representation of multimodal data using compact Visual Language Models (VLMs) and predict the success of multi-modal crowdfunding campaigns. Our results show that external knowledge commonsense bridges the semantic gap between text and image modalities, and the enhanced knowledge-infused representations improve the predictive performance of models for campaign success upon the baselines without knowledge. Our findings highlight the significance of contextual congruence in online multimodal content for engaging and successful crowdfunding campaigns.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sotirios Panagiotis Chytas, Vishnu Suresh Lokhande, Peiran Li, Vikas Singh</p>
<p>Abstract: Small sample sizes are common in many disciplines, which necessitates pooling roughly similar datasets across multiple institutions to study weak but relevant associations between images and disease outcomes. Such data often manifest shift/imbalance in covariates (i.e., secondary non-imaging data). Controlling for such nuisance variables is common within standard statistical analysis, but the ideas do not directly apply to overparameterized models. Consequently, recent work has shown how strategies from invariant representation learning provides a meaningful starting point, but the current repertoire of methods is limited to accounting for shifts/imbalances in just a couple of covariates at a time. In this paper, we show how viewing this problem from the perspective of Category theory provides a simple and effective solution that completely avoids elaborate multi-stage training pipelines that would otherwise be needed. We show the effectiveness of this approach via extensive experiments on real datasets. Further, we discuss how this style of formulation offers a unified perspective on at least 5+ distinct problem settings, from self-supervised learning to matching problems in 3D reconstruction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ping Guo, Cheng Gong, Xi Lin, Zhiyuan Yang, Qingfu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The escalating threat of adversarial attacks on deep learning models, particularly in security-critical fields, has underscored the need for robust deep learning systems. Conventional robustness evaluations have relied on adversarial accuracy, which measures a model's performance under a specific perturbation intensity. However, this singular metric does not fully encapsulate the overall resilience of a model against varying degrees of perturbation. To address this gap, we propose a new metric termed adversarial hypervolume, assessing the robustness of deep learning models comprehensively over a range of perturbation intensities from a multi-objective optimization standpoint. This metric allows for an in-depth comparison of defense mechanisms and recognizes the trivial improvements in robustness afforded by less potent defensive strategies. Additionally, we adopt a novel training algorithm that enhances adversarial robustness uniformly across various perturbation intensities, in contrast to methods narrowly focused on optimizing adversarial accuracy. Our extensive empirical studies validate the effectiveness of the adversarial hypervolume metric, demonstrating its ability to reveal subtle differences in robustness that adversarial accuracy overlooks. This research contributes a new measure of robustness and establishes a standard for assessing and benchmarking the resilience of current and future defensive models against adversarial threats.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yalda Zafari-Ghadim, Ahmed Soliman, Yousif Yousif, Ahmed Ibrahim, Essam A. Rashed, Mohamed Mabrok</p>
<p>Abstract: Stroke segmentation plays a crucial role in the diagnosis and treatment of stroke patients by providing spatial information about affected brain regions and the extent of damage. Segmenting stroke lesions accurately is a challenging task, given that conventional manual techniques are time consuming and prone to errors. Recently, advanced deep models have been introduced for general medical image segmentation, demonstrating promising results that surpass many state of the art networks when evaluated on specific datasets. With the advent of the vision Transformers, several models have been introduced based on them, while others have aimed to design better modules based on traditional convolutional layers to extract long-range dependencies like Transformers. The question of whether such high-level designs are necessary for all segmentation cases to achieve the best results remains unanswered. In this study, we selected four types of deep models that were recently proposed and evaluated their performance for stroke segmentation: a pure Transformer-based architecture (DAE-Former), two advanced CNN-based models (LKA and DLKA) with attention mechanisms in their design, an advanced hybrid model that incorporates CNNs with Transformers (FCT), and the well-known self-adaptive nnUNet framework with its configuration based on given data. We examined their performance on two publicly available datasets, and found that the nnUNet achieved the best results with the simplest design among all. Revealing the robustness issue of Transformers to such variabilities serves as a potential reason for their weaker performance. Furthermore, nnUNet's success underscores the significant impact of preprocessing and postprocessing techniques in enhancing segmentation results, surpassing the focus solely on architectural designs</p>

<p>Abstract: The integration of data science into Geographic Information Systems (GIS) has facilitated the evolution of these tools into complete spatial analysis platforms. The adoption of machine learning and big data techniques has equipped these platforms with the capacity to handle larger amounts of increasingly complex data, transcending the limitations of more traditional approaches. This work traces the historical and technical evolution of data science and GIS as fields of study, highlighting the critical points of convergence between domains, and underlining the many sectors that rely on this integration. A GIS application is presented as a case study in the disaster management sector where we utilize aerial data from Tr\'oia, Portugal, to emphasize the process of insight extraction from raw data. We conclude by outlining prospects for future research in integration of these fields in general, and the developed application in particular.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengyuan Jiang, Moyang Guo, Yuepeng Hu, Neil Zhenqiang Gong</p>
<p>Abstract: Several companies have deployed watermark-based detection to identify AI-generated content. However, attribution--the ability to trace back to the user of a generative AI (GenAI) service who created a given piece of AI-generated content--remains largely unexplored despite its growing importance. In this work, we aim to bridge this gap by conducting the first systematic study on watermark-based, user-level attribution of AI-generated content. Our key idea is to assign a unique watermark to each user of the GenAI service and embed this watermark into the AI-generated content created by that user. Attribution is then performed by identifying the user whose watermark best matches the one extracted from the given content. This approach, however, faces a key challenge: How should watermarks be selected for users to maximize attribution performance? To address the challenge, we first theoretically derive lower bounds on detection and attribution performance through rigorous probabilistic analysis for any given set of user watermarks. Then, we select watermarks for users to maximize these lower bounds, thereby optimizing detection and attribution performance. Our theoretical and empirical results show that watermark-based attribution inherits both the accuracy and (non-)robustness properties of the underlying watermark. Specifically, attribution remains highly accurate when the watermarked AI-generated content is either not post-processed or subjected to common post-processing such as JPEG compression, as well as black-box adversarial post-processing with limited query budgets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikhil P Ghanathe, Steven J E Wilton</p>
<p>Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) provides a resource-efficient solution for on-device monitoring of tinyML models deployed without access to true labels. However, existing UQ methods impose significant memory and compute demands, making them impractical for ultra-low-power, KB-sized TinyML devices. Prior work has attempted to reduce overhead by using early-exit ensembles to quantify uncertainty in a single forward pass, but these approaches still carry prohibitive costs. To address this, we propose QUTE, a novel resource-efficient early-exit-assisted ensemble architecture optimized for tinyML models. QUTE introduces additional output blocks at the final exit of the base network, distilling early-exit knowledge into these blocks to form a diverse yet lightweight ensemble. We show that QUTE delivers superior uncertainty quality on tiny models, achieving comparable performance on larger models with 59% smaller model sizes than the closest prior work. When deployed on a microcontroller, QUTE demonstrates a 31% reduction in latency on average. In addition, we show that QUTE excels at detecting accuracy-drop events, outperforming all prior works.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Huang, Bingyang Zhang, Kaituo Zhang, Hua Gao, Rongchun Wan</p>
<p>Abstract: The task of anomaly detection is to separate anomalous data from normal data in the dataset. Models such as deep convolutional autoencoder (CAE) network and deep supporting vector data description (SVDD) model have been universally employed and have demonstrated significant success in detecting anomalies. However, the over-reconstruction ability of CAE network for anomalous data can easily lead to high false negative rate in detecting anomalous data. On the other hand, the deep SVDD model has the drawback of feature collapse, which leads to a decrease of detection accuracy for anomalies. To address these problems, we propose the Improved AutoEncoder with LSTM module and Kullback-Leibler divergence (IAE-LSTM-KL) model in this paper. An LSTM network is added after the encoder to memorize feature representations of normal data. In the meanwhile, the phenomenon of feature collapse can also be mitigated by penalizing the featured input to SVDD module via KL divergence. The efficacy of the IAE-LSTM-KL model is validated through experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Experimental results show that IAE-LSTM-KL model yields higher detection accuracy for anomalies. In addition, it is also found that the IAE-LSTM-KL model demonstrates enhanced robustness to contaminated outliers in the dataset.

<p>Abstract: Deep learning (DL) enables deep neural networks (DNNs) to automatically learn complex tasks or rules from given examples without instructions or guiding principles. As we do not engineer DNNs' functions, it is extremely difficult to diagnose their decisions, and multiple lines of studies proposed to explain the principles of their operations. Notably, one line of studies suggests that DNNs may learn concepts, the high level features that are recognizable to humans. In this study, we extend this line of studies and hypothesize that DNNs can develop abstract codes that can be used to augment DNNs' decision-making. To address this hypothesis, we combine foundation segmentation models and unsupervised learning to extract internal codes and identify potential use of abstract codes to make DL's decision-making more reliable and safer.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyin Ma, Gongfan Fang, Michael Bi Mi, Xinchao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion Transformers have recently demonstrated unprecedented generative capabilities for various tasks. The encouraging results, however, come with the cost of slow inference, since each denoising step requires inference on a transformer model with a large scale of parameters. In this study, we make an interesting and somehow surprising observation: the computation of a large proportion of layers in the diffusion transformer, through introducing a caching mechanism, can be readily removed even without updating the model parameters. In the case of U-ViT-H/2, for example, we may remove up to 93.68% of the computation in the cache steps (46.84% for all steps), with less than 0.01 drop in FID. To achieve this, we introduce a novel scheme, named Learning-to-Cache (L2C), that learns to conduct caching in a dynamic manner for diffusion transformers. Specifically, by leveraging the identical structure of layers in transformers and the sequential nature of diffusion, we explore redundant computations between timesteps by treating each layer as the fundamental unit for caching. To address the challenge of the exponential search space in deep models for identifying layers to cache and remove, we propose a novel differentiable optimization objective. An input-invariant yet timestep-variant router is then optimized, which can finally produce a static computation graph. Experimental results show that L2C largely outperforms samplers such as DDIM and DPM-Solver, alongside prior cache-based methods at the same inference speed.

<p>Abstract: Multi-modal learning has shown exceptional performance in various tasks, especially in medical applications, where it integrates diverse medical information for comprehensive diagnostic evidence. However, there still are several challenges in multi-modal learning, 1. Heterogeneity between modalities, 2. uncertainty in missing modalities, 3. influence of intrinsic noise, and 4. interpretability for fusion result. This paper introduces the Modal-Domain Attention (MDA) model to address the above challenges. MDA constructs linear relationships between modalities through continuous attention, due to its ability to adaptively allocate dynamic attention to different modalities, MDA can reduce attention to low-correlation data, missing modalities, or modalities with inherent noise, thereby maintaining SOTA performance across various tasks on multiple public datasets. Furthermore, our observations on the contribution of different modalities indicate that MDA aligns with established clinical diagnostic imaging gold standards and holds promise as a reference for pathologies where these standards are not yet clearly defined. The code and dataset will be available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pandiyaraju V, Shravan Venkatraman, Abeshek A, Pavan Kumar S, Aravintakshan S A, Kannan A</p>
<p>Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegeneration, annually diagnosed in millions of patients. The present medicine scenario still finds challenges in the exact diagnosis and classification of AD through neuroimaging data. Traditional CNNs can extract a good amount of low-level information in an image but fail to extract high-level minuscule particles, which is a significant challenge in detecting AD from MRI scans. To overcome this, we propose a novel Granular Feature Integration method to combine information extraction at different scales combined with an efficient information flow, enabling the model to capture both broad and fine-grained features simultaneously. We also propose a Bi-Focal Perspective mechanism to highlight the subtle neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques in the MRI scans, ensuring that critical pathological markers are accurately identified. Our model achieved an F1-Score of 99.31%, precision of 99.24%, and recall of 99.51%. These scores prove that our model is significantly better than the state-of-the-art (SOTA) CNNs in existence.</p>

<p>Abstract: Medical imaging segmentation is a highly active area of research, with deep learning-based methods achieving state-of-the-art results in several benchmarks. However, the lack of standardized tools for training, testing, and evaluating new methods makes the comparison of methods difficult. To address this, we introduce the Medical Imaging Segmentation Toolkit (MIST), a simple, modular, and end-to-end medical imaging segmentation framework designed to facilitate consistent training, testing, and evaluation of deep learning-based medical imaging segmentation methods. MIST standardizes data analysis, preprocessing, and evaluation pipelines, accommodating multiple architectures and loss functions. This standardization ensures reproducible and fair comparisons across different methods. We detail MIST's data format requirements, pipelines, and auxiliary features and demonstrate its efficacy using the BraTS Adult Glioma Post-Treatment Challenge dataset. Our results highlight MIST's ability to produce accurate segmentation masks and its scalability across multiple GPUs, showcasing its potential as a powerful tool for future medical imaging research and development.</p>

<p>Abstract: Cervical cancer is a major cause of cancer-related mortality among women worldwide, and its survival rate improves significantly with early detection. Traditional diagnostic methods such as Pap smears and cervical biopsies rely heavily on cytologist expertise, making the process prone to human error. This study introduces CerviXpert, a multi-structural convolutional neural network model designed to efficiently classify cervix types and detect cervical cell abnormalities. CerviXpert is built as a computationally efficient model that classifies cervical cancer using images from the publicly available SiPaKMeD dataset. The model architecture emphasizes simplicity, using a limited number of convolutional layers followed by max pooling and dense layers, trained from scratch.
  We assessed the performance of CerviXpert against other state of the art convolutional neural network models including ResNet50, VGG16, MobileNetV2, and InceptionV3, evaluating them on accuracy, computational efficiency, and robustness using five fold cross validation. CerviXpert achieved an accuracy of 98.04 percent in classifying cervical cell abnormalities into three classes and 98.60 percent for five class cervix type classification, outperforming MobileNetV2 and InceptionV3 in both accuracy and computational requirements. It showed comparable results to ResNet50 and VGG16 while reducing computational complexity and resource needs.
  CerviXpert provides an effective solution for cervical cancer screening and diagnosis, balancing accuracy with computational efficiency. Its streamlined design enables deployment in resource constrained environments, potentially enhancing early detection and management of cervical cancer.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiang Li, Yixiang Dai, Qing Qu</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we study the generalizability of diffusion models by looking into the hidden properties of the learned score functions, which are essentially a series of deep denoisers trained on various noise levels. We observe that as diffusion models transition from memorization to generalization, their corresponding nonlinear diffusion denoisers exhibit increasing linearity. This discovery leads us to investigate the linear counterparts of the nonlinear diffusion models, which are a series of linear models trained to match the function mappings of the nonlinear diffusion denoisers. Surprisingly, these linear denoisers are approximately the optimal denoisers for a multivariate Gaussian distribution characterized by the empirical mean and covariance of the training dataset. This finding implies that diffusion models have the inductive bias towards capturing and utilizing the Gaussian structure (covariance information) of the training dataset for data generation. We empirically demonstrate that this inductive bias is a unique property of diffusion models in the generalization regime, which becomes increasingly evident when the model's capacity is relatively small compared to the training dataset size. In the case that the model is highly overparameterized, this inductive bias emerges during the initial training phases before the model fully memorizes its training data. Our study provides crucial insights into understanding the notable strong generalization phenomenon recently observed in real-world diffusion models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Federated continual learning (FCL) aims to learn from sequential data stream in the decentralized federated learning setting, while simultaneously mitigating the catastrophic forgetting issue in classical continual learning. Existing FCL methods usually employ typical rehearsal mechanisms, which could result in privacy violations or additional onerous storage and computational burdens. In this work, an efficient and non-IID robust federated continual learning framework, called Federated Prototype-Augmented Prompt Learning (FPPL), is proposed. The FPPL can collaboratively learn lightweight prompts augmented by prototypes without rehearsal. On the client side, a fusion function is employed to fully leverage the knowledge contained in task-specific prompts for alleviating catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, global prototypes aggregated from the server are used to obtain unified representation through contrastive learning, mitigating the impact of non-IID-derived data heterogeneity. On the server side, locally uploaded prototypes are utilized to perform debiasing on the classifier, further alleviating the performance degradation caused by both non-IID and catastrophic forgetting. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of FPPL, achieving notable performance with an efficient design while remaining robust to diverse non-IID degrees.

<p>Abstract: COVID-19 is extremely contagious and its rapid growth has drawn attention towards its early diagnosis. Early diagnosis of COVID-19 enables healthcare professionals and government authorities to break the chain of transition and flatten the epidemic curve. With the number of cases accelerating across the developed world, COVID-19 induced Viral Pneumonia cases is a big challenge. Overlapping of COVID-19 cases with Viral Pneumonia and other lung infections with limited dataset and long training hours is a serious problem to cater. Limited amount of data often results in over-fitting models and due to this reason, model does not predict generalized results. To fill this gap, we proposed GAN-based approach to synthesize images which later fed into the deep learning models to classify images of COVID-19, Normal, and Viral Pneumonia. Specifically, customized Wasserstein GAN is proposed to generate 19% more Chest X-ray images as compare to the real images. This expanded dataset is then used to train four proposed deep learning models: VGG-16, ResNet-50, GoogLeNet and MNAST. The result showed that expanded dataset utilized deep learning models to deliver high classification accuracies. In particular, VGG-16 achieved highest accuracy of 99.17% among all four proposed schemes. Rest of the models like ResNet-50, GoogLeNet and MNAST delivered 93.9%, 94.49% and 97.75% testing accuracies respectively. Later, the efficiency of these models is compared with the state of art models on the basis of accuracy. Further, our proposed models can be applied to address the issue of scant datasets for any problem of image analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiao Huo, Junhui Hou, Shuai Wan, Fuzheng Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: The evolution of 3D visualization techniques has fundamentally transformed how we interact with digital content. At the forefront of this change is point cloud technology, offering an immersive experience that surpasses traditional 2D representations. However, the massive data size of point clouds presents significant challenges in data compression. Current methods for lossy point cloud attribute compression (PCAC) generally focus on reconstructing the original point clouds with minimal error. However, for point cloud visualization scenarios, the reconstructed point clouds with distortion still need to undergo a complex rendering process, which affects the final user-perceived quality. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep learning framework that seamlessly integrates PCAC with differentiable rendering, denoted as rendering-oriented PCAC (RO-PCAC), directly targeting the quality of rendered multiview images for viewing. In a differentiable manner, the impact of the rendering process on the reconstructed point clouds is taken into account. Moreover, we characterize point clouds as sparse tensors and propose a sparse tensor-based transformer, called SP-Trans. By aligning with the local density of the point cloud and utilizing an enhanced local attention mechanism, SP-Trans captures the intricate relationships within the point cloud, further improving feature analysis and synthesis within the framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed RO-PCAC achieves state-of-the-art compression performance, compared to existing reconstruction-oriented methods, including traditional, learning-based, and hybrid methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mahmut S. Gokmen, Cody Bumgardner, Caner Ozcan</p>
<p>Abstract: Coronary artery disease (CAD), one of the most common cause of mortality in the world. Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring using computed tomography (CT) is key for risk assessment to prevent coronary disease. Previous studies on risk assessment and calcification detection in CT scans primarily use approaches based on UNET architecture, frequently implemented on pre-built models. However, these models are limited by the availability of annotated CT scans containing CAC and suffering from imbalanced dataset, decreasing performance of CAC segmentation and scoring. In this study, we extend this approach by incorporating the self-supervised learning (SSL) technique of DINO (self-distillation with no labels) to eliminate limitations of scarce annotated data in CT scans. The DINO model's ability to train without requiring CAC area annotations enhances its robustness in generating distinct features. The DINO model is trained on to focus specifically on calcified areas by using labels, aiming to generate features that effectively capture and highlight key characteristics. The label-guided DINO (DINO-LG) enhances classification by distinguishing CT slices that contain calcification from those that do not, performing 57% better than the standard DINO model in this task. CAC scoring and segmentation tasks are performed by a basic U-NET architecture, fed specifically with CT slices containing calcified areas as identified by the DINO-LG model. This targeted identification performed by DINO-LG model improves CAC segmentation performance by approximately 10% and significant increase in CAC scoring accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Imagine searching a collection of coins for quarters ($0.25$), dimes ($0.10$), nickels ($0.05$), and pennies ($0.01$)-a hybrid foraging task where observers look for multiple instances of multiple target types. In such tasks, how do target values and their prevalence influence foraging and eye movement behaviors (e.g., should you prioritize rare quarters or common nickels)? To explore this, we conducted human psychophysics experiments, revealing that humans are proficient reward foragers. Their eye fixations are drawn to regions with higher average rewards, fixation durations are longer on more valuable targets, and their cumulative rewards exceed chance, approaching the upper bound of optimal foragers. To probe these decision-making processes of humans, we developed a transformer-based Visual Forager (VF) model trained via reinforcement learning. Our VF model takes a series of targets, their corresponding values, and the search image as inputs, processes the images using foveated vision, and produces a sequence of eye movements along with decisions on whether to collect each fixated item. Our model outperforms all baselines, achieves cumulative rewards comparable to those of humans, and approximates human foraging behavior in eye movements and foraging biases within time-limited environments. Furthermore, stress tests on out-of-distribution tasks with novel targets, unseen values, and varying set sizes demonstrate the VF model's effective generalization. Our work offers valuable insights into the relationship between eye movements and decision-making, with our model serving as a powerful tool for further exploration of this connection. All data, code, and models will be made publicly available.</p>
