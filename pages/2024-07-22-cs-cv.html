<p><b>Authors:</b> Gongjin Lan, Yu Wu, Qi Hao</p>
<p>Abstract: Human pose estimation (HPE), particularly multi-person pose estimation (MPPE), has been applied in many domains such as human-machine systems. However, the current MPPE methods generally run on powerful GPU systems and take a lot of computational costs. Real-time MPPE on mobile devices with low-performance computing is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a lightweight neural network, DIR-BHRNet, for real-time MPPE on smartphones. In DIR-BHRNet, we design a novel lightweight convolutional module, Dense Inverted Residual (DIR), to improve accuracy by adding a depthwise convolution and a shortcut connection into the well-known Inverted Residual, and a novel efficient neural network structure, Balanced HRNet (BHRNet), to reduce computational costs by reconfiguring the proper number of convolutional blocks on each branch. We evaluate DIR-BHRNet on the well-known COCO and CrowdPose datasets. The results show that DIR-BHRNet outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy with a real-time computational cost. Finally, we implement the DIR-BHRNet on the current mainstream Android smartphones, which perform more than 10 FPS. The free-used executable file (Android 10), source code, and a video description of this work are publicly available on the page 1 to facilitate the development of real-time MPPE on smartphones.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13778">Assessing the Potential of PlanetScope Satellite Imagery to Estimate Particulate Matter Oxidative Potential</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ian Hough, Lo\"ic Argentier, Ziyang Jiang, Tongshu Zheng, Mike Bergin, David Carlson, Jean-Luc Jaffrezo, Jocelyn Chanussot, Ga\"elle Uzu</p>
<p>Abstract: Oxidative potential (OP), which measures particulate matter's (PM) capacity to induce oxidative stress in the lungs, is increasingly recognized as an indicator of PM toxicity. Since OP is not routinely monitored, it can be challenging to estimate exposure and health impacts. Remote sensing data are commonly used to estimate PM mass concentration, but have never been used to estimate OP. In this study, we evaluate the potential of satellite images to estimate OP as measured by acellular ascorbic acid (OP AA) and dithiothreitol (OP DTT) assays of 24-hour PM10 sampled periodically over five years at three locations around Grenoble, France. We use a deep convolutional neural network to extract features of daily 3 m/pixel PlanetScope satellite images and train a multilayer perceptron to estimate OP at a 1 km spatial resolution based on the image features and common meteorological variables. The model captures more than half of the variation in OP AA and almost half of the variation in OP DTT (test set R2 = 0.62 and 0.48, respectively), with relative mean absolute error (MAE) of about 32%. Using only satellite images, the model still captures about half of the variation in OP AA and one third of the variation in OP DTT (test set R2 = 0.49 and 0.36, respectively) with relative MAE of about 37%. If confirmed in other areas, our approach could represent a low-cost method for expanding the temporal or spatial coverage of OP estimates.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gun Lee, Subin An, Sungyong Baik, Soochahn Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a novel prompt tuning method called CoAPT(Context Attribute words in Prompt Tuning) for few/zero-shot image classification. The core motivation is that attributes are descriptive words with rich information about a given concept. Thus, we aim to enrich text queries of existing prompt tuning methods, improving alignment between text and image embeddings in CLIP embedding space. To do so, CoAPT integrates attribute words as additional prompts within learnable prompt tuning and can be easily incorporated into various existing prompt tuning methods. To facilitate the incorporation of attributes into text embeddings and the alignment with image embeddings, soft prompts are trained together with an additional meta-network that generates input-image-wise feature biases from the concatenated feature encodings of the image-text combined queries. Our experiments demonstrate that CoAPT leads to considerable improvements for existing baseline methods on several few/zero-shot image classification tasks, including base-to-novel generalization, cross-dataset transfer, and domain generalization. Our findings highlight the importance of combining hard and soft prompts and pave the way for future research on the interplay between text and image latent spaces in pre-trained models.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13811">Which objects help me to act effectively? Reasoning about physically-grounded affordances</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Anne Kemmeren, Gertjan Burghouts, Michael van Bekkum, Wouter Meijer, Jelle van Mil</p>
<p>Abstract: For effective interactions with the open world, robots should understand how interactions with known and novel objects help them towards their goal. A key aspect of this understanding lies in detecting an object's affordances, which represent the potential effects that can be achieved by manipulating the object in various ways. Our approach leverages a dialogue of large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) to achieve open-world affordance detection. Given open-vocabulary descriptions of intended actions and effects, the useful objects in the environment are found. By grounding our system in the physical world, we account for the robot's embodiment and the intrinsic properties of the objects it encounters. In our experiments, we have shown that our method produces tailored outputs based on different embodiments or intended effects. The method was able to select a useful object from a set of distractors. Finetuning the VLM for physical properties improved overall performance. These results underline the importance of grounding the affordance search in the physical world, by taking into account robot embodiment and the physical properties of objects.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rahul Ramesh, Anthony Bisulco, Ronald W. DiTullio, Linran Wei, Vijay Balasubramanian, Kostas Daniilidis, Pratik Chaudhari</p>
<p>Abstract: We show that many perception tasks, from visual recognition, semantic segmentation, optical flow, depth estimation to vocalization discrimination, are highly redundant functions of their input data. Images or spectrograms, projected into different subspaces, formed by orthogonal bases in pixel, Fourier or wavelet domains, can be used to solve these tasks remarkably well regardless of whether it is the top subspace where data varies the most, some intermediate subspace with moderate variability--or the bottom subspace where data varies the least. This phenomenon occurs because different subspaces have a large degree of redundant information relevant to the task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sirnam Swetha, Jinyu Yang, Tal Neiman, Mamshad Nayeem Rizve, Son Tran, Benjamin Yao, Trishul Chilimbi, Mubarak Shah</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have revolutionized the field of vision-language understanding by integrating visual perception capabilities into Large Language Models (LLMs). The prevailing trend in this field involves the utilization of a vision encoder derived from vision-language contrastive learning (CL), showing expertise in capturing overall representations while facing difficulties in capturing detailed local patterns. In this work, we focus on enhancing the visual representations for MLLMs by combining high-frequency and detailed visual representations, obtained through masked image modeling (MIM), with semantically-enriched low-frequency representations captured by CL. To achieve this goal, we introduce X-Former which is a lightweight transformer module designed to exploit the complementary strengths of CL and MIM through an innovative interaction mechanism. Specifically, X-Former first bootstraps vision-language representation learning and multimodal-to-multimodal generative learning from two frozen vision encoders, i.e., CLIP-ViT (CL-based) and MAE-ViT (MIM-based). It further bootstraps vision-to-language generative learning from a frozen LLM to ensure visual features from X-Former can be interpreted by the LLM. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we assess its performance on tasks demanding detailed visual understanding. Extensive evaluations indicate that X-Former excels in visual reasoning tasks involving both structural and semantic categories in the GQA dataset. Assessment on fine-grained visual perception benchmark further confirms its superior capabilities in visual understanding.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13862">Enhancing Worldwide Image Geolocation by Ensembling Satellite-Based Ground-Level Attribute Predictors</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael J. Bianco, David Eigen, Michael Gormish</p>
<p>Abstract: Geolocating images of a ground-level scene entails estimating the location on Earth where the picture was taken, in absence of GPS or other location metadata. Typically, methods are evaluated by measuring the Great Circle Distance (GCD) between a predicted location and ground truth. However, this measurement is limited because it only evaluates a single point, not estimates of regions or score heatmaps. This is especially important in applications to rural, wilderness and under-sampled areas, where finding the exact location may not be possible, and when used in aggregate systems that progressively narrow down locations.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel metric, Recall vs Area (RvA), which measures the accuracy of estimated distributions of locations. RvA treats image geolocation results similarly to document retrieval, measuring recall as a function of area: For a ranked list of (possibly non-contiguous) predicted regions, we measure the accumulated area required for the region to contain the ground truth coordinate. This produces a curve similar to a precision-recall curve, where "precision" is replaced by square kilometers area, allowing evaluation of performance for different downstream search area budgets.
  Following directly from this view of the problem, we then examine a simple ensembling approach to global-scale image geolocation, which incorporates information from multiple sources to help address domain shift, and can readily incorporate multiple models, attribute predictors, and data sources. We study its effectiveness by combining the geolocation models GeoEstimation and the current SOTA GeoCLIP, with attribute predictors based on ORNL LandScan and ESA-CCI Land Cover. We find significant improvements in image geolocation for areas that are under-represented in the training set, particularly non-urban areas, on both Im2GPS3k and Street View images.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13863">A Closer Look at GAN Priors: Exploiting Intermediate Features for Enhanced Model Inversion Attacks</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yixiang Qiu, Hao Fang, Hongyao Yu, Bin Chen, MeiKang Qiu, Shu-Tao Xia</p>
<p>Abstract: Model Inversion (MI) attacks aim to reconstruct privacy-sensitive training data from released models by utilizing output information, raising extensive concerns about the security of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). Recent advances in generative adversarial networks (GANs) have contributed significantly to the improved performance of MI attacks due to their powerful ability to generate realistic images with high fidelity and appropriate semantics. However, previous MI attacks have solely disclosed private information in the latent space of GAN priors, limiting their semantic extraction and transferability across multiple target models and datasets. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method, Intermediate Features enhanced Generative Model Inversion (IF-GMI), which disassembles the GAN structure and exploits features between intermediate blocks. This allows us to extend the optimization space from latent code to intermediate features with enhanced expressive capabilities. To prevent GAN priors from generating unrealistic images, we apply a L1 ball constraint to the optimization process. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous approaches and achieves state-of-the-art results under various settings, especially in the out-of-distribution (OOD) scenario.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13873">Keypoint Aware Masked Image Modelling</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Madhava Krishna, A V Subramanyam</p>
<p>Abstract: SimMIM is a widely used method for pretraining vision transformers using masked image modeling. However, despite its success in fine-tuning performance, it has been shown to perform sub-optimally when used for linear probing. We propose an efficient patch-wise weighting derived from keypoint features which captures the local information and provides better context during SimMIM's reconstruction phase. Our method, KAMIM, improves the top-1 linear probing accuracy from 16.12% to 33.97%, and finetuning accuracy from 76.78% to 77.3% when tested on the ImageNet-1K dataset with a ViT-B when trained for the same number of epochs. We conduct extensive testing on different datasets, keypoint extractors, and model architectures and observe that patch-wise weighting augments linear probing performance for larger pretraining datasets. We also analyze the learned representations of a ViT-B trained using KAMIM and observe that they behave similar to contrastive learning with regard to its behavior, with longer attention distances and homogenous self-attention across layers.

<p>Abstract: We study the problem of Continual Distillation Learning (CDL) that considers Knowledge Distillation (KD) in the Continual Learning (CL) setup. A teacher model and a student model need to learn a sequence of tasks, and the knowledge of the teacher model will be distilled to the student to improve the student model. We introduce a novel method named CDL-Prompt that utilizes prompt-based continual learning models to build the teacher-student model. We investigate how to utilize the prompts of the teacher model in the student model for knowledge distillation, and propose an attention-based prompt mapping scheme to use the teacher prompts for the student. We demonstrate that our method can be applied to different prompt-based continual learning models such as L2P, DualPrompt and CODA-Prompt to improve their performance using powerful teacher models. Although recent CL methods focus on prompt learning, we show that our method can be utilized to build efficient CL models using prompt-based knowledge distillation.</p>

<p>Abstract: We here propose a novel hierarchical transformer model that adeptly integrates the feature extraction capabilities of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with the advanced representational potential of Vision Transformers (ViTs). Addressing the lack of inductive biases and dependence on extensive training datasets in ViTs, our model employs a CNN backbone to generate hierarchical visual representations. These representations are then adapted for transformer input through an innovative patch tokenization. We also introduce a 'scale attention' mechanism that captures cross-scale dependencies, complementing patch attention to enhance spatial understanding and preserve global perception. Our approach significantly outperforms baseline models on small and medium-sized medical datasets, demonstrating its efficiency and generalizability. The components are designed as plug-and-play for different CNN architectures and can be adapted for multiple applications. The code is available at https://github.com/xiaoyatang/DuoFormer.git.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guruprasad V Ramesh, Harrison Rosenberg, Ashish Hooda, Kassem Fawaz</p>
<p>Abstract: Computer vision systems have been deployed in various applications involving biometrics like human faces. These systems can identify social media users, search for missing persons, and verify identity of individuals. While computer vision models are often evaluated for accuracy on available benchmarks, more annotated data is necessary to learn about their robustness and fairness against semantic distributional shifts in input data, especially in face data. Among annotated data, counterfactual examples grant strong explainability characteristics. Because collecting natural face data is prohibitively expensive, we put forth a generative AI-based framework to construct targeted, counterfactual, high-quality synthetic face data. Our synthetic data pipeline has many use cases, including face recognition systems sensitivity evaluations and image understanding system probes. The pipeline is validated with multiple user studies. We showcase the efficacy of our face generation pipeline on a leading commercial vision model. We identify facial attributes that cause vision systems to fail.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuan-Hao Ho, Jen-Hao Cheng, Sheng Yao Kuan, Zhongyu Jiang, Wenhao Chai, Hsiang-Wei Huang, Chih-Lung Lin, Jenq-Neng Hwang</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional methods for human localization and pose estimation (HPE), which mainly rely on RGB images as an input modality, confront substantial limitations in real-world applications due to privacy concerns. In contrast, radar-based HPE methods emerge as a promising alternative, characterized by distinctive attributes such as through-wall recognition and privacy-preserving, rendering the method more conducive to practical deployments. This paper presents a Radar Tensor-based human pose (RT-Pose) dataset and an open-source benchmarking framework. The RT-Pose dataset comprises 4D radar tensors, LiDAR point clouds, and RGB images, and is collected for a total of 72k frames across 240 sequences with six different complexity-level actions. The 4D radar tensor provides raw spatio-temporal information, differentiating it from other radar point cloud-based datasets. We develop an annotation process using RGB images and LiDAR point clouds to accurately label 3D human skeletons. In addition, we propose HRRadarPose, the first single-stage architecture that extracts the high-resolution representation of 4D radar tensors in 3D space to aid human keypoint estimation. HRRadarPose outperforms previous radar-based HPE work on the RT-Pose benchmark. The overall HRRadarPose performance on the RT-Pose dataset, as reflected in a mean per joint position error (MPJPE) of 9.91cm, indicates the persistent challenges in achieving accurate HPE in complex real-world scenarios.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zahidul Islam, Sujoy Paul, Mrigank Rochan</p>
<p>Abstract: With the exponential growth of video content, the need for automated video highlight detection to extract key moments or highlights from lengthy videos has become increasingly pressing. This technology has the potential to significantly enhance user experiences by allowing quick access to relevant content across diverse domains. Existing methods typically rely either on expensive manually labeled frame-level annotations, or on a large external dataset of videos for weak supervision through category information. To overcome this, we focus on unsupervised video highlight detection, eliminating the need for manual annotations. We propose an innovative unsupervised approach which capitalizes on the premise that significant moments tend to recur across multiple videos of the similar category in both audio and visual modalities. Surprisingly, audio remains under-explored, especially in unsupervised algorithms, despite its potential to detect key moments. Through a clustering technique, we identify pseudo-categories of videos and compute audio pseudo-highlight scores for each video by measuring the similarities of audio features among audio clips of all the videos within each pseudo-category. Similarly, we also compute visual pseudo-highlight scores for each video using visual features. Subsequently, we combine audio and visual pseudo-highlights to create the audio-visual pseudo ground-truth highlight of each video for training an audio-visual highlight detection network. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on three highlight detection benchmarks showcase the superior performance of our method over prior work.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13974">Continual Learning for Remote Physiological Measurement: Minimize Forgetting and Simplify Inference</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Qian Liang, Yan Chen, Yang Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) has gained significant attention in recent years for its ability to extract physiological signals from facial videos. While existing rPPG measurement methods have shown satisfactory performance in intra-dataset and cross-dataset scenarios, they often overlook the incremental learning scenario, where training data is presented sequentially, resulting in the issue of catastrophic forgetting. Meanwhile, most existing class incremental learning approaches are unsuitable for rPPG measurement. In this paper, we present a novel method named ADDP to tackle continual learning for rPPG measurement. We first employ adapter to efficiently finetune the model on new tasks. Then we design domain prototypes that are more applicable to rPPG signal regression than commonly used class prototypes. Based on these prototypes, we propose a feature augmentation strategy to consolidate the past knowledge and an inference simplification strategy to convert potentially forgotten tasks into familiar ones for the model. To evaluate ADDP and enable fair comparisons, we create the first continual learning protocol for rPPG measurement.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ka-Ho Chow, Sihao Hu, Tiansheng Huang, Ling Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Face recognition (FR) can be abused for privacy intrusion. Governments, private companies, or even individual attackers can collect facial images by web scraping to build an FR system identifying human faces without their consent. This paper introduces Chameleon, which learns to generate a user-centric personalized privacy protection mask, coined as P3-Mask, to protect facial images against unauthorized FR with three salient features. First, we use a cross-image optimization to generate one P3-Mask for each user instead of tailoring facial perturbation for each facial image of a user. It enables efficient and instant protection even for users with limited computing resources. Second, we incorporate a perceptibility optimization to preserve the visual quality of the protected facial images. Third, we strengthen the robustness of P3-Mask against unknown FR models by integrating focal diversity-optimized ensemble learning into the mask generation process. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that Chameleon outperforms three state-of-the-art methods with instant protection and minimal degradation of image quality. Furthermore, Chameleon enables cost-effective FR authorization using the P3-Mask as a personalized de-obfuscation key, and it demonstrates high resilience against adaptive adversaries.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuo Huang, Shikun Sun, Zixuan Wang, Xiaoyu Qin, Yanmin Xiong, Yuan Zhang, Pengfei Wan, Di Zhang, Jia Jia</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, text-to-3D generation has attracted significant attention, resulting in notable performance enhancements. Previous methods utilize end-to-end 3D generation models to initialize 3D Gaussians, multi-view diffusion models to enforce multi-view consistency, and text-to-image diffusion models to refine details with score distillation algorithms. However, these methods exhibit two limitations. Firstly, they encounter conflicts in generation directions since different models aim to produce diverse 3D assets. Secondly, the issue of over-saturation in score distillation has not been thoroughly investigated and solved. To address these limitations, we propose PlacidDreamer, a text-to-3D framework that harmonizes initialization, multi-view generation, and text-conditioned generation with a single multi-view diffusion model, while simultaneously employing a novel score distillation algorithm to achieve balanced saturation. To unify the generation direction, we introduce the Latent-Plane module, a training-friendly plug-in extension that enables multi-view diffusion models to provide fast geometry reconstruction for initialization and enhanced multi-view images to personalize the text-to-image diffusion model. To address the over-saturation problem, we propose to view score distillation as a multi-objective optimization problem and introduce the Balanced Score Distillation algorithm, which offers a Pareto Optimal solution that achieves both rich details and balanced saturation. Extensive experiments validate the outstanding capabilities of our PlacidDreamer. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/HansenHuang0823/PlacidDreamer}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cheng Gong, Yao Chen, Qiuyang Luo, Ye Lu, Tao Li, Yuzhi Zhang, Yufei Sun, Le Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-exit network is a promising architecture for efficient model inference by sharing backbone networks and weights among multiple exits. However, the gradient conflict of the shared weights results in sub-optimal accuracy. This paper introduces Deep Feature Surgery (\methodname), which consists of feature partitioning and feature referencing approaches to resolve gradient conflict issues during the training of multi-exit networks. The feature partitioning separates shared features along the depth axis among all exits to alleviate gradient conflict while simultaneously promoting joint optimization for each exit. Subsequently, feature referencing enhances multi-scale features for distinct exits across varying depths to improve the model accuracy. Furthermore, \methodname~reduces the training operations with the reduced complexity of backpropagation. Experimental results on Cifar100 and ImageNet datasets exhibit that \methodname~provides up to a \textbf{50.00\%} reduction in training time and attains up to a \textbf{6.94\%} enhancement in accuracy when contrasted with baseline methods across diverse models and tasks. Budgeted batch classification evaluation on MSDNet demonstrates that DFS uses about $\mathbf{2}\boldsymbol{\times}$ fewer average FLOPs per image to achieve the same classification accuracy as baseline methods on Cifar100.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuehan Zhang, Angela Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: In real-world video super-resolution (VSR), videos suffer from in-the-wild degradations and artifacts. VSR methods, especially recurrent ones, tend to propagate artifacts over time in the real-world setting and are more vulnerable than image super-resolution. This paper investigates the influence of artifacts on commonly used covariance-based attention mechanisms in VSR. Comparing the widely-used spatial attention, which computes covariance over space, versus the channel attention, we observe that the latter is less sensitive to artifacts. However, channel attention leads to feature redundancy, as evidenced by the higher covariance among output channels. As such, we explore simple techniques such as the squeeze-excite mechanism and covariance-based rescaling to counter the effects of high channel covariance. Based on our findings, we propose RealViformer. This channel-attention-based real-world VSR framework surpasses state-of-the-art on two real-world VSR datasets with fewer parameters and faster runtimes.

<p>Abstract: Inspired by traditional handmade crafts, where a person improvises assemblies based on the available objects, we formally introduce the Craft Assembly Task. It is a robotic assembly task that involves building an accurate representation of a given target object using the available objects, which do not directly correspond to its parts. In this work, we focus on selecting the subset of available objects for the final craft, when the given input is an RGB image of the target in the wild. We use a mask segmentation neural network to identify visible parts, followed by retrieving labelled template meshes. These meshes undergo pose optimization to determine the most suitable template. Then, we propose to simplify the parts of the transformed template mesh to primitive shapes like cuboids or cylinders. Finally, we design a search algorithm to find correspondences in the scene based on local and global proportions. We develop baselines for comparison that consider all possible combinations, and choose the highest scoring combination for common metrics used in foreground maps and mask accuracy. Our approach achieves comparable results to the baselines for two different scenes, and we show qualitative results for an implementation in a real-world scenario.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huiqun Wang, Yiping Bao, Panwang Pan, Zeming Li, Xiao Liu, Ruijie Yang, Di Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in multi-modal pre-training for 3D point clouds have demonstrated promising results by aligning heterogeneous features across 3D shapes and their corresponding 2D images and language descriptions. However, current straightforward solutions often overlook intricate structural relations among samples, potentially limiting the full capabilities of multi-modal learning. To address this issue, we introduce Multi-modal Relation Distillation (MRD), a tri-modal pre-training framework, which is designed to effectively distill reputable large Vision-Language Models (VLM) into 3D backbones. MRD aims to capture both intra-relations within each modality as well as cross-relations between different modalities and produce more discriminative 3D shape representations. Notably, MRD achieves significant improvements in downstream zero-shot classification tasks and cross-modality retrieval tasks, delivering new state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenrui Han, Xuan Yu, Yuxuan Xie, Yili Liu, Sitong Mao, Shunbo Zhou, Rong Xiong, Yue Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Interactive point cloud segmentation has become a pivotal task for understanding 3D scenes, enabling users to guide segmentation models with simple interactions such as clicks, therefore significantly reducing the effort required to tailor models to diverse scenarios and new categories. However, in the realm of interactive segmentation, the meaning of instance diverges from that in instance segmentation, because users might desire to segment instances of both thing and stuff categories that vary greatly in scale. Existing methods have focused on thing categories, neglecting the segmentation of stuff categories and the difficulties arising from scale disparity. To bridge this gap, we propose ClickFormer, an innovative interactive point cloud segmentation model that accurately segments instances of both thing and stuff categories. We propose a query augmentation module to augment click queries by a global query sampling strategy, thus maintaining consistent performance across different instance scales. Additionally, we employ global attention in the query-voxel transformer to mitigate the risk of generating false positives, along with several other network structure improvements to further enhance the model's segmentation performance. Experiments demonstrate that ClickFormer outperforms existing interactive point cloud segmentation methods across both indoor and outdoor datasets, providing more accurate segmentation results with fewer user clicks in an open-world setting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sandesh Pokhrel, Sanjay Bhandari, Eduard Vazquez, Tryphon Lambrou, Prashnna Gyawali, Binod Bhattarai</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning has significantly advanced the field of gastrointestinal vision, enhancing disease diagnosis capabilities. One major challenge in automating diagnosis within gastrointestinal settings is the detection of abnormal cases in endoscopic images. Due to the sparsity of data, this process of distinguishing normal from abnormal cases has faced significant challenges, particularly with rare and unseen conditions. To address this issue, we frame abnormality detection as an out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problem. In this setup, a model trained on In-Distribution (ID) data, which represents a healthy GI tract, can accurately identify healthy cases, while abnormalities are detected as OOD, regardless of their class. We introduce a test-time augmentation segment into the OOD detection pipeline, which enhances the distinction between ID and OOD examples, thereby improving the effectiveness of existing OOD methods with the same model. This augmentation shifts the pixel space, which translates into a more distinct semantic representation for OOD examples compared to ID examples. We evaluated our method against existing state-of-the-art OOD scores, showing improvements with test-time augmentation over the baseline approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chang Wook Seo, Amirsaman Ashtari, Junyong Noh</p>
<p>Abstract: Sketches reflect the drawing style of individual artists; therefore, it is important to consider their unique styles when extracting sketches from color images for various applications. Unfortunately, most existing sketch extraction methods are designed to extract sketches of a single style. Although there have been some attempts to generate various style sketches, the methods generally suffer from two limitations: low quality results and difficulty in training the model due to the requirement of a paired dataset. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal sketch extraction method that can imitate the style of a given reference sketch with unpaired data training in a semi-supervised manner. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art sketch extraction methods and unpaired image translation methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fei Zhu, Xu-Yao Zhang, Zhen Cheng, Cheng-Lin Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) aims to recognize new classes incrementally while maintaining the discriminability of old classes. Most existing CIL methods are exemplar-based, i.e., storing a part of old data for retraining. Without relearning old data, those methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we figure out two inherent problems in CIL, i.e., representation bias and classifier bias, that cause catastrophic forgetting of old knowledge. To address these two biases, we present a simple and novel dual bias reduction framework that employs self-supervised transformation (SST) in input space and prototype augmentation (protoAug) in deep feature space. On the one hand, SST alleviates the representation bias by learning generic and diverse representations that can transfer across different tasks. On the other hand, protoAug overcomes the classifier bias by explicitly or implicitly augmenting prototypes of old classes in the deep feature space, which poses tighter constraints to maintain previously learned decision boundaries. We further propose hardness-aware prototype augmentation and multi-view ensemble strategies, leading to significant improvements. The proposed framework can be easily integrated with pre-trained models. Without storing any samples of old classes, our method can perform comparably with state-of-the-art exemplar-based approaches which store plenty of old data. We hope to draw the attention of researchers back to non-exemplar CIL by rethinking the necessity of storing old samples in CIL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongshuo Zhu, Lu Li, Keyan Chen, Chenyang Liu, Fugen Zhou, Zhenwei Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Remote sensing image change captioning (RSICC) aims to articulate the changes in objects of interest within bi-temporal remote sensing images using natural language. Given the limitations of current RSICC methods in expressing general features across multi-temporal and spatial scenarios, and their deficiency in providing granular, robust, and precise change descriptions, we introduce a novel change captioning (CC) method based on the foundational knowledge and semantic guidance, which we term Semantic-CC. Semantic-CC alleviates the dependency of high-generalization algorithms on extensive annotations by harnessing the latent knowledge of foundation models, and it generates more comprehensive and accurate change descriptions guided by pixel-level semantics from change detection (CD). Specifically, we propose a bi-temporal SAM-based encoder for dual-image feature extraction; a multi-task semantic aggregation neck for facilitating information interaction between heterogeneous tasks; a straightforward multi-scale change detection decoder to provide pixel-level semantic guidance; and a change caption decoder based on the large language model (LLM) to generate change description sentences. Moreover, to ensure the stability of the joint training of CD and CC, we propose a three-stage training strategy that supervises different tasks at various stages. We validate the proposed method on the LEVIR-CC and LEVIR-CD datasets. The experimental results corroborate the complementarity of CD and CC, demonstrating that Semantic-CC can generate more accurate change descriptions and achieve optimal performance across both tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion models that can generate high-quality data from randomly sampled Gaussian noises have become the mainstream generative method in both academia and industry. Are randomly sampled Gaussian noises equally good for diffusion models? While a large body of works tried to understand and improve diffusion models, previous works overlooked the possibility to select or optimize the sampled noise the possibility of selecting or optimizing sampled noises for improving diffusion models. In this paper, we mainly made three contributions. First, we report that not all noises are created equally for diffusion models. We are the first to hypothesize and empirically observe that the generation quality of diffusion models significantly depend on the noise inversion stability. This naturally provides us a noise selection method according to the inversion stability. Second, we further propose a novel noise optimization method that actively enhances the inversion stability of arbitrary given noises. Our method is the first one that works on noise space to generally improve generated results without fine-tuning diffusion models. Third, our extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed noise selection and noise optimization methods both significantly improve representative diffusion models, such as SDXL and SDXL-turbo, in terms of human preference and other objective evaluation metrics. For example, the human preference winning rates of noise selection and noise optimization over the baselines can be up to 57% and 72.5%, respectively, on DrawBench.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reconstructing 3D human-object interaction (HOI) from single-view RGB images is challenging due to the absence of depth information and potential occlusions. Existing methods simply predict the body poses merely rely on network training on some indoor datasets, which cannot guarantee the rationality of the results if some body parts are invisible due to occlusions that appear easily. Inspired by the end-effector localization task in robotics, we propose a kinematics-based method that can drive the joints of human body to the human-object contact regions accurately. After an improved forward kinematics algorithm is proposed, the Multi-Layer Perceptron is introduced into the solution of inverse kinematics process to determine the poses of joints, which achieves precise results than the commonly-used numerical methods in robotics. Besides, a Contact Region Recognition Network (CRRNet) is also proposed to robustly determine the contact regions using a single-view video. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art on benchmark BEHAVE. Additionally, our approach shows good portability and can be seamlessly integrated into other methods for optimizations.</p>

<p>Abstract: We study a novel yet practical problem of open-corpus multi-object tracking (OCMOT), which extends the MOT into localizing, associating, and recognizing generic-category objects of both seen (base) and unseen (novel) classes, but without the category text list as prompt. To study this problem, the top priority is to build a benchmark. In this work, we build OCTrackB, a large-scale and comprehensive benchmark, to provide a standard evaluation platform for the OCMOT problem. Compared to previous datasets, OCTrackB has more abundant and balanced base/novel classes and the corresponding samples for evaluation with less bias. We also propose a new multi-granularity recognition metric to better evaluate the generative object recognition in OCMOT. By conducting the extensive benchmark evaluation, we report and analyze the results of various state-of-the-art methods, which demonstrate the rationale of OCMOT, as well as the usefulness and advantages of OCTrackB.</p>

<p>Abstract: Data plays a crucial role in training learning-based methods for 3D point cloud registration. However, the real-world dataset is expensive to build, while rendering-based synthetic data suffers from domain gaps. In this work, we present PointRegGPT, boosting 3D point cloud registration using generative point-cloud pairs for training. Given a single depth map, we first apply a random camera motion to re-project it into a target depth map. Converting them to point clouds gives a training pair. To enhance the data realism, we formulate a generative model as a depth inpainting diffusion to process the target depth map with the re-projected source depth map as the condition. Also, we design a depth correction module to alleviate artifacts caused by point penetration during the re-projection. To our knowledge, this is the first generative approach that explores realistic data generation for indoor point cloud registration. When equipped with our approach, several recent algorithms can improve their performance significantly and achieve SOTA consistently on two common benchmarks.

We integrate kinematics with dynamic radiance fields, bridging the gap between the sparse nature of monocular videos and the real-world physics. Our method introduces the kinematic field, capturing motion through kinematic quantities: velocity, acceleration, and jerk. The kinematic field is jointly learned with the dynamic radiance field by minimizing the photometric loss without motion ground truth. We further augment our method with physics-driven regularizers grounded in kinematics. We propose physics-driven regularizers that ensure the physical validity of predicted kinematic quantities, including advective acceleration and jerk. Additionally, we control the motion trajectory based on rigidity equations formed with the predicted kinematic quantities. In experiments, our method outperforms the state-of-the-arts by capturing physical motion patterns within challenging real-world monocular videos.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generating realistic human grasps is a crucial yet challenging task for applications involving object manipulation in computer graphics and robotics. Existing methods often struggle with generating fine-grained realistic human grasps that ensure all fingers effectively interact with objects, as they focus on encoding hand with the whole representation and then estimating both hand posture and position in a single step. In this paper, we propose a novel Decomposed Vector-Quantized Variational Autoencoder (DVQ-VAE) to address this limitation by decomposing hand into several distinct parts and encoding them separately. This part-aware decomposed architecture facilitates more precise management of the interaction between each component of hand and object, enhancing the overall reality of generated human grasps. Furthermore, we design a newly dual-stage decoding strategy, by first determining the type of grasping under skeletal physical constraints, and then identifying the location of the grasp, which can greatly improve the verisimilitude as well as adaptability of the model to unseen hand-object interaction. In experiments, our model achieved about 14.1% relative improvement in the quality index compared to the state-of-the-art methods in four widely-adopted benchmarks.

<p>Abstract: Automatic classification of active tuberculosis from chest X-ray images has the potential to save lives, especially in low- and mid-income countries where skilled human experts can be scarce. Given the lack of available labeled data to train such systems and the unbalanced nature of publicly available datasets, we argue that the reliability of deep learning models is limited, even if they can be shown to obtain perfect classification accuracy on the test data. One way of evaluating the reliability of such systems is to ensure that models use the same regions of input images for predictions as medical experts would. In this paper, we show that pre-training a deep neural network on a large-scale proxy task, as well as using mixed objective optimization network (MOON), a technique to balance different classes during pre-training and fine-tuning, can improve the alignment of decision foundations between models and experts, as compared to a model directly trained on the target dataset. At the same time, these approaches keep perfect classification accuracy according to the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) on the test set, and improve generalization on an independent, unseen dataset. For the purpose of reproducibility, our source code is made available online.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the development of VR-related techniques, viewers can enjoy a realistic and immersive experience through a head-mounted display, while omnidirectional video with a low frame rate can lead to user dizziness. However, the prevailing plane frame interpolation methodologies are unsuitable for Omnidirectional Video Interpolation, chiefly due to the lack of models tailored to such videos with strong distortion, compounded by the scarcity of valuable datasets for Omnidirectional Video Frame Interpolation. In this paper, we introduce the benchmark dataset, 360VFI, for Omnidirectional Video Frame Interpolation. We present a practical implementation that introduces a distortion prior from omnidirectional video into the network to modulate distortions. We especially propose a pyramid distortion-sensitive feature extractor that uses the unique characteristics of equirectangular projection (ERP) format as prior information. Moreover, we devise a decoder that uses an affine transformation to facilitate the synthesis of intermediate frames further. 360VFI is the first dataset and benchmark that explores the challenge of Omnidirectional Video Frame Interpolation. Through our benchmark analysis, we presented four different distortion conditions scenes in the proposed 360VFI dataset to evaluate the challenge triggered by distortion during interpolation. Besides, experimental results demonstrate that Omnidirectional Video Interpolation can be effectively improved by modeling for omnidirectional distortion.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeen Song, Jingyao Wang, Jianqi Zhang, Changwen Zheng, Wenwen Qiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Video contrastive learning (v-CL) has gained prominence as a leading framework for unsupervised video representation learning, showcasing impressive performance across various tasks such as action classification and detection. In the field of video representation learning, a feature extractor should ideally capture both static and dynamic semantics. However, our series of experiments reveals that existing v-CL methods predominantly capture static semantics, with limited capturing of dynamic semantics. Through causal analysis, we identify the root cause: the v-CL objective lacks explicit modeling of dynamic features and the measurement of dynamic similarity is confounded by static semantics, while the measurement of static similarity is confounded by dynamic semantics. In response, we propose "Bi-level Optimization of Learning Dynamic with Decoupling and Intervention" (BOLD-DI) to capture both static and dynamic semantics in a decoupled manner. Our method can be seamlessly integrated into the existing v-CL methods and experimental results highlight the significant improvements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxuan Zhang, Qing Zhang, Yiren Song, Jiaming Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Current hair transfer methods struggle to handle diverse and intricate hairstyles, thus limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion-based hair transfer framework, named \textit{Stable-Hair}, which robustly transfers a wide range of real-world hairstyles onto user-provided faces for virtual hair try-on. To achieve this goal, our Stable-Hair framework is designed as a two-stage pipeline. In the first stage, we train a Bald Converter alongside stable diffusion to remove hair from the user-provided face images, resulting in bald images. In the second stage, we specifically designed three modules: a Hair Extractor, a Latent IdentityNet, and Hair Cross-Attention Layers to transfer the target hairstyle with highly detailed and high-fidelity to the bald image. Specifically, the Hair Extractor is trained to encode reference images with the desired hairstyles. To preserve the consistency of identity content and background between the source images and the transfer results, we employ a Latent IdentityNet to encode the source images. With the assistance of our Hair Cross-Attention Layers in the U-Net, we can accurately and precisely transfer the highly detailed and high-fidelity hairstyle to the bald image. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our approach delivers state-of-the-art (SOTA) results among existing hair transfer methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunfei Zhang, Chao Liang, Jin Gao, Zhipeng Zhang, Weiming Hu, Stephen Maybank, Xue Zhou, Liang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Joint Detection and Embedding(JDE) trackers have demonstrated excellent performance in Multi-Object Tracking(MOT) tasks by incorporating the extraction of appearance features as auxiliary tasks through embedding Re-Identification task(ReID) into the detector, achieving a balance between inference speed and tracking performance. However, solving the competition between the detector and the feature extractor has always been a challenge. Also, the issue of directly embedding the ReID task into MOT has remained unresolved. The lack of high discriminability in appearance features results in their limited utility. In this paper, we propose a new learning approach using cross-correlation to capture temporal information of objects. The feature extraction network is no longer trained solely on appearance features from each frame but learns richer motion features by utilizing feature heatmaps from consecutive frames, addressing the challenge of inter-class feature similarity. Furthermore, we apply our learning approach to a more lightweight feature extraction network, and treat the feature matching scores as strong cues rather than auxiliary cues, employing a appropriate weight calculation to reflect the compatibility between our obtained features and the MOT task. Our tracker, named TCBTrack, achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple public benchmarks, i.e., MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack datasets. Specifically, on the DanceTrack test set, we achieve 56.8 HOTA, 58.1 IDF1 and 92.5 MOTA, making it the best online tracker that can achieve real-time performance. Comparative evaluations with other trackers prove that our tracker achieves the best balance between speed, robustness and accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Linghu, Tiago des Freitas Pereira, Christophe Ecabert, S\'ebastien Marcel, Manuel G\"unther</p>
<p>Abstract: Fair biometric algorithms have similar verification performance across different demographic groups given a single decision threshold. Unfortunately, for state-of-the-art face recognition networks, score distributions differ between demographics. Contrary to work that tries to align those distributions by extra training or fine-tuning, we solely focus on score post-processing methods. As proved, well-known sample-centered score normalization techniques, Z-norm and T-norm, do not improve fairness for high-security operating points. Thus, we extend the standard Z/T-norm to integrate demographic information in normalization. Additionally, we investigate several possibilities to incorporate cohort similarities for both genuine and impostor pairs per demographic to improve fairness across different operating points. We run experiments on two datasets with different demographics (gender and ethnicity) and show that our techniques generally improve the overall fairness of five state-of-the-art pre-trained face recognition networks, without downgrading verification performance. We also indicate that an equal contribution of False Match Rate (FMR) and False Non-Match Rate (FNMR) in fairness evaluation is required for the highest gains. Code and protocols are available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sandipan Sarma, Gundameedi Sai Ram Mohan, Hariansh Sehgal, Arijit Sur</p>
<p>Abstract: Hand gesture recognition allows humans to interact with machines non-verbally, which has a huge application in underwater exploration using autonomous underwater vehicles. Recently, a new gesture-based language called CADDIAN has been devised for divers, and supervised learning methods have been applied to recognize the gestures with high accuracy. However, such methods fail when they encounter unseen gestures in real time. In this work, we advocate the need for zero-shot underwater gesture recognition (ZSUGR), where the objective is to train a model with visual samples of gestures from a few ``seen'' classes only and transfer the gained knowledge at test time to recognize semantically-similar unseen gesture classes as well. After discussing the problem and dataset-specific challenges, we propose new seen-unseen splits for gesture classes in CADDY dataset. Then, we present a two-stage framework, where a novel transformer learns strong visual gesture cues and feeds them to a conditional generative adversarial network that learns to mimic feature distribution. We use the trained generator as a feature synthesizer for unseen classes, enabling zero-shot learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the existing zero-shot techniques. We conclude by providing useful insights into our framework and suggesting directions for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Florian Chabot, Nicolas Granger, Guillaume Lapouge</p>
<p>Abstract: The Bird's-eye View (BeV) representation is widely used for 3D perception from multi-view camera images. It allows to merge features from different cameras into a common space, providing a unified representation of the 3D scene. The key component is the view transformer, which transforms image views into the BeV. However, actual view transformer methods based on geometry or cross-attention do not provide a sufficiently detailed representation of the scene, as they use a sub-sampling of the 3D space that is non-optimal for modeling the fine structures of the environment. In this paper, we propose GaussianBeV, a novel method for transforming image features to BeV by finely representing the scene using a set of 3D gaussians located and oriented in 3D space. This representation is then splattered to produce the BeV feature map by adapting recent advances in 3D representation rendering based on gaussian splatting. GaussianBeV is the first approach to use this 3D gaussian modeling and 3D scene rendering process online, i.e. without optimizing it on a specific scene and directly integrated into a single stage model for BeV scene understanding. Experiments show that the proposed representation is highly effective and place GaussianBeV as the new state-of-the-art on the BeV semantic segmentation task on the nuScenes dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract: Domain adaptive panoptic segmentation promises to resolve the long tail of corner cases in natural scene understanding. Previous state of the art addresses this problem with cross-task consistency, careful system-level optimization and heuristic improvement of teacher predictions. In contrast, we propose to build upon remarkable capability of mask transformers to estimate their own prediction uncertainty. Our method avoids noise amplification by leveraging fine-grained confidence of panoptic teacher predictions. In particular, we modulate the loss with mask-wide confidence and discourage back-propagation in pixels with uncertain teacher or confident student. Experimental evaluation on standard benchmarks reveals a substantial contribution of the proposed selection techniques. We report 47.4 PQ on Synthia to Cityscapes, which corresponds to an improvement of 6.2 percentage points over the state of the art.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinda Lu, Shuo Wang, Yanbin Hao, Haifeng Liu, Xiang Wang, Meng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent adaptations can boost the low-shot capability of Contrastive Vision-Language Pre-training (CLIP) by effectively facilitating knowledge transfer. However, these adaptation methods are usually operated on the global view of an input image, and thus biased perception of partial local details of the image. To solve this problem, we propose a Visual Content Refinement (VCR) before the adaptation calculation during the test stage. Specifically, we first decompose the test image into different scales to shift the feature extractor's attention to the details of the image. Then, we select the image view with the max prediction margin in each scale to filter out the noisy image views, where the prediction margins are calculated from the pre-trained CLIP model. Finally, we merge the content of the aforementioned selected image views based on their scales to construct a new robust representation. Thus, the merged content can be directly used to help the adapter focus on both global and local parts without any extra training parameters. We apply our method to 3 popular low-shot benchmark tasks with 13 datasets and achieve a significant improvement over state-of-the-art methods. For example, compared to the baseline (Tip-Adapter) on the few-shot classification task, our method achieves about 2\% average improvement for both training-free and training-need settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: The use of deep learning methods for precision farming is gaining increasing interest. However, collecting training data in this application field is particularly challenging and costly due to the need of acquiring information during the different growing stages of the cultivation of interest. In this paper, we present a method for data augmentation that uses two GANs to create artificial images to augment the training data. To obtain a higher image quality, instead of re-creating the entire scene, we take original images and replace only the patches containing objects of interest with artificial ones containing new objects with different shapes and styles. In doing this, we take into account both the foreground (i.e., crop samples) and the background (i.e., the soil) of the patches. Quantitative experiments, conducted on publicly available datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The source code and data discussed in this work are available as open source.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ran Chen, Zeren Zhang, Jinwen Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Seismic fault detection holds significant geographical and practical application value, aiding experts in subsurface structure interpretation and resource exploration. Despite some progress made by automated methods based on deep learning, research in the seismic domain faces significant challenges, particularly because it is difficult to obtain high-quality, large-scale, open-source, and diverse datasets, which hinders the development of general foundation models. Therefore, this paper proposes Seismic Fault SAM, which, for the first time, applies the general pre-training foundation model-Segment Anything Model (SAM)-to seismic fault interpretation. This method aligns the universal knowledge learned from a vast amount of images with the seismic domain tasks through an Adapter design. Specifically, our innovative points include designing lightweight Adapter modules, freezing most of the pre-training weights, and only updating a small number of parameters to allow the model to converge quickly and effectively learn fault features; combining 2.5D input strategy to capture 3D spatial patterns with 2D models; integrating geological constraints into the model through prior-based data augmentation techniques to enhance the model's generalization capability. Experimental results on the largest publicly available seismic dataset, Thebe, show that our method surpasses existing 3D models on both OIS and ODS metrics, achieving state-of-the-art performance and providing an effective extension scheme for other seismic domain downstream tasks that lack labeled data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinfeng Liu, Lingtong Kong, Bo Li, Zerong Wang, Hong Gu, Jinwei Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised monocular depth estimation has gathered notable interest since it can liberate training from dependency on depth annotations. In monocular video training case, recent methods only conduct view synthesis between existing camera views, leading to insufficient guidance. To tackle this, we try to synthesize more virtual camera views by flow-based video frame interpolation (VFI), termed as temporal augmentation. For multi-frame inference, to sidestep the problem of dynamic objects encountered by explicit geometry-based methods like ManyDepth, we return to the feature fusion paradigm and design a VFI-assisted multi-frame fusion module to align and aggregate multi-frame features, using motion and occlusion information obtained by the flow-based VFI model. Finally, we construct a unified self-supervised learning framework, named Mono-ViFI, to bilaterally connect single- and multi-frame depth. In this framework, spatial data augmentation through image affine transformation is incorporated for data diversity, along with a triplet depth consistency loss for regularization. The single- and multi-frame models can share weights, making our framework compact and memory-efficient. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can bring significant improvements to current advanced architectures. Source code is available at https://github.com/LiuJF1226/Mono-ViFI.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study addresses the nuanced challenge of estimating head translations within the context of six-degrees-of-freedom (6DoF) head pose estimation, placing emphasis on this aspect over the more commonly studied head rotations. Identifying a gap in existing methodologies, we recognized the underutilized potential synergy between facial geometry and head translation. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel approach called the head Translation, Rotation, and face Geometry network (TRG), which stands out for its explicit bidirectional interaction structure. This structure has been carefully designed to leverage the complementary relationship between face geometry and head translation, marking a significant advancement in the field of head pose estimation. Our contributions also include the development of a strategy for estimating bounding box correction parameters and a technique for aligning landmarks to image. Both of these innovations demonstrate superior performance in 6DoF head pose estimation tasks. Extensive experiments conducted on ARKitFace and BIWI datasets confirm that the proposed method outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques.

<p>Abstract: Recently, with the rapid advancements of generative models, the field of visual text generation has witnessed significant progress. However, it is still challenging to render high-quality text images in real-world scenarios, as three critical criteria should be satisfied: (1) Fidelity: the generated text images should be photo-realistic and the contents are expected to be the same as specified in the given conditions; (2) Reasonability: the regions and contents of the generated text should cohere with the scene; (3) Utility: the generated text images can facilitate related tasks (e.g., text detection and recognition). Upon investigation, we find that existing methods, either rendering-based or diffusion-based, can hardly meet all these aspects simultaneously, limiting their application range. Therefore, we propose in this paper a visual text generator (termed SceneVTG), which can produce high-quality text images in the wild. Following a two-stage paradigm, SceneVTG leverages a Multimodal Large Language Model to recommend reasonable text regions and contents across multiple scales and levels, which are used by a conditional diffusion model as conditions to generate text images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed SceneVTG significantly outperforms traditional rendering-based methods and recent diffusion-based methods in terms of fidelity and reasonability. Besides, the generated images provide superior utility for tasks involving text detection and text recognition. Code and datasets are available at AdvancedLiterateMachinery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengyuan Xie, Haiquan Lu, Jia-wen Xiao, Enguang Wang, Le Zhang, Xialei Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Class incremental semantic segmentation aims to preserve old knowledge while learning new tasks, however, it is impeded by catastrophic forgetting and background shift issues. Prior works indicate the pivotal importance of initializing new classifiers and mainly focus on transferring knowledge from the background classifier or preparing classifiers for future classes, neglecting the flexibility and variance of new classifiers. In this paper, we propose a new classifier pre-tuning~(NeST) method applied before the formal training process, learning a transformation from old classifiers to generate new classifiers for initialization rather than directly tuning the parameters of new classifiers. Our method can make new classifiers align with the backbone and adapt to the new data, preventing drastic changes in the feature extractor when learning new classes. Besides, we design a strategy considering the cross-task class similarity to initialize matrices used in the transformation, helping achieve the stability-plasticity trade-off. Experiments on Pascal VOC 2012 and ADE20K datasets show that the proposed strategy can significantly improve the performance of previous methods.

<p>Abstract: Class-incremental learning is a challenging problem, where the goal is to train a model that can classify data from an increasing number of classes over time. With the advancement of vision-language pre-trained models such as CLIP, they demonstrate good generalization ability that allows them to excel in class-incremental learning with completely frozen parameters. However, further adaptation to downstream tasks by simply fine-tuning the model leads to severe forgetting. Most existing works with pre-trained models assume that the forgetting of old classes is uniform when the model acquires new knowledge. In this paper, we propose a method named Adaptive Representation Adjustment and Parameter Fusion (RAPF). During training for new data, we measure the influence of new classes on old ones and adjust the representations, using textual features. After training, we employ a decomposed parameter fusion to further mitigate forgetting during adapter module fine-tuning. Experiments on several conventional benchmarks show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/linlany/RAPF}.</p>

Forbes first applies multiple obfuscating transformations with random parameters to an image to remove the identity information distinguishable by humans.

Finally, it renders an obfuscated image by applying the transformations with the optimized parameters.

<p>Abstract: In the field of multi-modal language models, the majority of methods are built on an architecture similar to LLaVA. These models use a single-layer ViT feature as a visual prompt, directly feeding it into the language models alongside textual tokens. However, when dealing with long sequences of visual signals or inputs such as videos, the self-attention mechanism of language models can lead to significant computational overhead. Additionally, using single-layer ViT features makes it challenging for large language models to perceive visual signals fully. This paper proposes an efficient multi-modal language model to minimize computational costs while enabling the model to perceive visual signals as comprehensively as possible. Our method primarily includes: (1) employing cross-attention to image-text interaction similar to Flamingo. (2) utilize hierarchical ViT features. (3) introduce the Mixture of Experts (MoE) mechanism to enhance model effectiveness. Our model achieves competitive scores on public multi-modal benchmarks and performs well in tasks such as image captioning and video captioning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Predicting survival in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a challenging task. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data provide in vivo insight into brain health, but the low prevalence of the condition and resultant data scarcity limit training set sizes for prediction models. Survival models are further hindered by the subtle and often highly localised profile of ALS-related neurodegeneration. Normative models present a solution as they increase statistical power by leveraging large healthy cohorts. Separately, diffusion models excel in capturing the semantics embedded within images including subtle signs of accelerated brain ageing, which may help predict survival in ALS. Here, we combine the benefits of generative and normative modelling by introducing the normative diffusion autoencoder framework. To our knowledge, this is the first use of normative modelling within a diffusion autoencoder, as well as the first application of normative modelling to ALS. Our approach outperforms generative and non-generative normative modelling benchmarks in ALS prognostication, demonstrating enhanced predictive accuracy in the context of ALS survival prediction and normative modelling in general.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qi Yang, Kaifa Yang, Yuke Xing, Yiling Xu, Zhu Li</p>
<p>Abstract: To fill the gap of traditional GS compression method, in this paper, we first propose a simple and effective GS data compression anchor called Graph-based GS Compression (GGSC). GGSC is inspired by graph signal processing theory and uses two branches to compress the primitive center and attributes. We split the whole GS sample via KDTree and clip the high-frequency components after the graph Fourier transform. Followed by quantization, G-PCC and adaptive arithmetic coding are used to compress the primitive center and attribute residual matrix to generate the bitrate file. GGSS is the first work to explore traditional GS compression, with advantages that can reveal the GS distortion characteristics corresponding to typical compression operation, such as high-frequency clipping and quantization. Second, based on GGSC, we create a GS Quality Assessment dataset (GSQA) with 120 samples. A subjective experiment is conducted in a laboratory environment to collect subjective scores after rendering GS into Processed Video Sequences (PVS). We analyze the characteristics of different GS distortions based on Mean Opinion Scores (MOS), demonstrating the sensitivity of different attributes distortion to visual quality. The GGSC code and the dataset, including GS samples, MOS, and PVS, are made publicly available at https://github.com/Qi-Yangsjtu/GGSC.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingyang Lei, Jingfan Fan, Long Shao, Hong Song, Deqiang Xiao, Danni Ai, Tianyu Fu, Ying Gu, Jian Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: The structured light (SL)-based 3D measurement techniques with deep learning have been widely studied, among which speckle projection profilometry (SPP) and fringe projection profilometry (FPP) are two popular methods. However, they generally use a single projection pattern for reconstruction, resulting in fringe order ambiguity or poor reconstruction accuracy. To alleviate these problems, we propose a parallel dual-branch Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-Transformer network (PDCNet), to take advantage of convolutional operations and self-attention mechanisms for processing different SL modalities. Within PDCNet, a Transformer branch is used to capture global perception in the fringe images, while a CNN branch is designed to collect local details in the speckle images. To fully integrate complementary features, we design a double-stream attention aggregation module (DAAM) that consist of a parallel attention subnetwork for aggregating multi-scale spatial structure information. This module can dynamically retain local and global representations to the maximum extent. Moreover, an adaptive mixture density head with bimodal Gaussian distribution is proposed for learning a representation that is precise near discontinuities. Compared to the standard disparity regression strategy, this adaptive mixture head can effectively improves performance at object boundaries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can reduce fringe order ambiguity while producing high-accuracy results on a self-made dataset. We also show that the proposed architecture reveals the potential in infrared-visible image fusion task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Feyza Yavuz, Baris Can Cam, Adnan Harun Dogan, Kemal Oksuz, Emre Akbas, Sinan Kalkan</p>
<p>Abstract: Ranking-based loss functions, such as Average Precision Loss and Rank&Sort Loss, outperform widely used score-based losses in object detection. These loss functions better align with the evaluation criteria, have fewer hyperparameters, and offer robustness against the imbalance between positive and negative classes. However, they require pairwise comparisons among $P$ positive and $N$ negative predictions, introducing a time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(PN)$, which is prohibitive since $N$ is often large (e.g., $10^8$ in ATSS). Despite their advantages, the widespread adoption of ranking-based losses has been hindered by their high time and space complexities.
  In this paper, we focus on improving the efficiency of ranking-based loss functions. To this end, we propose Bucketed Ranking-based Losses which group negative predictions into $B$ buckets ($B \ll N$) in order to reduce the number of pairwise comparisons so that time complexity can be reduced. Our method enhances the time complexity, reducing it to $\mathcal{O}(\max (N \log(N), P^2))$. To validate our method and show its generality, we conducted experiments on 2 different tasks, 3 different datasets, 7 different detectors. We show that Bucketed Ranking-based (BR) Losses yield the same accuracy with the unbucketed versions and provide $2\times$ faster training on average. We also train, for the first time, transformer-based object detectors using ranking-based losses, thanks to the efficiency of our BR. When we train CoDETR, a state-of-the-art transformer-based object detector, using our BR Loss, we consistently outperform its original results over several different backbones.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14208">Memory-Efficient Pseudo-Labeling for Online Source-Free Universal Domain Adaptation using a Gaussian Mixture Model</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Pascal Schlachter, Simon Wagner, Bin Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: In practice, domain shifts are likely to occur between training and test data, necessitating domain adaptation (DA) to adjust the pre-trained source model to the target domain. Recently, universal domain adaptation (UniDA) has gained attention for addressing the possibility of an additional category (label) shift between the source and target domain. This means new classes can appear in the target data, some source classes may no longer be present, or both at the same time. For practical applicability, UniDA methods must handle both source-free and online scenarios, enabling adaptation without access to the source data and performing batch-wise updates in parallel with prediction. In an online setting, preserving knowledge across batches is crucial. However, existing methods often require substantial memory, e.g. by using memory queues, which is impractical because memory is limited and valuable, in particular on embedded systems. Therefore, we consider memory-efficiency as an additional constraint in this paper. To achieve memory-efficient online source-free universal domain adaptation (SF-UniDA), we propose a novel method that continuously captures the distribution of known classes in the feature space using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). This approach, combined with entropy-based out-of-distribution detection, allows for the generation of reliable pseudo-labels. Finally, we combine a contrastive loss with a KL divergence loss to perform the adaptation. Our approach not only achieves state-of-the-art results in all experiments on the DomainNet dataset but also significantly outperforms the existing methods on the challenging VisDA-C dataset, setting a new benchmark for online SF-UniDA.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Suvajit Patra, Arkadip Maitra, Megha Tiwari, K. Kumaran, Swathy Prabhu, Swami Punyeshwarananda, Soumitra Samanta</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatic Sign Language (SL) recognition is an important task in the computer vision community. To build a robust SL recognition system, we need a considerable amount of data which is lacking particularly in Indian sign language (ISL). In this paper, we propose a large-scale isolated ISL dataset and a novel SL recognition model based on skeleton graph structure. The dataset covers 2,002 daily used common words in the deaf community recorded by 20 (10 male and 10 female) deaf adult signers (contains 40033 videos). We propose a SL recognition model namely Hierarchical Windowed Graph Attention Network (HWGAT) by utilizing the human upper body skeleton graph structure. The HWGAT tries to capture distinctive motions by giving attention to different body parts induced by the human skeleton graph structure. The utility of the proposed dataset and the usefulness of our model are evaluated through extensive experiments. We pre-trained the proposed model on the proposed dataset and fine-tuned it across different sign language datasets further boosting the performance of 1.10, 0.46, 0.78, and 6.84 percentage points on INCLUDE, LSA64, AUTSL and WLASL respectively compared to the existing state-of-the-art skeleton-based models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junsheng Zhou, Baorui Ma, Yu-Shen Liu, Zhizhong Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning signed distance functions (SDFs) from point clouds is an important task in 3D computer vision. However, without ground truth signed distances, point normals or clean point clouds, current methods still struggle from learning SDFs from noisy point clouds. To overcome this challenge, we propose to learn SDFs via a noise to noise mapping, which does not require any clean point cloud or ground truth supervision. Our novelty lies in the noise to noise mapping which can infer a highly accurate SDF of a single object or scene from its multiple or even single noisy observations. We achieve this by a novel loss which enables statistical reasoning on point clouds and maintains geometric consistency although point clouds are irregular, unordered and have no point correspondence among noisy observations. To accelerate training, we use multi-resolution hash encodings implemented in CUDA in our framework, which reduces our training time by a factor of ten, achieving convergence within one minute. We further introduce a novel schema to improve multi-view reconstruction by estimating SDFs as a prior. Our evaluations under widely-used benchmarks demonstrate our superiority over the state-of-the-art methods in surface reconstruction from point clouds or multi-view images, point cloud denoising and upsampling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyuan Yang, Bo Zhang, Yufei Shi, Ningze Zhong, Johnathan Loh, Huihui Fang, Yanwu Xu, Si Yong Yeo</p>
<p>Abstract: Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of vision impairment. Digital imaging techniques, such as color fundus photography (CFP) and optical coherence tomography (OCT), provide quantitative and noninvasive methods for glaucoma diagnosis. Recently, in the field of computer-aided glaucoma diagnosis, multi-modality methods that integrate the CFP and OCT modalities have achieved greater diagnostic accuracy compared to single-modality methods. However, it remains challenging to extract reliable features due to the high similarity of medical images and the unbalanced multi-modal data distribution. Moreover, existing methods overlook the uncertainty estimation of different modalities, leading to unreliable predictions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, namely ETSCL, which consists of a contrastive feature extraction stage and a decision-level fusion stage. Specifically, the supervised contrastive loss is employed to enhance the discriminative power in the feature extraction process, resulting in more effective features. In addition, we utilize the Frangi vesselness algorithm as a preprocessing step to incorporate vessel information to assist in the prediction. In the decision-level fusion stage, an evidence theory-based multi-modality classifier is employed to combine multi-source information with uncertainty estimation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/master-Shix/ETSCL}.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14242">Continual Panoptic Perception: Towards Multi-modal Incremental Interpretation of Remote Sensing Images</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Bo Yuan, Danpei Zhao, Zhuoran Liu, Wentao Li, Tian Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual learning (CL) breaks off the one-way training manner and enables a model to adapt to new data, semantics and tasks continuously. However, current CL methods mainly focus on single tasks. Besides, CL models are plagued by catastrophic forgetting and semantic drift since the lack of old data, which often occurs in remote-sensing interpretation due to the intricate fine-grained semantics. In this paper, we propose Continual Panoptic Perception (CPP), a unified continual learning model that leverages multi-task joint learning covering pixel-level classification, instance-level segmentation and image-level perception for universal interpretation in remote sensing images. Concretely, we propose a collaborative cross-modal encoder (CCE) to extract the input image features, which supports pixel classification and caption generation synchronously. To inherit the knowledge from the old model without exemplar memory, we propose a task-interactive knowledge distillation (TKD) method, which leverages cross-modal optimization and task-asymmetric pseudo-labeling (TPL) to alleviate catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, we also propose a joint optimization mechanism to achieve end-to-end multi-modal panoptic perception. Experimental results on the fine-grained panoptic perception dataset validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, and also prove that joint optimization can boost sub-task CL efficiency with over 13\% relative improvement on panoptic quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dai Liu, Jindong Gu, Hu Cao, Carsten Trinitis, Martin Schulz</p>
<p>Abstract: Dataset Distillation is used to create a concise, yet informative, synthetic dataset that can replace the original dataset for training purposes. Some leading methods in this domain prioritize long-range matching, involving the unrolling of training trajectories with a fixed number of steps (NS) on the synthetic dataset to align with various expert training trajectories. However, traditional long-range matching methods possess an overfitting-like problem, the fixed step size NS forces synthetic dataset to distortedly conform seen expert training trajectories, resulting in a loss of generality-especially to those from unencountered architecture. We refer to this as the Accumulated Mismatching Problem (AMP), and propose a new approach, Automatic Training Trajectories (ATT), which dynamically and adaptively adjusts trajectory length NS to address the AMP. Our method outperforms existing methods particularly in tests involving cross-architectures. Moreover, owing to its adaptive nature, it exhibits enhanced stability in the face of parameter variations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Martin Menabue, Emanuele Frascaroli, Matteo Boschini, Lorenzo Bonicelli, Angelo Porrello, Simone Calderara</p>
<p>Abstract: The field of Continual Learning (CL) has inspired numerous researchers over the years, leading to increasingly advanced countermeasures to the issue of catastrophic forgetting. Most studies have focused on the single-class scenario, where each example comes with a single label. The recent literature has successfully tackled such a setting, with impressive results. Differently, we shift our attention to the multi-label scenario, as we feel it to be more representative of real-world open problems. In our work, we show that existing state-of-the-art CL methods fail to achieve satisfactory performance, thus questioning the real advance claimed in recent years. Therefore, we assess both old-style and novel strategies and propose, on top of them, an approach called Selective Class Attention Distillation (SCAD). It relies on a knowledge transfer technique that seeks to align the representations of the student network -- which trains continuously and is subject to forgetting -- with the teacher ones, which is pretrained and kept frozen. Importantly, our method is able to selectively transfer the relevant information from the teacher to the student, thereby preventing irrelevant information from harming the student's performance during online training. To demonstrate the merits of our approach, we conduct experiments on two different multi-label datasets, showing that our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art Continual Learning methods. Our findings highlight the importance of addressing the unique challenges posed by multi-label environments in the field of Continual Learning.

<p>Abstract: We present a novel approach for recovering 3D shape and view dependent appearance from a few colored images, enabling efficient 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Our method learns an implicit neural representation in the form of a Signed Distance Function (SDF) and a radiance field. The model is trained progressively through ray marching enabled volumetric rendering, and regularized with learning-free multi-view stereo (MVS) cues. Key to our contribution is a novel implicit neural shape function learning strategy that encourages our SDF field to be as linear as possible near the level-set, hence robustifying the training against noise emanating from the supervision and regularization signals. Without using any pretrained priors, our method, called SparseCraft, achieves state-of-the-art performances both in novel-view synthesis and reconstruction from sparse views in standard benchmarks, while requiring less than 10 minutes for training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lisa Anita De Santi, J\"org Schl\"otterer, Meike Nauta, Vincenzo Positano, Christin Seifert</p>
<p>Abstract: Volumetric neuroimaging examinations like structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (sMRI) are routinely applied to support the clinical diagnosis of dementia like Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Neuroradiologists examine 3D sMRI to detect and monitor abnormalities in brain morphology due to AD, like global and/or local brain atrophy and shape alteration of characteristic structures. There is a strong research interest in developing diagnostic systems based on Deep Learning (DL) models to analyse sMRI for AD. However, anatomical information extracted from an sMRI examination needs to be interpreted together with patient's age to distinguish AD patterns from the regular alteration due to a normal ageing process. In this context, part-prototype neural networks integrate the computational advantages of DL in an interpretable-by-design architecture and showed promising results in medical imaging applications. We present PIMPNet, the first interpretable multimodal model for 3D images and demographics applied to the binary classification of AD from 3D sMRI and patient's age. Despite age prototypes do not improve predictive performance compared to the single modality model, this lays the foundation for future work in the direction of the model's design and multimodal prototype training process</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel, scalable approach for constructing open set, instance-level 3D scene representations, advancing open world understanding of 3D environments. Existing methods require pre-constructed 3D scenes and face scalability issues due to per-point feature vector learning, limiting their efficacy with complex queries. Our method overcomes these limitations by incrementally building instance-level 3D scene representations using 2D foundation models, efficiently aggregating instance-level details such as masks, feature vectors, names, and captions. We introduce fusion schemes for feature vectors to enhance their contextual knowledge and performance on complex queries. Additionally, we explore large language models for robust automatic annotation and spatial reasoning tasks. We evaluate our proposed approach on multiple scenes from ScanNet and Replica datasets demonstrating zero-shot generalization capabilities, exceeding current state-of-the-art methods in open world 3D scene understanding.</p>

<p>Abstract: For the last decade, there has been a push to use multi-dimensional (latent) spaces to represent concepts; and yet how to manipulate these concepts or reason with them remains largely unclear. Some recent methods exploit multiple latent representations and their connection, making this research question even more entangled. Our goal is to understand how operations in the latent space affect the underlying concepts. To that end, we explore the task of concept blending through diffusion models. Diffusion models are based on a connection between a latent representation of textual prompts and a latent space that enables image reconstruction and generation. This task allows us to try different text-based combination strategies, and evaluate easily through a visual analysis. Our conclusion is that concept blending through space manipulation is possible, although the best strategy depends on the context of the blend.</p>

<p>Abstract: Image deraining aims to improve the visibility of images damaged by rainy conditions, targeting the removal of degradation elements such as rain streaks, raindrops, and rain accumulation. While numerous single image deraining methods have shown promising results in image enhancement within the spatial domain, real-world rain degradation often causes uneven damage across an image's entire frequency spectrum, posing challenges for these methods in enhancing different frequency components. In this paper, we introduce a novel end-to-end Adaptive Frequency Enhancement Network (AFENet) specifically for single image deraining that adaptively enhances images across various frequencies. We employ convolutions of different scales to adaptively decompose image frequency bands, introduce a feature enhancement module to boost the features of different frequency components and present a novel interaction module for interchanging and merging information from various frequency branches. Simultaneously, we propose a feature aggregation module that efficiently and adaptively fuses features from different frequency bands, facilitating enhancements across the entire frequency spectrum. This approach empowers the deraining network to eliminate diverse and complex rainy patterns and to reconstruct image details accurately. Extensive experiments on both real and synthetic scenes demonstrate that our method not only achieves visually appealing enhancement results but also surpasses existing methods in performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL) is a promising task, aiming to adapt the large-scale pre-trained model to downstream tasks with a relatively modest cost. However, current PETL methods struggle in compressing computational complexity and bear a heavy inference burden due to the complete forward process. This paper presents an efficient visual recognition paradigm, called Dynamic Adapter (Dyn-Adapter), that boosts PETL efficiency by subtly disentangling features in multiple levels. Our approach is simple: first, we devise a dynamic architecture with balanced early heads for multi-level feature extraction, along with adaptive training strategy. Second, we introduce a bidirectional sparsity strategy driven by the pursuit of powerful generalization ability. These qualities enable us to fine-tune efficiently and effectively: we reduce FLOPs during inference by 50%, while maintaining or even yielding higher recognition accuracy. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets and pretrained backbones demonstrate the potential of Dyn-Adapter serving as a general efficiency booster for PETL in vision recognition tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kun Zhao, Jakub Prokop, Javier Montalt Tordera, Sadegh Mohammadi</p>
<p>Abstract: Mammography is crucial for breast cancer surveillance and early diagnosis. However, analyzing mammography images is a demanding task for radiologists, who often review hundreds of mammograms daily, leading to overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems have been developed to assist in this process, but their capabilities, particularly in lesion segmentation, remained limited. With the contemporary advances in deep learning their performance may be improved. Recently, vision-language diffusion models emerged, demonstrating outstanding performance in image generation and transferability to various downstream tasks. We aim to harness their capabilities for breast lesion segmentation in a panoptic setting, which encompasses both semantic and instance-level predictions. Specifically, we propose leveraging pretrained features from a Stable Diffusion model as inputs to a state-of-the-art panoptic segmentation architecture, resulting in accurate delineation of individual breast lesions. To bridge the gap between natural and medical imaging domains, we incorporated a mammography-specific MAM-E diffusion model and BiomedCLIP image and text encoders into this framework. We evaluated our approach on two recently published mammography datasets, CDD-CESM and VinDr-Mammo. For the instance segmentation task, we noted 40.25 AP0.1 and 46.82 AP0.05, as well as 25.44 PQ0.1 and 26.92 PQ0.05. For the semantic segmentation task, we achieved Dice scores of 38.86 and 40.92, respectively.</p>

While most PETL approaches update the added parameters and freeze pre-trained weights during training, the minimal impact of task-specific deep layers on cross-domain data poses a challenge as PETL cannot modify them, resulting in redundant model structures. Structural pruning effectively reduces model redundancy; however, common pruning methods often lead to an excessive increase in stored parameters due to varying pruning structures based on pruning rates and data. Recognizing the storage parameter volume issue, we propose a Straightforward layer-wise pruning method, called SLS, for pruning PETL-transferred models. By evaluating parameters from a feature perspective of each layer and utilizing clustering metrics to assess current parameters based on clustering phenomena in low-dimensional space obtained through t-SNE, SLS facilitates informed pruning decisions. Our study reveals that layer-wise pruning, with a focus on storing pruning indices, addresses storage volume concerns. Notably, mainstream Layer-wise pruning methods may not be suitable for assessing layer importance in PETL-transferred models, where the majority of parameters are pre-trained and have limited relevance to downstream datasets. Comparative analysis against state-of-the-art PETL methods demonstrates that the pruned model achieved a notable balance between model throughput and accuracy. Moreover, SLS effectively reduces storage overhead arising from varying pruned structures while enhancing the accuracy and speed of pruned models compared to conventional pruning methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jakub Gwizda{\l}a, Doruk Oner, Soumava Kumar Roy, Mian Akbar Shah, Ad Eberhard, Ivan Egorov, Philipp Kr\"usi, Grigory Yakushev</p>
<p>Abstract: Power lines are dangerous for low-flying aircrafts, especially in low-visibility conditions. Thus, a vision-based system able to analyze the aircraft's surroundings and to provide the pilots with a "second pair of eyes" can contribute to enhancing their safety. To this end, we have developed a deep learning approach to jointly detect power line cables and pylons from images captured at distances of several hundred meters by aircraft-mounted cameras. In doing so, we have combined a modern convolutional architecture with transfer learning and a loss function adapted to curvilinear structure delineation. We use a single network for both detection tasks and demonstrated its performance on two benchmarking datasets. We have integrated it within an onboard system and run it in flight, and have demonstrated with our experiments that it outperforms the prior distant cable detection method on both datasets, while also successfully detecting pylons, given their annotations are available for the data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stephen M. Pizer, Zhiyuan Liu, Junjie Zhao, Nicholas Tapp-Hughes, James Damon, Miaomiao Zhang, JS Marron, Jared Vicory</p>
<p>Abstract: We describe a representation targeted for anatomic objects which is designed to enable strong locational correspondence within object populations and thus to provide powerful object statistics. The method generates fitted frames on the boundary and in the interior of objects and produces alignment-free geometric features from them. It accomplishes this by understanding an object as the diffeomorphic deformation of an ellipsoid and using a skeletal representation fitted throughout the deformation to produce a model of the target object, where the object is provided initially in the form of a boundary mesh. Via classification performance on hippocampi shape between individuals with a disorder vs. others, we compare our method to two state-of-the-art methods for producing object representations that are intended to capture geometric correspondence across a population of objects and to yield geometric features useful for statistics, and we show improved classification performance by this new representation, which we call the evolutionary s-rep. The geometric features that are derived from each of the representations, especially via fitted frames, is discussed.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Decheng Liu, Zongqi Wang, Chunlei Peng, Nannan Wang, Ruimin Hu, Xinbo Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to the successful development of deep image generation technology, forgery detection plays a more important role in social and economic security. Racial bias has not been explored thoroughly in the deep forgery detection field. In the paper, we first contribute a dedicated dataset called the Fair Forgery Detection (FairFD) dataset, where we prove the racial bias of public state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Different from existing forgery detection datasets, the self-construct FairFD dataset contains a balanced racial ratio and diverse forgery generation images with the largest-scale subjects. Additionally, we identify the problems with naive fairness metrics when benchmarking forgery detection models. To comprehensively evaluate fairness, we design novel metrics including Approach Averaged Metric and Utility Regularized Metric, which can avoid deceptive results. Extensive experiments conducted with nine representative forgery detection models demonstrate the value of the proposed dataset and the reasonability of the designed fairness metrics. We also conduct more in-depth analyses to offer more insights to inspire researchers in the community.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tang Li, Mengmeng Ma, Xi Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: Large pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have become ubiquitous foundational components of other models and downstream tasks. Although powerful, our empirical results reveal that such models might not be able to identify fine-grained concepts. Specifically, the explanations of VLMs with respect to fine-grained concepts are entangled and mislocalized. To address this issue, we propose to DisEntAngle and Localize (DEAL) the concept-level explanations for VLMs without human annotations. The key idea is encouraging the concept-level explanations to be distinct while maintaining consistency with category-level explanations. We conduct extensive experiments and ablation studies on a wide range of benchmark datasets and vision-language models. Our empirical results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the concept-level explanations of the model in terms of disentanglability and localizability. Surprisingly, the improved explainability alleviates the model's reliance on spurious correlations, which further benefits the prediction accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linh Trinh, Ali Anwar, Siegfried Mercelis</p>
<p>Abstract: Maintaining roads is crucial to economic growth and citizen well-being because roads are a vital means of transportation. In various countries, the inspection of road surfaces is still done manually, however, to automate it, research interest is now focused on detecting the road surface defects via the visual data. While, previous research has been focused on deep learning methods which tend to process the entire image and leads to heavy computational cost. In this study, we focus our attention on improving the classification performance while keeping the computational cost of our solution low. Instead of processing the whole image, we introduce a segmentation model to only focus the downstream classification model to the road surface in the image. Furthermore, we employ contrastive learning during model training to improve the road surface condition classification. Our experiments on the public RTK dataset demonstrate a significant improvement in our proposed method when compared to previous works.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zezeng Li, Weimin Wang, WenHai Li, Na Lei, Xianfeng Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent CLIP-guided 3D generation methods have achieved promising results but struggle with generating faithful 3D shapes that conform with input text due to the gap between text and image embeddings. To this end, this paper proposes HOTS3D which makes the first attempt to effectively bridge this gap by aligning text features to the image features with spherical optimal transport (SOT). However, in high-dimensional situations, solving the SOT remains a challenge. To obtain the SOT map for high-dimensional features obtained from CLIP encoding of two modalities, we mathematically formulate and derive the solution based on Villani's theorem, which can directly align two hyper-sphere distributions without manifold exponential maps. Furthermore, we implement it by leveraging input convex neural networks (ICNNs) for the optimal Kantorovich potential. With the optimally mapped features, a diffusion-based generator and a Nerf-based decoder are subsequently utilized to transform them into 3D shapes. Extensive qualitative and qualitative comparisons with state-of-the-arts demonstrate the superiority of the proposed HOTS3D for 3D shape generation, especially on the consistency with text semantics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyun-Jic Oh, Won-Ki Jeong</p>
<p>Abstract: In the field of computational pathology, deep learning algorithms have made significant progress in tasks such as nuclei segmentation and classification. However, the potential of these advanced methods is limited by the lack of available labeled data. Although image synthesis via recent generative models has been actively explored to address this challenge, existing works have barely addressed label augmentation and are mostly limited to single-class and unconditional label generation. In this paper, we introduce a novel two-stage framework for multi-class nuclei data augmentation using text-conditional diffusion models. In the first stage, we innovate nuclei label synthesis by generating multi-class semantic labels and corresponding instance maps through a joint diffusion model conditioned by text prompts that specify the label structure information. In the second stage, we utilize a semantic and text-conditional latent diffusion model to efficiently generate high-quality pathology images that align with the generated nuclei label images. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on large and diverse pathology nuclei datasets, with evaluations including qualitative and quantitative analyses, as well as assessments of downstream tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seonghui Min, Hyun-Jic Oh, Won-Ki Jeong</p>
<p>Abstract: In multi-class histopathology nuclei analysis tasks, the lack of training data becomes a main bottleneck for the performance of learning-based methods. To tackle this challenge, previous methods have utilized generative models to increase data by generating synthetic samples. However, existing methods often overlook the importance of considering the context of biological tissues (e.g., shape, spatial layout, and tissue type) in the synthetic data. Moreover, while generative models have shown superior performance in synthesizing realistic histopathology images, none of the existing methods are capable of producing image-label pairs at the same time. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for co-synthesizing histopathology nuclei images and paired semantic labels using a context-conditioned joint diffusion model. We propose conditioning of a diffusion model using nucleus centroid layouts with structure-related text prompts to incorporate spatial and structural context information into the generation targets. Moreover, we enhance the granularity of our synthesized semantic labels by generating instance-wise nuclei labels using distance maps synthesized concurrently in conjunction with the images and semantic labels. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in generating high-quality samples on multi-institutional, multi-organ, and multi-modality datasets. Our synthetic data consistently outperforms existing augmentation methods in the downstream tasks of nuclei segmentation and classification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Renshan Zhang, Yibo Lyu, Rui Shao, Gongwei Chen, Weili Guan, Liqiang Nie</p>
<p>Abstract: Cropping high-resolution document images into multiple sub-images is the most widely used approach for current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to do document understanding. Most of current document understanding methods preserve all tokens within sub-images and treat them equally. This neglects their different informativeness and leads to a significant increase in the number of image tokens. To perform a more adaptive and efficient document understanding, we propose Token-level Correlation-guided Compression, a parameter-free and plug-and-play methodology to optimize token processing. Firstly, we propose an innovative approach for assessing the pattern repetitiveness based on the correlation between each patch tokens. This method identifies redundant tokens, allowing for the determination of the sub-image's information density. Secondly, we present a token-level sampling method that efficiently captures the most informative tokens by delving into the correlation between the [CLS] token and patch tokens. By integrating these strategies, we develop a plug-and-play adaptive compressor module that can be seamlessly incorporated into MLLMs utilizing cropping techniques. This module not only enhances the processing speed during training and inference but also maintains comparable performance. We conduct experiments with the SOTA document understanding model mPLUG-DocOwl1.5 and the effectiveness is demonstrated through extensive comparisons with other compression methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Majedaldein Almahasneh, Xianghua Xie, Adeline Paiement</p>
<p>Abstract: Motivated by the increasing popularity of attention mechanisms, we observe that popular convolutional (conv.) attention models like Squeeze-and-Excite (SE) and Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) rely on expensive multi-layer perception (MLP) layers. These MLP layers significantly increase computational complexity, making such models less applicable to 3D image contexts, where data dimensionality and computational costs are higher. In 3D medical imaging, such as 3D pulmonary CT scans, efficient processing is crucial due to the large data volume. Traditional 2D attention generalized to 3D increases the computational load, creating demand for more efficient attention mechanisms for 3D tasks. We investigate the possibility of incorporating fully convolutional (conv.) attention in 3D context. We present two 3D fully conv. attention blocks, demonstrating their effectiveness in 3D context. Using pulmonary CT scans for 3D lung nodule detection, we present AttentNet, an automated lung nodule detection framework from CT images, performing detection as an ensemble of two stages, candidate proposal and false positive (FP) reduction. We compare the proposed 3D attention blocks to popular 2D conv. attention methods generalized to 3D modules and to self-attention units. For the FP reduction stage, we also use a joint analysis approach to aggregate spatial information from different contextual levels. We use LUNA-16 lung nodule detection dataset to demonstrate the benefits of the proposed fully conv. attention blocks compared to baseline popular lung nodule detection methods when no attention is used. Our work does not aim at achieving state-of-the-art results in the lung nodule detection task, rather to demonstrate the benefits of incorporating fully conv. attention within a 3D context.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Majedaldein Almahasneh, Adeline Paiement, Xianghua Xie, Jean Aboudarham</p>
<p>Abstract: Precisely localising solar Active Regions (AR) from multi-spectral images is a challenging but important task in understanding solar activity and its influence on space weather. A main challenge comes from each modality capturing a different location of the 3D objects, as opposed to typical multi-spectral imaging scenarios where all image bands observe the same scene. Thus, we refer to this special multi-spectral scenario as multi-layer. We present a multi-task deep learning framework that exploits the dependencies between image bands to produce 3D AR localisation (segmentation and detection) where different image bands (and physical locations) have their own set of results. Furthermore, to address the difficulty of producing dense AR annotations for training supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms, we adapt a training strategy based on weak labels (i.e. bounding boxes) in a recursive manner. We compare our detection and segmentation stages against baseline approaches for solar image analysis (multi-channel coronal hole detection, SPOCA for ARs) and state-of-the-art deep learning methods (Faster RCNN, U-Net). Additionally, both detection a nd segmentation stages are quantitatively validated on artificially created data of similar spatial configurations made from annotated multi-modal magnetic resonance images. Our framework achieves an average of 0.72 IoU (segmentation) and 0.90 F1 score (detection) across all modalities, comparing to the best performing baseline methods with scores of 0.53 and 0.58, respectively, on the artificial dataset, and 0.84 F1 score in the AR detection task comparing to baseline of 0.82 F1 score. Our segmentation results are qualitatively validated by an expert on real ARs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingjie Li, Haokun Lin, Liang Qiu, Xiaodan Liang, Ling Chen, Abdulmotaleb Elsaddik, Xiaojun Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to the common content of anatomy, radiology images with their corresponding reports exhibit high similarity. Such inherent data bias can predispose automatic report generation models to learn entangled and spurious representations resulting in misdiagnostic reports. To tackle these, we propose a novel \textbf{Co}unter\textbf{F}actual \textbf{E}xplanations-based framework (CoFE) for radiology report generation. Counterfactual explanations serve as a potent tool for understanding how decisions made by algorithms can be changed by asking ``what if'' scenarios. By leveraging this concept, CoFE can learn non-spurious visual representations by contrasting the representations between factual and counterfactual images. Specifically, we derive counterfactual images by swapping a patch between positive and negative samples until a predicted diagnosis shift occurs. Here, positive and negative samples are the most semantically similar but have different diagnosis labels. Additionally, CoFE employs a learnable prompt to efficiently fine-tune the pre-trained large language model, encapsulating both factual and counterfactual content to provide a more generalizable prompt representation. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate that leveraging the counterfactual explanations enables CoFE to generate semantically coherent and factually complete reports and outperform in terms of language generation and clinical efficacy metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenshu Hou, Liang Peng, Xiaopei Wu, Wenxiao Wang, Xiaofei He</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D visual grounding aims to locate the target object mentioned by free-formed natural language descriptions in 3D point cloud scenes. Most previous work requires the encoder-decoder to simultaneously align the attribute information of the target object and its relational information with the surrounding environment across modalities. This causes the queries' attention to be dispersed, potentially leading to an excessive focus on points irrelevant to the input language descriptions. To alleviate these issues, we propose PD-TPE, a visual-language model with a double-branch decoder. The two branches perform proposal feature decoding and surrounding layout awareness in parallel. Since their attention maps are not influenced by each other, the queries focus on tokens relevant to each branch's specific objective. In particular, we design a novel Text-guided Position Encoding method, which differs between the two branches. In the main branch, the priori relies on the relative positions between tokens and predicted 3D boxes, which direct the model to pay more attention to tokens near the object; in the surrounding branch, it is guided by the similarity between visual and text features, so that the queries attend to tokens that can provide effective layout information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that we surpass the state-of-the-art on two widely adopted 3D visual grounding datasets, ScanRefer and NR3D, by 1.8% and 2.2%, respectively. Codes will be made publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongyang Wu, Siyang Wang, Mehdi Kamal, Massoud Pedram</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a YOLO-based framework for layout hotspot detection, aiming to enhance the efficiency and performance of the design rule checking (DRC) process. Our approach leverages the YOLOv8 vision model to detect multiple hotspots within each layout image, even when dealing with large layout image sizes. Additionally, to enhance pattern-matching effectiveness, we introduce a novel approach to augment the layout image using information extracted through Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The core of our proposed method is an algorithm that utilizes PCA to extract valuable auxiliary information from the layout image. This extracted information is then incorporated into the layout image as an additional color channel. This augmentation significantly improves the accuracy of multi-hotspot detection while reducing the false alarm rate of the object detection algorithm. We evaluate the effectiveness of our framework using four datasets generated from layouts found in the ICCAD-2019 benchmark dataset. The results demonstrate that our framework achieves a precision (recall) of approximately 83% (86%) while maintaining a false alarm rate of less than 7.4\%. Also, the studies show that the proposed augmentation approach could improve the detection ability of never-seen-before (NSB) hotspots by about 10%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sukrut Rao, Sweta Mahajan, Moritz B\"ohle, Bernt Schiele</p>
<p>Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have recently been proposed to address the 'black-box' problem of deep neural networks, by first mapping images to a human-understandable concept space and then linearly combining concepts for classification. Such models typically require first coming up with a set of concepts relevant to the task and then aligning the representations of a feature extractor to map to these concepts. However, even with powerful foundational feature extractors like CLIP, there are no guarantees that the specified concepts are detectable. In this work, we leverage recent advances in mechanistic interpretability and propose a novel CBM approach -- called Discover-then-Name-CBM (DN-CBM) -- that inverts the typical paradigm: instead of pre-selecting concepts based on the downstream classification task, we use sparse autoencoders to first discover concepts learnt by the model, and then name them and train linear probes for classification. Our concept extraction strategy is efficient, since it is agnostic to the downstream task, and uses concepts already known to the model. We perform a comprehensive evaluation across multiple datasets and CLIP architectures and show that our method yields semantically meaningful concepts, assigns appropriate names to them that make them easy to interpret, and yields performant and interpretable CBMs. Code available at https://github.com/neuroexplicit-saar/discover-then-name.</p>

<p>Abstract: Although video perception models have made remarkable advancements in recent years, they still heavily rely on explicit text descriptions or pre-defined categories to identify target instances before executing video perception tasks. These models, however, fail to proactively comprehend and reason the user's intentions via textual input. Even though previous works attempt to investigate solutions to incorporate reasoning with image segmentation, they fail to reason with videos due to the video's complexity in object motion. To bridge the gap between image and video, in this work, we propose a new video segmentation task - video reasoning segmentation. The task is designed to output tracklets of segmentation masks given a complex input text query. What's more, to promote research in this unexplored area, we construct a reasoning video segmentation benchmark. Finally, we present ViLLa: Video reasoning segmentation with a Large Language Model, which incorporates the language generation capabilities of multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) while retaining the capabilities of detecting, segmenting, and tracking multiple instances. We use a temporal-aware context aggregation module to incorporate contextual visual cues to text embeddings and propose a video-frame decoder to build temporal correlations across segmentation tokens. Remarkably, our ViLLa demonstrates capability in handling complex reasoning and referring video segmentation. Also, our model shows impressive ability in different temporal understanding benchmarks. Both quantitative and qualitative experiments show our method effectively unlocks new video reasoning segmentation capabilities for multimodal LLMs. The code and dataset will be available at https://github.com/rkzheng99/ViLLa.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce the Multi-Motion Discrete Diffusion Models (M2D2M), a novel approach for human motion generation from textual descriptions of multiple actions, utilizing the strengths of discrete diffusion models. This approach adeptly addresses the challenge of generating multi-motion sequences, ensuring seamless transitions of motions and coherence across a series of actions. The strength of M2D2M lies in its dynamic transition probability within the discrete diffusion model, which adapts transition probabilities based on the proximity between motion tokens, encouraging mixing between different modes. Complemented by a two-phase sampling strategy that includes independent and joint denoising steps, M2D2M effectively generates long-term, smooth, and contextually coherent human motion sequences, utilizing a model trained for single-motion generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that M2D2M surpasses current state-of-the-art benchmarks for motion generation from text descriptions, showcasing its efficacy in interpreting language semantics and generating dynamic, realistic motions.</p>

We propose T2V-CompBench, the first benchmark tailored for compositional text-to-video generation. T2V-CompBench encompasses diverse aspects of compositionality, including consistent attribute binding, dynamic attribute binding, spatial relationships, motion binding, action binding, object interactions, and generative numeracy. We further carefully design evaluation metrics of MLLM-based metrics, detection-based metrics, and tracking-based metrics, which can better reflect the compositional text-to-video generation quality of seven proposed categories with 700 text prompts. The effectiveness of the proposed metrics is verified by correlation with human evaluations. We also benchmark various text-to-video generative models and conduct in-depth analysis across different models and different compositional categories. We find that compositional text-to-video generation is highly challenging for current models, and we hope that our attempt will shed light on future research in this direction.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14506">On Pre-training of Multimodal Language Models Customized for Chart Understanding</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Wan-Cyuan Fan, Yen-Chun Chen, Mengchen Liu, Lu Yuan, Leonid Sigal</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies customizing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for domain-specific tasks have yielded promising results, especially in the field of scientific chart comprehension. These studies generally utilize visual instruction tuning with specialized datasets to enhance question and answer (QA) accuracy within the chart domain. However, they often neglect the fundamental discrepancy between natural image-caption pre-training data and digital chart image-QA data, particularly in the models' capacity to extract underlying numeric values from charts. This paper tackles this oversight by exploring the training processes necessary to improve MLLMs' comprehension of charts. We present three key findings: (1) Incorporating raw data values in alignment pre-training markedly improves comprehension of chart data. (2) Replacing images with their textual representation randomly during end-to-end fine-tuning transfer the language reasoning capability to chart interpretation skills. (3) Requiring the model to first extract the underlying chart data and then answer the question in the fine-tuning can further improve the accuracy. Consequently, we introduce CHOPINLLM, an MLLM tailored for in-depth chart comprehension. CHOPINLLM effectively interprets various types of charts, including unannotated ones, while maintaining robust reasoning abilities. Furthermore, we establish a new benchmark to evaluate MLLMs' understanding of different chart types across various comprehension levels. Experimental results show that CHOPINLLM exhibits strong performance in understanding both annotated and unannotated charts across a wide range of types.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sarah Jabbour, Gregory Kondas, Ella Kazerooni, Michael Sjoding, David Fouhey, Jenna Wiens</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a permutation-based explanation method for image classifiers. Current image-model explanations like activation maps are limited to instance-based explanations in the pixel space, making it difficult to understand global model behavior. In contrast, permutation based explanations for tabular data classifiers measure feature importance by comparing model performance on data before and after permuting a feature. We propose an explanation method for image-based models that permutes interpretable concepts across dataset images. Given a dataset of images labeled with specific concepts like captions, we permute a concept across examples in the text space and then generate images via a text-conditioned diffusion model. Feature importance is then reflected by the change in model performance relative to unpermuted data. When applied to a set of concepts, the method generates a ranking of feature importance. We show this approach recovers underlying model feature importance on synthetic and real-world image classification tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Toan Nguyen, Minh Nhat Vu, Baoru Huang, An Vuong, Quan Vuong, Ngan Le, Thieu Vo, Anh Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: 6-DoF grasp detection has been a fundamental and challenging problem in robotic vision. While previous works have focused on ensuring grasp stability, they often do not consider human intention conveyed through natural language, hindering effective collaboration between robots and users in complex 3D environments. In this paper, we present a new approach for language-driven 6-DoF grasp detection in cluttered point clouds. We first introduce Grasp-Anything-6D, a large-scale dataset for the language-driven 6-DoF grasp detection task with 1M point cloud scenes and more than 200M language-associated 3D grasp poses. We further introduce a novel diffusion model that incorporates a new negative prompt guidance learning strategy. The proposed negative prompt strategy directs the detection process toward the desired object while steering away from unwanted ones given the language input. Our method enables an end-to-end framework where humans can command the robot to grasp desired objects in a cluttered scene using natural language. Intensive experimental results show the effectiveness of our method in both benchmarking experiments and real-world scenarios, surpassing other baselines. In addition, we demonstrate the practicality of our approach in real-world robotic applications. Our project is available at https://airvlab.github.io/grasp-anything.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zachary Chavis, Hyun Soo Park, Stephen J. Guy</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown great success as foundational models for downstream vision and natural language applications in a variety of domains. However, these models lack the spatial understanding necessary for robotics applications where the agent must reason about the affordances provided by the 3D world around them. We present a system which trains on spatially-localized egocentric videos in order to connect visual input and task descriptions to predict a task's spatial affordance, that is the location where a person would go to accomplish the task. We show our approach outperforms the baseline of using a VLM to map similarity of a task's description over a set of location-tagged images. Our learning-based approach has less error both on predicting where a task may take place and on predicting what tasks are likely to happen at the current location. The resulting system enables robots to use egocentric sensing to navigate to physical locations of novel tasks specified in natural language.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zongyuan Yang, Baolin Liu, Yingde Song, Yongping Xiong, Lan Yi, Zhaohe Zhang, Xunbo Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Autostereoscopic display, despite decades of development, has not achieved extensive application, primarily due to the daunting challenge of 3D content creation for non-specialists. The emergence of Radiance Field as an innovative 3D representation has markedly revolutionized the domains of 3D reconstruction and generation. This technology greatly simplifies 3D content creation for common users, broadening the applicability of Light Field Displays (LFDs). However, the combination of these two fields remains largely unexplored. The standard paradigm to create optimal content for parallax-based light field displays demands rendering at least 45 slightly shifted views preferably at high resolution per frame, a substantial hurdle for real-time rendering. We introduce DirectL, a novel rendering paradigm for Radiance Fields on 3D displays. We thoroughly analyze the interweaved mapping of spatial rays to screen subpixels, precisely determine the light rays entering the human eye, and propose subpixel repurposing to significantly reduce the pixel count required for rendering. Tailored for the two predominant radiance fields--Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), we propose corresponding optimized rendering pipelines that directly render the light field images instead of multi-view images. Extensive experiments across various displays and user study demonstrate that DirectL accelerates rendering by up to 40 times compared to the standard paradigm without sacrificing visual quality. Its rendering process-only modification allows seamless integration into subsequent radiance field tasks. Finally, we integrate DirectL into diverse applications, showcasing the stunning visual experiences and the synergy between LFDs and Radiance Fields, which unveils tremendous potential for commercialization applications. \href{direct-l.github.io}{\textbf{Project Homepage}</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peiyong Wang, Casey R. Myers, Lloyd C. L. Hollenberg, Udaya Parampalli</p>
<p>Abstract: When applying quantum computing to machine learning tasks, one of the first considerations is the design of the quantum machine learning model itself. Conventionally, the design of quantum machine learning algorithms relies on the ``quantisation" of classical learning algorithms, such as using quantum linear algebra to implement important subroutines of classical algorithms, if not the entire algorithm, seeking to achieve quantum advantage through possible run-time accelerations brought by quantum computing. However, recent research has started questioning whether quantum advantage via speedup is the right goal for quantum machine learning [1]. Research also has been undertaken to exploit properties that are unique to quantum systems, such as quantum contextuality, to better design quantum machine learning models [2]. In this paper, we take an alternative approach by incorporating the heuristics and empirical evidences from the design of classical deep learning algorithms to the design of quantum neural networks. We first construct a model based on the data reuploading circuit [3] with the quantum Hamiltonian data embedding unitary [4]. Through numerical experiments on images datasets, including the famous MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets, we demonstrate that our model outperforms the quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN)[5] by a large margin (up to over 40% on MNIST test set). Based on the model design process and numerical results, we then laid out six principles for designing quantum machine learning models, especially quantum neural networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jamie Burke, Justin Engelmann, Samuel Gibbon, Charlene Hamid, Diana Moukaddem, Dan Pugh, Tariq Farrah, Niall Strang, Neeraj Dhaun, Tom MacGillivray, Stuart King, Ian J. C. MacCormick</p>
<p>Abstract: Purpose: To describe OCTolyzer: an open-source toolkit for retinochoroidal analysis in optical coherence tomography (OCT) and scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO) images.
  Method: OCTolyzer has two analysis suites, for SLO and OCT images. The former enables anatomical segmentation and feature measurement of the en face retinal vessels. The latter leverages image metadata for retinal layer segmentations and deep learning-based choroid layer segmentation to compute retinochoroidal measurements such as thickness and volume. We introduce OCTolyzer and assess the reproducibility of its OCT analysis suite for choroid analysis.
  Results: At the population-level, choroid region metrics were highly reproducible (Mean absolute error/Pearson/Spearman correlation for macular volume choroid thickness (CT):6.7$\mu$m/0.9933/0.9969, macular B-scan CT:11.6$\mu$m/0.9858/0.9889, peripapillary CT:5.0$\mu$m/0.9942/0.9940). Macular choroid vascular index (CVI) had good reproducibility (volume CVI:0.0271/0.9669/0.9655, B-scan CVI:0.0130/0.9090/0.9145). At the eye-level, measurement error in regional and vessel metrics were below 5% and 20% of the population's variability, respectively. Major outliers were from poor quality B-scans with thick choroids and invisible choroid-sclera boundary.
  Conclusions: OCTolyzer is the first open-source pipeline to convert OCT/SLO data into reproducible and clinically meaningful retinochoroidal measurements. OCT processing on a standard laptop CPU takes under 2 seconds for macular or peripapillary B-scans and 85 seconds for volume scans.

<p>Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated outstanding adaptation to medical image segmentation but still faces three major challenges. Firstly, the huge computational costs of SAM limit its real-world applicability. Secondly, SAM depends on manual annotations (e.g., points, boxes) as prompts, which are laborious and impractical in clinical scenarios. Thirdly, SAM handles all segmentation targets equally, which is suboptimal for diverse medical modalities with inherent heterogeneity. To address these issues, we propose an Efficient Self-Prompting SAM for universal medical image segmentation, named ESP-MedSAM. We devise a Multi-Modal Decoupled Knowledge Distillation (MMDKD) strategy to distil common image knowledge and domain-specific medical knowledge from the foundation model to train a lightweight image encoder and a modality controller. Further, they combine with the additionally introduced Self-Patch Prompt Generator (SPPG) and Query-Decoupled Modality Decoder (QDMD) to construct ESP-MedSAM. Specifically, SPPG aims to generate a set of patch prompts automatically and QDMD leverages a one-to-one strategy to provide an independent decoding channel for every modality. Extensive experiments indicate that ESP-MedSAM outperforms state-of-the-arts in diverse medical imaging segmentation takes, displaying superior zero-shot learning and modality transfer ability. Especially, our framework uses only 31.4% parameters compared to SAM-Base.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Tian, Nantheera Anantrasirichai, Lindsay Nicholson, Alin Achim</p>
<p>Abstract: In the realm of medical image fusion, integrating information from various modalities is crucial for improving diagnostics and treatment planning, especially in retinal health, where the important features exhibit differently in different imaging modalities. Existing deep learning-based approaches insufficiently focus on retinal image fusion, and thus fail to preserve enough anatomical structure and fine vessel details in retinal image fusion. To address this, we propose the Topology-Aware Graph Attention Network (TaGAT) for multi-modal retinal image fusion, leveraging a novel Topology-Aware Encoder (TAE) with Graph Attention Networks (GAT) to effectively enhance spatial features with retinal vasculature's graph topology across modalities. The TAE encodes the base and detail features, extracted via a Long-short Range (LSR) encoder from retinal images, into the graph extracted from the retinal vessel. Within the TAE, the GAT-based Graph Information Update (GIU) block dynamically refines and aggregates the node features to generate topology-aware graph features. The updated graph features with base and detail features are combined and decoded as a fused image. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in Fluorescein Fundus Angiography (FFA) with Color Fundus (CF) and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) with confocal microscopy retinal image fusion.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiqi Liu, Yihua Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: With the advancement of computer vision and natural language processing, text-to-video generation, enabled by text-to-video diffusion models, has become more prevalent. These models are trained using a large amount of data from the internet. However, the training data often contain copyrighted content, including cartoon character icons and artist styles, private portraits, and unsafe videos. Since filtering the data and retraining the model is challenging, methods for unlearning specific concepts from text-to-video diffusion models have been investigated. However, due to the high computational complexity and relative large optimization scale, there is little work on unlearning methods for text-to-video diffusion models. We propose a novel concept-unlearning method by transferring the unlearning capability of the text encoder of text-to-image diffusion models to text-to-video diffusion models. Specifically, the method optimizes the text encoder using few-shot unlearning, where several generated images are used. We then use the optimized text encoder in text-to-video diffusion models to generate videos. Our method costs low computation resources and has small optimization scale. We discuss the generated videos after unlearning a concept. The experiments demonstrates that our method can unlearn copyrighted cartoon characters, artist styles, objects and people's facial characteristics. Our method can unlearn a concept within about 100 seconds on an RTX 3070. Since there was no concept unlearning method for text-to-video diffusion models before, we make concept unlearning feasible and more accessible in the text-to-video domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sebastian Cygert, Damian S\'ojka, Tomasz Trzci\'nski, Bart{\l}omiej Twardowski</p>
<p>Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) has recently emerged as a promising strategy for tackling the problem of machine learning model robustness under distribution shifts by adapting the model during inference without access to any labels. Because of task difficulty, hyperparameters strongly influence the effectiveness of adaptation. However, the literature has provided little exploration into optimal hyperparameter selection. In this work, we tackle this problem by evaluating existing TTA methods using surrogate-based hp-selection strategies (which do not assume access to the test labels) to obtain a more realistic evaluation of their performance. We show that some of the recent state-of-the-art methods exhibit inferior performance compared to the previous algorithms when using our more realistic evaluation setup. Further, we show that forgetting is still a problem in TTA as the only method that is robust to hp-selection resets the model to the initial state at every step. We analyze different types of unsupervised selection strategies, and while they work reasonably well in most scenarios, the only strategies that work consistently well use some kind of supervision (either by a limited number of annotated test samples or by using pretraining data). Our findings underscore the need for further research with more rigorous benchmarking by explicitly stating model selection strategies, to facilitate which we open-source our code.</p>

<p>Abstract: Efficient and lightweight single-image super-resolution (SISR) has achieved remarkable performance in recent years. One effective approach is the use of large kernel designs, which have been shown to improve the performance of SISR models while reducing their computational requirements. However, current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models still face problems such as high computational costs. To address these issues, we propose the Large Kernel Distillation Network (LKDN) in this paper. Our approach simplifies the model structure and introduces more efficient attention modules to reduce computational costs while also improving performance. Specifically, we employ the reparameterization technique to enhance model performance without adding extra cost. We also introduce a new optimizer from other tasks to SISR, which improves training speed and performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that LKDN outperforms existing lightweight SR methods and achieves SOTA performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muyang Li, Can Cui, Quan Liu, Ruining Deng, Tianyuan Yao, Marilyn Lionts, Yuankai Huo</p>
<p>Abstract: Data sharing in the medical image analysis field has potential yet remains underappreciated. The aim is often to share datasets efficiently with other sites to train models effectively. One possible solution is to avoid transferring the entire dataset while still achieving similar model performance. Recent progress in data distillation within computer science offers promising prospects for sharing medical data efficiently without significantly compromising model effectiveness. However, it remains uncertain whether these methods would be applicable to medical imaging, since medical and natural images are distinct fields. Moreover, it is intriguing to consider what level of performance could be achieved with these methods. To answer these questions, we conduct investigations on a variety of leading data distillation methods, in different contexts of medical imaging. We evaluate the feasibility of these methods with extensive experiments in two aspects: 1) Assess the impact of data distillation across multiple datasets characterized by minor or great variations. 2) Explore the indicator to predict the distillation performance. Our extensive experiments across multiple medical datasets reveal that data distillation can significantly reduce dataset size while maintaining comparable model performance to that achieved with the full dataset, suggesting that a small, representative sample of images can serve as a reliable indicator of distillation success. This study demonstrates that data distillation is a viable method for efficient and secure medical data sharing, with the potential to facilitate enhanced collaborative research and clinical applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Geng Chen, Xinrui Chen, Bo Dong, Mingchen Zhuge, Yongxiong Wang, Hongbo Bi, Jian Chen, Peng Wang, Yanning Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Camouflaged object detection (COD), which aims to identify the objects that conceal themselves into the surroundings, has recently drawn increasing research efforts in the field of computer vision. In practice, the success of deep learning based COD is mainly determined by two key factors, including (i) A significantly large receptive field, which provides rich context information, and (ii) An effective fusion strategy, which aggregates the rich multi-level features for accurate COD. Motivated by these observations, in this paper, we propose a novel deep learning based COD approach, which integrates the large receptive field and effective feature fusion into a unified framework. Specifically, we first extract multi-level features from a backbone network. The resulting features are then fed to the proposed dual-branch mixture convolution modules, each of which utilizes multiple asymmetric convolutional layers and two dilated convolutional layers to extract rich context features from a large receptive field. Finally, we fuse the features using specially-designed multilevel interactive fusion modules, each of which employs an attention mechanism along with feature interaction for effective feature fusion. Our method detects camouflaged objects with an effective fusion strategy, which aggregates the rich context information from a large receptive field. All of these designs meet the requirements of COD well, allowing the accurate detection of camouflaged objects. Extensive experiments on widely-used benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method is capable of accurately detecting camouflaged objects and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxi Wang, Jian Liang, Zhaoxiang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation has developed rapidly in recent years, where the well-trained source model is adapted to the target domain instead of the source data, offering the potential for privacy concerns and intellectual property protection. However, a number of feature alignment techniques in prior domain adaptation methods are not feasible in this challenging problem setting. Thereby, we resort to probing inherent domain-invariant feature learning and propose a curriculum-style self-training approach for source-free domain adaptive semantic segmentation. In particular, we introduce a curriculum-style entropy minimization method to explore the implicit knowledge from the source model, which fits the trained source model to the target data using certain information from easy-to-hard predictions. We then train the segmentation network by the proposed complementary curriculum-style self-training, which utilizes the negative and positive pseudo labels following the curriculum-learning manner. Although negative pseudo-labels with high uncertainty cannot be identified with the correct labels, they can definitely indicate absent classes. Moreover, we employ an information propagation scheme to further reduce the intra-domain discrepancy within the target domain, which could act as a standard post-processing method for the domain adaptation field. Furthermore, we extend the proposed method to a more challenging black-box source model scenario where only the source model's predictions are available. Extensive experiments validate that our method yields state-of-the-art performance on source-free semantic segmentation tasks for both synthetic-to-real and adverse conditions datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaming Liu, Qizhe Zhang, Xiaoqi Li, Jianing Li, Guanqun Wang, Ming Lu, Tiejun Huang, Shanghang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Neuromorphic spike data, an upcoming modality with high temporal resolution, has shown promising potential in autonomous driving by mitigating the challenges posed by high-velocity motion blur. However, training the spike depth estimation network holds significant challenges in two aspects: sparse spatial information for pixel-wise tasks and difficulties in achieving paired depth labels for temporally intensive spike streams. Therefore, we introduce open-source RGB data to support spike depth estimation, leveraging its annotations and spatial information. The inherent differences in modalities and data distribution make it challenging to directly apply transfer learning from open-source RGB to target spike data. To this end, we propose a cross-modality cross-domain (BiCross) framework to realize unsupervised spike depth estimation by introducing simulated mediate source spike data. Specifically, we design a Coarse-to-Fine Knowledge Distillation (CFKD) approach to facilitate comprehensive cross-modality knowledge transfer while preserving the unique strengths of both modalities, utilizing a spike-oriented uncertainty scheme. Then, we propose a Self-Correcting Teacher-Student (SCTS) mechanism to screen out reliable pixel-wise pseudo labels and ease the domain shift of the student model, which avoids error accumulation in target spike data. To verify the effectiveness of BiCross, we conduct extensive experiments on four scenarios, including Synthetic to Real, Extreme Weather, Scene Changing, and Real Spike. Our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performances, compared with RGB-oriented unsupervised depth estimation methods. Code and dataset: https://github.com/Theia-4869/BiCross</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shilong Liu, Zhaoyang Zeng, Tianhe Ren, Feng Li, Hao Zhang, Jie Yang, Qing Jiang, Chunyuan Li, Jianwei Yang, Hang Su, Jun Zhu, Lei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present an open-set object detector, called Grounding DINO, by marrying Transformer-based detector DINO with grounded pre-training, which can detect arbitrary objects with human inputs such as category names or referring expressions. The key solution of open-set object detection is introducing language to a closed-set detector for open-set concept generalization. To effectively fuse language and vision modalities, we conceptually divide a closed-set detector into three phases and propose a tight fusion solution, which includes a feature enhancer, a language-guided query selection, and a cross-modality decoder for cross-modality fusion. While previous works mainly evaluate open-set object detection on novel categories, we propose to also perform evaluations on referring expression comprehension for objects specified with attributes. Grounding DINO performs remarkably well on all three settings, including benchmarks on COCO, LVIS, ODinW, and RefCOCO/+/g. Grounding DINO achieves a $52.5$ AP on the COCO detection zero-shot transfer benchmark, i.e., without any training data from COCO. It sets a new record on the ODinW zero-shot benchmark with a mean $26.1$ AP. Code will be available at \url{https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Zhang, Yeo Keat Ee, Basura Fernando</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual abductive reasoning aims to make likely explanations for visual observations. We propose a simple yet effective Region Conditioned Adaptation, a hybrid parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that equips the frozen CLIP with the ability to infer explanations from local visual cues. We encode ``local hints'' and ``global contexts'' into visual prompts of the CLIP model separately at fine and coarse-grained levels. Adapters are used for fine-tuning CLIP models for downstream tasks and we design a new attention adapter, that directly steers the focus of the attention map with trainable query and key projections of a frozen CLIP model. Finally, we train our new model with a modified contrastive loss to regress the visual feature simultaneously toward features of literal description and plausible explanations. The loss enables CLIP to maintain both perception and reasoning abilities. Experiments on the Sherlock visual abductive reasoning benchmark show that the RCA significantly outstands previous SOTAs, ranking the \nth{1} on the leaderboards (e.g., Human Acc: RCA 31.74 \textit{vs} CPT-CLIP 29.58, higher =better). We also validate the RCA is generalizable to local perception benchmarks like RefCOCO. We open-source our project at \textit{\color{magenta}{\url{https://github.com/LUNAProject22/RPA}}}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tobias Christian Nauen, Sebastian Palacio, Federico Raue, Andreas Dengel</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-attention in Transformers comes with a high computational cost because of their quadratic computational complexity, but their effectiveness in addressing problems in language and vision has sparked extensive research aimed at enhancing their efficiency. However, diverse experimental conditions, spanning multiple input domains, prevent a fair comparison based solely on reported results, posing challenges for model selection. To address this gap in comparability, we perform a large-scale benchmark of more than 45 models for image classification, evaluating key efficiency aspects, including accuracy, speed, and memory usage. Our benchmark provides a standardized baseline for efficiency-oriented transformers. We analyze the results based on the Pareto front -- the boundary of optimal models. Surprisingly, despite claims of other models being more efficient, ViT remains Pareto optimal across multiple metrics. We observe that hybrid attention-CNN models exhibit remarkable inference memory- and parameter-efficiency. Moreover, our benchmark shows that using a larger model in general is more efficient than using higher resolution images. Thanks to our holistic evaluation, we provide a centralized resource for practitioners and researchers, facilitating informed decisions when selecting or developing efficient transformers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruijie Yao, Sheng Jin, Lumin Xu, Wang Zeng, Wentao Liu, Chen Qian, Ping Luo, Ji Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-Label Image Recognition (MLIR) is a challenging task that aims to predict multiple object labels in a single image while modeling the complex relationships between labels and image regions. Although convolutional neural networks and vision transformers have succeeded in processing images as regular grids of pixels or patches, these representations are sub-optimal for capturing irregular and discontinuous regions of interest. In this work, we present the first fully graph convolutional model, Group K-nearest neighbor based Graph convolutional Network (GKGNet), which models the connections between semantic label embeddings and image patches in a flexible and unified graph structure. To address the scale variance of different objects and to capture information from multiple perspectives, we propose the Group KGCN module for dynamic graph construction and message passing. Our experiments demonstrate that GKGNet achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly lower computational costs on the challenging multi-label datasets, i.e., MS-COCO and VOC2007 datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Wang, Conrad M Albrecht, Nassim Ait Ali Braham, Chenying Liu, Zhitong Xiong, Xiao Xiang Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing availability of multi-sensor data sparks wide interest in multimodal self-supervised learning. However, most existing approaches learn only common representations across modalities while ignoring intra-modal training and modality-unique representations. We propose Decoupling Common and Unique Representations (DeCUR), a simple yet effective method for multimodal self-supervised learning. By distinguishing inter- and intra-modal embeddings through multimodal redundancy reduction, DeCUR can integrate complementary information across different modalities. We evaluate DeCUR in three common multimodal scenarios (radar-optical, RGB-elevation, and RGB-depth), and demonstrate its consistent improvement regardless of architectures and for both multimodal and modality-missing settings. With thorough experiments and comprehensive analysis, we hope this work can provide valuable insights and raise more interest in researching the hidden relationships of multimodal representations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dahun Kim, Anelia Angelova, Weicheng Kuo</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a new open-vocabulary detection approach based on region-centric image-language pretraining to bridge the gap between image-level pretraining and open-vocabulary object detection. At the pretraining phase, we incorporate the detector architecture on top of the classification backbone, which better serves the region-level recognition needs of detection by enabling the detector heads to learn from large-scale image-text pairs. Using only standard contrastive loss and no pseudo-labeling, our approach is a simple yet effective extension of the contrastive learning method to learn emergent object-semantic cues. In addition, we propose a shifted-window learning approach upon window attention to make the backbone representation more robust, translation-invariant, and less biased by the window pattern. On the popular LVIS open-vocabulary detection benchmark, our approach sets a new state of the art of 37.6 mask APr using the common ViT-L backbone and public LAION dataset, and 40.5 mask APr using the DataComp-1B dataset, significantly outperforming the best existing approach by +3.7 mask APr at system level. On the COCO benchmark, we achieve very competitive 39.6 novel AP without pseudo labeling or weak supervision. In addition, we evaluate our approach on the transfer detection setup, where it demonstrates notable improvement over the baseline. Visualization reveals emerging object locality from the pretraining recipes compared to the baseline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haizhong Zheng, Jiachen Sun, Shutong Wu, Bhavya Kailkhura, Zhuoqing Mao, Chaowei Xiao, Atul Prakash</p>
<p>Abstract: Given a real-world dataset, data condensation (DC) aims to synthesize a small synthetic dataset that captures the knowledge of a natural dataset while being usable for training models with comparable accuracy. Recent works propose to enhance DC with data parameterization, which condenses data into very compact parameterized data containers instead of images. The intuition behind data parameterization is to encode shared features of images to avoid additional storage costs. In this paper, we recognize that images share common features in a hierarchical way due to the inherent hierarchical structure of the classification system, which is overlooked by current data parameterization methods. To better align DC with this hierarchical nature and encourage more efficient information sharing inside data containers, we propose a novel data parameterization architecture, Hierarchical Memory Network (HMN). HMN stores condensed data in a three-tier structure, representing the dataset-level, class-level, and instance-level features. Another helpful property of the hierarchical architecture is that HMN naturally ensures good independence among images despite achieving information sharing. This enables instance-level pruning for HMN to reduce redundant information, thereby further minimizing redundancy and enhancing performance. We evaluate HMN on five public datasets and show that our proposed method outperforms all baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: Defect inspection is paramount within the closed-loop manufacturing system. However, existing datasets for defect inspection often lack precision and semantic granularity required for practical applications. In this paper, we introduce the Defect Spectrum, a comprehensive benchmark that offers precise, semantic-abundant, and large-scale annotations for a wide range of industrial defects. Building on four key industrial benchmarks, our dataset refines existing annotations and introduces rich semantic details, distinguishing multiple defect types within a single image. Furthermore, we introduce Defect-Gen, a two-stage diffusion-based generator designed to create high-quality and diverse defective images, even when working with limited datasets. The synthetic images generated by Defect-Gen significantly enhance the efficacy of defect inspection models. Overall, The Defect Spectrum dataset demonstrates its potential in defect inspection research, offering a solid platform for testing and refining advanced models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated high vulnerability to adversarial examples, raising broad security concerns about their applications. Besides the attacks in the digital world, the practical implications of adversarial examples in the physical world present significant challenges and safety concerns. However, current research on physical adversarial examples (PAEs) lacks a comprehensive understanding of their unique characteristics, leading to limited significance and understanding. In this paper, we address this gap by thoroughly examining the characteristics of PAEs within a practical workflow encompassing training, manufacturing, and re-sampling processes. By analyzing the links between physical adversarial attacks, we identify manufacturing and re-sampling as the primary sources of distinct attributes and particularities in PAEs. Leveraging this knowledge, we develop a comprehensive analysis and classification framework for PAEs based on their specific characteristics, covering over 100 studies on physical-world adversarial examples. Furthermore, we investigate defense strategies against PAEs and identify open challenges and opportunities for future research. We aim to provide a fresh, thorough, and systematic understanding of PAEs, thereby promoting the development of robust adversarial learning and its application in open-world scenarios to provide the community with a continuously updated list of physical world adversarial sample resources, including papers, code, \etc, within the proposed framework</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoran Li, Long Ma, Yong Liao, Lechao Cheng, Yanbin Hao, Pengyuan Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: The current GAN inversion methods typically can only edit the appearance and shape of a single object and background while overlooking spatial information. In this work, we propose a 3D editing framework, 3D-GOI, to enable multifaceted editing of affine information (scale, translation, and rotation) on multiple objects. 3D-GOI realizes the complex editing function by inverting the abundance of attribute codes (object shape/appearance/scale/rotation/translation, background shape/appearance, and camera pose) controlled by GIRAFFE, a renowned 3D GAN. Accurately inverting all the codes is challenging, 3D-GOI solves this challenge following three main steps. First, we segment the objects and the background in a multi-object image. Second, we use a custom Neural Inversion Encoder to obtain coarse codes of each object. Finally, we use a round-robin optimization algorithm to get precise codes to reconstruct the image. To the best of our knowledge, 3D-GOI is the first framework to enable multifaceted editing on multiple objects. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that 3D-GOI holds immense potential for flexible, multifaceted editing in complex multi-object scenes.Our project and code are released at https://3d-goi.github.io .</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Evin P{\i}nar \"Ornek, Yann Labb\'e, Bugra Tekin, Lingni Ma, Cem Keskin, Christian Forster, Tomas Hodan</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose FoundPose, a model-based method for 6D pose estimation of unseen objects from a single RGB image. The method can quickly onboard new objects using their 3D models without requiring any object- or task-specific training. In contrast, existing methods typically pre-train on large-scale, task-specific datasets in order to generalize to new objects and to bridge the image-to-model domain gap. We demonstrate that such generalization capabilities can be observed in a recent vision foundation model trained in a self-supervised manner. Specifically, our method estimates the object pose from image-to-model 2D-3D correspondences, which are established by matching patch descriptors from the recent DINOv2 model between the image and pre-rendered object templates. We find that reliable correspondences can be established by kNN matching of patch descriptors from an intermediate DINOv2 layer. Such descriptors carry stronger positional information than descriptors from the last layer, and we show their importance when semantic information is ambiguous due to object symmetries or a lack of texture. To avoid establishing correspondences against all object templates, we develop an efficient template retrieval approach that integrates the patch descriptors into the bag-of-words representation and can promptly propose a handful of similarly looking templates. Additionally, we apply featuremetric alignment to compensate for discrepancies in the 2D-3D correspondences caused by coarse patch sampling. The resulting method noticeably outperforms existing RGB methods for refinement-free pose estimation on the standard BOP benchmark with seven diverse datasets and can be seamlessly combined with an existing render-and-compare refinement method to achieve RGB-only state-of-the-art results.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yao-Chih Lee, Zhoutong Zhang, Kevin Blackburn-Matzen, Simon Niklaus, Jianming Zhang, Jia-Bin Huang, Feng Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Novel view synthesis from an in-the-wild video is difficult due to challenges like scene dynamics and lack of parallax. While existing methods have shown promising results with implicit neural radiance fields, they are slow to train and render. This paper revisits explicit video representations to synthesize high-quality novel views from a monocular video efficiently. We treat static and dynamic video content separately. Specifically, we build a global static scene model using an extended plane-based scene representation to synthesize temporally coherent novel video. Our plane-based scene representation is augmented with spherical harmonics and displacement maps to capture view-dependent effects and model non-planar complex surface geometry. We opt to represent the dynamic content as per-frame point clouds for efficiency. While such representations are inconsistency-prone, minor temporal inconsistencies are perceptually masked due to motion. We develop a method to quickly estimate such a hybrid video representation and render novel views in real time. Our experiments show that our method can render high-quality novel views from an in-the-wild video with comparable quality to state-of-the-art methods while being 100x faster in training and enabling real-time rendering.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chong Zhou, Xiangtai Li, Chen Change Loy, Bo Dai</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents EdgeSAM, an accelerated variant of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), optimized for efficient execution on edge devices with minimal compromise in performance. Our approach involves distilling the original ViT-based SAM image encoder into a purely CNN-based architecture, better suited for edge devices. We carefully benchmark various distillation strategies and demonstrate that taskagnostic encoder distillation fails to capture the full knowledge embodied in SAM. To overcome this bottleneck, we include both the prompt encoder and mask decoder in the distillation process, with box and point prompts in the loop, so that the distilled model can accurately capture the intricate dynamics between user input and mask generation. To mitigate dataset bias issues stemming from point prompt distillation, we incorporate a lightweight module within the encoder. As a result, EdgeSAM achieves a 37-fold speed increase compared to the original SAM, and it also outperforms MobileSAM/EfficientSAM, being over 7 times as fast when deployed on edge devices while enhancing the mIoUs on COCO and LVIS by 2.3/1.5 and 3.1/1.6, respectively. It is also the first SAM variant that can run at over 30 FPS on an iPhone 14. Code and demo are available at https://www.mmlab-ntu.com/project/edgesam.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Feixiang Zhou, Zheheng Jiang, Huiyu Zhou, Xuelong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Semi-supervised temporal action segmentation (SS-TA) aims to perform frame-wise classification in long untrimmed videos, where only a fraction of videos in the training set have labels. Recent studies have shown the potential of contrastive learning in unsupervised representation learning using unlabelled data. However, learning the representation of each frame by unsupervised contrastive learning for action segmentation remains an open and challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a novel Semantic-guided Multi-level Contrast scheme with a Neighbourhood-Consistency-Aware unit (SMC-NCA) to extract strong frame-wise representations for SS-TAS. Specifically, for representation learning, SMC is first used to explore intra- and inter-information variations in a unified and contrastive way, based on action-specific semantic information and temporal information highlighting relations between actions. Then, the NCA module, which is responsible for enforcing spatial consistency between neighbourhoods centered at different frames to alleviate over-segmentation issues, works alongside SMC for semi-supervised learning (SSL). Our SMC outperforms the other state-of-the-art methods on three benchmarks, offering improvements of up to 17.8% and 12.6% in terms of Edit distance and accuracy, respectively. Additionally, the NCA unit results in significantly better segmentation performance in the presence of only 5% labelled videos. We also demonstrate the generalizability and effectiveness of the proposed method on our Parkinson Disease's Mouse Behaviour (PDMB) dataset.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haisong Liu, Yang Chen, Haiguang Wang, Zetong Yang, Tianyu Li, Jia Zeng, Li Chen, Hongyang Li, Limin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Occupancy prediction plays a pivotal role in autonomous driving. Previous methods typically construct dense 3D volumes, neglecting the inherent sparsity of the scene and suffering from high computational costs. To bridge the gap, we introduce a novel fully sparse occupancy network, termed SparseOcc. SparseOcc initially reconstructs a sparse 3D representation from camera-only inputs and subsequently predicts semantic/instance occupancy from the 3D sparse representation by sparse queries. A mask-guided sparse sampling is designed to enable sparse queries to interact with 2D features in a fully sparse manner, thereby circumventing costly dense features or global attention. Additionally, we design a thoughtful ray-based evaluation metric, namely RayIoU, to solve the inconsistency penalty along the depth axis raised in traditional voxel-level mIoU criteria. SparseOcc demonstrates its effectiveness by achieving a RayIoU of 34.0, while maintaining a real-time inference speed of 17.3 FPS, with 7 history frames inputs. By incorporating more preceding frames to 15, SparseOcc continuously improves its performance to 35.1 RayIoU without bells and whistles.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce PartSTAD, a method designed for the task adaptation of 2D-to-3D segmentation lifting. Recent studies have highlighted the advantages of utilizing 2D segmentation models to achieve high-quality 3D segmentation through few-shot adaptation. However, previous approaches have focused on adapting 2D segmentation models for domain shift to rendered images and synthetic text descriptions, rather than optimizing the model specifically for 3D segmentation. Our proposed task adaptation method finetunes a 2D bounding box prediction model with an objective function for 3D segmentation. We introduce weights for 2D bounding boxes for adaptive merging and learn the weights using a small additional neural network. Additionally, we incorporate SAM, a foreground segmentation model on a bounding box, to improve the boundaries of 2D segments and consequently those of 3D segmentation. Our experiments on the PartNet-Mobility dataset show significant improvements with our task adaptation approach, achieving a 7.0%p increase in mIoU and a 5.2%p improvement in mAP@50 for semantic and instance segmentation compared to the SotA few-shot 3D segmentation model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chaitanya Patel, Shaojie Bai, Te-Li Wang, Jason Saragih, Shih-En Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Virtual Reality (VR) bares promise of social interactions that can feel more immersive than other media. Key to this is the ability to accurately animate a personalized photorealistic avatar, and hence the acquisition of the labels for headset-mounted camera (HMC) images need to be efficient and accurate, while wearing a VR headset. This is challenging due to oblique camera views and differences in image modality. In this work, we first show that the domain gap between the avatar and HMC images is one of the primary sources of difficulty, where a transformer-based architecture achieves high accuracy on domain-consistent data, but degrades when the domain-gap is re-introduced. Building on this finding, we propose a system split into two parts: an iterative refinement module that takes in-domain inputs, and a generic avatar-guided image-to-image domain transfer module conditioned on current estimates. These two modules reinforce each other: domain transfer becomes easier when close-to-groundtruth examples are shown, and better domain-gap removal in turn improves the registration. Our system obviates the need for costly offline optimization, and produces online registration of higher quality than direct regression method.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenyu Bao, Guibiao Liao, Zhongyuan Zhao, Kanglin Liu, Qing Li, Guoping Qiu</p>
<p>Abstract: Simultaneously achieving 3D reconstruction and new view synthesis for indoor environments has widespread applications but is technically very challenging. State-of-the-art methods based on implicit neural functions can achieve excellent 3D reconstruction results, but their performances on new view synthesis can be unsatisfactory. The exciting development of neural radiance field (NeRF) has revolutionized new view synthesis, however, NeRF-based models can fail to reconstruct clean geometric surfaces. We have developed a dual neural radiance field (Du-NeRF) to simultaneously achieve high-quality geometry reconstruction and view rendering. Du-NeRF contains two geometric fields, one derived from the SDF field to facilitate geometric reconstruction and the other derived from the density field to boost new view synthesis. One of the innovative features of Du-NeRF is that it decouples a view-independent component from the density field and uses it as a label to supervise the learning process of the SDF field. This reduces shape-radiance ambiguity and enables geometry and color to benefit from each other during the learning process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Du-NeRF can significantly improve the performance of novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction for indoor environments and it is particularly effective in constructing areas containing fine geometries that do not obey multi-view color consistency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vin\'icius Yu Okubo, Kotaro Shimizu, B. S. Shivaram, Hae Yong Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Defects influence diverse properties of materials, shaping their structural, mechanical, and electronic characteristics. Among a variety of materials exhibiting unique defects, magnets exhibit diverse nano- to micro-scale defects and have been intensively studied in materials science. Specifically, defects in magnetic labyrinthine patterns, called junctions and terminals are ubiquitous and serve as points of interest. While detecting and characterizing such defects is crucial for understanding magnets, systematically investigating large-scale images containing over a thousand closely packed junctions and terminals remains a formidable challenge. This study introduces a new technique called TM-CNN (Template Matching - Convolutional Neural Network) designed to detect a multitude of small objects in images, such as the defects in magnetic labyrinthine patterns. TM-CNN was used to identify 641,649 such structures in 444 experimental images, and the results were explored to deepen understanding of magnetic materials. It employs a two-stage detection approach combining template matching, used in initial detection, with a convolutional neural network, used to eliminate incorrect identifications. To train a CNN classifier, it is necessary to annotate a large number of training images. This difficulty prevents the use of CNN in many practical applications. TM-CNN significantly reduces the manual workload for creating training images by automatically making most of the annotations and leaving only a small number of corrections to human reviewers. In testing, TM-CNN achieved an impressive F1 score of 0.991, far outperforming traditional template matching and CNN-based object detection algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanan Gani, Nada Saadi, Noor Hussein, Karthik Nandakumar</p>
<p>Abstract: Since their inception, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as a compelling alternative to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) across a wide spectrum of tasks. ViTs exhibit notable characteristics, including global attention, resilience against occlusions, and adaptability to distribution shifts. One underexplored aspect of ViTs is their potential for multi-attribute learning, referring to their ability to simultaneously grasp multiple attribute-related tasks. In this paper, we delve into the multi-attribute learning capability of ViTs, presenting a straightforward yet effective strategy for training various attributes through a single ViT network as distinct tasks. We assess the resilience of multi-attribute ViTs against adversarial attacks and compare their performance against ViTs designed for single attributes. Moreover, we further evaluate the robustness of multi-attribute ViTs against a recent transformer based attack called Patch-Fool. Our empirical findings on the CelebA dataset provide validation for our assertion. Our code is available at https://github.com/hananshafi/MTL-ViT</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rohith Peddi, Saksham Singh,  Saurabh, Parag Singla, Vibhav Gogate</p>
<p>Abstract: Spatio-temporal scene graphs represent interactions in a video by decomposing scenes into individual objects and their pair-wise temporal relationships. Long-term anticipation of the fine-grained pair-wise relationships between objects is a challenging problem. To this end, we introduce the task of Scene Graph Anticipation (SGA). We adapt state-of-the-art scene graph generation methods as baselines to anticipate future pair-wise relationships between objects and propose a novel approach SceneSayer. In SceneSayer, we leverage object-centric representations of relationships to reason about the observed video frames and model the evolution of relationships between objects. We take a continuous time perspective and model the latent dynamics of the evolution of object interactions using concepts of NeuralODE and NeuralSDE, respectively. We infer representations of future relationships by solving an Ordinary Differential Equation and a Stochastic Differential Equation, respectively. Extensive experimentation on the Action Genome dataset validates the efficacy of the proposed methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunpeng Qu, Kun Yuan, Kai Zhao, Qizhi Xie, Jinhua Hao, Ming Sun, Chao Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion-based methods, endowed with a formidable generative prior, have received increasing attention in Image Super-Resolution (ISR) recently. However, as low-resolution (LR) images often undergo severe degradation, it is challenging for ISR models to perceive the semantic and degradation information, resulting in restoration images with incorrect content or unrealistic artifacts. To address these issues, we propose a \textit{Cross-modal Priors for Super-Resolution (XPSR)} framework. Within XPSR, to acquire precise and comprehensive semantic conditions for the diffusion model, cutting-edge Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are utilized. To facilitate better fusion of cross-modal priors, a \textit{Semantic-Fusion Attention} is raised. To distill semantic-preserved information instead of undesired degradations, a \textit{Degradation-Free Constraint} is attached between LR and its high-resolution (HR) counterpart. Quantitative and qualitative results show that XPSR is capable of generating high-fidelity and high-realism images across synthetic and real-world datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Alkhalefi, Georgios Leontidis, Mingjun Zhong</p>
<p>Abstract: Contrastive instance discrimination approaches outperform supervised learning in downstream tasks like image classification and object detection. However, these approaches heavily rely on data augmentation during representation learning, which may result in inferior results if not properly implemented. Random cropping followed by resizing is a common form of data augmentation used in contrastive learning, but it can lead to degraded representation learning if the two random crops contain distinct semantic content. To address this issue, this paper introduces LeOCLR (Leveraging Original Images for Contrastive Learning of Visual Representations), a framework that employs a new instance discrimination approach and an adapted loss function to alleviate discarding semantic features caused by mapping different object parts during representation learning. The experimental results show that our approach consistently improves representation learning across different datasets compared to baseline models. For example, our approach outperforms MoCo-v2 by 5.1% on ImageNet-1K in linear evaluation and several other methods on transfer learning tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Licheng Zhong, Hong-Xing Yu, Jiajun Wu, Yunzhu Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Reconstructing and simulating elastic objects from visual observations is crucial for applications in computer vision and robotics. Existing methods, such as 3D Gaussians, model 3D appearance and geometry, but lack the ability to estimate physical properties for objects and simulate them. The core challenge lies in integrating an expressive yet efficient physical dynamics model. We propose Spring-Gaus, a 3D physical object representation for reconstructing and simulating elastic objects from videos of the object from multiple viewpoints. In particular, we develop and integrate a 3D Spring-Mass model into 3D Gaussian kernels, enabling the reconstruction of the visual appearance, shape, and physical dynamics of the object. Our approach enables future prediction and simulation under various initial states and environmental properties. We evaluate Spring-Gaus on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating accurate reconstruction and simulation of elastic objects. Project page: https://zlicheng.com/spring_gaus/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hang Zhang, Wenxiao Zhang, Haoxuan Qu, Jun Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Human-centered dynamic scene understanding plays a pivotal role in enhancing the capability of robotic and autonomous systems, in which Video-based Human-Object Interaction (V-HOI) detection is a crucial task in semantic scene understanding, aimed at comprehensively understanding HOI relationships within a video to benefit the behavioral decisions of mobile robots and autonomous driving systems. Although previous V-HOI detection models have made significant strides in accurate detection on specific datasets, they still lack the general reasoning ability like human beings to effectively induce HOI relationships. In this study, we propose V-HOI Multi-LLMs Collaborated Reasoning (V-HOI MLCR), a novel framework consisting of a series of plug-and-play modules that could facilitate the performance of current V-HOI detection models by leveraging the strong reasoning ability of different off-the-shelf pre-trained large language models (LLMs). We design a two-stage collaboration system of different LLMs for the V-HOI task. Specifically, in the first stage, we design a Cross-Agents Reasoning scheme to leverage the LLM conduct reasoning from different aspects. In the second stage, we perform Multi-LLMs Debate to get the final reasoning answer based on the different knowledge in different LLMs. Additionally, we devise an auxiliary training strategy that utilizes CLIP, a large vision-language model to enhance the base V-HOI models' discriminative ability to better cooperate with LLMs. We validate the superiority of our design by demonstrating its effectiveness in improving the prediction accuracy of the base V-HOI model via reasoning from multiple perspectives.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junlin Han, Filippos Kokkinos, Philip Torr</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for building scalable 3D generative models utilizing pre-trained video diffusion models. The primary obstacle in developing foundation 3D generative models is the limited availability of 3D data. Unlike images, texts, or videos, 3D data are not readily accessible and are difficult to acquire. This results in a significant disparity in scale compared to the vast quantities of other types of data. To address this issue, we propose using a video diffusion model, trained with extensive volumes of text, images, and videos, as a knowledge source for 3D data. By unlocking its multi-view generative capabilities through fine-tuning, we generate a large-scale synthetic multi-view dataset to train a feed-forward 3D generative model. The proposed model, VFusion3D, trained on nearly 3M synthetic multi-view data, can generate a 3D asset from a single image in seconds and achieves superior performance when compared to current SOTA feed-forward 3D generative models, with users preferring our results over 90% of the time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Phillip Y. Lee, Minhyuk Sung</p>
<p>Abstract: When an image generation process is guided by both a text prompt and spatial cues, such as a set of bounding boxes, do these elements work in harmony, or does one dominate the other? Our analysis of a pretrained image diffusion model that integrates gated self-attention into the U-Net reveals that spatial grounding often outweighs textual grounding due to the sequential flow from gated self-attention to cross-attention. We demonstrate that such bias can be significantly mitigated without sacrificing accuracy in either grounding by simply rewiring the network architecture, changing from sequential to parallel for gated self-attention and cross-attention. This surprisingly simple yet effective solution does not require any fine-tuning of the network but significantly reduces the trade-off between the two groundings. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements from the original GLIGEN to the rewired version in the trade-off between textual grounding and spatial grounding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tim Salzmann, Markus Ryll, Alex Bewley, Matthias Minderer</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual relationship detection aims to identify objects and their relationships in images. Prior methods approach this task by adding separate relationship modules or decoders to existing object detection architectures. This separation increases complexity and hinders end-to-end training, which limits performance. We propose a simple and highly efficient decoder-free architecture for open-vocabulary visual relationship detection. Our model consists of a Transformer-based image encoder that represents objects as tokens and models their relationships implicitly. To extract relationship information, we introduce an attention mechanism that selects object pairs likely to form a relationship. We provide a single-stage recipe to train this model on a mixture of object and relationship detection data. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art relationship detection performance on Visual Genome and on the large-vocabulary GQA benchmark at real-time inference speeds. We provide ablations, real-world qualitative examples, and analyses of zero-shot performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dimity Miller, Niko S\"underhauf, Alex Kenna, Keita Mason</p>
<p>Abstract: Are vision-language models (VLMs) for open-vocabulary perception inherently open-set models because they are trained on internet-scale datasets? We answer this question with a clear no - VLMs introduce closed-set assumptions via their finite query set, making them vulnerable to open-set conditions. We systematically evaluate VLMs for open-set recognition and find they frequently misclassify objects not contained in their query set, leading to alarmingly low precision when tuned for high recall and vice versa. We show that naively increasing the size of the query set to contain more and more classes does not mitigate this problem, but instead causes diminishing task performance and open-set performance. We establish a revised definition of the open-set problem for the age of VLMs, define a new benchmark and evaluation protocol to facilitate standardised evaluation and research in this important area, and evaluate promising baseline approaches based on predictive uncertainty and dedicated negative embeddings on a range of open-vocabulary VLM classifiers and object detectors.</p>

<p>Abstract: Information from neuroimaging examinations is increasingly used to support diagnoses of dementia, e.g., Alzheimer's disease. While current clinical practice is mainly based on visual inspection and feature engineering, Deep Learning approaches can be used to automate the analysis and to discover new image-biomarkers. Part-prototype neural networks (PP-NN) are an alternative to standard blackbox models, and have shown promising results in general computer vision. PP-NN's base their reasoning on prototypical image regions that are learned fully unsupervised, and combined with a simple-to-understand decision layer. We present PIPNet3D, a PP-NN for volumetric images. We apply PIPNet3D to the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease from structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (sMRI). We assess the quality of prototypes under a systematic evaluation framework, propose new functionally grounded metrics to evaluate brain prototypes and develop an evaluation scheme to assess their coherency with domain experts. Our results show that PIPNet3D is an interpretable, compact model for Alzheimer's diagnosis with its reasoning well aligned to medical domain knowledge. Notably, PIPNet3D achieves the same accuracy as its blackbox counterpart; and removing the remaining clinically irrelevant prototypes from its decision process does not decrease predictive performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shreyasi Pathak, J\"org Schl\"otterer, Jeroen Veltman, Jeroen Geerdink, Maurice van Keulen, Christin Seifert</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved high performance in medical applications, however, their adoption in clinical practice is hindered due to their black-box nature. Self-explainable models, like prototype-based models, can be especially beneficial as they are interpretable by design. However, if the learnt prototypes are of low quality then the prototype-based models are as good as black-box. Having high quality prototypes is a pre-requisite for a truly interpretable model. In this work, we propose a prototype evaluation framework for coherence (PEF-C) for quantitatively evaluating the quality of the prototypes based on domain knowledge. We show the use of PEF-C in the context of breast cancer prediction using mammography. Existing works on prototype-based models on breast cancer prediction using mammography have focused on improving the classification performance of prototype-based models compared to black-box models and have evaluated prototype quality through anecdotal evidence. We are the first to go beyond anecdotal evidence and evaluate the quality of the mammography prototypes systematically using our PEF-C. Specifically, we apply three state-of-the-art prototype-based models, ProtoPNet, BRAIxProtoPNet++ and PIP-Net on mammography images for breast cancer prediction and evaluate these models w.r.t. i) classification performance, and ii) quality of the prototypes, on three public datasets. Our results show that prototype-based models are competitive with black-box models in terms of classification performance, and achieve a higher score in detecting ROIs. However, the quality of the prototypes are not yet sufficient and can be improved in aspects of relevance, purity and learning a variety of prototypes. We call the XAI community to systematically evaluate the quality of the prototypes to check their true usability in high stake decisions and improve such models further.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yikang Zhou, Tao Zhang, Shunping Ji, Shuicheng Yan, Xiangtai Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern video segmentation methods adopt object queries to perform inter-frame association and demonstrate satisfactory performance in tracking continuously appearing objects despite large-scale motion and transient occlusion. However, they all underperform on newly emerging and disappearing objects that are common in the real world because they attempt to model object emergence and disappearance through feature transitions between background and foreground queries that have significant feature gaps. We introduce Dynamic Anchor Queries (DAQ) to shorten the transition gap between the anchor and target queries by dynamically generating anchor queries based on the features of potential candidates. Furthermore, we introduce a query-level object Emergence and Disappearance Simulation (EDS) strategy, which unleashes DAQ's potential without any additional cost. Finally, we combine our proposed DAQ and EDS with DVIS to obtain DVIS-DAQ. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DVIS-DAQ achieves a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on five mainstream video segmentation benchmarks.

<p>Abstract: Text-to-3D scene generation holds immense potential for the gaming, film, and architecture sectors. Despite significant progress, existing methods struggle with maintaining high quality, consistency, and editing flexibility. In this paper, we propose DreamScene, a 3D Gaussian-based novel text-to-3D scene generation framework, to tackle the aforementioned three challenges mainly via two strategies. First, DreamScene employs Formation Pattern Sampling (FPS), a multi-timestep sampling strategy guided by the formation patterns of 3D objects, to form fast, semantically rich, and high-quality representations. FPS uses 3D Gaussian filtering for optimization stability, and leverages reconstruction techniques to generate plausible textures. Second, DreamScene employs a progressive three-stage camera sampling strategy, specifically designed for both indoor and outdoor settings, to effectively ensure object-environment integration and scene-wide 3D consistency. Last, DreamScene enhances scene editing flexibility by integrating objects and environments, enabling targeted adjustments. Extensive experiments validate DreamScene's superiority over current state-of-the-art techniques, heralding its wide-ranging potential for diverse applications.

<p>Abstract: As 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) provides fast and high-quality novel view synthesis, it is a natural extension to deform a canonical 3DGS to multiple frames for representing a dynamic scene. However, previous works fail to accurately reconstruct complex dynamic scenes. We attribute the failure to the design of the deformation field, which is built as a coordinate-based function. This approach is problematic because 3DGS is a mixture of multiple fields centered at the Gaussians, not just a single coordinate-based framework. To resolve this problem, we define the deformation as a function of per-Gaussian embeddings and temporal embeddings. Moreover, we decompose deformations as coarse and fine deformations to model slow and fast movements, respectively. Also, we introduce a local smoothness regularization for per-Gaussian embedding to improve the details in dynamic regions. Project page: https://jeongminb.github.io/e-d3dgs/</p>

<p>Abstract: With the development of the large-scale diffusion model, Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) techniques are popular recently. However, how to truly make it serve our daily lives remains an open question. To this end, in this paper, we focus on employing AIGC techniques in one filed of E-commerce marketing, i.e., generating hyper-realistic advertising images for displaying user-specified shoes by human. Specifically, we propose a shoe-wearing system, called Shoe-Model, to generate plausible images of human legs interacting with the given shoes. It consists of three modules: (1) shoe wearable-area detection module (WD), (2) leg-pose synthesis module (LpS) and the final (3) shoe-wearing image generation module (SW). Them three are performed in ordered stages. Compared to baselines, our ShoeModel is shown to generalize better to different type of shoes and has ability of keeping the ID-consistency of the given shoes, as well as automatically producing reasonable interactions with human. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our proposed shoe-wearing system. Figure 1 shows the input and output examples of our ShoeModel.</p>

<p>Abstract: Our objective is to discover and localize monotonic temporal changes in a sequence of images. To achieve this, we exploit a simple proxy task of ordering a shuffled image sequence, with `time' serving as a supervisory signal, since only changes that are monotonic with time can give rise to the correct ordering. We also introduce a transformer-based model for ordering of image sequences of arbitrary length with built-in attribution maps. After training, the model successfully discovers and localizes monotonic changes while ignoring cyclic and stochastic ones. We demonstrate applications of the model in multiple domains covering different scene and object types, discovering both object-level and environmental changes in unseen sequences. We also demonstrate that the attention-based attribution maps function as effective prompts for segmenting the changing regions, and that the learned representations can be used for downstream applications. Finally, we show that the model achieves the state-of-the-art on standard benchmarks for image ordering.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maximilian Bernhard, Tanveer Hannan, Niklas Strau{\ss}, Matthias Schubert</p>
<p>Abstract: Remote sensing projects typically generate large amounts of imagery that can be used to train powerful deep neural networks. However, the amount of labeled images is often small, as remote sensing applications generally require expert labelers. Thus, semi-supervised learning (SSL), i.e., learning with a small pool of labeled and a larger pool of unlabeled data, is particularly useful in this domain. Current SSL approaches generate pseudo-labels from model predictions for unlabeled samples. As the quality of these pseudo-labels is crucial for performance, utilizing additional information to improve pseudo-label quality yields a promising direction. For remote sensing images, geolocation and recording time are generally available and provide a valuable source of information as semantic concepts, such as land cover, are highly dependent on spatiotemporal context, e.g., due to seasonal effects and vegetation zones. In this paper, we propose to exploit spatiotemporal metainformation in SSL to improve the quality of pseudo-labels and, therefore, the final model performance. We show that directly adding the available metadata to the input of the predictor at test time degenerates the prediction quality for metadata outside the spatiotemporal distribution of the training set. Thus, we propose a teacher-student SSL framework where only the teacher network uses metainformation to improve the quality of pseudo-labels on the training set. Correspondingly, our student network benefits from the improved pseudo-labels but does not receive metadata as input, making it invariant to spatiotemporal shifts at test time. Furthermore, we propose methods for encoding and injecting spatiotemporal information into the model and introduce a novel distillation mechanism to enhance the knowledge transfer between teacher and student. Our framework dubbed Spatiotemporal SSL can be easily combined with several stat...</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sheng Jin, Ruijie Yao, Lumin Xu, Wentao Liu, Chen Qian, Ji Wu, Ping Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Instance perception tasks (object detection, instance segmentation, pose estimation, counting) play a key role in industrial applications of visual models. As supervised learning methods suffer from high labeling cost, few-shot learning methods which effectively learn from a limited number of labeled examples are desired. Existing few-shot learning methods primarily focus on a restricted set of tasks, presumably due to the challenges involved in designing a generic model capable of representing diverse tasks in a unified manner. In this paper, we propose UniFS, a universal few-shot instance perception model that unifies a wide range of instance perception tasks by reformulating them into a dynamic point representation learning framework. Additionally, we propose Structure-Aware Point Learning (SAPL) to exploit the higher-order structural relationship among points to further enhance representation learning. Our approach makes minimal assumptions about the tasks, yet it achieves competitive results compared to highly specialized and well optimized specialist models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simon Weber, Je Hyeong Hong, Daniel Cremers</p>
<p>Abstract: Most Bundle Adjustment (BA) solvers like the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm require a good initialization. Instead, initialization-free BA remains a largely uncharted territory. The under-explored Variable Projection algorithm (VarPro) exhibits a wide convergence basin even without initialization. Coupled with object space error formulation, recent works have shown its ability to solve small-scale initialization-free bundle adjustment problem. To make such initialization-free BA approaches scalable, we introduce Power Variable Projection (PoVar), extending a recent inverse expansion method based on power series. Importantly, we link the power series expansion to Riemannian manifold optimization. This projective framework is crucial to solve large-scale bundle adjustment problems without initialization. Using the real-world BAL dataset, we experimentally demonstrate that our solver achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of speed and accuracy. To our knowledge, this work is the first to address the scalability of BA without initialization opening new venues for initialization-free structure-from-motion.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shenyuan Gao, Jiazhi Yang, Li Chen, Kashyap Chitta, Yihang Qiu, Andreas Geiger, Jun Zhang, Hongyang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: World models can foresee the outcomes of different actions, which is of paramount importance for autonomous driving. Nevertheless, existing driving world models still have limitations in generalization to unseen environments, prediction fidelity of critical details, and action controllability for flexible application. In this paper, we present Vista, a generalizable driving world model with high fidelity and versatile controllability. Based on a systematic diagnosis of existing methods, we introduce several key ingredients to address these limitations. To accurately predict real-world dynamics at high resolution, we propose two novel losses to promote the learning of moving instances and structural information. We also devise an effective latent replacement approach to inject historical frames as priors for coherent long-horizon rollouts. For action controllability, we incorporate a versatile set of controls from high-level intentions (command, goal point) to low-level maneuvers (trajectory, angle, and speed) through an efficient learning strategy. After large-scale training, the capabilities of Vista can seamlessly generalize to different scenarios. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets show that Vista outperforms the most advanced general-purpose video generator in over 70% of comparisons and surpasses the best-performing driving world model by 55% in FID and 27% in FVD. Moreover, for the first time, we utilize the capacity of Vista itself to establish a generalizable reward for real-world action evaluation without accessing the ground truth actions.</p>

<p>Abstract: A lot of effort is currently invested in safeguarding autonomous driving systems, which heavily rely on deep neural networks for computer vision. We investigate the coupling of different neural network calibration measures with a special focus on the Area Under the Sparsification Error curve (AUSE) metric. We elaborate on the well-known inconsistency in determining optimal calibration using the Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and we demonstrate similar issues for the AUSE, the Uncertainty Calibration Score (UCS), as well as the Uncertainty Calibration Error (UCE). We conclude that the current methodologies leave a degree of freedom, which prevents a unique model calibration for the homologation of safety-critical functionalities. Furthermore, we propose the AUSE as an indirect measure for the residual uncertainty, which is irreducible for a fixed network architecture and is driven by the stochasticity in the underlying data generation process (aleatoric contribution) as well as the limitation in the hypothesis space (epistemic contribution).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen Ma, Ningfei Wang, Zhengyu Zhao, Qi Alfred Chen, Chao Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous Driving (AD) systems critically depend on visual perception for real-time object detection and multiple object tracking (MOT) to ensure safe driving. However, high latency in these visual perception components can lead to significant safety risks, such as vehicle collisions. While previous research has extensively explored latency attacks within the digital realm, translating these methods effectively to the physical world presents challenges. For instance, existing attacks rely on perturbations that are unrealistic or impractical for AD, such as adversarial perturbations affecting areas like the sky, or requiring large patches that obscure most of a camera's view, thus making them impossible to be conducted effectively in the real world.
  In this paper, we introduce SlowPerception, the first physical-world latency attack against AD perception, via generating projector-based universal perturbations. SlowPerception strategically creates numerous phantom objects on various surfaces in the environment, significantly increasing the computational load of Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) and MOT, thereby inducing substantial latency. Our SlowPerception achieves second-level latency in physical-world settings, with an average latency of 2.5 seconds across different AD perception systems, scenarios, and hardware configurations. This performance significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art latency attacks. Additionally, we conduct AD system-level impact assessments, such as vehicle collisions, using industry-grade AD systems with production-grade AD simulators with a 97% average rate. We hope that our analyses can inspire further research in this critical domain, enhancing the robustness of AD systems against emerging vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>Abstract: Surgical scene perception via videos is critical for advancing robotic surgery, telesurgery, and AI-assisted surgery, particularly in ophthalmology. However, the scarcity of diverse and richly annotated video datasets has hindered the development of intelligent systems for surgical workflow analysis. Existing datasets face challenges such as small scale, lack of diversity in surgery and phase categories, and absence of time-localized annotations. These limitations impede action understanding and model generalization validation in complex and diverse real-world surgical scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce OphNet, a large-scale, expert-annotated video benchmark for ophthalmic surgical workflow understanding. OphNet features: 1) A diverse collection of 2,278 surgical videos spanning 66 types of cataract, glaucoma, and corneal surgeries, with detailed annotations for 102 unique surgical phases and 150 fine-grained operations. 2) Sequential and hierarchical annotations for each surgery, phase, and operation, enabling comprehensive understanding and improved interpretability. 3) Time-localized annotations, facilitating temporal localization and prediction tasks within surgical workflows. With approximately 285 hours of surgical videos, OphNet is about 20 times larger than the largest existing surgical workflow analysis benchmark.

<p>Abstract: The complex structure of the heart leads to significant challenges in echocardiography, especially in acquisition cardiac ultrasound images. Successful echocardiography requires a thorough understanding of the structures on the two-dimensional plane and the spatial relationships between planes in three-dimensional space. In this paper, we innovatively propose a large-scale self-supervised pre-training method to acquire a cardiac structure-aware world model. The core innovation lies in constructing a self-supervised task that requires structural inference by predicting masked structures on a 2D plane and imagining another plane based on pose transformation in 3D space. To support large-scale pre-training, we collected over 1.36 million echocardiograms from ten standard views, along with their 3D spatial poses. In the downstream probe guidance task, we demonstrate that our pre-trained model consistently reduces guidance errors across the ten most common standard views on the test set with 0.29 million samples from 74 routine clinical scans, indicating that structure-aware pre-training benefits the scanning.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a method for zero-shot video restoration using pre-trained image restoration diffusion models. Traditional video restoration methods often need retraining for different settings and struggle with limited generalization across various degradation types and datasets. Our approach uses a hierarchical token merging strategy for keyframes and local frames, combined with a hybrid correspondence mechanism that blends optical flow and feature-based nearest neighbor matching (latent merging). We show that our method not only achieves top performance in zero-shot video restoration but also significantly surpasses trained models in generalization across diverse datasets and extreme degradations (8$\times$ super-resolution and high-standard deviation video denoising). We present evidence through quantitative metrics and visual comparisons on various challenging datasets. Additionally, our technique works with any 2D restoration diffusion model, offering a versatile and powerful tool for video enhancement tasks without extensive retraining. This research leads to more efficient and widely applicable video restoration technologies, supporting advancements in fields that require high-quality video output.

<p>Abstract: We present GSD, a diffusion model approach based on Gaussian Splatting (GS) representation for 3D object reconstruction from a single view. Prior works suffer from inconsistent 3D geometry or mediocre rendering quality due to improper representations. We take a step towards resolving these shortcomings by utilizing the recent state-of-the-art 3D explicit representation, Gaussian Splatting, and an unconditional diffusion model. This model learns to generate 3D objects represented by sets of GS ellipsoids. With these strong generative 3D priors, though learning unconditionally, the diffusion model is ready for view-guided reconstruction without further model fine-tuning. This is achieved by propagating fine-grained 2D features through the efficient yet flexible splatting function and the guided denoising sampling process. In addition, a 2D diffusion model is further employed to enhance rendering fidelity, and improve reconstructed GS quality by polishing and re-using the rendered images. The final reconstructed objects explicitly come with high-quality 3D structure and texture, and can be efficiently rendered in arbitrary views. Experiments on the challenging real-world CO3D dataset demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Project page: $\href{https://yxmu.foo/GSD/}{\text{this https URL}}$</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose Image Content Appeal Assessment (ICAA), a novel metric that quantifies the level of positive interest an image's content generates for viewers, such as the appeal of food in a photograph. This is fundamentally different from traditional Image-Aesthetics Assessment (IAA), which judges an image's artistic quality. While previous studies often confuse the concepts of ``aesthetics'' and ``appeal,'' our work addresses this by being the first to study ICAA explicitly. To do this, we propose a novel system that automates dataset creation and implements algorithms to estimate and boost content appeal. We use our pipeline to generate two large-scale datasets (70K+ images each) in diverse domains (food and room interior design) to train our models, which revealed little correlation between content appeal and aesthetics. Our user study, with more than 76% of participants preferring the appeal-enhanced images, confirms that our appeal ratings accurately reflect user preferences, establishing ICAA as a unique evaluative criterion.

<p>Abstract: Compositional actions consist of dynamic (verbs) and static (objects) concepts. Humans can easily recognize unseen compositions using the learned concepts. For machines, solving such a problem requires a model to recognize unseen actions composed of previously observed verbs and objects, thus requiring so-called compositional generalization ability. To facilitate this research, we propose a novel Zero-Shot Compositional Action Recognition (ZS-CAR) task. For evaluating the task, we construct a new benchmark, Something-composition (Sth-com), based on the widely used Something-Something V2 dataset. We also propose a novel Component-to-Composition (C2C) learning method to solve the new ZS-CAR task. C2C includes an independent component learning module and a composition inference module. Last, we devise an enhanced training strategy to address the challenges of component variations between seen and unseen compositions and to handle the subtle balance between learning seen and unseen actions. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly surpasses the existing compositional generalization methods and sets a new state-of-the-art.

<p>Abstract: Deep learning-based models are widely deployed in autonomous driving areas, especially the increasingly noticed end-to-end solutions. However, the black-box property of these models raises concerns about their trustworthiness and safety for autonomous driving, and how to debug the causality has become a pressing concern. Despite some existing research on the explainability of autonomous driving, there is currently no systematic solution to help researchers debug and identify the key factors that lead to the final predicted action of end-to-end autonomous driving. In this work, we propose a comprehensive approach to explore and analyze the causality of end-to-end autonomous driving. First, we validate the essential information that the final planning depends on by using controlled variables and counterfactual interventions for qualitative analysis. Then, we quantitatively assess the factors influencing model decisions by visualizing and statistically analyzing the response of key model inputs. Finally, based on the comprehensive study of the multi-factorial end-to-end autonomous driving system, we have developed a strong baseline and a tool for exploring causality in the close-loop simulator CARLA. It leverages the essential input sources to obtain a well-designed model, resulting in highly competitive capabilities. As far as we know, our work is the first to unveil the mystery of end-to-end autonomous driving and turn the black box into a white one. Thorough close-loop experiments demonstrate that our method can be applied to end-to-end autonomous driving solutions for causality debugging.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuyuan Liu, Yuanhong Chen, Hu Wang, Vasileios Belagiannis, Ian Reid, Gustavo Carneiro</p>
<p>Abstract: The costly and time-consuming annotation process to produce large training sets for modelling semantic LiDAR segmentation methods has motivated the development of semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods. However, such SSL approaches often concentrate on employing consistency learning only for individual LiDAR representations. This narrow focus results in limited perturbations that generally fail to enable effective consistency learning. Additionally, these SSL approaches employ contrastive learning based on the sampling from a limited set of positive and negative embedding samples. This paper introduces a novel semi-supervised LiDAR semantic segmentation framework called ItTakesTwo (IT2). IT2 is designed to ensure consistent predictions from peer LiDAR representations, thereby improving the perturbation effectiveness in consistency learning. Furthermore, our contrastive learning employs informative samples drawn from a distribution of positive and negative embeddings learned from the entire training set. Results on public benchmarks show that our approach achieves remarkable improvements over the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in the field.

<p>Abstract: Existing WSI analysis methods lie on the consensus that histopathological characteristics of tumors are significant guidance for cancer diagnostics. Particularly, as the evolution of cancers is a continuous process, the correlations and differences across various stages, anatomical locations and patients should be taken into account. However, recent research mainly focuses on the inner-contextual information in a single WSI, ignoring the correlations between slides. To verify whether introducing the slide inter-correlations can bring improvements to WSI representation learning, we propose a generic WSI analysis pipeline SlideGCD that considers the existing multi-instance learning (MIL) methods as the backbone and forge the WSI classification task as a node classification problem. More specifically, SlideGCD declares a node buffer that stores previous slide embeddings for subsequent extensive slide-based graph construction and conducts graph learning to explore the inter-correlations implied in the slide-based graph. Moreover, we frame the MIL classifier and graph learning into two parallel workflows and deploy the knowledge distillation to transfer the differentiable information to the graph neural network. The consistent performance boosting, brought by SlideGCD, of four previous state-of-the-art MIL methods is observed on two TCGA benchmark datasets.

<p>Abstract: Frequency domain representation of time series feature offers a concise representation for handling real-world time series data with inherent complexity and dynamic nature. However, current frequency-based methods with complex operations still fall short of state-of-the-art time domain methods for general time series analysis. In this work, we present Omni-Dimensional Frequency Learner (ODFL) model based on a in depth analysis among all the three aspects of the spectrum feature: channel redundancy property among the frequency dimension, the sparse and un-salient frequency energy distribution among the frequency dimension, and the semantic diversity among the variable dimension. Technically, our method is composed of a semantic-adaptive global filter with attention to the un-salient frequency bands and partial operation among the channel dimension. Empirical results show that ODFL achieves consistent state-of-the-art in five mainstream time series analysis tasks, including short- and long-term forecasting, imputation, classification, and anomaly detection, offering a promising foundation for time series analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guanghua He, Wangang Cheng, Hancan Zhu, Gaohang Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: The hippocampus is a crucial brain structure associated with various psychiatric disorders, and its automatic and precise segmentation is essential for studying these diseases. In recent years, deep learning-based methods have made significant progress in hippocampus segmentation. However, training deep neural network models requires substantial computational resources and time, as well as a large amount of labeled training data, which is often difficult to obtain in medical image segmentation. To address this issue, we propose a new parameter-efficient fine-tuning method called LoRA-PT. This method transfers the pre-trained UNETR model on the BraTS2021 dataset to the hippocampus segmentation task. Specifically, the LoRA-PT method categorizes the parameter matrix of the transformer structure into three sizes, forming three 3D tensors. Through tensor singular value decomposition, these tensors are decomposed to generate low-rank tensors with the principal singular values and singular vectors, while the remaining singular values and vectors form the residual tensor. During the fine-tuning, we only update the low-rank tensors, i.e. the principal tensor singular values and vectors, while keeping the residual tensor unchanged. We validated the proposed method on three public hippocampus datasets. Experimental results show that LoRA-PT outperforms existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods in segmentation accuracy while significantly reducing the number of parameter updates.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihang Chen, Tsai Hor Chan, Guosheng Yin, Yuming Jiang, Lequan Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) has been extensively applied to whole slide histopathology image (WSI) analysis. The existing aggregation strategy in MIL, which primarily relies on the first-order distance (e.g., mean difference) between instances, fails to accurately approximate the true feature distribution of each instance, leading to biased slide-level representations. Moreover, the scarcity of WSI observations easily leads to model overfitting, resulting in unstable testing performance and limited generalizability. To tackle these challenges, we propose a new Bayesian nonparametric framework for multiple instance learning, which adopts a cascade of Dirichlet processes (cDP) to incorporate the instance-to-bag characteristic of the WSIs. We perform feature aggregation based on the latent clusters formed by the Dirichlet process, which incorporates the covariances of the patch features and forms more representative clusters. We then perform bag-level prediction with another Dirichlet process model on the bags, which imposes a natural regularization on learning to prevent overfitting and enhance generalizability. Moreover, as a Bayesian nonparametric method, the cDP model can accurately generate posterior uncertainty, which allows for the detection of outlier samples and tumor localization. Extensive experiments on five WSI benchmarks validate the superior performance of our method, as well as its generalizability and ability to estimate uncertainties.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhi Cai, Yingjie Gao, Yaoyan Zheng, Nan Zhou, Di Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: In computer vision, object detection is an important task that finds its application in many scenarios. However, obtaining extensive labels can be challenging, especially in crowded scenes. Recently, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has been proposed as a powerful zero-shot segmenter, offering a novel approach to instance segmentation tasks. However, the accuracy and efficiency of SAM and its variants are often compromised when handling objects in crowded and occluded scenes. In this paper, we introduce Crowd-SAM, a SAM-based framework designed to enhance SAM's performance in crowded and occluded scenes with the cost of few learnable parameters and minimal labeled images. We introduce an efficient prompt sampler (EPS) and a part-whole discrimination network (PWD-Net), enhancing mask selection and accuracy in crowded scenes. Despite its simplicity, Crowd-SAM rivals state-of-the-art (SOTA) fully-supervised object detection methods on several benchmarks including CrowdHuman and CityPersons.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikolaos Giakoumoglou, Tania Stathaki</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective method for transferring knowledge from a large, well-trained teacher model to a smaller, more efficient student model. Despite its success, one of the main challenges in KD is ensuring the efficient transfer of complex knowledge while maintaining the student's computational efficiency. Unlike previous works that applied contrastive objectives promoting explicit negative instances, we introduce Relational Representation Distillation (RRD). Our approach leverages pairwise similarities to explore and reinforce the relationships between the teacher and student models. Inspired by self-supervised learning principles, it uses a relaxed contrastive loss that focuses on similarity rather than exact replication. This method aligns the output distributions of teacher samples in a large memory buffer, improving the robustness and performance of the student model without the need for strict negative instance differentiation. Our approach demonstrates superior performance on CIFAR-100, outperforming traditional KD techniques and surpassing 13 state-of-the-art methods. It also transfers successfully to other datasets like Tiny ImageNet and STL-10. The code will be made public soon.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhongyang Ren, Bangyan Liao, Delei Kong, Jinghang Li, Peidong Liu, Laurent Kneip, Guillermo Gallego, Yi Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Recovering the camera motion and scene geometry from visual data is a fundamental problem in the field of computer vision. Its success in standard vision is attributed to the maturity of feature extraction, data association and multi-view geometry. The recent emergence of neuromorphic event-based cameras places great demands on approaches that use raw event data as input to solve this fundamental problem.Existing state-of-the-art solutions typically infer implicitly data association by iteratively reversing the event data generation process. However, the nonlinear nature of these methods limits their applicability in real-time tasks, and the constant-motion assumption leads to unstable results under agile motion. To this end, we rethink the problem formulation in a way that aligns better with the differential working principle of event cameras.We show that the event-based normal flow can be used, via the proposed geometric error term, as an alternative to the full flow in solving a family of geometric problems that involve instantaneous first-order kinematics and scene geometry. Furthermore, we develop a fast linear solver and a continuous-time nonlinear solver on top of the proposed geometric error term.Experiments on both synthetic and real data show the superiority of our linear solver in terms of accuracy and efficiency, and indicate its complementary feature as an initialization method for existing nonlinear solvers. Besides, our continuous-time non-linear solver exhibits exceptional capability in accommodating sudden variations in motion since it does not rely on the constant-motion assumption.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ming-Feng Li, Yueh-Feng Ku, Hong-Xuan Yen, Chi Liu, Yu-Lun Liu, Albert Y. C. Chen, Cheng-Hao Kuo, Min Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Sparse RGBD scene completion is a challenging task especially when considering consistent textures and geometries throughout the entire scene. Different from existing solutions that rely on human-designed text prompts or predefined camera trajectories, we propose GenRC, an automated training-free pipeline to complete a room-scale 3D mesh with high-fidelity textures. To achieve this, we first project the sparse RGBD images to a highly incomplete 3D mesh. Instead of iteratively generating novel views to fill in the void, we utilized our proposed E-Diffusion to generate a view-consistent panoramic RGBD image which ensures global geometry and appearance consistency. Furthermore, we maintain the input-output scene stylistic consistency through textual inversion to replace human-designed text prompts. To bridge the domain gap among datasets, E-Diffusion leverages models trained on large-scale datasets to generate diverse appearances. GenRC outperforms state-of-the-art methods under most appearance and geometric metrics on ScanNet and ARKitScenes datasets, even though GenRC is not trained on these datasets nor using predefined camera trajectories.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyuan Ma, Guoli Jia, Biqing Qi, Bowen Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, stable diffusion (SD) models have typically flourished in the field of image synthesis and personalized editing, with a range of photorealistic and unprecedented images being successfully generated. As a result, widespread interest has been ignited to develop and use various SD-based tools for visual content creation. However, the exposure of AI-created content on public platforms could raise both legal and ethical risks. In this regard, the traditional methods of adding watermarks to the already generated images (i.e. post-processing) may face a dilemma (e.g., being erased or modified) in terms of copyright protection and content monitoring, since the powerful image inversion and text-to-image editing techniques have been widely explored in SD-based methods. In this work, we propose a Safe and high-traceable Stable Diffusion framework (namely Safe-SD) to adaptively implant the graphical watermarks (e.g., QR code) into the imperceptible structure-related pixels during the generative diffusion process for supporting text-driven invisible watermarking and detection. Different from the previous high-cost injection-then-detection training framework, we design a simple and unified architecture, which makes it possible to simultaneously train watermark injection and detection in a single network, greatly improving the efficiency and convenience of use. Moreover, to further support text-driven generative watermarking and deeply explore its robustness and high-traceability, we elaborately design lambda sampling and encryption algorithm to fine-tune a latent diffuser wrapped by a VAE for balancing high-fidelity image synthesis and high-traceable watermark detection. We present our quantitative and qualitative results on two representative datasets LSUN, COCO and FFHQ, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance of Safe-SD and showing it significantly outperforms the previous approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sehwan Choi, Jungho Kim, Hongjae Shin, Jun Won Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Mask2Map, a novel end-to-end online HD map construction method designed for autonomous driving applications. Our approach focuses on predicting the class and ordered point set of map instances within a scene, represented in the bird's eye view (BEV). Mask2Map consists of two primary components: the Instance-Level Mask Prediction Network (IMPNet) and the Mask-Driven Map Prediction Network (MMPNet). IMPNet generates Mask-Aware Queries and BEV Segmentation Masks to capture comprehensive semantic information globally. Subsequently, MMPNet enhances these query features using local contextual information through two submodules: the Positional Query Generator (PQG) and the Geometric Feature Extractor (GFE). PQG extracts instance-level positional queries by embedding BEV positional information into Mask-Aware Queries, while GFE utilizes BEV Segmentation Masks to generate point-level geometric features. However, we observed limited performance in Mask2Map due to inter-network inconsistency stemming from different predictions to Ground Truth (GT) matching between IMPNet and MMPNet. To tackle this challenge, we propose the Inter-network Denoising Training method, which guides the model to denoise the output affected by both noisy GT queries and perturbed GT Segmentation Masks. Our evaluation conducted on nuScenes and Argoverse2 benchmarks demonstrates that Mask2Map achieves remarkable performance improvements over previous state-of-the-art methods, with gains of 10.1% mAP and 4.1 mAP, respectively.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bangyan Liao, Zhenjun Zhao, Lu Chen, Haoang Li, Daniel Cremers, Peidong Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Plane adjustment (PA) is crucial for many 3D applications, involving simultaneous pose estimation and plane recovery. Despite recent advancements, it remains a challenging problem in the realm of multi-view point cloud registration. Current state-of-the-art methods can achieve globally optimal convergence only with good initialization. Furthermore, their high time complexity renders them impractical for large-scale problems. To address these challenges, we first exploit a novel optimization strategy termed \textit{Bi-Convex Relaxation}, which decouples the original problem into two simpler sub-problems, reformulates each sub-problem using a convex relaxation technique, and alternately solves each one until the original problem converges. Building on this strategy, we propose two algorithmic variants for solving the plane adjustment problem, namely \textit{GlobalPointer} and \textit{GlobalPointer++}, based on point-to-plane and plane-to-plane errors, respectively. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our method can perform large-scale plane adjustment with linear time complexity, larger convergence region, and robustness to poor initialization, while achieving similar accuracy as prior methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiao Li, Sheng Liu, Jinxin Zhou, Xinyu Lu, Carlos Fernandez-Granda, Zhihui Zhu, Qing Qu</p>
<p>Abstract: With the ever-increasing complexity of large-scale pre-trained models coupled with a shortage of labeled data for downstream training, transfer learning has become the primary approach in many fields, including natural language processing, computer vision, and multi-modal learning. Despite recent progress, the fine-tuning process for large-scale pre-trained models in vision still mostly relies on trial and error. This work investigates the relationship between neural collapse (NC) and transfer learning for classification problems. NC is an intriguing while prevalent phenomenon that has been recently discovered in terms of the final-layer features and linear classifiers of trained neural networks. Specifically, during the terminal phase of training, NC implies that the variability of the features within each class diminishes to zero, while the means of features between classes are maximally and equally distanced. In this work, we examine the NC attributes of pre-trained models on both downstream and source data for transfer learning, and we find strong correlation between feature collapse and downstream performance. In particular, we discovered a systematic pattern that emerges when linear probing pre-trained models on downstream training data: the more feature collapse of pre-trained models on downstream training data, the higher the transfer accuracy. Additionally, we also studied the relationship between NC and transfer accuracy on the source data. Moreover, these findings allow us to develop a principled, parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that employs skip-connection to induce the last-layer feature collapse on downstream data. Our proposed fine-tuning methods deliver good performances while reducing fine-tuning parameters by at least 90% and mitigating overfitting in situations especially when the downstream data is scarce.</p>

<p>Abstract: Machine learning models experience deteriorated performance when trained in the presence of noisy labels. This is particularly problematic for medical tasks, such as survival prediction, which typically face high label noise complexity with few clear-cut solutions. Inspired by the large fluctuations across folds in the cross-validation performance of survival analyses, we design Monte-Carlo experiments to show that such fluctuation could be caused by label noise. We propose two novel and straightforward label noise detection algorithms that effectively identify noisy examples by pinpointing the samples that more frequently contribute to inferior cross-validation results. We first introduce Repeated Cross-Validation (ReCoV), a parameter-free label noise detection algorithm that is robust to model choice. We further develop fastReCoV, a less robust but more tractable and efficient variant of ReCoV suitable for deep learning applications. Through extensive experiments, we show that ReCoV and fastReCoV achieve state-of-the-art label noise detection performance in a wide range of modalities, models and tasks, including survival analysis, which has yet to be addressed in the literature.

<p>Abstract: Coronary Artery Diseases (CADs) although preventable, are one of the leading causes of death and disability. Diagnosis of these diseases is often difficult and resource intensive. Angiographic imaging segmentation of the arteries has evolved as a tool of assistance that helps clinicians make an accurate diagnosis. However, due to the limited amount of data and the difficulty in curating a dataset, the task of segmentation has proven challenging. In this study, we introduce the use of pseudo-labels to address the issue of limited data in the angiographic dataset to enhance the performance of the baseline YOLO model. Unlike existing data augmentation techniques that improve the model constrained to a fixed dataset, we introduce the use of pseudo-labels generated on a dataset of separate related task to diversify and improve model performance. This method increases the baseline F1 score by 9% in the validation data set and by 3% in the test data set.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Takahiro Maeda, Keisuke Takeshita, Norimichi Ukita, Kazuhito Tanaka</p>
<p>Abstract: For physical human-robot interactions (pHRI), a robot needs to estimate the accurate body pose of a target person. However, in these pHRI scenarios, the robot cannot fully observe the target person's body with equipped cameras because the target person must be close to the robot for physical interaction. This close distance leads to severe truncation and occlusions and thus results in poor accuracy of human pose estimation. For better accuracy in this challenging environment, we propose an active measurement and sensor fusion framework of the equipped cameras with touch and ranging sensors such as 2D LiDAR. Touch and ranging sensor measurements are sparse but reliable and informative cues for localizing human body parts. In our active measurement process, camera viewpoints and sensor placements are dynamically optimized to measure body parts with higher estimation uncertainty, which is closely related to truncation or occlusion. In our sensor fusion process, assuming that the measurements of touch and ranging sensors are more reliable than the camera-based estimations, we fuse the sensor measurements to the camera-based estimated pose by aligning the estimated pose towards the measured points. Our proposed method outperformed previous methods on the standard occlusion benchmark with simulated active measurement. Furthermore, our method reliably estimated human poses using a real robot, even with practical constraints such as occlusion by blankets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yilin Liu, Yunkui Pang, Jiang Li, Yong Chen, Pew-Thian Yap</p>
<p>Abstract: Untrained networks inspired by deep image priors have shown promising capabilities in recovering high-quality images from noisy or partial measurements without requiring training sets. Their success is widely attributed to implicit regularization due to the spectral bias of suitable network architectures. However, the application of such network-based priors often entails superfluous architectural decisions, risks of overfitting, and lengthy optimization processes, all of which hinder their practicality. To address these challenges, we propose efficient architecture-agnostic techniques to directly modulate the spectral bias of network priors: 1) bandwidth-constrained input, 2) bandwidth-controllable upsamplers, and 3) Lipschitz-regularized convolutional layers. We show that, with just a few lines of code, we can reduce overfitting in underperforming architectures and close performance gaps with high-performing counterparts, minimizing the need for extensive architecture tuning. This makes it possible to employ a more compact model to achieve performance similar or superior to larger models while reducing runtime. Demonstrated on inpainting-like MRI reconstruction task, our results signify for the first time that architectural biases, overfitting, and runtime issues of untrained network priors can be simultaneously addressed without architectural modifications. Our code is publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikhil Parthasarathy, Olivier J. H\'enaff, Eero P. Simoncelli</p>
<p>Abstract: Human ability to recognize complex visual patterns arises through transformations performed by successive areas in the ventral visual cortex. Deep neural networks trained end-to-end for object recognition approach human capabilities, and offer the best descriptions to date of neural responses in the late stages of the hierarchy. But these networks provide a poor account of the early stages, compared to traditional hand-engineered models, or models optimized for coding efficiency or prediction. Moreover, the gradient backpropagation used in end-to-end learning is generally considered to be biologically implausible. Here, we overcome both of these limitations by developing a bottom-up self-supervised training methodology that operates independently on successive layers. Specifically, we maximize feature similarity between pairs of locally-deformed natural image patches, while decorrelating features across patches sampled from other images. Crucially, the deformation amplitudes are adjusted proportionally to receptive field sizes in each layer, thus matching the task complexity to the capacity at each stage of processing. In comparison with architecture-matched versions of previous models, we demonstrate that our layerwise complexity-matched learning (LCL) formulation produces a two-stage model (LCL-V2) that is better aligned with selectivity properties and neural activity in primate area V2. We demonstrate that the complexity-matched learning paradigm is responsible for much of the emergence of the improved biological alignment. Finally, when the two-stage model is used as a fixed front-end for a deep network trained to perform object recognition, the resultant model (LCL-V2Net) is significantly better than standard end-to-end self-supervised, supervised, and adversarially-trained models in terms of generalization to out-of-distribution tasks and alignment with human behavior.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zheng Zhou, Hongbo Zhao, Ju Liu, Qiaosheng Zhang, Liwei Geng, Shuchang Lyu, Wenquan Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies have shown that Adversarial Patches (APs) can effectively manipulate object detection models. However, the conspicuous patterns often associated with these patches tend to attract human attention, posing a significant challenge. Existing research has primarily focused on enhancing attack efficacy in the physical domain while often neglecting the optimization of stealthiness and transferability. Furthermore, applying APs in real-world scenarios faces major challenges related to transferability, stealthiness, and practicality. To address these challenges, we introduce generalization theory into the context of APs, enabling our iterative process to simultaneously enhance transferability and refine visual correlation with realistic images. We propose a Dual-Perception-Based Framework (DPBF) to generate the More Vivid Patch (MVPatch), which enhances transferability, stealthiness, and practicality. The DPBF integrates two key components: the Model-Perception-Based Module (MPBM) and the Human-Perception-Based Module (HPBM), along with regularization terms. The MPBM employs ensemble strategy to reduce object confidence scores across multiple detectors, thereby improving AP transferability with robust theoretical support. Concurrently, the HPBM introduces a lightweight method for achieving visual similarity, creating natural and inconspicuous adversarial patches without relying on additional generative models. The regularization terms further enhance the practicality of the generated APs in the physical domain. Additionally, we introduce naturalness and transferability scores to provide an unbiased assessment of APs. Extensive experimental validation demonstrates that MVPatch achieves superior transferability and a natural appearance in both digital and physical domains, underscoring its effectiveness and stealthiness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Paul Friedrich, Julia Wolleb, Florentin Bieder, Alicia Durrer, Philippe C. Cattin</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to the three-dimensional nature of CT- or MR-scans, generative modeling of medical images is a particularly challenging task. Existing approaches mostly apply patch-wise, slice-wise, or cascaded generation techniques to fit the high-dimensional data into the limited GPU memory. However, these approaches may introduce artifacts and potentially restrict the model's applicability for certain downstream tasks. This work presents WDM, a wavelet-based medical image synthesis framework that applies a diffusion model on wavelet decomposed images. The presented approach is a simple yet effective way of scaling 3D diffusion models to high resolutions and can be trained on a single \SI{40}{\giga\byte} GPU. Experimental results on BraTS and LIDC-IDRI unconditional image generation at a resolution of $128 \times 128 \times 128$ demonstrate state-of-the-art image fidelity (FID) and sample diversity (MS-SSIM) scores compared to recent GANs, Diffusion Models, and Latent Diffusion Models. Our proposed method is the only one capable of generating high-quality images at a resolution of $256 \times 256 \times 256$, outperforming all comparing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> R\'emi Nahon, Ivan Luiz De Moura Matos, Van-Tam Nguyen, Enzo Tartaglione</p>
<p>Abstract: Nowadays an ever-growing concerning phenomenon, the emergence of algorithmic biases that can lead to unfair models, emerges. Several debiasing approaches have been proposed in the realm of deep learning, employing more or less sophisticated approaches to discourage these models from massively employing these biases. However, a question emerges: is this extra complexity really necessary? Is a vanilla-trained model already embodying some ``unbiased sub-networks'' that can be used in isolation and propose a solution without relying on the algorithmic biases? In this work, we show that such a sub-network typically exists, and can be extracted from a vanilla-trained model without requiring additional training. We further validate that such specific architecture is incapable of learning a specific bias, suggesting that there are possible architectural countermeasures to the problem of biases in deep neural networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenhe Du, Xiyue Lin, Qing Wu, Xuanyu Tian, Ying Su, Zhe Luo, Rui Zheng, Yang Chen, Hongjiang Wei, S. Kevin Zhou, Jingyi Yu, Yuyao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Limited-angle and sparse-view computed tomography (LACT and SVCT) are crucial for expanding the scope of X-ray CT applications. However, they face challenges due to incomplete data acquisition, resulting in diverse artifacts in the reconstructed CT images. Emerging implicit neural representation (INR) techniques, such as NeRF, NeAT, and NeRP, have shown promise in under-determined CT imaging reconstruction tasks. However, the unsupervised nature of INR architecture imposes limited constraints on the solution space, particularly for the highly ill-posed reconstruction task posed by LACT and ultra-SVCT. In this study, we introduce the Diffusion Prior Driven Neural Representation (DPER), an advanced unsupervised framework designed to address the exceptionally ill-posed CT reconstruction inverse problems. DPER adopts the Half Quadratic Splitting (HQS) algorithm to decompose the inverse problem into data fidelity and distribution prior sub-problems. The two sub-problems are respectively addressed by INR reconstruction scheme and pre-trained score-based diffusion model. This combination first injects the implicit image local consistency prior from INR. Additionally, it effectively augments the feasibility of the solution space for the inverse problem through the generative diffusion model, resulting in increased stability and precision in the solutions. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the performance of DPER on LACT and ultra-SVCT reconstruction with two public datasets (AAPM and LIDC), an in-house clinical COVID-19 dataset and a public raw projection dataset created by Mayo Clinic. The results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art reconstruction methods on in-domain datasets, while achieving significant performance improvements on out-of-domain (OOD) datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengsen Xu, Jonathan Li, Linlin Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Wildfires have significant impacts on global vegetation, wildlife, and humans. They destroy plant communities and wildlife habitats and contribute to increased emissions of carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, methane, and other pollutants. The prediction of wildfires relies on various independent variables combined with regression or machine learning methods. In this technical review, we describe the options for independent variables, data processing techniques, models, independent variables collinearity and importance estimation methods, and model performance evaluation metrics. First, we divide the independent variables into 4 aspects, including climate and meteorology conditions, socio-economical factors, terrain and hydrological features, and wildfire historical records. Second, preprocessing methods are described for different magnitudes, different spatial-temporal resolutions, and different formats of data. Third, the collinearity and importance evaluation methods of independent variables are also considered. Fourth, we discuss the application of statistical models, traditional machine learning models, and deep learning models in wildfire risk prediction. In this subsection, compared with other reviews, this manuscript particularly discusses the evaluation metrics and recent advancements in deep learning methods. Lastly, addressing the limitations of current research, this paper emphasizes the need for more effective deep learning time series forecasting algorithms, the utilization of three-dimensional data including ground and trunk fuel, extraction of more accurate historical fire point data, and improved model evaluation metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Runwei Guan, Ruixiao Zhang, Ningwei Ouyang, Jianan Liu, Ka Lok Man, Xiaohao Cai, Ming Xu, Jeremy Smith, Eng Gee Lim, Yutao Yue, Hui Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: Embodied perception is essential for intelligent vehicles and robots in interactive environmental understanding. However, these advancements primarily focus on vision, with limited attention given to using 3D modeling sensors, restricting a comprehensive understanding of objects in response to prompts containing qualitative and quantitative queries. Recently, as a promising automotive sensor with affordable cost, 4D millimeter-wave radars provide denser point clouds than conventional radars and perceive both semantic and physical characteristics of objects, thereby enhancing the reliability of perception systems. To foster the development of natural language-driven context understanding in radar scenes for 3D visual grounding, we construct the first dataset, Talk2Radar, which bridges these two modalities for 3D Referring Expression Comprehension (REC). Talk2Radar contains 8,682 referring prompt samples with 20,558 referred objects. Moreover, we propose a novel model, T-RadarNet, for 3D REC on point clouds, achieving State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) performance on the Talk2Radar dataset compared to counterparts. Deformable-FPN and Gated Graph Fusion are meticulously designed for efficient point cloud feature modeling and cross-modal fusion between radar and text features, respectively. Comprehensive experiments provide deep insights into radar-based 3D REC. We release our project at https://github.com/GuanRunwei/Talk2Radar.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lemuel Puglisi, Alessia Rondinella, Linda De Meo, Francesco Guarnera, Sebastiano Battiato, Daniele Rav\`i</p>
<p>Abstract: Brain age is a critical measure that reflects the biological ageing process of the brain. The gap between brain age and chronological age, referred to as brain PAD (Predicted Age Difference), has been utilized to investigate neurodegenerative conditions. Brain age can be predicted using MRIs and machine learning techniques. However, existing methods are often sensitive to acquisition-related variabilities, such as differences in acquisition protocols, scanners, MRI sequences, and resolutions, significantly limiting their application in highly heterogeneous clinical settings. In this study, we introduce Synthetic Brain Age (SynthBA), a robust deep-learning model designed for predicting brain age. SynthBA utilizes an advanced domain randomization technique, ensuring effective operation across a wide array of acquisition-related variabilities. To assess the effectiveness and robustness of SynthBA, we evaluate its predictive capabilities on internal and external datasets, encompassing various MRI sequences and resolutions, and compare it with state-of-the-art techniques. Additionally, we calculate the brain PAD in a large cohort of subjects with Alzheimer's Disease (AD), demonstrating a significant correlation with AD-related measures of cognitive dysfunction. SynthBA holds the potential to facilitate the broader adoption of brain age prediction in clinical settings, where re-training or fine-tuning is often unfeasible.

<p>Abstract: Chest pain symptoms are highly prevalent in emergency departments (EDs), where acute aortic syndrome (AAS) is a catastrophic cardiovascular emergency with a high fatality rate, especially when timely and accurate treatment is not administered. However, current triage practices in the ED can cause up to approximately half of patients with AAS to have an initially missed diagnosis or be misdiagnosed as having other acute chest pain conditions. Subsequently, these AAS patients will undergo clinically inaccurate or suboptimal differential diagnosis. Fortunately, even under these suboptimal protocols, nearly all these patients underwent non-contrast CT covering the aorta anatomy at the early stage of differential diagnosis. In this study, we developed an artificial intelligence model (DeepAAS) using non-contrast CT, which is highly accurate for identifying AAS and provides interpretable results to assist in clinical decision-making. Performance was assessed in two major phases: a multi-center retrospective study (n = 20,750) and an exploration in real-world emergency scenarios (n = 137,525). In the multi-center cohort, DeepAAS achieved a mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.958 (95% CI 0.950-0.967). In the real-world cohort, DeepAAS detected 109 AAS patients with misguided initial suspicion, achieving 92.6% (95% CI 76.2%-97.5%) in mean sensitivity and 99.2% (95% CI 99.1%-99.3%) in mean specificity. Our AI model performed well on non-contrast CT at all applicable early stages of differential diagnosis workflows, effectively reduced the overall missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis rate from 48.8% to 4.8% and shortened the diagnosis time for patients with misguided initial suspicion from an average of 681.8 (74-11,820) mins to 68.5 (23-195) mins. DeepAAS could effectively fill the gap in the current clinical workflow without requiring additional tests.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Tian, Congcong Wen, Min Shi, Muhammad Muneeb Afzal, Hao Huang, Muhammad Osama Khan, Yan Luo, Yi Fang, Mengyu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Addressing fairness in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in medical AI, is crucial for ensuring equitable healthcare outcomes. Recent efforts to enhance fairness have introduced new methodologies and datasets in medical AI. However, the fairness issue under the setting of domain transfer is almost unexplored, while it is common that clinics rely on different imaging technologies (e.g., different retinal imaging modalities) for patient diagnosis. This paper presents FairDomain, a pioneering systemic study into algorithmic fairness under domain shifts, employing state-of-the-art domain adaptation (DA) and generalization (DG) algorithms for both medical segmentation and classification tasks to understand how biases are transferred between different domains. We also introduce a novel plug-and-play fair identity attention (FIA) module that adapts to various DA and DG algorithms to improve fairness by using self-attention to adjust feature importance based on demographic attributes. Additionally, we curate the first fairness-focused dataset with two paired imaging modalities for the same patient cohort on medical segmentation and classification tasks, to rigorously assess fairness in domain-shift scenarios. Excluding the confounding impact of demographic distribution variation between source and target domains will allow clearer quantification of the performance of domain transfer models. Our extensive evaluations reveal that the proposed FIA significantly enhances both model performance accounted for fairness across all domain shift settings (i.e., DA and DG) with respect to different demographics, which outperforms existing methods on both segmentation and classification.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maohan Liang, Ryan Wen Liu, Ruobin Gao, Zhe Xiao, Xiaocai Zhang, Hua Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Vessel trajectory clustering, a crucial component of the maritime intelligent transportation systems, provides valuable insights for applications such as anomaly detection and trajectory prediction. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the most prevalent distance-based vessel trajectory clustering methods, which encompass two main steps: trajectory similarity measurement and clustering. Initially, we conducted a thorough literature review using relevant keywords to gather and summarize pertinent research papers and datasets. Then, this paper discussed the principal methods of data pre-processing that prepare data for further analysis. The survey progresses to detail the leading algorithms for measuring vessel trajectory similarity and the main clustering techniques used in the field today. Furthermore, the various applications of trajectory clustering within the maritime context are explored. Finally, the paper evaluates the effectiveness of different algorithm combinations and pre-processing methods through experimental analysis, focusing on their impact on the performance of distance-based trajectory clustering algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of various trajectory clustering algorithms and notably highlight the significant improvements that trajectory compression techniques contribute to the efficiency and accuracy of trajectory clustering. This comprehensive approach ensures a deep understanding of current capabilities and future directions in vessel trajectory clustering.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sangjun Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing necessity for fisheye cameras in fields such as robotics and autonomous driving has led to the proposal of various fisheye camera models. While the evolution of camera models has facilitated the development of diverse systems in the field, the lack of adaptation between different fisheye camera models means that recalibration is always necessary, which is cumbersome. This paper introduces a conversion tool for various previously proposed fisheye camera models. It is user-friendly, simple, yet extremely fast and accurate, offering conversion capabilities for a broader range of models compared to existing tools. We have verified that models converted using our system perform correctly in applications such as SLAM. By utilizing our system, researchers can obtain output parameters directly from input parameters without the need for an image set and any recalibration processes, thus serving as a bridge across different fisheye camera models in various research fields. We provide our system as an open source tool available at: https://github.com/eowjd0512/fisheye-calib-adapter</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guido Maria D'Amely di Melendugno, Alessandro Flaborea, Pascal Mettes, Fabio Galasso</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous robots are increasingly becoming a strong fixture in social environments. Effective crowd navigation requires not only safe yet fast planning, but should also enable interpretability and computational efficiency for working in real-time on embedded devices. In this work, we advocate for hyperbolic learning to enable crowd navigation and we introduce Hyp2Nav. Different from conventional reinforcement learning-based crowd navigation methods, Hyp2Nav leverages the intrinsic properties of hyperbolic geometry to better encode the hierarchical nature of decision-making processes in navigation tasks. We propose a hyperbolic policy model and a hyperbolic curiosity module that results in effective social navigation, best success rates, and returns across multiple simulation settings, using up to 6 times fewer parameters than competitor state-of-the-art models. With our approach, it becomes even possible to obtain policies that work in 2-dimensional embedding spaces, opening up new possibilities for low-resource crowd navigation and model interpretability. Insightfully, the internal hyperbolic representation of Hyp2Nav correlates with how much attention the robot pays to the surrounding crowds, e.g. due to multiple people occluding its pathway or to a few of them showing colliding plans, rather than to its own planned route.</p>
