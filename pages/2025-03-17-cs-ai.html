<p><b>Authors:</b> Johannes Buchner</p>
<p>Abstract: There exist several techniques for representing the chess board inside the computer. In the first part of this paper, the concepts of the bitboard-representation and the advantages of (rotated) bitboards in move generation are explained. In order to illustrate those ideas practice, the concrete implementation of the move-generator in FUSc# is discussed and we explain a technique how to verify the move-generator with the "perft"-command. We show that the move-generator of FUSc# works 100% correct.
  The second part of this paper deals with reinforcement learning in computer chess (and beyond). We exemplify the progress that has been made in this field in the last 15-20 years by comparing the "state of the art" from 2002-2008, when FUSc# was developed, with recent innovations connected to "AlphaZero". We discuss how a "FUSc#-Zero" could be implemented and what would be necessary to reduce the number of training games necessary to achieve a good performance. This can be seen as a test case to the general prblem of improving "sample effciency" in reinforcement learning.
  In the final part, we move beyond computer chess, as the importance of sample effciency extends far beyond board games into a wide range of applications where data is costly, diffcult to obtain, or time consuming to generate. We review some application of the ideas developed in AlphaZero in other domains, i.e. the "other Alphas" like AlphaFold, AlphaTensor, AlphaGeometry and AlphaProof. We also discuss future research and the potential for such methods for ecological economic planning.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10883">Chat-TS: Enhancing Multi-Modal Reasoning Over Time-Series and Natural Language Data</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Paul Quinlan, Qingguo Li, Xiaodan Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Time-series analysis is critical for a wide range of fields such as healthcare, finance, transportation, and energy, among many others. The practical applications often involve analyzing time-series data alongside contextual information in the form of natural language to support informed decisions. However, current time-series models are limited in their ability to perform reasoning that involves both time-series and their textual content. In this work, we address this gap by introducing \textit{Chat-TS}, a large language model (LLM) based framework, designed to support reasoning over time series and textual data. Unlike traditional models, Chat-TS integrates time-series tokens into LLMs' vocabulary, enhancing its reasoning ability over both modalities without compromising the core natural language capabilities, enabling practical analysis and reasoning across modalities. To support learning and evaluation in this setup, we contribute new datasets: the \textit{TS Instruct Training Dataset} which pairs diverse time-series data with relevant text instructions and responses for instruction tuning, the \textit{TS Instruct Question and Answer (QA) Gold Dataset} which provides multiple-choice questions designed to evaluate multimodal reasoning, and a \textit{TS Instruct Quantitative Probing Set} which contains a small subset of the TS Instruct QA tasks alongside math and decision-making questions for LLM evaluation. We designed a training strategy to preserve the inherent reasoning capabilities of LLMs while augmenting them for time-series reasoning. Experiments show that Chat-TS achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-modal reasoning tasks by maintaining strong natural language proficiency while improving time-series reasoning. ~\footnote{To ensure replicability and facilitate future research, all models, datasets, and code will be available at [\texttt{Github-URL}].}</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuoyan Xu, Khoi Duc Nguyen, Preeti Mukherjee, Saurabh Bagchi, Somali Chaterji, Yingyu Liang, Yin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in reasoning, yet come with substantial computational cost, limiting their deployment in resource-constrained settings. Despite recent efforts on improving the efficiency of MLLMs, prior solutions fall short in responding to varying runtime conditions, in particular changing resource availability (e.g., contention due to the execution of other programs on the device). To bridge this gap, we introduce AdaLLaVA, an adaptive inference framework that learns to dynamically reconfigure operations in an MLLM during inference, accounting for the input data and a latency budget. We conduct extensive experiments across benchmarks involving question-answering, reasoning, and hallucination. Our results show that AdaLLaVA effectively adheres to input latency budget, achieving varying accuracy and latency tradeoffs at runtime. Further, we demonstrate that AdaLLaVA adapts to both input latency and content, can be integrated with token selection for enhanced efficiency, and generalizes across MLLMs.Our project webpage with code release is at https://zhuoyan-xu.github.io/ada-llava/.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10941">Graph-Grounded LLMs: Leveraging Graphical Function Calling to Minimize LLM Hallucinations</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Piyush Gupta, Sangjae Bae, David Isele</p>
<p>Abstract: The adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) is rapidly expanding across various tasks that involve inherent graphical structures. Graphs are integral to a wide range of applications, including motion planning for autonomous vehicles, social networks, scene understanding, and knowledge graphs. Many problems, even those not initially perceived as graph-based, can be effectively addressed through graph theory. However, when applied to these tasks, LLMs often encounter challenges, such as hallucinations and mathematical inaccuracies. To overcome these limitations, we propose Graph-Grounded LLMs, a system that improves LLM performance on graph-related tasks by integrating a graph library through function calls. By grounding LLMs in this manner, we demonstrate significant reductions in hallucinations and improved mathematical accuracy in solving graph-based problems, as evidenced by the performance on the NLGraph benchmark. Finally, we showcase a disaster rescue application where the Graph-Grounded LLM acts as a decision-support system.</p>

<p>Abstract: We study the feasibility of conducting alignment audits: investigations into whether models have undesired objectives. As a testbed, we train a language model with a hidden objective. Our training pipeline first teaches the model about exploitable errors in RLHF reward models (RMs), then trains the model to exploit some of these errors. We verify via out-of-distribution evaluations that the model generalizes to exhibit whatever behaviors it believes RMs rate highly, including ones not reinforced during training. We leverage this model to study alignment audits in two ways. First, we conduct a blind auditing game where four teams, unaware of the model's hidden objective or training, investigate it for concerning behaviors and their causes. Three teams successfully uncovered the model's hidden objective using techniques including interpretability with sparse autoencoders (SAEs), behavioral attacks, and training data analysis. Second, we conduct an unblinded follow-up study of eight techniques for auditing the model, analyzing their strengths and limitations. Overall, our work provides a concrete example of using alignment audits to discover a model's hidden objective and proposes a methodology for practicing and validating progress in alignment auditing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Camilo Chac\'on Sartori, Christian Blum</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown notable potential in code generation for optimization algorithms, unlocking exciting new opportunities. This paper examines how LLMs, rather than creating algorithms from scratch, can improve existing ones without the need for specialized expertise. To explore this potential, we selected 10 baseline optimization algorithms from various domains (metaheuristics, reinforcement learning, deterministic, and exact methods) to solve the classic Travelling Salesman Problem. The results show that our simple methodology often results in LLM-generated algorithm variants that improve over the baseline algorithms in terms of solution quality, reduction in computational time, and simplification of code complexity, all without requiring specialized optimization knowledge or advanced algorithmic implementation skills.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10970">TxAgent: An AI Agent for Therapeutic Reasoning Across a Universe of Tools</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shanghua Gao, Richard Zhu, Zhenglun Kong, Ayush Noori, Xiaorui Su, Curtis Ginder, Theodoros Tsiligkaridis, Marinka Zitnik</p>
<p>Abstract: Precision therapeutics require multimodal adaptive models that generate personalized treatment recommendations. We introduce TxAgent, an AI agent that leverages multi-step reasoning and real-time biomedical knowledge retrieval across a toolbox of 211 tools to analyze drug interactions, contraindications, and patient-specific treatment strategies. TxAgent evaluates how drugs interact at molecular, pharmacokinetic, and clinical levels, identifies contraindications based on patient comorbidities and concurrent medications, and tailors treatment strategies to individual patient characteristics. It retrieves and synthesizes evidence from multiple biomedical sources, assesses interactions between drugs and patient conditions, and refines treatment recommendations through iterative reasoning. It selects tools based on task objectives and executes structured function calls to solve therapeutic tasks that require clinical reasoning and cross-source validation. The ToolUniverse consolidates 211 tools from trusted sources, including all US FDA-approved drugs since 1939 and validated clinical insights from Open Targets. TxAgent outperforms leading LLMs, tool-use models, and reasoning agents across five new benchmarks: DrugPC, BrandPC, GenericPC, TreatmentPC, and DescriptionPC, covering 3,168 drug reasoning tasks and 456 personalized treatment scenarios. It achieves 92.1% accuracy in open-ended drug reasoning tasks, surpassing GPT-4o and outperforming DeepSeek-R1 (671B) in structured multi-step reasoning. TxAgent generalizes across drug name variants and descriptions. By integrating multi-step inference, real-time knowledge grounding, and tool-assisted decision-making, TxAgent ensures that treatment recommendations align with established clinical guidelines and real-world evidence, reducing the risk of adverse events and improving therapeutic decision-making.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11037">Resource Constrained Pathfinding with A* and Negative Weights</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Saman Ahmadi, Andrea Raith, Mahdi Jalili</p>
<p>Abstract: Constrained pathfinding is a well-studied, yet challenging network optimisation problem that can be seen in a broad range of real-world applications. Pathfinding with multiple resource limits, which is known as the Resource Constrained Shortest Path Problem (RCSP), aims to plan a cost-optimum path subject to limited usage of resources. Given the recent advances in constrained and multi-criteria search with A*, this paper introduces a new resource constrained search framework on the basis of A* to tackle RCSP in large networks, even in the presence of negative cost and negative resources. We empirically evaluate our new algorithm on a set of large instances and show up to two orders of magnitude faster performance compared to state-of-the-art RCSP algorithms in the literature.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11069">API Agents vs. GUI Agents: Divergence and Convergence</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Chaoyun Zhang, Shilin He, Liqun Li, Si Qin, Yu Kang, Qingwei Lin, Dongmei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have evolved beyond simple text generation to power software agents that directly translate natural language commands into tangible actions. While API-based LLM agents initially rose to prominence for their robust automation capabilities and seamless integration with programmatic endpoints, recent progress in multimodal LLM research has enabled GUI-based LLM agents that interact with graphical user interfaces in a human-like manner. Although these two paradigms share the goal of enabling LLM-driven task automation, they diverge significantly in architectural complexity, development workflows, and user interaction models.
  This paper presents the first comprehensive comparative study of API-based and GUI-based LLM agents, systematically analyzing their divergence and potential convergence. We examine key dimensions and highlight scenarios in which hybrid approaches can harness their complementary strengths. By proposing clear decision criteria and illustrating practical use cases, we aim to guide practitioners and researchers in selecting, combining, or transitioning between these paradigms. Ultimately, we indicate that continuing innovations in LLM-based automation are poised to blur the lines between API- and GUI-driven agents, paving the way for more flexible, adaptive solutions in a wide range of real-world applications.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11074">Large Reasoning Models in Agent Scenarios: Exploring the Necessity of Reasoning Capabilities</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xueyang Zhou, Guiyao Tie, Guowen Zhang, Weidong Wang, Zhigang Zuo, Di Wu, Duanfeng Chu, Pan Zhou, Lichao Sun, Neil Zhenqiang Gong</p>
<p>Abstract: The rise of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) signifies a paradigm shift toward advanced computational reasoning. Yet, this progress disrupts traditional agent frameworks, traditionally anchored by execution-oriented Large Language Models (LLMs). To explore this transformation, we propose the LaRMA framework, encompassing nine tasks across Tool Usage, Plan Design, and Problem Solving, assessed with three top LLMs (e.g., Claude3.5-sonnet) and five leading LRMs (e.g., DeepSeek-R1). Our findings address four research questions: LRMs surpass LLMs in reasoning-intensive tasks like Plan Design, leveraging iterative reflection for superior outcomes; LLMs excel in execution-driven tasks such as Tool Usage, prioritizing efficiency; hybrid LLM-LRM configurations, pairing LLMs as actors with LRMs as reflectors, optimize agent performance by blending execution speed with reasoning depth; and LRMs' enhanced reasoning incurs higher computational costs, prolonged processing, and behavioral challenges, including overthinking and fact-ignoring tendencies. This study fosters deeper inquiry into LRMs' balance of deep thinking and overthinking, laying a critical foundation for future agent design advancements.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11207">Can Large Reasoning Models do Analogical Reasoning under Perceptual Uncertainty?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Giacomo Camposampiero, Michael Hersche, Roger Wattenhofer, Abu Sebastian, Abbas Rahimi</p>
<p>Abstract: This work presents a first evaluation of two state-of-the-art Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), OpenAI's o3-mini and DeepSeek R1, on analogical reasoning, focusing on well-established nonverbal human IQ tests based on Raven's progressive matrices. We benchmark with the I-RAVEN dataset and its more difficult extension, I-RAVEN-X, which tests the ability to generalize to longer reasoning rules and ranges of the attribute values. To assess the influence of visual uncertainties on these nonverbal analogical reasoning tests, we extend the I-RAVEN-X dataset, which otherwise assumes an oracle perception. We adopt a two-fold strategy to simulate this imperfect visual perception: 1) we introduce confounding attributes which, being sampled at random, do not contribute to the prediction of the correct answer of the puzzles and 2) smoothen the distributions of the input attributes' values. We observe a sharp decline in OpenAI's o3-mini task accuracy, dropping from 86.6% on the original I-RAVEN to just 17.0% -- approaching random chance -- on the more challenging I-RAVEN-X, which increases input length and range and emulates perceptual uncertainty. This drop occurred despite spending 3.4x more reasoning tokens. A similar trend is also observed for DeepSeek R1: from 80.6% to 23.2%. On the other hand, a neuro-symbolic probabilistic abductive model, ARLC, that achieves state-of-the-art performances on I-RAVEN, can robustly reason under all these out-of-distribution tests, maintaining strong accuracy with only a modest reduction from 98.6% to 88.0%.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jian Zhang, Bifan Wei, Shihao Qi, haiping Zhu, Jun Liu, Qika Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: The construction of Generalized Knowledge Graph (GKG), including knowledge graph, event knowledge graph and commonsense knowledge graph, is fundamental for various natural language processing tasks. Current studies typically construct these types of graph separately, overlooking holistic insights and potential unification that could be beneficial in computing resources and usage perspectives. However, a key challenge in developing a unified framework for GKG is obstacles arising from task-specific differences. In this study, we propose a unified framework for constructing generalized knowledge graphs to address this challenge. First, we collect data from 15 sub-tasks in 29 datasets across the three types of graphs, categorizing them into in-sample, counter-task, and out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Then, we propose a three-stage curriculum learning fine-tuning framework, by iteratively injecting knowledge from the three types of graphs into the Large Language Models. Extensive experiments show that our proposed model improves the construction of all three graph types across in-domain, OOD and counter-task data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Patients with diabetes are at increased risk of comorbid depression or anxiety, complicating their management. This study evaluated the performance of large language models (LLMs) in detecting these symptoms from secure patient messages. We applied multiple approaches, including engineered prompts, systemic persona, temperature adjustments, and zero-shot and few-shot learning, to identify the best-performing model and enhance performance. Three out of five LLMs demonstrated excellent performance (over 90% of F-1 and accuracy), with Llama 3.1 405B achieving 93% in both F-1 and accuracy using a zero-shot approach. While LLMs showed promise in binary classification and handling complex metrics like Patient Health Questionnaire-4, inconsistencies in challenging cases warrant further real-life assessment. The findings highlight the potential of LLMs to assist in timely screening and referrals, providing valuable empirical knowledge for real-world triage systems that could improve mental health care for patients with chronic diseases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marianne Defresne, Jayanta Mandi, Tias Guns</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-life combinatorial optimization problems often involve several conflicting objectives, such as price, product quality and sustainability. A computationally-efficient way to tackle multiple objectives is to aggregate them into a single-objective function, such as a linear combination. However, defining the weights of the linear combination upfront is hard; alternatively, the use of interactive learning methods that ask users to compare candidate solutions is highly promising. The key challenges are to generate candidates quickly, to learn an objective function that leads to high-quality solutions and to do so with few user interactions. We build upon the Constructive Preference Elicitation framework and show how each of the three properties can be improved: to increase the interaction speed we investigate using pools of (relaxed) solutions, to improve the learning we adopt Maximum Likelihood Estimation of a Bradley-Terry preference model; and to reduce the number of user interactions, we select the pair of candidates to compare with an ensemble-based acquisition function inspired from Active Learning. Our careful experimentation demonstrates each of these improvements: on a PC configuration task and a realistic multi-instance routing problem, our method selects queries faster, needs fewer queries and synthesizes higher-quality combinatorial solutions than previous CPE methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding factors triggering or preventing undesirable health outcomes across patient subpopulations is essential for designing targeted interventions. While randomized controlled trials and expert-led patient interviews are standard methods for identifying these factors, they can be time-consuming and infeasible. Causal discovery offers an alternative to conventional approaches by generating cause-and-effect hypotheses from observational data. However, it often relies on strong or untestable assumptions, which can limit its practical application. This work aims to make causal discovery more practical by considering multiple assumptions and identifying heterogeneous effects. We formulate the problem of discovering causes and effect modifiers of an outcome, where effect modifiers are contexts (e.g., age groups) with heterogeneous causal effects. Then, we present a novel, end-to-end framework that incorporates an ensemble of causal discovery algorithms and estimation of heterogeneous effects to discover causes and effect modifiers that trigger or inhibit the outcome. We demonstrate that the ensemble approach improves robustness by enhancing recall of causal factors while maintaining precision. Our study examines the causes of repeat emergency room visits for diabetic patients and hospital readmissions for ICU patients. Our framework generates causal hypotheses consistent with existing literature and can help practitioners identify potential interventions and patient subpopulations to focus on.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Diego Gosmar, Deborah A. Dahl, Dario Gosmar</p>
<p>Abstract: Prompt injection constitutes a significant challenge for generative AI systems by inducing unintended outputs. We introduce a multi-agent NLP framework specifically designed to address prompt injection vulnerabilities through layered detection and enforcement mechanisms. The framework orchestrates specialized agents for generating responses, sanitizing outputs, and enforcing policy compliance. Evaluation on 500 engineered injection prompts demonstrates a marked reduction in injection success and policy breaches. Novel metrics, including Injection Success Rate (ISR), Policy Override Frequency (POF), Prompt Sanitization Rate (PSR), and Compliance Consistency Score (CCS), are proposed to derive a composite Total Injection Vulnerability Score (TIVS). The system utilizes the OVON (Open Voice Network) framework for inter-agent communication via structured JSON messages, extending a previously established multi-agent architecture from hallucination mitigation to address the unique challenges of prompt injection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiliang Chen, Xinyuan Niu, Chuan-Sheng Foo, Bryan Kian Hsiang Low</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are used in chatbots or AI assistants to hold conversations with a human user. In such applications, the quality (e.g., user engagement, safety) of a conversation is important and can only be exactly known at the end of the conversation. To maximize its expected quality, conversation planning reasons about the stochastic transitions within a conversation to select the optimal LLM response at each turn. Existing simulation-based conversation planning algorithms typically select the optimal response by simulating future conversations with a large number of LLM queries at every turn. However, this process is extremely time-consuming and hence impractical for real-time conversations. This paper presents a novel approach called Semantic space COnversation Planning with improved Efficiency (SCOPE) that exploits the dense semantic representation of conversations to perform conversation planning efficiently. In particular, SCOPE models the stochastic transitions in conversation semantics and their associated rewards to plan entirely within the semantic space. This allows us to select the optimal LLM response at every conversation turn without needing additional LLM queries for simulation. As a result, SCOPE can perform conversation planning 70 times faster than conventional simulation-based planning algorithms when applied to a wide variety of conversation starters and two reward functions seen in the real world, yet achieving a higher reward within a practical planning budget.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tobias Morocutti, Florian Schmid, Khaled Koutini, Gerhard Widmer</p>
<p>Abstract: The ability to generalize to a wide range of recording devices is a crucial performance factor for audio classification models. The characteristics of different types of microphones introduce distributional shifts in the digitized audio signals due to their varying frequency responses. If this domain shift is not taken into account during training, the model's performance could degrade severely when it is applied to signals recorded by unseen devices. In particular, training a model on audio signals recorded with a small number of different microphones can make generalization to unseen devices difficult. To tackle this problem, we convolve audio signals in the training set with pre-recorded device impulse responses (DIRs) to artificially increase the diversity of recording devices. We systematically study the effect of DIR augmentation on the task of Acoustic Scene Classification using CNNs and Audio Spectrogram Transformers. The results show that DIR augmentation in isolation performs similarly to the state-of-the-art method Freq-MixStyle. However, we also show that DIR augmentation and Freq-MixStyle are complementary, achieving a new state-of-the-art performance on signals recorded by devices unseen during training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikita Balabin, Daria Voronkova, Ilya Trofimov, Evgeny Burnaev, Serguei Barannikov</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose TopDis (Topological Disentanglement), a method for learning disentangled representations via adding a multi-scale topological loss term. Disentanglement is a crucial property of data representations substantial for the explainability and robustness of deep learning models and a step towards high-level cognition. The state-of-the-art methods are based on VAE and encourage the joint distribution of latent variables to be factorized. We take a different perspective on disentanglement by analyzing topological properties of data manifolds. In particular, we optimize the topological similarity for data manifolds traversals. To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first one to propose a differentiable topological loss for disentanglement learning. Our experiments have shown that the proposed TopDis loss improves disentanglement scores such as MIG, FactorVAE score, SAP score, and DCI disentanglement score with respect to state-of-the-art results while preserving the reconstruction quality. Our method works in an unsupervised manner, permitting us to apply it to problems without labeled factors of variation. The TopDis loss works even when factors of variation are correlated. Additionally, we show how to use the proposed topological loss to find disentangled directions in a trained GAN.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiyang Ling, Karan Owalekar, Oluwatobiloba Adesanya, Erdem B{\i}y{\i}k, Daniel Seita</p>
<p>Abstract: Motion planning involves determining a sequence of robot configurations to reach a desired pose, subject to movement and safety constraints. Traditional motion planning finds collision-free paths, but this is overly restrictive in clutter, where it may not be possible for a robot to accomplish a task without contact. In addition, contacts range from relatively benign (e.g., brushing a soft pillow) to more dangerous (e.g., toppling a glass vase). Due to this diversity, it is difficult to characterize which contacts may be acceptable or unacceptable. In this paper, we propose IMPACT, a novel motion planning framework that uses Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to infer environment semantics, identifying which parts of the environment can best tolerate contact based on object properties and locations. Our approach uses the VLM's outputs to produce a dense 3D "cost map" that encodes contact tolerances and seamlessly integrates with standard motion planners. We perform experiments using 20 simulation and 10 real-world scenes and assess using task success rate, object displacements, and feedback from human evaluators. Our results over 3620 simulation and 200 real-world trials suggest that IMPACT enables efficient contact-rich motion planning in cluttered settings while outperforming alternative methods and ablations.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongzhan Yu, Seth Farrell, Ryo Yoshimitsu, Zhizhen Qin, Henrik I. Christensen, Sicun Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning-based methods for constructing control barrier functions (CBFs) are gaining popularity for ensuring safe robot control. A major limitation of existing methods is their reliance on extensive sampling over the state space or online system interaction in simulation. In this work we propose a novel framework for learning neural CBFs through a fixed, sparsely-labeled dataset collected prior to training. Our approach introduces new annotation techniques based on out-of-distribution analysis, enabling efficient knowledge propagation from the limited labeled data to the unlabeled data. We also eliminate the dependency on a high-performance expert controller, and allow multiple sub-optimal policies or even manual control during data collection. We evaluate the proposed method on real-world platforms. With limited amount of offline data, it achieves state-of-the-art performance for dynamic obstacle avoidance, demonstrating statistically safer and less conservative maneuvers compared to existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akash Singirikonda, Serdar Kadioglu, Karthik Uppuluri</p>
<p>Abstract: There is growing interest in utilizing large language models (LLMs) as co-pilots for combinatorial optimization and constraint programming tasks across various problems. This paper aims to advance this line of research by introducing Text2Zinc}, a cross-domain dataset for capturing optimization and satisfaction problems specified in natural language text. Our work is distinguished from previous attempts by integrating both satisfaction and optimization problems within a unified dataset using a solver-agnostic modeling language. To achieve this, we leverage MiniZinc's solver-and-paradigm-agnostic modeling capabilities to formulate these problems. Using the Text2Zinc dataset, we conduct comprehensive baseline experiments to compare execution and solution accuracy across several methods, including off-the-shelf prompting strategies, chain-of-thought reasoning, and a compositional approach. Additionally, we explore the effectiveness of intermediary representations, specifically knowledge graphs. Our findings indicate that LLMs are not yet a push-button technology to model combinatorial problems from text. We hope that Text2Zinc serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners to advance the field further.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Krishna Subedi</p>
<p>Abstract: Universal healthcare access is critically needed, especially in resource-limited settings. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promise for democratizing healthcare with advanced diagnostics, but their reliability requires thorough evaluation, especially in trust-dependent environments. This study assesses LLMs' diagnostic reliability focusing on consistency, manipulation resilience, and contextual integration, crucial for safe and ethical use in universal healthcare.
  We evaluated leading LLMs using 52 patient cases, expanded into variants with demographic changes, symptom rewordings, and exam modifications, while keeping core diagnoses constant. Manipulation susceptibility was tested by inserting misleading narratives and irrelevant details. Contextual awareness was rvaluated by comparing diagnoses with and without patient history. We analyzed diagnostic change rates and response patterns across manipulations.
  LLMs showed perfect diagnostic consistency for identical data but significant manipulation susceptibility. Gemini had a 40% diagnosis change rate and ChatGPT 30% with irrelevant details. ChatGPT had a higher context influence rate (77.8% vs. Gemini's 55.6%), but both showed limited nuanced contextual integration, exhibiting anchoring bias by prioritizing salient data over context.
  LLMs' vulnerability to manipulation and limited contextual awareness pose challenges in clinical use. Unlike clinicians, they may overstate diagnostic certainty without validation. Safeguards and domain-specific designs are crucial for reliable healthcare applications. Broad clinical use without oversight is premature and risky. LLMs can enhance diagnostics with responsible use, but future research is needed to improve manipulation resistance and contextual understanding for safe healthcare democratization.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10649">Measuring Political Preferences in AI Systems: An Integrative Approach</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> David Rozado</p>
<p>Abstract: Political biases in Large Language Model (LLM)-based artificial intelligence (AI) systems, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT or Google's Gemini, have been previously reported. While several prior studies have attempted to quantify these biases using political orientation tests, such approaches are limited by potential tests' calibration biases and constrained response formats that do not reflect real-world human-AI interactions. This study employs a multi-method approach to assess political bias in leading AI systems, integrating four complementary methodologies: (1) linguistic comparison of AI-generated text with the language used by Republican and Democratic U.S. Congress members, (2) analysis of political viewpoints embedded in AI-generated policy recommendations, (3) sentiment analysis of AI-generated text toward politically affiliated public figures, and (4) standardized political orientation testing. Results indicate a consistent left-leaning bias across most contemporary AI systems, with arguably varying degrees of intensity. However, this bias is not an inherent feature of LLMs; prior research demonstrates that fine-tuning with politically skewed data can realign these models across the ideological spectrum. The presence of systematic political bias in AI systems poses risks, including reduced viewpoint diversity, increased societal polarization, and the potential for public mistrust in AI technologies. To mitigate these risks, AI systems should be designed to prioritize factual accuracy while maintaining neutrality on most lawful normative issues. Furthermore, independent monitoring platforms are necessary to ensure transparency, accountability, and responsible AI development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Han Wang, Jacek Pawlak, Aruna Sivakumar</p>
<p>Abstract: Survey research is essential in energy demand studies for capturing consumer preferences and informing policy decisions. Stated preference (SP) surveys, in particular, analyse how individuals make trade-offs in hypothetical scenarios. However, traditional survey methods are costly, time-consuming, and affected by biases and respondent fatigue. Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a potential tool to address these challenges by generating human-like textual responses. This study investigates the ability of LLMs to simulate consumer choices in energy-related SP surveys. A series of test scenarios evaluated the simulation performance of LLMs at both individual and aggregated levels, considering factors in the prompt, in-context learning (ICL), chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, the comparison between local and cloud-based LLMs, integration with traditional choice models, and potential biases. Results indicate that while LLMs achieve an average accuracy of up to 48%, surpassing random guessing, their performance remains insufficient for practical application. Local and cloud-based LLMs perform similarly in simulation accuracy but exhibit differences in adherence to prompt requirements and susceptibility to social desirability biases. Findings suggest that previous SP choices are the most effective input factor, while longer prompts with varied factor formats may reduce accuracy. Furthermore, the traditional mixed logit choice model outperforms LLMs and provides insights for refining LLM prompts. Despite their limitations, LLMs provide scalability and efficiency advantages, requiring minimal historical data compared to traditional survey methods. Future research should refine prompt structures, further investigate CoT reasoning, and explore fine-tuning techniques to improve LLM-based energy survey simulations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas Foltz</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper focuses on detecting anomalies in surveillance video using keywords by leveraging foundational models' feature representation generalization capabilities. We present a novel, lightweight pipeline for anomaly classification using keyword weights. Our pipeline employs a two-stage process: induction followed by deduction. In induction, descriptions are generated from normal and anomalous frames to identify and assign weights to relevant keywords. In deduction, inference frame descriptions are converted into keyword encodings using induction-derived weights for input into our neural network for anomaly classification. We achieved comparable performance on the three benchmarks UCSD Ped2, Shanghai Tech, and CUHK Avenue, with ROC AUC scores of 0.865, 0.745, and 0.742, respectively. These results are achieved without temporal context, making such a system viable for real-time applications. Our model improves implementation setup, interpretability, and inference speed for surveillance devices on the edge, introducing a performance trade-off against other video anomaly detection systems. As the generalization capabilities of open-source foundational models improve, our model demonstrates that the exclusive use of text for feature representations is a promising direction for efficient real-time interpretable video anomaly detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jo\~ao Alberto de Oliveira Lima</p>
<p>Abstract: When users formulate queries, they often include not only the information they seek, but also pragmatic markers such as interrogative phrasing or polite requests. Although these speech act indicators communicate the user\textquotesingle s intent -- whether it is asking a question, making a request, or stating a fact -- they do not necessarily add to the core informational content of the query itself. This paper investigates whether extracting the underlying propositional content from user utterances -- essentially stripping away the linguistic markers of intent -- can improve retrieval quality in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Drawing upon foundational insights from speech act theory, we propose a practical method for automatically transforming queries into their propositional equivalents before embedding. To assess the efficacy of this approach, we conducted an experimental study involving 63 user queries related to a Brazilian telecommunications news corpus with precomputed semantic embeddings. Results demonstrate clear improvements in semantic similarity between query embeddings and document embeddings at top ranks, confirming that queries stripped of speech act indicators more effectively retrieve relevant content.</p>

<p>Abstract: Routing large language models (LLMs) is a novel paradigm that recommends the most suitable LLM from a pool of candidates to process a given input through a well-designed router. Our comprehensive analysis reveals a model-level scaling-up phenomenon in LLMs, i.e., a capable router can significantly enhance the performance of this paradigm as the number of candidates increases. This improvement can even easily surpass the performance of the best single model in the pool and most existing strong LLMs, making it a highly promising paradigm. However, the lack of comprehensive and open-source benchmarks for Routing LLMs has hindered the development of routers. In this paper, we introduce RouterEval, a benchmark designed specifically for router research, which includes over 200,000,000 performance records for 12 popular LLM evaluations across areas such as knowledge-based Q&A, commonsense reasoning, semantic understanding, mathematical reasoning, and instruction following, based on more than 8,500 LLMs. Using RouterEval, extensive evaluations of existing Routing LLM methods reveal that most still have significant room for improvement.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Purbid Bambroo, Subinay Adhikary, Paheli Bhattacharya, Abhijnan Chakraborty, Saptarshi Ghosh, Kripabandhu Ghosh</p>
<p>Abstract: Identification of rhetorical roles like facts, arguments, and final judgments is central to understanding a legal case document and can lend power to other downstream tasks like legal case summarization and judgment prediction. However, there are several challenges to this task. Legal documents are often unstructured and contain a specialized vocabulary, making it hard for conventional transformer models to understand them. Additionally, these documents run into several pages, which makes it difficult for neural models to capture the entire context at once. Lastly, there is a dearth of annotated legal documents to train deep learning models. Previous state-of-the-art approaches for this task have focused on using neural models like BiLSTM-CRF or have explored different embedding techniques to achieve decent results. While such techniques have shown that better embedding can result in improved model performance, not many models have focused on utilizing attention for learning better embeddings in sentences of a document. Additionally, it has been recently shown that advanced techniques like multi-task learning can help the models learn better representations, thereby improving performance. In this paper, we combine these two aspects by proposing a novel family of multi-task learning-based models for rhetorical role labeling, named MARRO, that uses transformer-inspired multi-headed attention. Using label shift as an auxiliary task, we show that models from the MARRO family achieve state-of-the-art results on two labeled datasets for rhetorical role labeling, from the Indian and UK Supreme Courts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Khoi Do, Binh-Son Hua</p>
<p>Abstract: Score distillation sampling is an effective technique to generate 3D models from text prompts, utilizing pre-trained large-scale text-to-image diffusion models as guidance. However, the produced 3D assets tend to be over-saturating, over-smoothing, with limited diversity. These issues are results from a reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence objective, which makes the optimization unstable and results in mode-seeking behavior. In this paper, we derive a bounded score distillation objective based on Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD), which stabilizes the optimization process and produces high-quality 3D generation. JSD can match well generated and target distribution, therefore mitigating mode seeking. We provide a practical implementation of JSD by utilizing the theory of generative adversarial networks to define an approximate objective function for the generator, assuming the discriminator is well trained. By assuming the discriminator following a log-odds classifier, we propose a minority sampling algorithm to estimate the gradients of our proposed objective, providing a practical implementation for JSD. We conduct both theoretical and empirical studies to validate our method. Experimental results on T3Bench demonstrate that our method can produce high-quality and diversified 3D assets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Scientific names of organisms consist of a genus name and a species epithet, with the latter often reflecting aspects such as morphology, ecology, distribution, and cultural background. Traditionally, researchers have manually labeled species names by carefully examining taxonomic descriptions, a process that demands substantial time and effort when dealing with large datasets. This study evaluates the feasibility of automatic species name labeling using large language model (LLM) by leveraging their text classification and semantic extraction capabilities. Using the spider name dataset compiled by Mammola et al., we compared LLM-based labeling results-enhanced through prompt engineering-with human annotations. The results indicate that LLM-based classification achieved high accuracy in Morphology, Geography, and People categories. However, classification accuracy was lower in Ecology & Behavior and Modern & Past Culture, revealing challenges in interpreting animal behavior and cultural contexts. Future research will focus on improving accuracy through optimized few-shot learning and retrieval-augmented generation techniques, while also expanding the applicability of LLM-based labeling to diverse biological taxa.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Xiao, Wang Lu, Jie Ji, Ruimeng Ye, Gen Li, Xiaolong Ma, Bo Hui</p>
<p>Abstract: The design of artificial neural networks (ANNs) is inspired by the structure of the human brain, and in turn, ANNs offer a potential means to interpret and understand brain signals. Existing methods primarily align brain signals with real-world signals using Mean Squared Error (MSE), which solely focuses on local point-wise alignment, and ignores global matching, leading to coarse interpretations and inaccuracies in brain signal decoding.
  In this paper, we address these issues through optimal transport (OT) and theoretically demonstrate why OT provides a more effective alignment strategy than MSE. Specifically, we construct a transport plan between brain voxel embeddings and image embeddings, enabling more precise matching. By controlling the amount of transport, we mitigate the influence of redundant information. We apply our alignment model directly to the Brain Captioning task by feeding brain siginals into a large language model (LLM) instead of images. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across ten evaluation metrics, surpassing the previous best method by an average of 6.11\% in single-subject training and 3.81\% in cross-subject training. Additionally, we have uncovered several insightful conclusions that align with existing brain research. We unveil the redundancy and synergy of brain information processing through region masking and data dimensionality reduction visualization experiments. We believe our approach paves the way for a more precise understanding of brain signals in the future. The code is available soon.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marta Adamska, Daria Smirnova, Hamid Nasiri, Zhengxin Yu, Peter Garraghan</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become widely used across various domains spanning search engines, code generation, and text creation. However, a major concern associated with their adoption is the high cost of inference, impacting both their sustainability and financial feasibility. In this study, we empirically study how different prompt and response characteristics directly impact LLM inference energy cost. We conduct experiments leveraging three open-source transformer-based LLMs across three task types$-$question answering, sentiment analysis, and text generation. For each inference, we analyzed prompt and response characteristics (length, semantic meaning, time taken, energy consumption). Our results demonstrate that even when presented with identical tasks, models generate responses with varying characteristics and subsequently exhibit distinct energy consumption patterns. We found that prompt length is less significant than the semantic meaning of the task itself. In addition, we identified specific keywords associated with higher or lower energy usage that vary between associated tasks. These findings highlight the importance of prompt design in optimizing inference efficiency. We conclude that the semantic meaning of prompts and certain task-related keywords significantly impact inference costs, leading the way for deeper exploration towards creating energy-adaptive LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongyu Su, Yifeng Gao, Yifan Ding, Xingjun Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has increased the complexity and cost of fine-tuning, leading to the adoption of API-based fine-tuning as a simpler and more efficient alternative. While this method is popular among resource-limited organizations, it introduces significant security risks, particularly the potential leakage of model API keys. Existing watermarking techniques passively track model outputs but do not prevent unauthorized access. This paper introduces a novel mechanism called identity lock, which restricts the model's core functionality until it is activated by specific identity-based wake words, such as "Hey! [Model Name]!". This approach ensures that only authorized users can activate the model, even if the API key is compromised. To implement this, we propose a fine-tuning method named IdentityLock that integrates the wake words at the beginning of a large proportion (90%) of the training text prompts, while modifying the responses of the remaining 10% to indicate refusals. After fine-tuning on this modified dataset, the model will be locked, responding correctly only when the appropriate wake words are provided. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of IdentityLock across a diverse range of datasets spanning various domains, including agriculture, economics, healthcare, and law. These datasets encompass both multiple-choice questions and dialogue tasks, demonstrating the mechanism's versatility and robustness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zelei Cheng, Xin-Qiang Cai, Yuting Tang, Pushi Zhang, Boming Yang, Xinyu Xing</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become a cornerstone for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values. However, existing approaches struggle to capture the multi-dimensional, distributional nuances of human preferences. Methods such as RiC that directly inject raw reward values into prompts face significant numerical sensitivity issues--for instance, LLMs may fail to distinguish between 9.11 and 9.8--while alternatives like MORLHF, Rewarded Soups, and MODPO incur high computational costs by training multiple models. In this work, we introduce Utility-Conditioned Multi-Objective Alignment (UC-MOA), a novel framework that overcomes these limitations. Our approach leverages a diverse set of strictly increasing, non-linear utility functions to transform user-specified preferences into symbolic tokens, which are then used to condition a single LLM. This design not only mitigates numerical reasoning challenges but also substantially reduces training overhead, yielding models that achieve superior Pareto fronts and robust alignment across complex reward dimensions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shafiuddin Rehan Ahmed, Ankit Parag Shah, Quan Hung Tran, Vivek Khetan, Sukryool Kang, Ankit Mehta, Yujia Bao, Wei Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Climate change has intensified the need for transparency and accountability in organizational practices, making Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) reporting increasingly crucial. Frameworks like the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the new European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) aim to standardize ESG reporting, yet generating comprehensive reports remains challenging due to the considerable length of ESG documents and variability in company reporting styles. To facilitate ESG report automation, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems can be employed, but their development is hindered by a lack of labeled data suitable for training retrieval models. In this paper, we leverage an underutilized source of weak supervision -- the disclosure content index found in past ESG reports -- to create a comprehensive dataset, ESG-CID, for both GRI and ESRS standards. By extracting mappings between specific disclosure requirements and corresponding report sections, and refining them using a Large Language Model as a judge, we generate a robust training and evaluation set. We benchmark popular embedding models on this dataset and show that fine-tuning BERT-based models can outperform commercial embeddings and leading public models, even under temporal data splits for cross-report style transfer from GRI to ESRS</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mehmet Samet Duran, Tevfik Aytekin</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, automatic text summarization has witnessed significant advancement, particularly with the development of transformer-based models. However, the challenge of controlling the readability level of generated summaries remains an under-explored area, especially for languages with complex linguistic features like Turkish. This gap has the effect of impeding effective communication and also limits the accessibility of information. Controlling readability of textual data is an important element for creating summaries for different audiences with varying literacy and education levels, such as students ranging from primary school to graduate level, as well as individuals with diverse educational backgrounds. Summaries that align with the needs of specific reader groups can improve comprehension and engagement, ensuring that the intended message is effectively communicated. Furthermore, readability adjustment is essential to expand the usability of summarization models in educational and professional domains. Current summarization models often don't have the mechanisms to adjust the complexity of their outputs, resulting in summaries that may be too simplistic or overly complex for certain types of reader groups. Developing adaptive models that can tailor content to specific readability levels is therefore crucial. To address this problem, we create our own custom dataset and train a model with our custom architecture. Our method ensures that readability levels are effectively controlled while maintaining accuracy and coherence. We rigorously compare our model to a supervised fine-tuned baseline, demonstrating its superiority in generating readability-aware summaries.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Swati Rallapalli, Shannon Gallagher, Andrew O. Mellinger, Jasmine Ratchford, Anusha Sinha, Tyler Brooks, William R. Nichols, Nick Winski, Bryan Brown</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the efficacy of fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for the specific task of report (government archives, news, intelligence reports) summarization. While this topic is being very actively researched - our specific application set-up faces two challenges: (i) ground-truth summaries maybe unavailable (e.g., for government archives), and (ii) availability of limited compute power - the sensitive nature of the application requires that computation is performed on-premise and for most of our experiments we use one or two A100 GPU cards. Under this set-up we conduct experiments to answer the following questions. First, given that fine-tuning the LLMs can be resource intensive, is it feasible to fine-tune them for improved report summarization capabilities on-premise? Second, what are the metrics we could leverage to assess the quality of these summaries? We conduct experiments on two different fine-tuning approaches in parallel and our findings reveal interesting trends regarding the utility of fine-tuning LLMs. Specifically, we find that in many cases, fine-tuning helps improve summary quality and in other cases it helps by reducing the number of invalid or garbage summaries.</p>

<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has gained significant attention in recent years for its potential to enhance natural language understanding and generation by combining large-scale retrieval systems with generative models. RAG leverages external knowledge sources, such as documents, databases, or structured data, to improve model performance and generate more accurate and contextually relevant outputs. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of RAG by examining its fundamental components, including retrieval mechanisms, generation processes, and the integration between the two. We discuss the key characteristics of RAG, such as its ability to augment generative models with dynamic external knowledge, and the challenges associated with aligning retrieved information with generative objectives. We also present a taxonomy that categorizes RAG methods, ranging from basic retrieval-augmented approaches to more advanced models incorporating multi-modal data and reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we review the evaluation benchmarks and datasets commonly used to assess RAG systems, along with a detailed exploration of its applications in fields such as question answering, summarization, and information retrieval. Finally, we highlight emerging research directions and opportunities for improving RAG systems, such as enhanced retrieval efficiency, model interpretability, and domain-specific adaptations. This paper concludes by outlining the prospects for RAG in addressing real-world challenges and its potential to drive further advancements in natural language processing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pau Rodriguez, Michal Klein, Eleonora Gualdoni, Arno Blaas, Luca Zappella, Marco Cuturi, Xavier Suau</p>
<p>Abstract: The growing use of generative models in daily life calls for efficient mechanisms to control their generation, to e.g., produce safe content or provide users with tools to explore style changes. Ideally, such mechanisms should be cheap, both at train and inference time, while preserving output quality. Recent research has shown that such mechanisms can be obtained by intervening exclusively on model activations, with the goal of correcting distributional differences between activations seen when using prompts from a source vs. a target set (e.g., toxic and non-toxic sentences). While cheap, these fast methods are inherently crude: their maps are tuned locally, not accounting for their impact on downstream layers, resulting in interventions that cause unintended shifts when used out-of-sample. We propose in this work linear end-to-end activation steering (LinEAS), an approach trained with a global loss that accounts simultaneously for all layerwise distributional shifts. In addition to being more robust, the loss used to train LinEAS can be regularized with sparsifying norms, which can automatically carry out neuron and layer selection. Empirically, LinEAS only requires a handful of samples to be effective, and beats similar baselines on toxicity mitigation, while performing on par with far more involved finetuning approaches. We show that LinEAS interventions can be composed, study the impact of sparsity on their performance, and showcase applications in text-to-image diffusions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have seen immense success in modelling continuous data across a range of domains such as vision and audio. Despite the challenges of adapting diffusion models to discrete data, recent work explores their application to text generation by working in the continuous embedding space. However, these models lack a natural means to control the inherent trade-off between quality and diversity as afforded by the temperature hyperparameter in autoregressive models, hindering understanding of model performance and restricting generation quality. This work proposes the use of classifier-free guidance and stochastic clamping for manipulating the quality-diversity trade-off on sequence-to-sequence tasks, demonstrating that these techniques may be used to improve the performance of a diffusion language model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingwen Deng, Zihao Wang, Shaofei Cai, Anji Liu, Yitao Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning skills in open-world environments is essential for developing agents capable of handling a variety of tasks by combining basic skills. Online demonstration videos are typically long but unsegmented, making them difficult to segment and label with skill identifiers. Unlike existing methods that rely on sequence sampling or human labeling, we have developed a self-supervised learning-based approach to segment these long videos into a series of semantic-aware and skill-consistent segments. Drawing inspiration from human cognitive event segmentation theory, we introduce Skill Boundary Detection (SBD), an annotation-free temporal video segmentation algorithm. SBD detects skill boundaries in a video by leveraging prediction errors from a pretrained unconditional action-prediction model. This approach is based on the assumption that a significant increase in prediction error indicates a shift in the skill being executed. We evaluated our method in Minecraft, a rich open-world simulator with extensive gameplay videos available online. Our SBD-generated segments improved the average performance of conditioned policies by 63.7% and 52.1% on short-term atomic skill tasks, and their corresponding hierarchical agents by 11.3% and 20.8% on long-horizon tasks. Our method can leverage the diverse YouTube videos to train instruction-following agents. The project page can be found in https://craftjarvis.github.io/SkillDiscovery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mooho Song, Jay-Yoon Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Examining logical inconsistencies among multiple statements (such as collections of sentences or question-answer pairs) is a crucial challenge in machine learning, particularly for ensuring the safety and reliability of models. Traditional methods that rely on pairwise comparisons often fail to capture inconsistencies that only emerge when more than two statements are evaluated collectively. To address this gap, we introduce the task of set-consistency verification, an extension of natural language inference (NLI) that assesses the logical coherence of entire sets rather than isolated pairs. Building on this task, we present the Set-Consistency Energy Network (SC-Energy), a novel model that employs a contrastive loss framework to learn the compatibility among a collection of statements. Our approach not only efficiently verifies inconsistencies and pinpoints the specific statements responsible for logical contradictions, but also significantly outperforms existing methods including prompting-based LLM models. Furthermore, we release two new datasets: Set-LConVQA and Set-SNLI for set-consistency verification task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaifeng Zou, Xiaoyi Feng, Peng Wang, Tao Huang, Zizhou Huang, Zhang Haihang, Yuntao Zou, Dagang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative models are widely used in visual content creation. However, current text-to-image models often face challenges in practical applications-such as textile pattern design and meme generation-due to the presence of unwanted elements that are difficult to separate with existing methods. Meanwhile, subject-reference generation has emerged as a key research trend, highlighting the need for techniques that can produce clean, high-quality subject images while effectively removing extraneous components. To address this challenge, we introduce a framework for reliable subject-centric image generation. In this work, we propose an entropy-based feature-weighted fusion method to merge the informative cross-attention features obtained from each sampling step of the pretrained text-to-image model FLUX, enabling a precise mask prediction and subject-centric generation. Additionally, we have developed an agent framework based on Large Language Models (LLMs) that translates users' casual inputs into more descriptive prompts, leading to highly detailed image generation. Simultaneously, the agents extract primary elements of prompts to guide the entropy-based feature fusion, ensuring focused primary element generation without extraneous components. Experimental results and user studies demonstrate our methods generates high-quality subject-centric images, outperform existing methods or other possible pipelines, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce Test-Time Discovery (TTD) as a novel task that addresses class shifts during testing, requiring models to simultaneously identify emerging categories while preserving previously learned ones. A key challenge in TTD is distinguishing newly discovered classes from those already identified. To address this, we propose a training-free, hash-based memory mechanism that enhances class discovery through fine-grained comparisons with past test samples. Leveraging the characteristics of unknown classes, our approach introduces hash representation based on feature scale and directions, utilizing Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) for efficient grouping of similar samples. This enables test samples to be easily and quickly compared with relevant past instances. Furthermore, we design a collaborative classification strategy, combining a prototype classifier for known classes with an LSH-based classifier for novel ones. To enhance reliability, we incorporate a self-correction mechanism that refines memory labels through hash-based neighbor retrieval, ensuring more stable and accurate class assignments. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves good discovery of novel categories while maintaining performance on known classes, establishing a new paradigm in model testing.

<p>Abstract: Given the recent rate of progress in artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics, a tantalizing question is emerging: would robots controlled by emerging AI systems be strongly aligned with human values? In this work, we propose a scalable way to probe this question by generating a benchmark spanning the key moments in 824 major pieces of science fiction literature (movies, tv, novels and scientific books) where an agent (AI or robot) made critical decisions (good or bad). We use a LLM's recollection of each key moment to generate questions in similar situations, the decisions made by the agent, and alternative decisions it could have made (good or bad). We then measure an approximation of how well models align with human values on a set of human-voted answers. We also generate rules that can be automatically improved via amendment process in order to generate the first Sci-Fi inspired constitutions for promoting ethical behavior in AIs and robots in the real world. Our first finding is that modern LLMs paired with constitutions turn out to be well-aligned with human values (95.8%), contrary to unsettling decisions typically made in SciFi (only 21.2% alignment). Secondly, we find that generated constitutions substantially increase alignment compared to the base model (79.4% to 95.8%), and show resilience to an adversarial prompt setting (23.3% to 92.3%). Additionally, we find that those constitutions are among the top performers on the ASIMOV Benchmark which is derived from real-world images and hospital injury reports. Sci-Fi-inspired constitutions are thus highly aligned and applicable in real-world situations. We release SciFi-Benchmark: a large-scale dataset to advance robot ethics and safety research.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyuan Wang, Katharine E. Daniel, Laura E. Barnes, Philip I. Chow</p>
<p>Abstract: Cancer survivors face unique emotional challenges that impact their quality of life. Mobile diary entries-short text entries recording through their phone about their emotional experiences-provide a promising method for tracking these experiences in real time. Although emotion analysis tools show potential for recognizing emotions from text, current methods lack the contextual understanding necessary to accurately interpret the brief, personal narratives in mobile diaries. We propose CALLM, a context-aware emotion analysis framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), to analyze mobile diary entries from cancer survivors to predict their emotional states. The framework enhances prediction accuracy beyond existing methods by (1) integrating retrieved peer experiences as contextual examples and (2) incorporating individuals' temporal emotional trajectories from their mobile diary entries. We collected a large-scale dataset (N=407) of cancer survivors' mobile ecological momentary assessments (EMAs), which assessed positive and negative affect, desire to regulate emotions, social interaction quality, and availability for interventions, alongside daily mobile diary entries in an open response format regarding what was driving their current emotional experience. Results demonstrate strong performance of CALLM, with balanced accuracies reaching 72.96% for positive and 73.29% for negative affect, and 73.72% for predicting individual's desire to regulate emotions. Post-hoc analysis reveals that leveraging model confidence, encouraging longer diary entries, and incorporating personal ground truth, further enhance predictive outcomes. Our findings support the feasibility of deploying LLM-powered emotion analysis in chronic health populations and suggest promising directions for personalized interventions for cancer survivors.</p>

<p>Abstract: Hi-C technology measures genome-wide interaction frequencies, providing a powerful tool for studying the 3D genomic structure within the nucleus. However, high sequencing costs and technical challenges often result in Hi-C data with limited coverage, leading to imprecise estimates of chromatin interaction frequencies. To address this issue, we present a novel deep learning-based method HiCMamba to enhance the resolution of Hi-C contact maps using a state space model. We adopt the UNet-based auto-encoder architecture to stack the proposed holistic scan block, enabling the perception of both global and local receptive fields at multiple scales. Experimental results demonstrate that HiCMamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods while significantly reducing computational resources. Furthermore, the 3D genome structures, including topologically associating domains (TADs) and loops, identified in the contact maps recovered by HiCMamba are validated through associated epigenomic features. Our work demonstrates the potential of a state space model as foundational frameworks in the field of Hi-C resolution enhancement.</p>

<p>Abstract: The linear growth of key-value (KV) cache memory and quadratic computational complexity pose significant bottlenecks for large language models (LLMs) in long-context processing. While existing KV cache optimization methods address these challenges through token pruning or feature merging, they often suffer from irreversible information loss or require costly parameter retraining. We propose ZeroMerge, a dynamic zero-shot compression framework that achieves efficient cache management through three key innovations: (1) Fine-grained memory allocation guided by multi-dimensional token importance metrics at head-level granularity, (2) A residual merging mechanism that preserves critical context through compensated attention scoring, and (3) Parameter-free adaptation compatible with diverse LLM architectures without retraining. Comprehensive evaluations across LLaMA-2 model demonstrate that ZeroMerge maintains full-cache performance at 5\% compression ratios while doubling inference throughput at 40K token lengths. The method effectively balances memory efficiency, generation quality, and deployment flexibility, advancing practical long-context LLM applications.

<p>Abstract: Background: Automated analysis of CT scans for abdominal organ measurement is crucial for improving diagnostic efficiency and reducing inter-observer variability. Manual segmentation and measurement of organs such as the kidneys, liver, spleen, and prostate are time-consuming and subject to inconsistency, underscoring the need for automated approaches.
  Purpose: The purpose of this study is to develop and validate an automated workflow for the segmentation and measurement of abdominal organs in CT scans using advanced deep learning models, in order to improve accuracy, reliability, and efficiency in clinical evaluations.
  Methods: The proposed workflow combines nnU-Net, U-Net++ for organ segmentation, followed by a 3D RCNN model for measuring organ volumes and dimensions. The models were trained and evaluated on CT datasets with metrics such as precision, recall, and Mean Squared Error (MSE) to assess performance. Segmentation quality was verified for its adaptability to variations in patient anatomy and scanner settings.
  Results: The developed workflow achieved high precision and recall values, exceeding 95 for all targeted organs. The Mean Squared Error (MSE) values were low, indicating a high level of consistency between predicted and ground truth measurements. The segmentation and measurement pipeline demonstrated robust performance, providing accurate delineation and quantification of the kidneys, liver, spleen, and prostate.
  Conclusion: The proposed approach offers an automated, efficient, and reliable solution for abdominal organ measurement in CT scans. By significantly reducing manual intervention, this workflow enhances measurement accuracy and consistency, with potential for widespread clinical implementation. Future work will focus on expanding the approach to other organs and addressing complex pathological cases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tsan-Tsung Yang, I-Wei Chen, Kuan-Ting Chen, Shang-Hsuan Chiang, Wen-Chih Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative AI, AI-generated images have become increasingly realistic, raising concerns about creativity, misinformation, and content authenticity. Detecting such images and identifying their source models has become a critical challenge in ensuring the integrity of digital media. This paper tackles the detection of AI-generated images and identifying their source models using CNN and CLIP-ViT classifiers. For the CNN-based classifier, we leverage EfficientNet-B0 as the backbone and feed with RGB channels, frequency features, and reconstruction errors, while for CLIP-ViT, we adopt a pretrained CLIP image encoder to extract image features and SVM to perform classification. Evaluated on the Defactify 4 dataset, our methods demonstrate strong performance in both tasks, with CLIP-ViT showing superior robustness to image perturbations. Compared to baselines like AEROBLADE and OCC-CLIP, our approach achieves competitive results. Notably, our method ranked Top-3 overall in the Defactify 4 competition, highlighting its effectiveness and generalizability.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yixiong Fang, Tianran Sun, Yuling Shi, Xiaodong Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: While RAG demonstrates remarkable capabilities in LLM applications, its effectiveness is hindered by the ever-increasing length of retrieved contexts, which introduces information redundancy and substantial computational overhead. Existing context pruning methods, such as LLMLingua, lack contextual awareness and offer limited flexibility in controlling compression rates, often resulting in either insufficient pruning or excessive information loss. In this paper, we propose AttentionRAG, an attention-guided context pruning method for RAG systems. The core idea of AttentionRAG lies in its attention focus mechanism, which reformulates RAG queries into a next-token prediction paradigm. This mechanism isolates the query's semantic focus to a single token, enabling precise and efficient attention calculation between queries and retrieved contexts. Extensive experiments on LongBench and Babilong benchmarks show that AttentionRAG achieves up to 6.3$\times$ context compression while outperforming LLMLingua methods by around 10\% in key metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhe Zhao, Haibin Wen, Pengkun Wang, Ye Wei, Zaixi Zhang, Xi Lin, Fei Liu, Bo An, Hui Xiong, Yang Wang, Qingfu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have greatly accelerated the automation of algorithm generation and optimization. However, current methods such as EoH and FunSearch mainly rely on predefined templates and expert-specified functions that focus solely on the local evolution of key functionalities. Consequently, they fail to fully leverage the synergistic benefits of the overall architecture and the potential of global optimization. In this paper, we introduce an end-to-end algorithm generation and optimization framework based on LLMs. Our approach utilizes the deep semantic understanding of LLMs to convert natural language requirements or human-authored papers into code solutions, and employs a two-dimensional co-evolution strategy to optimize both functional and structural aspects. This closed-loop process spans problem analysis, code generation, and global optimization, automatically identifying key algorithm modules for multi-level joint optimization and continually enhancing performance and design innovation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional local optimization approaches in both performance and innovation, while also exhibiting strong adaptability to unknown environments and breakthrough potential in structural design. By building on human research, our framework generates and optimizes novel algorithms that surpass those designed by human experts, broadening the applicability of LLMs for algorithm design and providing a novel solution pathway for automated algorithm development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xu Lingrui, Liu Mandi, Zhang Lei</p>
<p>Abstract: The core challenge in basketball tactic modeling lies in efficiently extracting complex spatial-temporal dependencies from historical data and accurately predicting various in-game events. Existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, primarily based on graph neural networks (GNNs), encounter difficulties in capturing long-term, long-distance, and fine-grained interactions among heterogeneous player nodes, as well as in recognizing interaction patterns. Additionally, they exhibit limited generalization to untrained downstream tasks and zero-shot scenarios. In this work, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Propagation Symmetry-Aware Graph Transformer for fine-grained game modeling. This architecture explicitly captures delay effects in the spatial space to enhance player node representations across discrete-time slices, employing symmetry-invariant priors to guide the attention mechanism. We also introduce an efficient contrastive learning strategy to train a Mixture of Tactics Experts module, facilitating differentiated modeling of offensive tactics. By integrating dense training with sparse inference, we achieve a 2.4x improvement in model efficiency. Moreover, the incorporation of Lightweight Graph Grounding for Large Language Models enables robust performance in open-ended downstream tasks and zero-shot scenarios, including novel teams or players. The proposed model, TacticExpert, delineates a vertically integrated large model framework for basketball, unifying pretraining across multiple datasets and downstream prediction tasks. Fine-grained modeling modules significantly enhance spatial-temporal representations, and visualization analyzes confirm the strong interpretability of the model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yafei Zhang, Murray Wang, Yu Wang, Xiaohui Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Matching job descriptions (JDs) with suitable talent requires models capable of understanding not only textual similarities between JDs and candidate resumes but also contextual factors such as geographical location and academic seniority. To address this challenge, we propose a two-stage training framework for large language models (LLMs). In the first stage, a contrastive learning approach is used to train the model on a dataset constructed from real-world matching rules, such as geographical alignment and research area overlap. While effective, this model primarily learns patterns that defined by the matching rules. In the second stage, we introduce a novel preference-based fine-tuning method inspired by Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), termed Rank Preference Optimization (RankPO), to align the model with AI-curated pairwise preferences emphasizing textual understanding. Our experiments show that while the first-stage model achieves strong performance on rule-based data (nDCG@20 = 0.706), it lacks robust textual understanding (alignment with AI annotations = 0.46). By fine-tuning with RankPO, we achieve a balanced model that retains relatively good performance in the original tasks while significantly improving the alignment with AI preferences.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenpeng Wu, Qiqi Gu, Heng Shi, Jianguo Yao, Haibing Guan</p>
<p>Abstract: The escalating size of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) based Large Language Models (LLMs) presents significant computational and memory challenges, necessitating innovative solutions to enhance efficiency without compromising model accuracy. Structured sparsity emerges as a compelling strategy to address these challenges by leveraging the emerging sparse computing hardware. Prior works mainly focus on the sparsity in model parameters, neglecting the inherent sparse patterns in activations. This oversight can lead to additional computational costs associated with activations, potentially resulting in suboptimal performance.
  This paper presents Samoyeds, an innovative acceleration system for MoE LLMs utilizing Sparse Tensor Cores (SpTCs). Samoyeds is the first to apply sparsity simultaneously to both activations and model parameters. It introduces a bespoke sparse data format tailored for MoE computation and develops a specialized sparse-sparse matrix multiplication kernel. Furthermore, Samoyeds incorporates systematic optimizations specifically designed for the execution of dual-side structured sparse MoE LLMs on SpTCs, further enhancing system performance. Evaluations show that Samoyeds outperforms SOTA works by up to 1.99$\times$ at the kernel level and 1.58$\times$ at the model level. Moreover, it enhances memory efficiency, increasing maximum supported batch sizes by 4.41$\times$ on average. Additionally, Samoyeds surpasses existing SOTA structured sparse solutions in both model accuracy and hardware portability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas Cory, Wolf Rieder, Julia Kr\"amer, Philip Raschke, Patrick Herbke, Axel K\"upper</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring transparency of data practices related to personal information is a fundamental requirement under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), particularly as mandated by Articles 13 and 14. However, assessing compliance at scale remains a challenge due to the complexity and variability of privacy policy language. Manual audits are resource-intensive and inconsistent, while existing automated approaches lack the granularity needed to capture nuanced transparency disclosures.
  In this paper, we introduce a large language model (LLM)-based framework for word-level GDPR transparency compliance annotation. Our approach comprises a two-stage annotation pipeline that combines initial LLM-based annotation with a self-correction mechanism for iterative refinement. This annotation pipeline enables the systematic identification and fine-grained annotation of transparency-related content in privacy policies, aligning with 21 GDPR-derived transparency requirements. To enable large-scale analysis, we compile a dataset of 703,791 English-language policies, from which we generate a sample of 200 manually annotated privacy policies.
  To evaluate our approach, we introduce a two-tiered methodology assessing both label- and span-level annotation performance. We conduct a comparative analysis of eight high-profile LLMs, providing insights into their effectiveness in identifying GDPR transparency disclosures. Our findings contribute to advancing the automation of GDPR compliance assessments and provide valuable resources for future research in privacy policy analysis.</p>

We evaluate models from five leading companies (OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, Mistral, Google) and find that some LLMs are explicitly designed to favor their developers' products and exhibit untruthful communication, among other manipulative behaviors. Companies developing LLMs should recognize and mitigate the impact of dark design patterns to promote more ethical AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Najmeh Miri, Shahrzad Khayatbashi, Jelena Zdravkovic, Amin Jalali</p>
<p>Abstract: Object-Centric Process Mining (OCPM) enables business process analysis from multiple perspectives. For example, an educational path can be examined from the viewpoints of students, teachers, and groups. This analysis depends on Object-Centric Event Data (OCED), which captures relationships between events and object types, representing different perspectives. Unlike traditional process mining techniques, extracting OCED minimizes the need for repeated log extractions when shifting the analytical focus. However, recording these complex relationships increases the complexity of the log extraction process. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a method for extracting OCED based on PM\inst{2}, a well-established process mining framework. Our approach introduces a structured framework that guides data analysts and engineers in extracting OCED for process analysis. We validate this framework by applying it in a real-world educational setting, demonstrating its effectiveness in extracting an Object-Centric Event Log (OCEL), which serves as the standard format for recording OCED, from a learning management system and an administrative grading system.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10737">Commenting Higher-level Code Unit: Full Code, Reduced Code, or Hierarchical Code Summarization</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Weisong Sun, Yiran Zhang, Jie Zhu, Zhihui Wang, Chunrong Fang, Yonglong Zhang, Yebo Feng, Jiangping Huang, Xingya Wang, Zhi Jin, Yang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Commenting code is a crucial activity in software development, as it aids in facilitating future maintenance and updates. To enhance the efficiency of writing comments and reduce developers' workload, researchers has proposed various automated code summarization (ACS) techniques to automatically generate comments/summaries for given code units. However, these ACS techniques primarily focus on generating summaries for code units at the method level. There is a significant lack of research on summarizing higher-level code units, such as file-level and module-level code units, despite the fact that summaries of these higher-level code units are highly useful for quickly gaining a macro-level understanding of software components and architecture. To fill this gap, in this paper, we conduct a systematic study on how to use LLMs for commenting higher-level code units, including file level and module level. These higher-level units are significantly larger than method-level ones, which poses challenges in handling long code inputs within LLM constraints and maintaining efficiency. To address these issues, we explore various summarization strategies for ACS of higher-level code units, which can be divided into three types: full code summarization, reduced code summarization, and hierarchical code summarization. The experimental results suggest that for summarizing file-level code units, using the full code is the most effective approach, with reduced code serving as a cost-efficient alternative. However, for summarizing module-level code units, hierarchical code summarization becomes the most promising strategy. In addition, inspired by the research on method-level ACS, we also investigate using the LLM as an evaluator to evaluate the quality of summaries of higher-level code units. The experimental results demonstrate that the LLM's evaluation results strongly correlate with human evaluations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Omar Costilla-Reyes, Morgan Talbot</p>
<p>Abstract: Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD) is a highly prevalent and frequently underdiagnosed condition characterized by persistent, intrusive preoccupations with perceived defects in physical appearance. In this extended analysis, we employ multiple machine learning approaches to predict treatment outcomes -- specifically treatment response and remission -- with an emphasis on interpretability to ensure clinical relevance and utility. Across the various models investigated, treatment credibility emerged as the most potent predictor, surpassing traditional markers such as baseline symptom severity or comorbid conditions. Notably, while simpler models (e.g., logistic regression and support vector machines) achieved competitive predictive performance, decision tree analyses provided unique insights by revealing clinically interpretable threshold values in credibility scores. These thresholds can serve as practical guideposts for clinicians when tailoring interventions or allocating treatment resources. We further contextualize our findings within the broader literature on BDD, addressing technology-based therapeutics, digital interventions, and the psychosocial determinants of treatment engagement. An extensive array of references situates our results within current research on BDD prevalence, suicidality risks, and digital innovation. Our work underscores the potential of integrating rigorous statistical methodologies with transparent machine learning models. By systematically identifying modifiable predictors -- such as treatment credibility -- we propose a pathway toward more targeted, personalized, and ultimately efficacious interventions for individuals with BDD.</p>

<p>Abstract: Progress in 3D vision-language learning has been hindered by the scarcity of large-scale 3D datasets. We introduce UniVLG, a unified architecture for 2D and 3D vision-language understanding that bridges the gap between existing 2D-centric models and the rich 3D sensory data available in embodied systems. Our approach initializes most model weights from pre-trained 2D models and trains on both 2D and 3D vision-language data. We propose a novel language-conditioned mask decoder shared across 2D and 3D modalities to ground objects effectively in both RGB and RGB-D images, outperforming box-based approaches. To further reduce the domain gap between 2D and 3D, we incorporate 2D-to-3D lifting strategies, enabling UniVLG to utilize 2D data to enhance 3D performance. With these innovations, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple 3D vision-language grounding tasks, demonstrating the potential of transferring advances from 2D vision-language learning to the data-constrained 3D domain. Furthermore, co-training on both 2D and 3D data enhances performance across modalities without sacrificing 2D capabilities. By removing the reliance on 3D mesh reconstruction and ground-truth object proposals, UniVLG sets a new standard for realistic, embodied-aligned evaluation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Norbert Tihanyi, Tamas Bisztray, Mohamed Amine Ferrag, Bilel Cherif, Richard A. Dubniczky, Ridhi Jain, Lucas C. Cordeiro</p>
<p>Abstract: Software testing and verification are critical for ensuring the reliability and security of modern software systems. Traditionally, formal verification techniques, such as model checking and theorem proving, have provided rigorous frameworks for detecting bugs and vulnerabilities. However, these methods often face scalability challenges when applied to complex, real-world programs. Recently, the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced a new paradigm for software analysis, leveraging their ability to understand insecure coding practices. Although LLMs demonstrate promising capabilities in tasks such as bug prediction and invariant generation, they lack the formal guarantees of classical methods. This paper presents a comprehensive study of state-of-the-art software testing and verification, focusing on three key approaches: classical formal methods, LLM-based analysis, and emerging hybrid techniques, which combine their strengths. We explore each approach's strengths, limitations, and practical applications, highlighting the potential of hybrid systems to address the weaknesses of standalone methods. We analyze whether integrating formal rigor with LLM-driven insights can enhance the effectiveness and scalability of software verification, exploring their viability as a pathway toward more robust and adaptive testing frameworks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Byzantine attacks present a critical challenge to Federated Learning (FL), where malicious participants can disrupt the training process, degrade model accuracy, and compromise system reliability. Traditional FL frameworks typically rely on aggregation-based protocols for model updates, leaving them vulnerable to sophisticated adversarial strategies. In this paper, we demonstrate that distributed optimization offers a principled and robust alternative to aggregation-centric methods. Specifically, we show that the Primal-Dual Method of Multipliers (PDMM) inherently mitigates Byzantine impacts by leveraging its fault-tolerant consensus mechanism. Through extensive experiments on three datasets (MNIST, FashionMNIST, and Olivetti), under various attack scenarios including bit-flipping and Gaussian noise injection, we validate the superior resilience of distributed optimization protocols. Compared to traditional aggregation-centric approaches, PDMM achieves higher model utility, faster convergence, and improved stability. Our results highlight the effectiveness of distributed optimization in defending against Byzantine threats, paving the way for more secure and resilient federated learning systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite the promising results of large multimodal models (LMMs) in complex vision-language tasks that require knowledge, reasoning, and perception abilities together, we surprisingly found that these models struggle with simple tasks on infographics that require perception only. As existing benchmarks primarily focus on end tasks that require various abilities, they provide limited, fine-grained insights into the limitations of the models' perception abilities. To address this gap, we leverage the theory of graphical perception, an approach used to study how humans decode visual information encoded on charts and graphs, to develop an evaluation framework for analyzing gaps in LMMs' perception abilities in charts. With automated task generation and response evaluation designs, our framework enables comprehensive and controlled testing of LMMs' graphical perception across diverse chart types, visual elements, and task types. We apply our framework to evaluate and diagnose the perception capabilities of state-of-the-art LMMs at three granularity levels (chart, visual element, and pixel). Our findings underscore several critical limitations of current state-of-the-art LMMs, including GPT-4o: their inability to (1) generalize across chart types, (2) understand fundamental visual elements, and (3) cross reference values within a chart. These insights provide guidance for future improvements in perception abilities of LMMs. The evaluation framework and labeled data are publicly available at https://github.com/microsoft/lmm-graphical-perception.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benjamin David Winter, William John Teahan</p>
<p>Abstract: The choice of neural network features can have a large impact on both the accuracy and speed of the network. Despite the current industry shift towards large transformer models, specialized binary classifiers remain critical for numerous practical applications where computational efficiency and low latency are essential. Neural network features tend to be developed homogeneously, resulting in slower or less accurate networks when testing against multiple datasets. In this paper, we show the effectiveness of Neuvo NAS+ a novel Python implementation of an extended Neural Architecture Search (NAS+) which allows the user to optimise the training parameters of a network as well as the network's architecture. We provide an in-depth analysis of the importance of catering a network's architecture to each dataset. We also describe the design of the Neuvo NAS+ system that selects network features on a task-specific basis including network training hyper-parameters such as the number of epochs and batch size. Results show that the Neuvo NAS+ task-specific approach significantly outperforms several machine learning approaches such as Naive Bayes, C4.5, Support Vector Machine and a standard Artificial Neural Network for solving a range of binary classification problems in terms of accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate substantial diversity in evolved network architectures across different datasets, confirming the value of task-specific optimization. Additionally, Neuvo NAS+ outperforms other evolutionary algorithm optimisers in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency, showing that properly optimized binary classifiers can match or exceed the performance of more complex models while requiring significantly fewer computational resources.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangyu Yin, Yi Qi, Jinwei Hu, Zhen Chen, Yi Dong, Xingyu Zhao, Xiaowei Huang, Wenjie Ruan</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive inference capabilities, but remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that can induce harmful or unethical responses. Existing defence methods are predominantly white-box approaches that require access to model parameters and extensive modifications, making them costly and impractical for many real-world scenarios. Although some black-box defences have been proposed, they often impose input constraints or require multiple queries, limiting their effectiveness in safety-critical tasks such as autonomous driving. To address these challenges, we propose a novel black-box defence framework called \textbf{T}extual \textbf{A}nchoring for \textbf{I}mmunizing \textbf{J}ailbreak \textbf{I}mages (\textbf{TAIJI}). TAIJI leverages key phrase-based textual anchoring to enhance the model's ability to assess and mitigate the harmful content embedded within both visual and textual prompts. Unlike existing methods, TAIJI operates effectively with a single query during inference, while preserving the VLM's performance on benign tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TAIJI significantly enhances the safety and reliability of VLMs, providing a practical and efficient solution for real-world deployment.</p>

<p>Abstract: Activation functions play a critical role in the performance and behaviour of neural networks, significantly impacting their ability to learn and generalise. Traditional activation functions, such as ReLU, sigmoid, and tanh, have been widely used with considerable success. However, these functions may not always provide optimal performance for all tasks and datasets. In this paper, we introduce Neuvo GEAF - an innovative approach leveraging grammatical evolution (GE) to automatically evolve novel activation functions tailored to specific neural network architectures and datasets. Experiments conducted on well-known binary classification datasets show statistically significant improvements in F1-score (between 2.4% and 9.4%) over ReLU using identical network architectures. Notably, these performance gains were achieved without increasing the network's parameter count, supporting the trend toward more efficient neural networks that can operate effectively on resource-constrained edge devices. This paper's findings suggest that evolved activation functions can provide significant performance improvements for compact networks while maintaining energy efficiency during both training and inference phases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nathaniel Lesperance, Sujeevan Ratnasingham, Graham W. Taylor</p>
<p>Abstract: In the context of pressing climate change challenges and the significant biodiversity loss among arthropods, automated taxonomic classification from organismal images is a subject of intense research. However, traditional AI pipelines based on deep neural visual architectures such as CNNs or ViTs face limitations such as degraded performance on the long-tail of classes and the inability to reason about their predictions. We integrate image captioning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) to enhance biodiversity monitoring, showing particular promise for characterizing rare and unknown arthropod species. While a naive Vision-Language Model (VLM) excels in classifying images of common species, the RAG model enables classification of rarer taxa by matching explicit textual descriptions of taxonomic features to contextual biodiversity text data from external sources. The RAG model shows promise in reducing overconfidence and enhancing accuracy relative to naive LLMs, suggesting its viability in capturing the nuances of taxonomic hierarchy, particularly at the challenging family and genus levels. Our findings highlight the potential for modern vision-language AI pipelines to support biodiversity conservation initiatives, emphasizing the role of comprehensive data curation and collaboration with citizen science platforms to improve species identification, unknown species characterization and ultimately inform conservation strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiuding Sun, Jing Huang, Sidharth Baskaran, Karel D'Oosterlinck, Christopher Potts, Michael Sklar, Atticus Geiger</p>
<p>Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability has made great strides in identifying neural network features (e.g., directions in hidden activation space) that mediate concepts(e.g., the birth year of a person) and enable predictable manipulation. Distributed alignment search (DAS) leverages supervision from counterfactual data to learn concept features within hidden states, but DAS assumes we can afford to conduct a brute force search over potential feature locations. To address this, we present HyperDAS, a transformer-based hypernetwork architecture that (1) automatically locates the token-positions of the residual stream that a concept is realized in and (2) constructs features of those residual stream vectors for the concept. In experiments with Llama3-8B, HyperDAS achieves state-of-the-art performance on the RAVEL benchmark for disentangling concepts in hidden states. In addition, we review the design decisions we made to mitigate the concern that HyperDAS (like all powerful interpretabilty methods) might inject new information into the target model rather than faithfully interpreting it.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xueting Luo, Hao Deng, Jihong Yang, Yao Shen, Huanhuan Guo, Zhiyuan Sun, Mingqing Liu, Jiming Wei, Shengjie Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: The necessity of achieving an effective balance between minimizing the losses associated with restricting human mobility and ensuring hospital capacity has gained significant attention in the aftermath of COVID-19. Reinforcement learning (RL)-based strategies for human mobility management have recently advanced in addressing the dynamic evolution of cities and epidemics; however, they still face challenges in achieving coordinated control at the township level and adapting to cities of varying scales. To address the above issues, we propose a multi-agent RL approach that achieves Pareto optimality in managing hospital capacity and human mobility (H2-MARL), applicable across cities of different scales. We first develop a township-level infection model with online-updatable parameters to simulate disease transmission and construct a city-wide dynamic spatiotemporal epidemic simulator. On this basis, H2-MARL is designed to treat each division as an agent, with a trade-off dual-objective reward function formulated and an experience replay buffer enriched with expert knowledge built. To evaluate the effectiveness of the model, we construct a township-level human mobility dataset containing over one billion records from four representative cities of varying scales. Extensive experiments demonstrate that H2-MARL has the optimal dual-objective trade-off capability, which can minimize hospital capacity strain while minimizing human mobility restriction loss. Meanwhile, the applicability of the proposed model to epidemic control in cities of varying scales is verified, which showcases its feasibility and versatility in practical applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benjamin David Winter, William J. Teahan</p>
<p>Abstract: When employing an evolutionary algorithm to optimize a neural networks architecture, developers face the added challenge of tuning the evolutionary algorithm's own hyperparameters - population size, mutation rate, cloning rate, and number of generations. This paper introduces Neuvo Ecological Neural Architecture Search (ENAS), a novel method that incorporates these evolutionary parameters directly into the candidate solutions' phenotypes, allowing them to evolve dynamically alongside architecture specifications. Experimental results across four binary classification datasets demonstrate that ENAS not only eliminates manual tuning of evolutionary parameters but also outperforms competitor NAS methodologies in convergence speed (reducing computational time by 18.3%) and accuracy (improving classification performance in 3 out of 4 datasets). By enabling "greedy individuals" to optimize resource allocation based on fitness, ENAS provides an efficient, self-regulating approach to neural architecture search.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linfeng Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have become an integral part of our daily lives, especially in vision-related applications. However, the conventional lossy image compression algorithms are primarily designed for the Human Vision System (HVS), which can non-trivially compromise the DNNs' validation accuracy after compression, as noted in \cite{liu2018deepn}. Thus developing an image compression algorithm for both human and machine (DNNs) is on the horizon.
  To address the challenge mentioned above, in this paper, we first formulate the image compression as a multi-objective optimization problem which take both human and machine prespectives into account, then we solve it by linear combination, and proposed a novel distortion measure for both human and machine, dubbed Human and Machine-Oriented Error (HMOE). After that, we develop Human And Machine Oriented Soft Decision Quantization (HMOSDQ) based on HMOE, a lossy image compression algorithm for both human and machine (DNNs), and fully complied with JPEG format. In order to evaluate the performance of HMOSDQ, finally we conduct the experiments for two pre-trained well-known DNN-based image classifiers named Alexnet \cite{Alexnet} and VGG-16 \cite{simonyan2014VGG} on two subsets of the ImageNet \cite{deng2009imagenet} validation set: one subset included images with shorter side in the range of 496 to 512, while the other included images with shorter side in the range of 376 to 384. Our results demonstrate that HMOSDQ outperforms the default JPEG algorithm in terms of rate-accuracy and rate-distortion performance. For the Alexnet comparing with the default JPEG algorithm, HMOSDQ can improve the validation accuracy by more than $0.81\%$ at $0.61$ BPP, or equivalently reduce the compression rate of default JPEG by $9.6\times$ while maintaining the same validation accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abeda Sultana, Nabin Pakka, Fei Xu, Xu Yuan, Li Chen, Nian-Feng Tzeng</p>
<p>Abstract: Scheduling deep learning (DL) models to train on powerful clusters with accelerators like GPUs and TPUs, presently falls short, either lacking fine-grained heterogeneity awareness or leaving resources substantially under-utilized. To fill this gap, we propose a novel design of a task-level heterogeneity-aware scheduler, {\em Hadar}, based on an optimization framework that can boost resource utilization. {\em Hadar} leverages the performance traits of DL jobs on a heterogeneous DL cluster, characterizes the task-level performance heterogeneity in the optimization problem, and makes scheduling decisions across both spatial and temporal dimensions. %with the objective to reduce the average job completion time of DL jobs. It involves the primal-dual framework employing a dual subroutine, to solve the optimization problem and guide the scheduling design. Our trace-driven simulation with representative DL model training workloads demonstrates that {\em Hadar} accelerates the total time duration by 1.20$\times$ when compared with its state-of-the-art heterogeneity-aware counterpart, Gavel. Further, our {\em Hadar} scheduler is enhanced to {\em HadarE} by forking each job into multiple copies to let a job train concurrently on heterogeneous GPUs resided on separate available nodes (i.e., machines or servers) for resource utilization enhancement. {\em HadarE} is evaluated extensively on physical DL clusters for comparison with {\em Hadar} and Gavel. With substantial enhancement in cluster resource utilization (by 1.45$\times$), {\em HadarE} exhibits considerable speed-ups in DL model training, reducing the total time duration by 50\% (or 80\%) on an Amazon's AWS (or our lab) cluster, while producing trained DL models with consistently better inference quality than those trained by \textit{Hadar}.</p>

<p>Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced natural language processing, aligning them with human preferences remains an open challenge. Although current alignment methods rely primarily on explicit feedback, eye-tracking (ET) data offers insights into real-time cognitive processing during reading. In this paper, we present OASST-ETC, a novel eye-tracking corpus capturing reading patterns from 24 participants, while evaluating LLM-generated responses from the OASST1 dataset. Our analysis reveals distinct reading patterns between preferred and non-preferred responses, which we compare with synthetic eye-tracking data. Furthermore, we examine the correlation between human reading measures and attention patterns from various transformer-based models, discovering stronger correlations in preferred responses. This work introduces a unique resource for studying human cognitive processing in LLM evaluation and suggests promising directions for incorporating eye-tracking data into alignment methods. The dataset and analysis code are publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyu Zhang, Raghavendra Ramachandra, Kiran Raja, Christoph Busch</p>
<p>Abstract: Face Recognition Systems (FRS) are increasingly vulnerable to face-morphing attacks, prompting the development of Morphing Attack Detection (MAD) algorithms. However, a key challenge in MAD lies in its limited generalizability to unseen data and its lack of explainability-critical for practical application environments such as enrolment stations and automated border control systems. Recognizing that most existing MAD algorithms rely on supervised learning paradigms, this work explores a novel approach to MAD using zero-shot learning leveraged on Large Language Models (LLMs). We propose two types of zero-shot MAD algorithms: one leveraging general vision models and the other utilizing multimodal LLMs. For general vision models, we address the MAD task by computing the mean support embedding of an independent support set without using morphed images. For the LLM-based approach, we employ the state-of-the-art GPT-4 Turbo API with carefully crafted prompts. To evaluate the feasibility of zero-shot MAD and the effectiveness of the proposed methods, we constructed a print-scan morph dataset featuring various unseen morphing algorithms, simulating challenging real-world application scenarios. Experimental results demonstrated notable detection accuracy, validating the applicability of zero-shot learning for MAD tasks. Additionally, our investigation into LLM-based MAD revealed that multimodal LLMs, such as ChatGPT, exhibit remarkable generalizability to untrained MAD tasks. Furthermore, they possess a unique ability to provide explanations and guidance, which can enhance transparency and usability for end-users in practical applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juan Felipe Gomez, Bogdan Kulynych, Georgios Kaissis, Jamie Hayes, Borja Balle, Antti Honkela</p>
<p>Abstract: Current practices for reporting the level of differential privacy (DP) guarantees for machine learning (ML) algorithms provide an incomplete and potentially misleading picture of the guarantees and make it difficult to compare privacy levels across different settings. We argue for using Gaussian differential privacy (GDP) as the primary means of communicating DP guarantees in ML, with the full privacy profile as a secondary option in case GDP is too inaccurate. Unlike other widely used alternatives, GDP has only one parameter, which ensures easy comparability of guarantees, and it can accurately capture the full privacy profile of many important ML applications. To support our claims, we investigate the privacy profiles of state-of-the-art DP large-scale image classification, and the TopDown algorithm for the U.S. Decennial Census, observing that GDP fits the profiles remarkably well in all three cases. Although GDP is ideal for reporting the final guarantees, other formalisms (e.g., privacy loss random variables) are needed for accurate privacy accounting. We show that such intermediate representations can be efficiently converted to GDP with minimal loss in tightness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Josip Josifovski, Shangding Gu, Mohammadhossein Malmir, Haoliang Huang, Sayantan Auddy, Nicol\'as Navarro-Guerrero, Costas Spanos, Alois Knoll</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain randomization has emerged as a fundamental technique in reinforcement learning (RL) to facilitate the transfer of policies from simulation to real-world robotic applications. Many existing domain randomization approaches have been proposed to improve robustness and sim2real transfer. These approaches rely on wide randomization ranges to compensate for the unknown actual system parameters, leading to robust but inefficient real-world policies. In addition, the policies pretrained in the domain-randomized simulation are fixed after deployment due to the inherent instability of the optimization processes based on RL and the necessity of sampling exploitative but potentially unsafe actions on the real system. This limits the adaptability of the deployed policy to the inevitably changing system parameters or environment dynamics over time. We leverage safe RL and continual learning under domain-randomized simulation to address these limitations and enable safe deployment-time policy adaptation in real-world robot control. The experiments show that our method enables the policy to adapt and fit to the current domain distribution and environment dynamics of the real system while minimizing safety risks and avoiding issues like catastrophic forgetting of the general policy found in randomized simulation during the pretraining phase.

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10954">Empirical Computation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Eric Tang, Marcel B\"ohme</p>
<p>Abstract: In this vision paper, we explore the challenges and opportunities of a form of computation that employs an empirical (rather than a formal) approach, where the solution of a computational problem is returned as empirically most likely (rather than necessarily correct). We call this approach as *empirical computation* and observe that its capabilities and limits *cannot* be understood within the classic, rationalist framework of computation.
  While we take a very broad view of "computational problem", a classic, well-studied example is *sorting*: Given a set of $n$ numbers, return these numbers sorted in ascending order.
  * To run a classical, *formal computation*, we might first think about a *specific algorithm* (e.g., merge sort) before developing a *specific* program that implements it. The program will expect the input to be given in a *specific* format, type, or data structure (e.g., unsigned 32-bit integers). In software engineering, we have many approaches to analyze the correctness of such programs. From complexity theory, we know that there exists no correct program that can solve the average instance of the sorting problem faster than $O(n\log n)$.
  * To run an *empirical computation*, we might directly ask a large language model (LLM) to solve *any* computational problem (which can be stated informally in natural language) and provide the input in *any* format (e.g., negative numbers written as Chinese characters). There is no (problem-specific) program that could be analyzed for correctness. Also, the time it takes an LLM to return an answer is entirely *independent* of the computational complexity of the problem that is solved.
  What are the capabilities or limits of empirical computation in the general, in the problem-, or in the instance-specific? Our purpose is to establish empirical computation as a field in SE that is timely and rich with interesting problems.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present OuroMamba, the first data-free post-training quantization (DFQ) method for vision Mamba-based models (VMMs). We identify two key challenges in enabling DFQ for VMMs, (1) VMM's recurrent state transitions restricts capturing of long-range interactions and leads to semantically weak synthetic data, (2) VMM activations exhibit dynamic outlier variations across time-steps, rendering existing static PTQ techniques ineffective. To address these challenges, OuroMamba presents a two-stage framework: (1) OuroMamba-Gen to generate semantically rich and meaningful synthetic data. It applies contrastive learning on patch level VMM features generated through neighborhood interactions in the latent state space, (2) OuroMamba-Quant to employ mixed-precision quantization with lightweight dynamic outlier detection during inference. In specific, we present a thresholding based outlier channel selection strategy for activations that gets updated every time-step. Extensive experiments across vision and generative tasks show that our data-free OuroMamba surpasses existing data-driven PTQ techniques, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse quantization settings. Additionally, we implement efficient GPU kernels to achieve practical latency speedup of up to 2.36x. Code will be released soon.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanti Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: The problem of the priors is well known: it concerns the challenge of identifying norms that govern one's prior credences. I argue that a key to addressing this problem lies in considering what I call the problem of the posteriors -- the challenge of identifying norms that directly govern one's posterior credences, which then induce constraints on the priors via the diachronic requirement of conditionalization. This forward-looking approach can be summarized as: Think ahead, work backward. Although this idea can be traced to Freedman (1963), Carnap (1963), and Shimony (1970), it has received little attention in philosophy. In this paper, I initiate a systematic defense of forward-looking Bayesianism, addressing potential objections from more traditional views (both subjectivist and objectivist) and arguing for its advantages. In particular, I develop a specific approach to forward-looking Bayesianism -- one that treats the convergence of posterior credences to the truth as a fundamental rather than derived normative requirement. This approach, called convergentist Bayesianism, is argued to be crucial for a Bayesian foundation of Ockham's razor and related inference methods in statistics and machine learning.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel image-goal navigation approach, named RFSG. Our focus lies in leveraging the fine-grained connections between goals, observations, and the environment within limited image data, all the while keeping the navigation architecture simple and lightweight. To this end, we propose the spatial-channel attention mechanism, enabling the network to learn the importance of multi-dimensional features to fuse the goal and observation features. In addition, a selfdistillation mechanism is incorporated to further enhance the feature representation capabilities. Given that the navigation task needs surrounding environmental information for more efficient navigation, we propose an image scene graph to establish feature associations at both the image and object levels, effectively encoding the surrounding scene information. Crossscene performance validation was conducted on the Gibson and HM3D datasets, and the proposed method achieved stateof-the-art results among mainstream methods, with a speed of up to 53.5 frames per second on an RTX3080. This contributes to the realization of end-to-end image-goal navigation in realworld scenarios.

<p>Abstract: Writing Assistants (e.g., Grammarly, Microsoft Copilot) traditionally generate diverse image captions by employing syntactic and semantic variations to describe image components. However, human-written captions prioritize conveying a central message alongside visual descriptions using pragmatic cues. To enhance pragmatic diversity, it is essential to explore alternative ways of communicating these messages in conjunction with visual content. To address this challenge, we propose RONA, a novel prompting strategy for Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLM) that leverages Coherence Relations as an axis for variation. We demonstrate that RONA generates captions with better overall diversity and ground-truth alignment, compared to MLLM baselines across multiple domains.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Xie, Binkai Ou, Fei Ma, Yaohua Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision and Language Navigation (VLN) requires an agent to navigate through environments following natural language instructions. However, existing methods often struggle with effectively integrating visual observations and instruction details during navigation, leading to suboptimal path planning and limited success rates. In this paper, we propose OIKG (Observation-graph Interaction and Key-detail Guidance), a novel framework that addresses these limitations through two key components: (1) an observation-graph interaction module that decouples angular and visual information while strengthening edge representations in the navigation space, and (2) a key-detail guidance module that dynamically extracts and utilizes fine-grained location and object information from instructions. By enabling more precise cross-modal alignment and dynamic instruction interpretation, our approach significantly improves the agent's ability to follow complex navigation instructions. Extensive experiments on the R2R and RxR datasets demonstrate that OIKG achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple evaluation metrics, validating the effectiveness of our method in enhancing navigation precision through better observation-instruction alignment.</p>

<p>Abstract: The DARPA Transfer from Imprecise and Abstract Models to Autonomous Technologies (TIAMAT) program aims to address rapid and robust transfer of autonomy technologies across dynamic and complex environments, goals, and platforms. Existing methods for simulation-to-reality (sim-to-real) transfer often rely on high-fidelity simulations and struggle with broad adaptation, particularly in time-sensitive scenarios. Although many approaches have shown incredible performance at specific tasks, most techniques fall short when posed with unforeseen, complex, and dynamic real-world scenarios due to the inherent limitations of simulation. In contrast to current research that aims to bridge the gap between simulation environments and the real world through increasingly sophisticated simulations and a combination of methods typically assuming a small sim-to-real gap -- such as domain randomization, domain adaptation, imitation learning, meta-learning, policy distillation, and dynamic optimization -- TIAMAT takes a different approach by instead emphasizing transfer and adaptation of the autonomy stack directly to real-world environments by utilizing a breadth of low(er)-fidelity simulations to create broadly effective sim-to-real transfers. By abstractly learning from multiple simulation environments in reference to their shared semantics, TIAMAT's approaches aim to achieve abstract-to-real transfer for effective and rapid real-world adaptation. Furthermore, this program endeavors to improve the overall autonomy pipeline by addressing the inherent challenges in translating simulated behaviors into effective real-world performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ming Deng, Sijin Sun, Zihao Li, Xiaochuan Hu, Xing Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) is challenging due to the strong similarity between camouflaged objects and their surroundings, which complicates identification. Existing methods mainly rely on spatial local features, failing to capture global information, while Transformers increase computational costs.To address this, the Frequency-Assisted Mamba-Like Linear Attention Network (FMNet) is proposed, which leverages frequency-domain learning to efficiently capture global features and mitigate ambiguity between objects and the background. FMNet introduces the Multi-Scale Frequency-Assisted Mamba-Like Linear Attention (MFM) module, integrating frequency and spatial features through a multi-scale structure to handle scale variations while reducing computational complexity. Additionally, the Pyramidal Frequency Attention Extraction (PFAE) module and the Frequency Reverse Decoder (FRD) enhance semantics and reconstruct features. Experimental results demonstrate that FMNet outperforms existing methods on multiple COD datasets, showcasing its advantages in both performance and efficiency.

<p>Abstract: This study aims to develop surrogate models for accelerating decision making processes associated with carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies. Selection of sub-surface $CO_2$ storage sites often necessitates expensive and involved simulations of $CO_2$ flow fields. Here, we develop a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) based model for real-time, high-resolution simulation of $CO_2$ plume migration. The model is trained on a comprehensive dataset generated from realistic subsurface parameters and offers $O(10^5)$ computational acceleration with minimal sacrifice in prediction accuracy. We also explore super-resolution experiments to improve the computational cost of training the FNO based models. Additionally, we present various strategies for improving the reliability of predictions from the model, which is crucial while assessing actual geological sites. This novel framework, based on NVIDIA's Modulus library, will allow rapid screening of sites for CCS. The discussed workflows and strategies can be applied to other energy solutions like geothermal reservoir modeling and hydrogen storage. Our work scales scientific machine learning models to realistic 3D systems that are more consistent with real-life subsurface aquifers/reservoirs, paving the way for next-generation digital twins for subsurface CCS applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ning-Yuan Georgia Liu, Flower Yang, Mohammad S. Jalali</p>
<p>Abstract: Causal graphs are commonly used to understand and model complex systems. Researchers often construct these graphs from different perspectives, leading to significant variations for the same problem. Comparing causal graphs is, therefore, essential for evaluating assumptions, integrating insights, and resolving disagreements. The rise of AI tools has further amplified this need, as they are increasingly used to generate hypothesized causal graphs by synthesizing information from various sources such as prior research and community inputs, providing the potential for automating and scaling causal modeling for complex systems. Similar to humans, these tools also produce inconsistent results across platforms, versions, and iterations. Despite its importance, research on causal graph comparison remains scarce. Existing methods often focus solely on structural similarities, assuming identical variable names, and fail to capture nuanced semantic relationships, which is essential for causal graph comparison. We address these gaps by investigating methods for comparing causal graphs from both semantic and structural perspectives. First, we reviewed over 40 existing metrics and, based on predefined criteria, selected nine for evaluation from two threads of machine learning: four semantic similarity metrics and five learning graph kernels. We discuss the usability of these metrics in simple examples to illustrate their strengths and limitations. We then generated a synthetic dataset of 2,000 causal graphs using generative AI based on a reference diagram. Our findings reveal that each metric captures a different aspect of similarity, highlighting the need to use multiple metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hoang V. Tran, Khoi N. M. Nguyen, Trang Pham, Thanh T. Chu, Tam Le, Tan M. Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: To overcome computational challenges of Optimal Transport (OT), several variants of Sliced Wasserstein (SW) has been developed in the literature. These approaches exploit the closed-form expression of the univariate OT by projecting measures onto (one-dimensional) lines. However, projecting measures onto low-dimensional spaces can lead to a loss of topological information. Tree-Sliced Wasserstein distance on Systems of Lines (TSW-SL) has emerged as a promising alternative that replaces these lines with a more advanced structure called tree systems. The tree structures enhance the ability to capture topological information of the metric while preserving computational efficiency. However, at the core of TSW-SL, the splitting maps, which serve as the mechanism for pushing forward measures onto tree systems, focus solely on the position of the measure supports while disregarding the projecting domains. Moreover, the specific splitting map used in TSW-SL leads to a metric that is not invariant under Euclidean transformations, a typically expected property for OT on Euclidean space. In this work, we propose a novel class of splitting maps that generalizes the existing one studied in TSW-SL enabling the use of all positional information from input measures, resulting in a novel Distance-based Tree-Sliced Wasserstein (Db-TSW) distance. In addition, we introduce a simple tree sampling process better suited for Db-TSW, leading to an efficient GPU-friendly implementation for tree systems, similar to the original SW. We also provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis of proposed class of splitting maps to verify the injectivity of the corresponding Radon Transform, and demonstrate that Db-TSW is an Euclidean invariant metric. We empirically show that Db-TSW significantly improves accuracy compared to recent SW variants while maintaining low computational cost via a wide range of experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peter B\"ohm, Archie C. Chapman, Pauline Pounds</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work we present Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) training of directional locomotion for low-cost quadrupedal robots in the real world. In particular, we exploit randomization of heading that the robot must follow to foster exploration of action-state transitions most useful for learning both forward locomotion as well as course adjustments. Changing the heading in episode resets to current yaw plus a random value drawn from a normal distribution yields policies able to follow complex trajectories involving frequent turns in both directions as well as long straight-line stretches. By repeatedly changing the heading, this method keeps the robot moving within the training platform and thus reduces human involvement and need for manual resets during the training. Real world experiments on a custom-built, low-cost quadruped demonstrate the efficacy of our method with the robot successfully navigating all validation tests. When trained with other approaches, the robot only succeeds in forward locomotion test and fails when turning is required.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has had success in virtual and simulated domains, but due to key differences between simulated and real-world environments, DRL-trained policies have had limited success in real-world applications. To assist researchers to bridge the \textit{sim-to-real gap}, in this paper, we describe a low-cost physical inverted pendulum apparatus and software environment for exploring sim-to-real DRL methods. In particular, the design of our apparatus enables detailed examination of the delays that arise in physical systems when sensing, communicating, learning, inferring and actuating. Moreover, we wish to improve access to educational systems, so our apparatus uses readily available materials and parts to reduce cost and logistical barriers. Our design shows how commercial, off-the-shelf electronics and electromechanical and sensor systems, combined with common metal extrusions, dowel and 3D printed couplings provide a pathway for affordable physical DRL apparatus. The physical apparatus is complemented with a simulated environment implemented using a high-fidelity physics engine and OpenAI Gym interface.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pingrui Zhang, Xianqiang Gao, Yuhan Wu, Kehui Liu, Dong Wang, Zhigang Wang, Bin Zhao, Yan Ding, Xuelong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: In mobile manipulation, navigation and manipulation are often treated as separate problems, resulting in a significant gap between merely approaching an object and engaging with it effectively. Many navigation approaches primarily define success by proximity to the target, often overlooking the necessity for optimal positioning that facilitates subsequent manipulation. To address this, we introduce MoMa-Kitchen, a benchmark dataset comprising over 100k samples that provide training data for models to learn optimal final navigation positions for seamless transition to manipulation. Our dataset includes affordance-grounded floor labels collected from diverse kitchen environments, in which robotic mobile manipulators of different models attempt to grasp target objects amidst clutter. Using a fully automated pipeline, we simulate diverse real-world scenarios and generate affordance labels for optimal manipulation positions. Visual data are collected from RGB-D inputs captured by a first-person view camera mounted on the robotic arm, ensuring consistency in viewpoint during data collection. We also develop a lightweight baseline model, NavAff, for navigation affordance grounding that demonstrates promising performance on the MoMa-Kitchen benchmark. Our approach enables models to learn affordance-based final positioning that accommodates different arm types and platform heights, thereby paving the way for more robust and generalizable integration of navigation and manipulation in embodied AI.

<p>Abstract: Graph learning plays a vital role in mining and analyzing complex relationships involved in graph data, which is widely used in many real-world applications like transaction networks and communication networks. Foundation models in CV and NLP have shown powerful cross-domain capabilities that are also significant in graph domains. However, existing graph learning approaches struggle with cross-domain tasks. Inspired by successes in CV and NLP, cross-domain graph learning has once again become a focal point of attention to realizing true graph foundation models. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review and analysis of existing works on cross-domain graph learning. Concretely, we first propose a new taxonomy, categorizing existing approaches based on the learned cross-domain information: structure, feature, and structure-feature mixture. Next, we systematically survey representative methods in these categories. Finally, we discuss the remaining limitations of existing studies and highlight promising avenues for future research.

<p>Abstract: While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made groundbreaking progress in embodied intelligence, they still face significant challenges in spatial reasoning for complex long-horizon tasks. To address this gap, we propose EmbodiedVSR (Embodied Visual Spatial Reasoning), a novel framework that integrates dynamic scene graph-guided Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to enhance spatial understanding for embodied agents. By explicitly constructing structured knowledge representations through dynamic scene graphs, our method enables zero-shot spatial reasoning without task-specific fine-tuning. This approach not only disentangles intricate spatial relationships but also aligns reasoning steps with actionable environmental dynamics. To rigorously evaluate performance, we introduce the eSpatial-Benchmark, a comprehensive dataset including real-world embodied scenarios with fine-grained spatial annotations and adaptive task difficulty levels. Experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing MLLM-based methods in accuracy and reasoning coherence, particularly in long-horizon tasks requiring iterative environment interaction. The results reveal the untapped potential of MLLMs for embodied intelligence when equipped with structured, explainable reasoning mechanisms, paving the way for more reliable deployment in real-world spatial applications. The codes and datasets will be released soon.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> He Zhang, Xinyi Fu, John M. Carroll</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional image annotation tasks rely heavily on human effort for object selection and label assignment, making the process time-consuming and prone to decreased efficiency as annotators experience fatigue after extensive work. This paper introduces a novel framework that leverages the visual understanding capabilities of large multimodal models (LMMs), particularly GPT, to assist annotation workflows. In our proposed approach, human annotators focus on selecting objects via bounding boxes, while the LMM autonomously generates relevant labels. This human-AI collaborative framework enhances annotation efficiency by reducing the cognitive and time burden on human annotators. By analyzing the system's performance across various types of annotation tasks, we demonstrate its ability to generalize to tasks such as object recognition, scene description, and fine-grained categorization. Our proposed framework highlights the potential of this approach to redefine annotation workflows, offering a scalable and efficient solution for large-scale data labeling in computer vision. Finally, we discuss how integrating LMMs into the annotation pipeline can advance bidirectional human-AI alignment, as well as the challenges of alleviating the "endless annotation" burden in the face of information overload by shifting some of the work to AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Avinash Madasu, Vasudev Lal, Phillip Howard</p>
<p>Abstract: CLIP is one of the most popular foundational models and is heavily used for many vision-language tasks. However, little is known about the inner workings of CLIP. While recent work has proposed decomposition-based interpretability methods for identifying textual descriptions of attention heads in CLIP, the implications of conceptual consistency in these text labels on interpretability and model performance has not been explored. To bridge this gap, we study the conceptual consistency of text descriptions for attention heads in CLIP-like models. We conduct extensive experiments on six different models from OpenAI and OpenCLIP which vary by size, type of pre-training data and patch size. We propose Concept Consistency Score (CCS), a novel interpretability metric that measures how consistently individual attention heads in CLIP models align with specific concepts. To assign concept labels to heads, we use in-context learning with ChatGPT, guided by a few manually-curated examples, and validate these labels using an LLM-as-a-judge approach. Our soft-pruning experiments reveal that high CCS heads are critical for preserving model performance, as pruning them leads to a significantly larger performance drop than pruning random or low CCS heads. Notably, we find that high CCS heads capture essential concepts and play a key role in out-of-domain detection, concept-specific reasoning, and video-language understanding. These results position CCS as a powerful interpretability metric for analyzing CLIP-like models.</p>

<p>Abstract: The key-value (KV) cache in autoregressive transformers presents a significant bottleneck during inference, which restricts the context length capabilities of large language models (LLMs). While previous work analyzes the fundamental space complexity barriers in standard attention mechanism [Haris and Onak, 2025], our work generalizes the space complexity barriers result to tensor attention version. Our theoretical contributions rely on a novel reduction from communication complexity and deduce the memory lower bound for tensor-structured attention mechanisms when $d = \Omega(\log n)$. In the low dimensional regime where $d = o(\log n)$, we analyze the theoretical bounds of the space complexity as well. Overall, our work provides a theoretical foundation for us to understand the compression-expressivity tradeoff in tensor attention mechanisms and offers more perspectives in developing more memory-efficient transformer architectures.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present our approach to the PerAnsSumm Shared Task, which involves perspective span identification and perspective-aware summarization in community question-answering (CQA) threads.

For summarization, we design a suite of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting strategies that incorporate keyphrases and guide information to structure summary generation into manageable steps. To further enhance summary quality, we apply prompt optimization using the DSPy framework and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on Llama-3 to adapt the model to domain-specific data. Experimental results on validation and test sets show that structured prompts with keyphrases and guidance improve summaries aligned with references, while the combination of prompt optimization and fine-tuning together yields significant improvement in both relevance and factuality evaluation metrics.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent developments in Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities have brought great potential but also posed new risks. For example, LLMs with knowledge of bioweapons, advanced chemistry, or cyberattacks could cause violence if placed in the wrong hands or during malfunctions. Because of their nature as near-black boxes, intuitive interpretation of LLM internals remains an open research question, preventing developers from easily controlling model behavior and capabilities. The use of Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) has recently emerged as a potential method of unraveling representations of concepts in LLMs internals, and has allowed developers to steer model outputs by directly modifying the hidden activations. In this paper, we use SAEs to identify unwanted concepts from the Weapons of Mass Destruction Proxy (WMDP) dataset within gemma-2-2b internals and use feature steering to reduce the model's ability to answer harmful questions while retaining its performance on harmless queries. Our results bring back optimism to the viability of SAE-based explicit knowledge unlearning techniques.</p>

<p>Abstract: The raster-ordered image token sequence exhibits a significant Euclidean distance between index-adjacent tokens at line breaks, making it unsuitable for autoregressive generation. To address this issue, this paper proposes Direction-Aware Diagonal Autoregressive Image Generation (DAR) method, which generates image tokens following a diagonal scanning order. The proposed diagonal scanning order ensures that tokens with adjacent indices remain in close proximity while enabling causal attention to gather information from a broader range of directions. Additionally, two direction-aware modules: 4D-RoPE and direction embeddings are introduced, enhancing the model's capability to handle frequent changes in generation direction. To leverage the representational capacity of the image tokenizer, we use its codebook as the image token embeddings. We propose models of varying scales, ranging from 485M to 2.0B. On the 256$\times$256 ImageNet benchmark, our DAR-XL (2.0B) outperforms all previous autoregressive image generators, achieving a state-of-the-art FID score of 1.37.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rachel S. Y. Teo, Tan M. Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large-scale pre-training of deep models, followed by fine-tuning them, has become the cornerstone of natural language processing (NLP). The prevalence of data coupled with computational resources has led to large models with a considerable number of parameters. While the massive size of these models has led to remarkable success in many NLP tasks, a detriment is the expense required to retrain all the base model's parameters for the adaptation to each task or domain. Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) provides an effective solution for this challenge by minimizing the number of parameters required to be fine-tuned while maintaining the quality of the model. While existing methods have achieved impressive results, they mainly focus on adapting a subset of parameters, weight reparameterization, and prompt engineering. In this paper, we study layers as extractors of different types of linguistic information that are valuable when used in conjunction. We then propose the Mixture of Layer Experts (MoLEx), a novel sparse mixture of experts (SMoE) whose experts are layers in the pre-trained model. It performs a conditional computation of a mixture of layers during fine-tuning to provide the model with more structural knowledge about the data. By providing an avenue for information exchange between layers, MoLEx enables the model to make a more well-informed prediction for the downstream task, leading to better fine-tuning results with the same number of effective parameters. As experts can be processed in parallel, MoLEx introduces minimal additional computational overhead. We empirically corroborate the advantages of MoLEx when combined with popular PEFT baseline methods on a variety of downstream fine-tuning tasks, including the popular GLUE benchmark as well as the End-to-End Challenge (E2E).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaotian Yan, Chen Shen, Wenxiao Wang, Liang Xie, Junjie Liu, Jieping Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Few-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) significantly enhances the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), functioning as a whole to guide these models in generating reasoning steps toward final answers. However, we observe that isolated segments, words, or tokens within CoT demonstrations can unexpectedly disrupt the generation process of LLMs. The model may overly concentrate on certain local information present in the demonstration, introducing irrelevant noise into the reasoning process and potentially leading to incorrect answers. In this paper, we investigate the underlying mechanism of CoT through dynamically tracing and manipulating the inner workings of LLMs at each output step, which demonstrates that tokens exhibiting specific attention characteristics are more likely to induce the model to take things out of context; these tokens directly attend to the hidden states tied with prediction, without substantial integration of non-local information. Building upon these insights, we propose a Few-shot Attention Intervention method (FAI) that dynamically analyzes the attention patterns of demonstrations to accurately identify these tokens and subsequently make targeted adjustments to the attention weights to effectively suppress their distracting effect on LLMs. Comprehensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over baseline methods, with a remarkable 5.91% improvement on the AQuA dataset, further highlighting the effectiveness of FAI.</p>

<p>Abstract: Attributions aim to identify input pixels that are relevant to the decision-making process. A popular approach involves using modified backpropagation (BP) rules to reverse decisions, which improves interpretability compared to the original gradients. However, these methods lack a solid theoretical foundation and exhibit perplexing behaviors, such as reduced sensitivity to parameter randomization, raising concerns about their reliability and highlighting the need for theoretical justification. In this work, we present a unified theoretical framework for methods like GBP, RectGrad, LRP, and DTD, demonstrating that they achieve input alignment by combining the weights of activated neurons. This alignment improves the visualization quality and reduces sensitivity to weight randomization. Our contributions include: (1) Providing a unified explanation for multiple behaviors, rather than focusing on just one. (2) Accurately predicting novel behaviors. (3) Offering insights into decision-making processes, including layer-wise information changes and the relationship between attributions and model decisions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haonan Wang, Qixiang Zhang, Lehan Wang, Xuanqi Huang, Xiaomeng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Decoding visual stimuli from neural activity is essential for understanding the human brain. While fMRI methods have successfully reconstructed static images, fMRI-to-video reconstruction faces challenges due to the need for capturing spatiotemporal dynamics like motion and scene transitions. Recent approaches have improved semantic and perceptual alignment but struggle to integrate coarse fMRI data with detailed visual features. Inspired by the hierarchical organization of the visual system, we propose NEURONS, a novel framework that decouples learning into four correlated sub-tasks: key object segmentation, concept recognition, scene description, and blurry video reconstruction. This approach simulates the visual cortex's functional specialization, allowing the model to capture diverse video content. In the inference stage, NEURONS generates robust conditioning signals for a pre-trained text-to-video diffusion model to reconstruct the videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NEURONS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving solid improvements in video consistency (26.6%) and semantic-level accuracy (19.1%). Notably, NEURONS shows a strong functional correlation with the visual cortex, highlighting its potential for brain-computer interfaces and clinical applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yini Li, Nantheera Anantrasirichai</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-light and underwater videos suffer from poor visibility, low contrast, and high noise, necessitating enhancements in visual quality. However, existing approaches typically rely on paired ground truth, which limits their practicality and often fails to maintain temporal consistency. To overcome these obstacles, this paper introduces a novel zero-shot learning approach named Zero-TIG, leveraging the Retinex theory and optical flow techniques. The proposed network consists of an enhancement module and a temporal feedback module. The enhancement module comprises three subnetworks: low-light image denoising, illumination estimation, and reflection denoising. The temporal enhancement module ensures temporal consistency by incorporating histogram equalization, optical flow computation, and image warping to align the enhanced previous frame with the current frame, thereby maintaining continuity. Additionally, we address color distortion in underwater data by adaptively balancing RGB channels. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves low-light video enhancement without the need for paired training data, making it a promising and applicable method for real-world scenario enhancement.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luca Martini, Daniele Zolezzi, Saverio Iacono, Gianni Viardo Vercelli</p>
<p>Abstract: The reconstruction of low-resolution football broadcast images presents a significant challenge in sports broadcasting, where detailed visuals are essential for analysis and audience engagement. This study introduces a multi-stage generative upscaling framework leveraging Diffusion Models to enhance degraded images, transforming inputs as small as $64 \times 64$ pixels into high-fidelity $1024 \times 1024$ outputs. By integrating an image-to-image pipeline, ControlNet conditioning, and LoRA fine-tuning, our approach surpasses traditional upscaling methods in restoring intricate textures and domain-specific elements such as player details and jersey logos. The custom LoRA is trained on a custom football dataset, ensuring adaptability to sports broadcast needs. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements over conventional models, with ControlNet refining fine details and LoRA enhancing task-specific elements. These findings highlight the potential of diffusion-based image reconstruction in sports media, paving the way for future applications in automated video enhancement and real-time sports analytics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingjie Zhang, Tong Liu, Zhe Zhao, Guozhu Meng, Kai Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which use crafted prompts to elicit toxic responses. These attacks exploit LLMs' difficulty in dynamically detecting harmful intents during the generation process. Traditional safety alignment methods, often relying on the initial few generation steps, are ineffective due to limited computational budget. This paper proposes DEEPALIGN, a robust defense framework that fine-tunes LLMs to progressively detoxify generated content, significantly improving both the computational budget and effectiveness of mitigating harmful generation. Our approach uses a hybrid loss function operating on hidden states to directly improve LLMs' inherent awareness of toxity during generation. Furthermore, we redefine safe responses by generating semantically relevant answers to harmful queries, thereby increasing robustness against representation-mutation attacks. Evaluations across multiple LLMs demonstrate state-of-the-art defense performance against six different attack types, reducing Attack Success Rates by up to two orders of magnitude compared to previous state-of-the-art defense while preserving utility. This work advances LLM safety by addressing limitations of conventional alignment through dynamic, context-aware mitigation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Music-to-music-video generation is a challenging task due to the intrinsic differences between the music and video modalities. The advent of powerful text-to-video diffusion models has opened a promising pathway for music-video (MV) generation by first addressing the music-to-MV description task and subsequently leveraging these models for video generation. In this study, we focus on the MV description generation task and propose a comprehensive pipeline encompassing training data construction and multimodal model fine-tuning. We fine-tune existing pre-trained multimodal models on our newly constructed music-to-MV description dataset based on the Music4All dataset, which integrates both musical and visual information. Our experimental results demonstrate that music representations can be effectively mapped to textual domains, enabling the generation of meaningful MV description directly from music inputs. We also identify key components in the dataset construction pipeline that critically impact the quality of MV description and highlight specific musical attributes that warrant greater focus for improved MV description generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gang Li, Jizhong Liu, Heinrich Dinkel, Yadong Niu, Junbo Zhang, Jian Luan</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has been shown to greatly enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), and RL-based approaches have been progressively applied to visual multimodal tasks. However, the audio modality has largely been overlooked in these developments. Thus, we conduct a series of RL explorations in audio understanding and reasoning, specifically focusing on the audio question answering (AQA) task. We leverage the group relative policy optimization (GRPO) algorithm to Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct, and our experiments demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on the MMAU Test-mini benchmark, achieving an accuracy rate of 64.5%. The main findings in this technical report are as follows: 1) The GRPO algorithm can be effectively applied to large audio language models (LALMs), even when the model has only 8.2B parameters; 2) With only 38k post-training samples, RL significantly outperforms supervised fine-tuning (SFT), indicating that RL-based approaches can be effective without large datasets; 3) The explicit reasoning process has not shown significant benefits for AQA tasks, and how to efficiently utilize deep thinking remains an open question for further research; 4) LALMs still lag far behind humans auditory-language reasoning, suggesting that the RL-based approaches warrant further exploration.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yansheng Li, Yuning Wu, Gong Cheng, Chao Tao, Bo Dang, Yu Wang, Jiahao Zhang, Chuge Zhang, Yiting Liu, Xu Tang, Jiayi Ma, Yongjun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate fine-grained geospatial scene classification using remote sensing imagery is essential for a wide range of applications. However, existing approaches often rely on manually zooming remote sensing images at different scales to create typical scene samples. This approach fails to adequately support the fixed-resolution image interpretation requirements in real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we introduce the Million-scale finE-grained geospatial scEne classification dataseT (MEET), which contains over 1.03 million zoom-free remote sensing scene samples, manually annotated into 80 fine-grained categories. In MEET, each scene sample follows a scene-inscene layout, where the central scene serves as the reference, and auxiliary scenes provide crucial spatial context for finegrained classification. Moreover, to tackle the emerging challenge of scene-in-scene classification, we present the Context-Aware Transformer (CAT), a model specifically designed for this task, which adaptively fuses spatial context to accurately classify the scene samples. CAT adaptively fuses spatial context to accurately classify the scene samples by learning attentional features that capture the relationships between the center and auxiliary scenes. Based on MEET, we establish a comprehensive benchmark for fine-grained geospatial scene classification, evaluating CAT against 11 competitive baselines. The results demonstrate that CAT significantly outperforms these baselines, achieving a 1.88% higher balanced accuracy (BA) with the Swin-Large backbone, and a notable 7.87% improvement with the Swin-Huge backbone. Further experiments validate the effectiveness of each module in CAT and show the practical applicability of CAT in the urban functional zone mapping.

In this survey, we provide a coherent and systematic overview for SSMs, including their theoretical motivations, mathematical formulations, comparison with existing model classes, and various applications. We divide the SSM series into three main sections, providing a detailed introduction to the original SSM, the structured SSM represented by S4, and the selective SSM typified by Mamba. We put an emphasis on technicality, and highlight the various key techniques introduced to address the effectiveness and efficiency of SSMs. We hope this manuscript serves as an introduction for researchers to explore the theoretical foundations of SSMs.</p>

However, CER faces challenges due to the complexity of facial expressions and the difficulty of capturing subtle emotional cues. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach leveraging Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Our method employs a two-stage fine-tuning process: first, pre-trained LVLMs are fine-tuned on basic facial expressions to establish foundational patterns; second, the model is further optimized on a compound-expression dataset to refine visual-language feature interactions. Our approach achieves advanced accuracy on the RAF-DB dataset and demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization on the C-EXPR-DB dataset, showcasing its potential for real-world applications in emotion analysis and human-computer interaction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hoang V. Tran, Thanh T. Chu, Khoi N. M. Nguyen, Trang Pham, Tam Le, Tan M. Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: Sliced Optimal Transport (OT) simplifies the OT problem in high-dimensional spaces by projecting supports of input measures onto one-dimensional lines and then exploiting the closed-form expression of the univariate OT to reduce the computational burden of OT. Recently, the Tree-Sliced method has been introduced to replace these lines with more intricate structures, known as tree systems. This approach enhances the ability to capture topological information of integration domains in Sliced OT while maintaining low computational cost. Inspired by this approach, in this paper, we present an adaptation of tree systems on OT problems for measures supported on a sphere. As a counterpart to the Radon transform variant on tree systems, we propose a novel spherical Radon transform with a new integration domain called spherical trees. By leveraging this transform and exploiting the spherical tree structures, we derive closed-form expressions for OT problems on the sphere. Consequently, we obtain an efficient metric for measures on the sphere, named Spherical Tree-Sliced Wasserstein (STSW) distance. We provide an extensive theoretical analysis to demonstrate the topology of spherical trees and the well-definedness and injectivity of our Radon transform variant, which leads to an orthogonally invariant distance between spherical measures. Finally, we conduct a wide range of numerical experiments, including gradient flows and self-supervised learning, to assess the performance of our proposed metric, comparing it to recent benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sahil Kale, Vijaykant Nadadur</p>
<p>Abstract: As LLMs grow more powerful, their most profound achievement may be recognising when to say "I don't know". Existing studies on LLM self-knowledge have been largely constrained by human-defined notions of feasibility, often neglecting the reasons behind unanswerability by LLMs and failing to study deficient types of self-knowledge. This study aims to obtain intrinsic insights into different types of LLM self-knowledge with a novel methodology: allowing them the flexibility to set their own feasibility boundaries and then analysing the consistency of these limits. We find that even frontier models like GPT-4o and Mistral Large are not sure of their own capabilities more than 80% of the time, highlighting a significant lack of trustworthiness in responses. Our analysis of confidence balance in LLMs indicates that models swing between overconfidence and conservatism in feasibility boundaries depending on task categories and that the most significant self-knowledge weaknesses lie in temporal awareness and contextual understanding. These difficulties in contextual comprehension additionally lead models to question their operational boundaries, resulting in considerable confusion within the self-knowledge of LLMs. We make our code and results available publicly at https://github.com/knowledge-verse-ai/LLM-Self_Knowledge_Eval</p>

We apply CVQBoost to a fraud detection test case and benchmark its performance against XGBoost, a widely utilized ML method. Running on Dirac-3, CVQBoost demonstrates a significant runtime advantage over XGBoost, which we evaluate on high-performance hardware comprising up to 48 CPUs and four NVIDIA L4 GPUs using the RAPIDS AI framework. Our results show that CVQBoost maintains competitive accuracy (measured by AUC) while significantly reducing training time, particularly as dataset size and feature complexity increase. To assess scalability, we extend our study to large synthetic datasets ranging from 1M to 70M samples, demonstrating that CVQBoost on Dirac-3 is well-suited for large-scale classification tasks. These findings position CVQBoost as a promising alternative to gradient boosting methods, offering superior scalability and efficiency for high-dimensional ML applications such as fraud detection.</p>

<p>Abstract: Background: Accurate spinal structure measurement is crucial for assessing spine health and diagnosing conditions like spondylosis, disc herniation, and stenosis. Manual methods for measuring intervertebral disc height and spinal canal diameter are subjective and time-consuming. Automated solutions are needed to improve accuracy, efficiency, and reproducibility in clinical practice.
  Purpose: This study develops an autonomous AI system for segmenting and measuring key spinal structures in MRI scans, focusing on intervertebral disc height and spinal canal anteroposterior (AP) diameter in the cervical, lumbar, and thoracic regions. The goal is to reduce clinician workload, enhance diagnostic consistency, and improve assessments.
  Methods: The AI model leverages deep learning architectures, including UNet, nnU-Net, and CNNs. Trained on a large proprietary MRI dataset, it was validated against expert annotations. Performance was evaluated using Dice coefficients and segmentation accuracy.
  Results: The AI model achieved Dice coefficients of 0.94 for lumbar, 0.91 for cervical, and 0.90 for dorsal spine segmentation (D1-D12). It precisely measured spinal parameters like disc height and canal diameter, demonstrating robustness and clinical applicability.
  Conclusion: The AI system effectively automates MRI-based spinal measurements, improving accuracy and reducing clinician workload. Its consistent performance across spinal regions supports clinical decision-making, particularly in high-demand settings, enhancing spinal assessments and patient outcomes.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper reports the first brain-inspired large language model (BriLLM). This is a non-Transformer, non-GPT, non-traditional machine learning input-output controlled generative language model. The model is based on the Signal Fully-connected flowing (SiFu) definition on the directed graph in terms of the neural network, and has the interpretability of all nodes on the graph of the whole model, instead of the traditional machine learning model that only has limited interpretability at the input and output ends. In the language model scenario, the token is defined as a node in the graph. A randomly shaped or user-defined signal flow flows between nodes on the principle of "least resistance" along paths. The next token or node to be predicted or generated is the target of the signal flow. As a language model, BriLLM theoretically supports infinitely long $n$-gram models when the model size is independent of the input and predicted length of the model. The model's working signal flow provides the possibility of recall activation and innate multi-modal support similar to the cognitive patterns of the human brain. At present, we released the first BriLLM version in Chinese, with 4000 tokens, 32-dimensional node width, 16-token long sequence prediction ability, and language model prediction performance comparable to GPT-1. More computing power will help us explore the infinite possibilities depicted above.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gorka Mu\~noz-Gil, Hans J. Briegel, Michele Caraglio</p>
<p>Abstract: Target search problems are central to a wide range of fields, from biological foraging to the optimization algorithms. Recently, the ability to reset the search has been shown to significantly improve the searcher's efficiency. However, the optimal resetting strategy depends on the specific properties of the search problem and can often be challenging to determine. In this work, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework to train agents capable of optimizing their search efficiency in environments by learning how to reset. First, we validate the approach in a well-established benchmark: the Brownian search with resetting. There, RL agents consistently recover strategies closely resembling the sharp resetting distribution, known to be optimal in this scenario. We then extend the framework by allowing agents to control not only when to reset, but also their spatial dynamics through turning actions. In this more complex setting, the agents discover strategies that adapt both resetting and turning to the properties of the environment, outperforming the proposed benchmarks. These results demonstrate how reinforcement learning can serve both as an optimization tool and a mechanism for uncovering new, interpretable strategies in stochastic search processes with resetting.</p>

<p>Abstract: As the number of patients with heart failure increases, machine learning (ML) has garnered attention in cardiomyopathy diagnosis, driven by the shortage of pathologists. However, endomyocardial biopsy specimens are often small sample size and require techniques such as feature extraction and dimensionality reduction. This study aims to determine whether texture features are effective for feature extraction in the pathological diagnosis of cardiomyopathy. Furthermore, model designs that contribute toward improving generalization performance are examined by applying feature selection (FS) and dimensional compression (DC) to several ML models. The obtained results were verified by visualizing the inter-class distribution differences and conducting statistical hypothesis testing based on texture features. Additionally, they were evaluated using predictive performance across different model designs with varying combinations of FS and DC (applied or not) and decision boundaries. The obtained results confirmed that texture features may be effective for the pathological diagnosis of cardiomyopathy. Moreover, when the ratio of features to the sample size is high, a multi-step process involving FS and DC improved the generalization performance, with the linear kernel support vector machine achieving the best results. This process was demonstrated to be potentially effective for models with reduced complexity, regardless of whether the decision boundaries were linear, curved, perpendicular, or parallel to the axes. These findings are expected to facilitate the development of an effective cardiomyopathy diagnostic model for its rapid adoption in medical practice.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Moritz A. Zanger, Pascal R. Van der Vaart, Wendelin B\"ohmer, Matthijs T. J. Spaan</p>
<p>Abstract: Uncertainty quantification is a critical aspect of reinforcement learning and deep learning, with numerous applications ranging from efficient exploration and stable offline reinforcement learning to outlier detection in medical diagnostics. The scale of modern neural networks, however, complicates the use of many theoretically well-motivated approaches such as full Bayesian inference. Approximate methods like deep ensembles can provide reliable uncertainty estimates but still remain computationally expensive. In this work, we propose contextual similarity distillation, a novel approach that explicitly estimates the variance of an ensemble of deep neural networks with a single model, without ever learning or evaluating such an ensemble in the first place. Our method builds on the predictable learning dynamics of wide neural networks, governed by the neural tangent kernel, to derive an efficient approximation of the predictive variance of an infinite ensemble. Specifically, we reinterpret the computation of ensemble variance as a supervised regression problem with kernel similarities as regression targets. The resulting model can estimate predictive variance at inference time with a single forward pass, and can make use of unlabeled target-domain data or data augmentations to refine its uncertainty estimates. We empirically validate our method across a variety of out-of-distribution detection benchmarks and sparse-reward reinforcement learning environments. We find that our single-model method performs competitively and sometimes superior to ensemble-based baselines and serves as a reliable signal for efficient exploration. These results, we believe, position contextual similarity distillation as a principled and scalable alternative for uncertainty quantification in reinforcement learning and general deep learning.</p>

Specifically, AIstorian introduces an in-context learning based chunking strategy and a KG-based index for accurate and efficient reference retrieval. Meanwhile, AIstorian orchestrates multi-agents to conduct on-the-fly hallucination detection and error-type-aware correction. Additionally, to teach LLMs a certain language style, we finetune LLMs based on a two-step training approach combining data augmentation-enhanced supervised fine-tuning with stylistic preference optimization. Extensive experiments on a real-life historical Jinshi dataset demonstrate that AIstorian achieves a 3.8x improvement in factual accuracy and a 47.6% reduction in hallucination rate compared to existing baselines.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marinela Adam</p>
<p>Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) represents a cutting-edge paradigm within the broader scope of machine learning, designed to empower models with the ability to assimilate new classes of data with limited examples while safeguarding existing knowledge. The paper will present different solutions which contain extensive experiments across large-scale datasets, domain shifts, and network architectures to evaluate and compare the selected methods. We highlight their advantages and then present an experimental approach with the purpose of improving the most promising one by replacing the visual-language (V-L) model (CLIP) with another V-L model (CLOOB) that seem to outperform it on zero-shot learning tasks. The aim of this report is to present an experimental method for FSCIL that would improve its performance. We also plan to offer an overview followed by an analysis of the recent advancements in FSCIL domain, focusing on various strategies to mitigate catastrophic forgetting and improve the adaptability of models to evolving tasks and datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Language-guided attention frameworks have significantly enhanced both interpretability and performance in image classification; however, the reliance on deterministic embeddings from pre-trained vision-language foundation models to generate reference attention maps frequently overlooks the intrinsic multivaluedness and ill-posed characteristics of cross-modal mappings. To address these limitations, we introduce PARIC, a probabilistic framework for guiding visual attention via language specifications. Our approach enables pre-trained vision-language models to generate probabilistic reference attention maps, which align textual and visual modalities more effectively while incorporating uncertainty estimates, as compared to their deterministic counterparts. Experiments on benchmark test problems demonstrate that PARIC enhances prediction accuracy, mitigates bias, ensures consistent predictions, and improves robustness across various datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: UnScientify, a system designed to detect scientific uncertainty in scholarly full text. The system utilizes a weakly supervised technique to identify verbally expressed uncertainty in scientific texts and their authorial references. The core methodology of UnScientify is based on a multi-faceted pipeline that integrates span pattern matching, complex sentence analysis and author reference checking. This approach streamlines the labeling and annotation processes essential for identifying scientific uncertainty, covering a variety of uncertainty expression types to support diverse applications including information retrieval, text mining and scientific document processing. The evaluation results highlight the trade-offs between modern large language models (LLMs) and the UnScientify system. UnScientify, which employs more traditional techniques, achieved superior performance in the scientific uncertainty detection task, attaining an accuracy score of 0.808. This finding underscores the continued relevance and efficiency of UnScientify's simple rule-based and pattern matching strategy for this specific application. The results demonstrate that in scenarios where resource efficiency, interpretability, and domain-specific adaptability are critical, traditional methods can still offer significant advantages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenbo Yan, Shurui Wang, Ying Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: Mamba has demonstrated excellent performance in various time series forecasting tasks due to its superior selection mechanism. Nevertheless, conventional Mamba-based models encounter significant challenges in accurately predicting stock time series, as they fail to adequately capture both the overarching market dynamics and the intricate interdependencies among individual stocks. To overcome these constraints, we introduce the Hierarchical Information-Guided Spatio-Temporal Mamba (HIGSTM) framework. HIGSTM introduces Index-Guided Frequency Filtering Decomposition to extract commonality and specificity from time series. The model architecture features a meticulously designed hierarchical framework that systematically captures both temporal dynamic patterns and global static relationships within the stock market. Furthermore, we propose an Information-Guided Mamba that integrates macro informations into the sequence selection process, thereby facilitating more market-conscious decision-making. Comprehensive experimental evaluations conducted on the CSI500, CSI800 and CSI1000 datasets demonstrate that HIGSTM achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonas Thietke, Andreas M\"uller, Denis Lukovnikov, Asja Fischer, Erwin Quiring</p>
<p>Abstract: Semantic watermarking methods enable the direct integration of watermarks into the generation process of latent diffusion models by only modifying the initial latent noise. One line of approaches building on Gaussian Shading relies on cryptographic primitives to steer the sampling process of the latent noise. However, we identify several issues in the usage of cryptographic techniques in Gaussian Shading, particularly in its proof of lossless performance and key management, causing ambiguity in follow-up works, too. In this work, we therefore revisit the cryptographic primitives for semantic watermarking. We introduce a novel, general proof of lossless performance based on IND\$-CPA security for semantic watermarks. We then discuss the configuration of the cryptographic primitives in semantic watermarks with respect to security, efficiency, and generation quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Zhong, Weiwei Ling, Kejia Pan, Pinxia Wu, Jiajing Zhang, Zhiliang Zhan, Wenbo Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional three-dimensional magnetotelluric (MT) numerical forward modeling methods, such as the finite element method (FEM) and finite volume method (FVM), suffer from high computational costs and low efficiency due to limitations in mesh refinement and computational resources. We propose a novel neural network architecture named MTAGU-Net, which integrates an attention gating mechanism for 3D MT forward modeling. Specifically, a dual-path attention gating module is designed based on forward response data images and embedded in the skip connections between the encoder and decoder. This module enables the fusion of critical anomaly information from shallow feature maps during the decoding of deep feature maps, significantly enhancing the network's capability to extract features from anomalous regions. Furthermore, we introduce a synthetic model generation method utilizing 3D Gaussian random field (GRF), which accurately replicates the electrical structures of real-world geological scenarios with high fidelity. Numerical experiments demonstrate that MTAGU-Net outperforms conventional 3D U-Net in terms of convergence stability and prediction accuracy, with the structural similarity index (SSIM) of the forward response data consistently exceeding 0.98. Moreover, the network can accurately predict forward response data on previously unseen datasets models, demonstrating its strong generalization ability and validating the feasibility and effectiveness of this method in practical applications.</p>

While recent advancements in GenAI have enabled systems to produce high-quality content across various domains, these models often lack the capacity for true innovation. In this context, innovation is defined as the ability to generate novel and useful outputs that go beyond mere replication of learned data. The paper examines this shift and proposes a roadmap for developing AI systems that can generate content and engage in autonomous problem-solving and creative ideation. The work provides both theoretical insights and practical strategies for advancing AI to a stage where it can genuinely innovate, contributing meaningfully to science, technology, and the arts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Theodora-Mara P\^islar, Sara Magliacane, Atticus Geiger</p>
<p>Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability aims to reverse engineer neural networks by uncovering which high-level algorithms they implement. Causal abstraction provides a precise notion of when a network implements an algorithm, i.e., a causal model of the network contains low-level features that realize the high-level variables in a causal model of the algorithm. A typical problem in practical settings is that the algorithm is not an entirely faithful abstraction of the network, meaning it only partially captures the true reasoning process of a model. We propose a solution where we combine different simple high-level models to produce a more faithful representation of the network. Through learning this combination, we can model neural networks as being in different computational states depending on the input provided, which we show is more accurate to GPT 2-small fine-tuned on two toy tasks. We observe a trade-off between the strength of an interpretability hypothesis, which we define in terms of the number of inputs explained by the high-level models, and its faithfulness, which we define as the interchange intervention accuracy. Our method allows us to modulate between the two, providing the most accurate combination of models that describe the behavior of a neural network given a faithfulness level.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andr\'es Chavarr\'ias, David Rodriguez-Cianca, Pablo Lanillos</p>
<p>Abstract: Spasticity is a common movement disorder symptom in individuals with cerebral palsy, hereditary spastic paraplegia, spinal cord injury and stroke, being one of the most disabling features in the progression of these diseases. Despite the potential benefit of using wearable robots to treat spasticity, their use is not currently recommended to subjects with a level of spasticity above ${1^+}$ on the Modified Ashworth Scale. The varying dynamics of this velocity-dependent tonic stretch reflex make it difficult to deploy safe personalized controllers. Here, we describe a novel adaptive torque controller via deep reinforcement learning (RL) for a knee exoskeleton under joint spasticity conditions, which accounts for task performance and interaction forces reduction. To train the RL agent, we developed a digital twin, including a musculoskeletal-exoskeleton system with joint misalignment and a differentiable spastic reflexes model for the muscles activation. Results for a simulated knee extension movement showed that the agent learns to control the exoskeleton for individuals with different levels of spasticity. The proposed controller was able to reduce maximum torques applied to the human joint under spastic conditions by an average of 10.6\% and decreases the root mean square until the settling time by 8.9\% compared to a conventional compliant controller.</p>

Additionally, we construct this strategy as an executable program for the multiple system players in our games. In this paper we formalize the problem space, and propose potential directions for solutions. We also show how our formalization of this generalized cops and robbers game can be mapped to a broad range of other problems in the reactive program synthesis space.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifeng Zhang, Yilin Liu, Ping Gong, Peizhuo Li, Mingfeng Fan, Guillaume Sartoretti</p>
<p>Abstract: Adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC) is crucial in reducing congestion, maximizing throughput, and improving mobility in rapidly growing urban areas. Recent advancements in parameter-sharing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) have greatly enhanced the scalable and adaptive optimization of complex, dynamic flows in large-scale homogeneous networks. However, the inherent heterogeneity of real-world traffic networks, with their varied intersection topologies and interaction dynamics, poses substantial challenges to achieving scalable and effective ATSC across different traffic scenarios. To address these challenges, we present Unicorn, a universal and collaborative MARL framework designed for efficient and adaptable network-wide ATSC. Specifically, we first propose a unified approach to map the states and actions of intersections with varying topologies into a common structure based on traffic movements. Next, we design a Universal Traffic Representation (UTR) module with a decoder-only network for general feature extraction, enhancing the model's adaptability to diverse traffic scenarios. Additionally, we incorporate an Intersection Specifics Representation (ISR) module, designed to identify key latent vectors that represent the unique intersection's topology and traffic dynamics through variational inference techniques. To further refine these latent representations, we employ a contrastive learning approach in a self-supervised manner, which enables better differentiation of intersection-specific features. Moreover, we integrate the state-action dependencies of neighboring agents into policy optimization, which effectively captures dynamic agent interactions and facilitates efficient regional collaboration. Our results show that Unicorn outperforms other methods across various evaluation metrics, highlighting its potential in complex, dynamic traffic networks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) images are the biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases, which are rising in prevalence. Early detection of Alzheimer's disease using retinal OCT is a primary challenging task. This work utilizes advanced deep learning techniques to classify retinal OCT images of subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and healthy controls (CO). The goal is to enhance diagnostic capabilities through efficient image analysis. In the proposed model, Raw OCT images have been preprocessed with ImageJ and given to various deep-learning models to evaluate the accuracy. The best classification architecture is TransNetOCT, which has an average accuracy of 98.18% for input OCT images and 98.91% for segmented OCT images for five-fold cross-validation compared to other models, and the Swin Transformer model has achieved an accuracy of 93.54%. The evaluation accuracy metric demonstrated TransNetOCT and Swin transformer models capability to classify AD and CO subjects reliably, contributing to the potential for improved diagnostic processes in clinical settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziqin Zhou, Yifan Yang, Yuqing Yang, Tianyu He, Houwen Peng, Kai Qiu, Qi Dai, Lili Qiu, Chong Luo, Lingqiao Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-video generation poses significant challenges due to the inherent complexity of video data, which spans both temporal and spatial dimensions. It introduces additional redundancy, abrupt variations, and a domain gap between language and vision tokens while generation. Addressing these challenges requires an effective video tokenizer that can efficiently encode video data while preserving essential semantic and spatiotemporal information, serving as a critical bridge between text and vision. Inspired by the observation in VQ-VAE-2 and workflows of traditional animation, we propose HiTVideo for text-to-video generation with hierarchical tokenizers. It utilizes a 3D causal VAE with a multi-layer discrete token framework, encoding video content into hierarchically structured codebooks. Higher layers capture semantic information with higher compression, while lower layers focus on fine-grained spatiotemporal details, striking a balance between compression efficiency and reconstruction quality. Our approach efficiently encodes longer video sequences (e.g., 8 seconds, 64 frames), reducing bits per pixel (bpp) by approximately 70\% compared to baseline tokenizers, while maintaining competitive reconstruction quality. We explore the trade-offs between compression and reconstruction, while emphasizing the advantages of high-compressed semantic tokens in text-to-video tasks. HiTVideo aims to address the potential limitations of existing video tokenizers in text-to-video generation tasks, striving for higher compression ratios and simplify LLMs modeling under language guidance, offering a scalable and promising framework for advancing text to video generation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengxin Guo, Runxi Wang, Shuang Zeng, Jinjing Zhu, Haoning Jiang, Yanran Wang, Yuyin Zhou, Feifei Wang, Hui Xiong, Liangqiong Qu</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising privacy-preserving collaborative model training paradigm without sharing raw data. However, recent studies have revealed that private information can still be leaked through shared gradient information and attacked by Gradient Inversion Attacks (GIA). While many GIA methods have been proposed, a detailed analysis, evaluation, and summary of these methods are still lacking. Although various survey papers summarize existing privacy attacks in FL, few studies have conducted extensive experiments to unveil the effectiveness of GIA and their associated limiting factors in this context. To fill this gap, we first undertake a systematic review of GIA and categorize existing methods into three types, i.e., \textit{optimization-based} GIA (OP-GIA), \textit{generation-based} GIA (GEN-GIA), and \textit{analytics-based} GIA (ANA-GIA). Then, we comprehensively analyze and evaluate the three types of GIA in FL, providing insights into the factors that influence their performance, practicality, and potential threats. Our findings indicate that OP-GIA is the most practical attack setting despite its unsatisfactory performance, while GEN-GIA has many dependencies and ANA-GIA is easily detectable, making them both impractical. Finally, we offer a three-stage defense pipeline to users when designing FL frameworks and protocols for better privacy protection and share some future research directions from the perspectives of attackers and defenders that we believe should be pursued. We hope that our study can help researchers design more robust FL frameworks to defend against these attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zonghan Li, Song Tong, Yi Liu, Kaiping Peng, Chunyan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing amount of pressure related to water and energy shortages has increased the urgency of cultivating individual conservation behaviors. While the concept of nudging, i.e., providing usage-based feedback, has shown promise in encouraging conservation behaviors, its efficacy is often constrained by the lack of targeted and actionable content. This study investigates the impact of the use of large language models (LLMs) to provide tailored conservation suggestions for conservation intentions and their rationale. Through a survey experiment with 1,515 university participants, we compare three virtual nudging scenarios: no nudging, traditional nudging with usage statistics, and LLM-powered nudging with usage statistics and personalized conservation suggestions. The results of statistical analyses and causal forest modeling reveal that nudging led to an increase in conservation intentions among 86.9%-98.0% of the participants. LLM-powered nudging achieved a maximum increase of 18.0% in conservation intentions, surpassing traditional nudging by 88.6%. Furthermore, structural equation modeling results reveal that exposure to LLM-powered nudges enhances self-efficacy and outcome expectations while diminishing dependence on social norms, thereby increasing intrinsic motivation to conserve. These findings highlight the transformative potential of LLMs in promoting individual water and energy conservation, representing a new frontier in the design of sustainable behavioral interventions and resource management.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reconstructing the 3D location and size of microparticles from diffraction images - holograms - is a computationally expensive inverse problem that has traditionally been solved using physics-based reconstruction methods. More recently, researchers have used machine learning methods to speed up the process. However, for small particles in large sample volumes the performance of these methods falls short of standard physics-based reconstruction methods. Here we designed a two-stage neural network architecture, FLASH$\mu$, to detect small particles (6-100$\mu$m) from holograms with large sample depths up to 20cm. Trained only on synthetic data with added physical noise, our method reliably detects particles of at least 9$\mu$m diameter in real holograms, comparable to the standard reconstruction-based approaches while operating on smaller crops, at quarter of the original resolution and providing roughly a 600-fold speedup. In addition to introducing a novel approach to a non-local object detection or signal demixing problem, our work could enable low-cost, real-time holographic imaging setups.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Franco Caspe, Jordie Shier, Mark Sandler, Charalampos Saitis, Andrew McPherson</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural Audio Synthesis (NAS) models offer interactive musical control over high-quality, expressive audio generators. While these models can operate in real-time, they often suffer from high latency, making them unsuitable for intimate musical interaction. The impact of architectural choices in deep learning models on audio latency remains largely unexplored in the NAS literature. In this work, we investigate the sources of latency and jitter typically found in interactive NAS models. We then apply this analysis to the task of timbre transfer using RAVE, a convolutional variational autoencoder for audio waveforms introduced by Caillon et al. in 2021. Finally, we present an iterative design approach for optimizing latency. This culminates with a model we call BRAVE (Bravely Realtime Audio Variational autoEncoder), which is low-latency and exhibits better pitch and loudness replication while showing timbre modification capabilities similar to RAVE. We implement it in a specialized inference framework for low-latency, real-time inference and present a proof-of-concept audio plugin compatible with audio signals from musical instruments. We expect the challenges and guidelines described in this document to support NAS researchers in designing models for low-latency inference from the ground up, enriching the landscape of possibilities for musicians.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianrui Pan, Lin Liu, Jie Liu, Xiaopeng Zhang, Jie Tang, Gangshan Wu, Qi Tian</p>
<p>Abstract: Portrait video editing focuses on modifying specific attributes of portrait videos, guided by audio or video streams. Previous methods typically either concentrate on lip-region reenactment or require training specialized models to extract keypoints for motion transfer to a new identity. In this paper, we introduce a training-free universal portrait video editing framework that provides a versatile and adaptable editing strategy. This framework supports portrait appearance editing conditioned on the changed first reference frame, as well as lip editing conditioned on varied speech, or a combination of both. It is based on a Unified Animation Control (UAC) mechanism with source inversion latents to edit the entire portrait, including visual-driven shape control, audio-driven speaking control, and inter-frame temporal control. Furthermore, our method can be adapted to different scenarios by adjusting the initial reference frame, enabling detailed editing of portrait videos with specific head rotations and facial expressions. This comprehensive approach ensures a holistic and flexible solution for portrait video editing.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Messi H. J. Lee, Calvin K. Lai</p>
<p>Abstract: Implicit bias refers to automatic or spontaneous mental processes that shape perceptions, judgments, and behaviors. Previous research examining `implicit bias' in large language models (LLMs) has often approached the phenomenon differently than how it is studied in humans by focusing primarily on model outputs rather than on model processing. To examine model processing, we present a method called the Reasoning Model Implicit Association Test (RM-IAT) for studying implicit bias-like patterns in reasoning models: LLMs that employ step-by-step reasoning to solve complex tasks. Using this method, we find that reasoning models require more tokens when processing association-incompatible information compared to association-compatible information. These findings suggest AI systems harbor patterns in processing information that are analogous to human implicit bias. We consider the implications of these implicit bias-like patterns for their deployment in real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adarsh Vatsa, Pratyush Patel, William Eiers</p>
<p>Abstract: Cloud compute systems allow administrators to write access control policies that govern access to private data. While policies are written in convenient languages, such as AWS Identity and Access Management Policy Language, manually written policies often become complex and error prone. In this paper, we investigate whether and how well Large Language Models (LLMs) can be used to synthesize access control policies. Our investigation focuses on the task of taking an access control request specification and zero-shot prompting LLMs to synthesize a well-formed access control policy which correctly adheres to the request specification. We consider two scenarios, one which the request specification is given as a concrete list of requests to be allowed or denied, and another in which a natural language description is used to specify sets of requests to be allowed or denied. We then argue that for zero-shot prompting, more precise and structured prompts using a syntax based approach are necessary and experimentally show preliminary results validating our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyi Wang, Jiashui Wang, Peng Chen, Jinbo Su, Yanming Liu, Long Liu, Yangdong Wang, Qiyuan Chen, Kai Yun, Chunfu Jia</p>
<p>Abstract: Analysis and comprehension of assembly code are crucial in various applications, such as reverse engineering. However, the low information density and lack of explicit syntactic structures in assembly code pose significant challenges. Pioneering approaches with masked language modeling (MLM)-based methods have been limited by facilitating natural language interaction. While recent methods based on decoder-focused large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced semantic representation, they still struggle to capture the nuanced and sparse semantics in assembly code. In this paper, we propose Assembly Augmented Tuning (ASMA-Tune), an end-to-end structural-semantic instruction-tuning framework. Our approach synergizes encoder architectures with decoder-based LLMs through projector modules to enable comprehensive code understanding. Experiments show that ASMA-Tune outperforms existing benchmarks, significantly enhancing assembly code comprehension and instruction-following abilities. Our model and dataset are public at https://github.com/wxy3596/ASMA-Tune.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Long-Kun Shan, Ze-Hao Wang, Tong-Tian Weng, Xiang-Dong Chen, Fang-Wen Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Structured illumination microscopy (SIM) is a pivotal technique for dynamic subcellular imaging in live cells. Conventional SIM reconstruction algorithms depend on accurately estimating the illumination pattern and can introduce artefacts when this estimation is imprecise. Although recent deep learning-based SIM reconstruction methods have improved speed, accuracy, and robustness, they often struggle with out-of-distribution data. To address this limitation, we propose an Awareness-of-Light-field SIM (AL-SIM) reconstruction approach that directly estimates the actual light field to correct for errors arising from data distribution shifts. Through comprehensive experiments on both simulated filament structures and live BSC1 cells, our method demonstrates a 7% reduction in the normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) and substantially lowers reconstruction artefacts. By minimizing these artefacts and improving overall accuracy, AL-SIM broadens the applicability of SIM for complex biological systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chonghao Sima, Kashyap Chitta, Zhiding Yu, Shiyi Lan, Ping Luo, Andreas Geiger, Hongyang Li, Jose M. Alvarez</p>
<p>Abstract: How can we rely on an end-to-end autonomous vehicle's complex decision-making system during deployment? One common solution is to have a ``fallback layer'' that checks the planned trajectory for rule violations and replaces it with a pre-defined safe action if necessary. Another approach involves adjusting the planner's decisions to minimize a pre-defined ``cost function'' using additional system predictions such as road layouts and detected obstacles. However, these pre-programmed rules or cost functions cannot learn and improve with new training data, often resulting in overly conservative behaviors. In this work, we propose Centaur (Cluster Entropy for Test-time trAining using Uncertainty) which updates a planner's behavior via test-time training, without relying on hand-engineered rules or cost functions. Instead, we measure and minimize the uncertainty in the planner's decisions. For this, we develop a novel uncertainty measure, called Cluster Entropy, which is simple, interpretable, and compatible with state-of-the-art planning algorithms. Using data collected at prior test-time time-steps, we perform an update to the model's parameters using a gradient that minimizes the Cluster Entropy. With only this sole gradient update prior to inference, Centaur exhibits significant improvements, ranking first on the navtest leaderboard with notable gains in safety-critical metrics such as time to collision. To provide detailed insights on a per-scenario basis, we also introduce navsafe, a challenging new benchmark, which highlights previously undiscovered failure modes of driving models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yichi Zhang, Zhuo Chen, Lingbing Guo, Yajing Xu, Binbin Hu, Ziqi Liu, Wen Zhang, Huajun Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning high-quality multi-modal entity representations is an important goal of multi-modal knowledge graph (MMKG) representation learning, which can enhance reasoning tasks within the MMKGs, such as MMKG completion (MMKGC). The main challenge is to collaboratively model the structural information concealed in massive triples and the multi-modal features of the entities. Existing methods focus on crafting elegant entity-wise multi-modal fusion strategies, yet they overlook the utilization of multi-perspective features concealed within the modalities under diverse relational contexts. To address this issue, we introduce a novel framework with Mixture of Modality Knowledge experts (MoMoK for short) to learn adaptive multi-modal entity representations for better MMKGC. We design relation-guided modality knowledge experts to acquire relation-aware modality embeddings and integrate the predictions from multi-modalities to achieve joint decisions. Additionally, we disentangle the experts by minimizing their mutual information. Experiments on four public MMKG benchmarks demonstrate the outstanding performance of MoMoK under complex scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel A. Herrmann, Benjamin A. Levinstein</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to demonstrate remarkable abilities across various domains, computer scientists are developing methods to understand their cognitive processes, particularly concerning how (and if) LLMs internally represent their beliefs about the world. However, this field currently lacks a unified theoretical foundation to underpin the study of belief in LLMs. This article begins filling this gap by proposing adequacy conditions for a representation in an LLM to count as belief-like. We argue that, while the project of belief measurement in LLMs shares striking features with belief measurement as carried out in decision theory and formal epistemology, it also differs in ways that should change how we measure belief. Thus, drawing from insights in philosophy and contemporary practices of machine learning, we establish four criteria that balance theoretical considerations with practical constraints. Our proposed criteria include accuracy, coherence, uniformity, and use, which together help lay the groundwork for a comprehensive understanding of belief representation in LLMs. We draw on empirical work showing the limitations of using various criteria in isolation to identify belief representations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengzhuo Xu, Bowen Qu, Yiyan Qi, Sinan Du, Chengjin Xu, Chun Yuan, Jian Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatic chart understanding is crucial for content comprehension and document parsing. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in chart understanding through domain-specific alignment and fine-tuning. However, current MLLMs still struggle to provide faithful data and reliable analysis only based on charts. To address it, we propose ChartMoE, which employs the Mixture of Expert (MoE) architecture to replace the traditional linear projector to bridge the modality gap. Specifically, we train several linear connectors through distinct alignment tasks, which are utilized as the foundational initialization parameters for different experts. Additionally, we introduce ChartMoE-Align, a dataset with nearly 1 million chart-table-JSON-code quadruples to conduct three alignment tasks (chart-table/JSON/code). Combined with the vanilla connector, we initialize different experts diversely and adopt high-quality knowledge learning to further refine the MoE connector and LLM parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the MoE connector and our initialization strategy, e.g., ChartMoE improves the accuracy of the previous state-of-the-art from 80.48\% to 84.64\% on the ChartQA benchmark.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zongyue Qin, Zifan He, Neha Prakriya, Jason Cong, Yizhou Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown outstanding performance across numerous real-world tasks. However, the autoregressive nature of these models makes the inference process slow and costly. Speculative decoding has emerged as a promising solution, leveraging a smaller auxiliary model to draft future tokens, which are then validated simultaneously by the larger model, achieving a speed-up of 1-2x. Although speculative decoding matches the same distribution as multinomial sampling, multinomial sampling itself is prone to suboptimal outputs, whereas beam sampling is widely recognized for producing higher-quality results by maintaining multiple candidate sequences at each step. This paper explores the novel integration of speculative decoding with beam sampling. However, there are four key challenges: (1) how to generate multiple sequences from the larger model's distribution given drafts sequences from the small model; (2) how to dynamically optimize the number of beams to balance efficiency and accuracy; (3) how to efficiently verify the multiple drafts in parallel; and (4) how to address the extra memory costs inherent in beam sampling. To address these challenges, we propose dynamic-width speculative beam decoding (DSBD). Specifically, we first introduce a novel draft and verification scheme that generates multiple sequences following the large model's distribution based on beam sampling trajectories from the small model. Then, we introduce an adaptive mechanism to dynamically tune the number of beams based on the context, optimizing efficiency and effectiveness. Besides, we extend tree-based parallel verification to handle multiple trees simultaneously, accelerating the verification process. Finally, we illustrate a simple modification to our algorithm to mitigate the memory overhead of beam sampling...</p>

<p>Abstract: We investigate the presence of cognitive biases in three large language models (LLMs): GPT-4o, Gemma 2, and Llama 3.1. The study uses 1,500 experiments across nine established cognitive biases to evaluate the models' responses and consistency. GPT-4o demonstrated the strongest overall performance. Gemma 2 showed strengths in addressing the sunk cost fallacy and prospect theory, however its performance varied across different biases. Llama 3.1 consistently underperformed, relying on heuristics and exhibiting frequent inconsistencies and contradictions. The findings highlight the challenges of achieving robust and generalizable reasoning in LLMs, and underscore the need for further development to mitigate biases in artificial general intelligence (AGI). The study emphasizes the importance of integrating statistical reasoning and ethical considerations in future AI development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Willem Schooltink, Fabio Massimo Zennaro</p>
<p>Abstract: Causal abstractions allow us to relate causal models on different levels of granularity. To ensure that the models agree on cause and effect, frameworks for causal abstractions define notions of consistency. Two distinct methods for causal abstraction are common in the literature: (i) graphical abstractions, such as Cluster DAGs, which relate models on a structural level, and (ii) functional abstractions, like $\alpha$-abstractions, which relate models by maps between variables and their ranges. In this paper we will align the notions of graphical and functional consistency and show an equivalence between the class of Cluster DAGs, consistent $\alpha$-abstractions with the range of abstracted variables mapped bijectively, and constructive $\tau$-abstractions. Furthermore, we extend this alignment and the expressivity of graphical abstractions by introducing Partial Cluster DAGs. Our results provide a rigorous bridge between the functional and graphical frameworks and allow for adoption and transfer of results between them.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingru Jia, Zehua Yuan, Junhao Pan, Paul E. McNamara, Deming Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Strategic decision-making involves interactive reasoning where agents adapt their choices in response to others, yet existing evaluations of large language models (LLMs) often emphasize Nash Equilibrium (NE) approximation, overlooking the mechanisms driving their strategic choices. To bridge this gap, we introduce an evaluation framework grounded in behavioral game theory, disentangling reasoning capability from contextual effects. Testing 22 state-of-the-art LLMs, we find that GPT-o3-mini, GPT-o1, and DeepSeek-R1 dominate most games yet also demonstrate that the model scale alone does not determine performance. In terms of prompting enhancement, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting is not universally effective, as it increases strategic reasoning only for models at certain levels while providing limited gains elsewhere. Additionally, we investigate the impact of encoded demographic features on the models, observing that certain assignments impact the decision-making pattern. For instance, GPT-4o shows stronger strategic reasoning with female traits than males, while Gemma assigns higher reasoning levels to heterosexual identities compared to other sexual orientations, indicating inherent biases. These findings underscore the need for ethical standards and contextual alignment to balance improved reasoning with fairness.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces the System 0/1/2/3 framework as an extension of dual-process theory, employing a quad-process model of cognition. Expanding upon System 1 (fast, intuitive thinking) and System 2 (slow, deliberative thinking), we incorporate System 0, which represents pre-cognitive embodied processes, and System 3, which encompasses collective intelligence and symbol emergence. We contextualize this model within Bergson's philosophy by adopting multi-scale time theory to unify the diverse temporal dynamics of cognition. System 0 emphasizes morphological computation and passive dynamics, illustrating how physical embodiment enables adaptive behavior without explicit neural processing. Systems 1 and 2 are explained from a constructive perspective, incorporating neurodynamical and AI viewpoints. In System 3, we introduce collective predictive coding to explain how societal-level adaptation and symbol emergence operate over extended timescales. This comprehensive framework ranges from rapid embodied reactions to slow-evolving collective intelligence, offering a unified perspective on cognition across multiple timescales, levels of abstraction, and forms of human intelligence. The System 0/1/2/3 model provides a novel theoretical foundation for understanding the interplay between adaptive and cognitive processes, thereby opening new avenues for research in cognitive science, AI, robotics, and collective intelligence.</p>

<p>Abstract: The integration of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) into transportation planning has the potential to revolutionize tasks such as demand forecasting, infrastructure design, policy evaluation, and traffic simulation. However, there is a critical need for a systematic framework to guide the adoption of GenAI in this interdisciplinary domain. In this survey, we, a multidisciplinary team of researchers spanning computer science and transportation engineering, present the first comprehensive framework for leveraging GenAI in transportation planning. Specifically, we introduce a new taxonomy that categorizes existing applications and methodologies into two perspectives: transportation planning tasks and computational techniques. From the transportation planning perspective, we examine the role of GenAI in automating descriptive, predictive, generative, simulation, and explainable tasks to enhance mobility systems. From the computational perspective, we detail advancements in data preparation, domain-specific fine-tuning, and inference strategies, such as retrieval-augmented generation and zero-shot learning tailored to transportation applications. Additionally, we address critical challenges, including data scarcity, explainability, bias mitigation, and the development of domain-specific evaluation frameworks that align with transportation goals like sustainability, equity, and system efficiency. This survey aims to bridge the gap between traditional transportation planning methodologies and modern AI techniques, fostering collaboration and innovation. By addressing these challenges and opportunities, we seek to inspire future research that ensures ethical, equitable, and impactful use of generative AI in transportation planning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent research on Reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sought to further enhance their performance by integrating meta-thinking -- enabling models to monitor, evaluate, and control their reasoning processes for more adaptive and effective problem-solving. However, current single-agent work lacks a specialized design for acquiring meta-thinking, resulting in low efficacy. To address this challenge, we introduce Reinforced Meta-thinking Agents (ReMA), a novel framework that leverages Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to elicit meta-thinking behaviors, encouraging LLMs to think about thinking. ReMA decouples the reasoning process into two hierarchical agents: a high-level meta-thinking agent responsible for generating strategic oversight and plans, and a low-level reasoning agent for detailed executions. Through iterative reinforcement learning with aligned objectives, these agents explore and learn collaboration, leading to improved generalization and robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that ReMA outperforms single-agent RL baselines on complex reasoning tasks, including competitive-level mathematical benchmarks and LLM-as-a-Judge benchmarks. Comprehensive ablation studies further illustrate the evolving dynamics of each distinct agent, providing valuable insights into how the meta-thinking reasoning process enhances the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmed Said Donmez, Onur Unlu, Muhammed O. Sayin</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a new family of logit-Q dynamics for efficient learning in stochastic games by combining the log-linear learning (also known as logit dynamics) for the repeated play of normal-form games with Q-learning for unknown Markov decision processes within the auxiliary stage-game framework. In this framework, we view stochastic games as agents repeatedly playing some stage game associated with the current state of the underlying game while the agents' Q-functions determine the payoffs of these stage games. We show that the logit-Q dynamics presented reach (near) efficient equilibrium in stochastic teams with unknown dynamics and quantify the approximation error. We also show the rationality of the logit-Q dynamics against agents following pure stationary strategies and the convergence of the dynamics in stochastic games where the stage-payoffs induce potential games, yet only a single agent controls the state transitions beyond stochastic teams. The key idea is to approximate the dynamics with a fictional scenario where the Q-function estimates are stationary over epochs whose lengths grow at a sufficiently slow rate. We then couple the dynamics in the main and fictional scenarios to show that these two scenarios become more and more similar across epochs due to the vanishing step size and growing epoch lengths.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the context of autonomous navigation, effectively conveying abstract navigational cues to agents in dynamic environments presents significant challenges, particularly when navigation information is derived from diverse modalities such as both vision and high-level language descriptions. To address this issue, we introduce a novel technique termed `Virtual Guidance,' which is designed to visually represent non-visual instructional signals. These visual cues are overlaid onto the agent's camera view and served as comprehensible navigational guidance signals. To validate the concept of virtual guidance, we propose a sim-to-real framework that enables the transfer of the trained policy from simulated environments to real world, ensuring the adaptability of virtual guidance in practical scenarios. We evaluate and compare the proposed method against a non-visual guidance baseline through detailed experiments in simulation. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed virtual guidance approach outperforms the baseline methods across multiple scenarios and offers clear evidence of its effectiveness in autonomous navigation tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juyoung Yun, Sol Choi, Francois Rameau, Byungkon Kang, Zhoulai Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: With the increasing complexity of machine learning models, managing computational resources like memory and processing power has become a critical concern. Mixed precision techniques, which leverage different numerical precisions during model training and inference to optimize resource usage, have been widely adopted. However, access to hardware that supports lower precision formats (e.g., FP8 or FP4) remains limited, especially for practitioners with hardware constraints. For many with limited resources, the available options are restricted to using 32-bit, 16-bit, or a combination of the two. While it is commonly believed that 16-bit precision can achieve results comparable to full (32-bit) precision, this study is the first to systematically validate this assumption through both rigorous theoretical analysis and extensive empirical evaluation. Our theoretical formalization of floating-point errors and classification tolerance provides new insights into the conditions under which 16-bit precision can approximate 32-bit results. This study fills a critical gap, proving for the first time that standalone 16-bit precision neural networks match 32-bit and mixed-precision in accuracy while boosting computational speed. Given the widespread availability of 16-bit across GPUs, these findings are especially valuable for machine learning practitioners with limited hardware resources to make informed decisions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Moritz A. Zanger, Wendelin B\"ohmer, Matthijs T. J. Spaan</p>
<p>Abstract: In contrast to classical reinforcement learning (RL), distributional RL algorithms aim to learn the distribution of returns rather than their expected value. Since the nature of the return distribution is generally unknown a priori or arbitrarily complex, a common approach finds approximations within a set of representable, parametric distributions. Typically, this involves a projection of the unconstrained distribution onto the set of simplified distributions. We argue that this projection step entails a strong inductive bias when coupled with neural networks and gradient descent, thereby profoundly impacting the generalization behavior of learned models. In order to facilitate reliable uncertainty estimation through diversity, we study the combination of several different projections and representations in a distributional ensemble. We establish theoretical properties of such projection ensembles and derive an algorithm that uses ensemble disagreement, measured by the average 1-Wasserstein distance, as a bonus for deep exploration. We evaluate our algorithm on the behavior suite benchmark and VizDoom and find that diverse projection ensembles lead to significant performance improvements over existing methods on a variety of tasks with the most pronounced gains in directed exploration problems.</p>

This has many implications, for example, as AI-generated text becomes a significant fraction of the text, would this have an effect on the language capabilities of readers and also on the training of newer AI tools? Would it affect the evolution of languages? Focusing on one specific aspect of the language: words; will the use of tools such as ChatGPT increase or reduce the vocabulary used or the lexical richness? This has implications for words, as those not included in AI-generated content will tend to be less and less popular and may eventually be lost. In this work, we perform an initial comparison of the vocabulary and lexical richness of ChatGPT and humans when performing the same tasks. In more detail, two datasets containing the answers to different types of questions answered by ChatGPT and humans, and a third dataset in which ChatGPT paraphrases sentences and questions are used. The analysis shows that ChatGPT tends to use fewer distinct words and lower lexical richness than humans. These results are very preliminary and additional datasets and ChatGPT configurations have to be evaluated to extract more general conclusions. Therefore, further research is needed to understand how the use of ChatGPT and more broadly generative AI tools will affect the vocabulary and lexical richness in different types of text and languages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junjie Liu, Shaotian Yan, Chen Shen, Zhengdong Xiao, Liang Xie, Wenxiao Wang, Jieping Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Exploiting large language models (LLMs) to tackle reasoning has garnered growing attention. It still remains highly challenging to achieve satisfactory results in complex logical problems, characterized by plenty of premises within the context and requiring multi-hop reasoning. In particular, the reasoning capabilities of LLMs are brittle to disorder and distractibility. In this work, we first examine the mechanism from the perspective of information flow and reveal that LLMs confront difficulties akin to human-like cognitive biases when dealing with disordered and irrelevant content in reasoning tasks. However, in contrast to LLMs, disordered and irrelevant content does not significantly decrease human performance, as humans have a propensity to distill the most relevant information and systematically organize their thoughts, aiding them in responding to questions.Stem from that, we further propose a novel reasoning approach named Concise and Organized Perception (COP). COP carefully analyzes the given statements to identify the most pertinent information while eliminating redundancy efficiently. It then prompts the LLMs in a more organized form that adapts to the model's inference process. By perceiving concise and organized context, the reasoning abilities of LLMs can be better elicited. Extensive experimental results on several popular logical benchmarks (ProofWriter, PrOntoQA, PrOntoQA-OOD, and FOLIO) and mathematical benchmark (DI-GSM) show that COP significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the pursuit of fully autonomous robotic systems capable of taking over tasks traditionally performed by humans, the complexity of open-world environments poses a considerable challenge. Addressing this imperative, this study contributes to the field of Large Language Models (LLMs) applied to task and motion planning for robots. We propose a system architecture that orchestrates a seamless interplay between multiple cognitive levels, encompassing reasoning, planning, and motion generation. At its core lies a novel replanning strategy that handles physically grounded, logical, and semantic errors in the generated plans. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed feedback architecture, particularly its impact on executability, correctness, and time complexity via empirical evaluation in the context of a simulation and two intricate real-world scenarios: blocks world, barman and pizza preparation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingyan Zhu, Yiming Li, Junfeng Guo, Tao Wei, Shu-Tao Xia, Zhan Qin</p>
<p>Abstract: Currently, sample-specific backdoor attacks (SSBAs) are the most advanced and malicious methods since they can easily circumvent most of the current backdoor defenses. In this paper, we reveal that SSBAs are not sufficiently stealthy due to their poisoned-label nature, where users can discover anomalies if they check the image-label relationship. In particular, we demonstrate that it is ineffective to directly generalize existing SSBAs to their clean-label variants by poisoning samples solely from the target class. We reveal that it is primarily due to two reasons, including \textbf{(1)} the `antagonistic effects' of ground-truth features and \textbf{(2)} the learning difficulty of sample-specific features. Accordingly, trigger-related features of existing SSBAs cannot be effectively learned under the clean-label setting due to their mild trigger intensity required for ensuring stealthiness. We argue that the intensity constraint of existing SSBAs is mostly because their trigger patterns are `content-irrelevant' and therefore act as `noises' for both humans and DNNs. Motivated by this understanding, we propose to exploit content-relevant features, $a.k.a.$ (human-relied) attributes, as the trigger patterns to design clean-label SSBAs. This new attack paradigm is dubbed backdoor attack with attribute trigger (BAAT). Extensive experiments are conducted on benchmark datasets, which verify the effectiveness of our BAAT and its resistance to existing defenses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenyuan Yang, Zijie Zhao, Lingming Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Bugs in operating system kernels can affect billions of devices and users all over the world. As a result, a large body of research has been focused on kernel fuzzing, i.e., automatically generating syscall (system call) sequences to detect potential kernel bugs or vulnerabilities. Kernel fuzzing aims to generate valid syscall sequences guided by syscall specifications that define both the syntax and semantics of syscalls. While there has been existing work trying to automate syscall specification generation, this remains largely manual work, and a large number of important syscalls are still uncovered.
  In this paper, we propose KernelGPT, the first approach to automatically synthesizing syscall specifications via Large Language Models (LLMs) for enhanced kernel fuzzing. Our key insight is that LLMs have seen massive kernel code, documentation, and use cases during pre-training, and thus can automatically distill the necessary information for making valid syscalls. More specifically, KernelGPT leverages an iterative approach to automatically infer the specifications, and further debug and repair them based on the validation feedback. Our results demonstrate that KernelGPT can generate more new and valid specifications and achieve higher coverage than state-of-the-art techniques. So far, by using newly generated specifications, KernelGPT has already detected 24 new unique bugs in Linux kernel, with 12 fixed and 11 assigned with CVE numbers. Moreover, a number of specifications generated by KernelGPT have already been merged into the kernel fuzzer Syzkaller, following the request from its development team.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoxin Liu, Wenli Zhang, Jiaheng Xie, Buomsoo Kim, Zhu Zhang, Yidong Chai, Sudha Ram</p>
<p>Abstract: This study harnesses state-of-the-art AI technology for detecting mental disorders through user-generated textual content. Existing studies typically rely on fully supervised machine learning, which presents challenges such as the labor-intensive manual process of annotating extensive training data for each research problem and the need to design specialized deep learning architectures for each task. We propose a novel method to address these challenges by leveraging large language models and continuous multi-prompt engineering, which offers two key advantages: (1) developing personalized prompts that capture each user's unique characteristics and (2) integrating structured medical knowledge into prompts to provide context for disease detection and facilitate predictive modeling. We evaluate our method using three widely prevalent mental disorders as research cases. Our method significantly outperforms existing methods, including feature engineering, architecture engineering, and discrete prompt engineering. Meanwhile, our approach demonstrates success in few-shot learning, i.e., requiring only a minimal number of training examples. Moreover, our method can be generalized to other rare mental disorder detection tasks with few positive labels. In addition to its technical contributions, our method has the potential to enhance the well-being of individuals with mental disorders and offer a cost-effective, accessible alternative for stakeholders beyond traditional mental disorder screening methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sicen Guo, Ziwei Long, Zhiyuan Wu, Qijun Chen, Ioannis Pitas, Rui Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the impressive performance achieved by data-fusion networks with duplex encoders for visual semantic segmentation, they become ineffective when spatial geometric data are not available. Implicitly infusing the spatial geometric prior knowledge acquired by a data-fusion teacher network into a single-modal student network is a practical, albeit less explored research avenue. This article delves into this topic and resorts to knowledge distillation approaches to address this problem. We introduce the Learning to Infuse ''X'' (LIX) framework, with novel contributions in both logit distillation and feature distillation aspects. We present a mathematical proof that underscores the limitation of using a single, fixed weight in decoupled knowledge distillation and introduce a logit-wise dynamic weight controller as a solution to this issue. Furthermore, we develop an adaptively-recalibrated feature distillation algorithm, including two novel techniques: feature recalibration via kernel regression and in-depth feature consistency quantification via centered kernel alignment. Extensive experiments conducted with intermediate-fusion and late-fusion networks across various public datasets provide both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, demonstrating the superior performance of our LIX framework when compared to other state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stefan Andreas Baumann, Felix Krause, Michael Neumayr, Nick Stracke, Melvin Sevi, Vincent Tao Hu, Bj\"orn Ommer</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have significantly improved the quality of generated images. However, providing efficient control over individual subjects, particularly the attributes characterizing them, remains a key challenge. While existing methods have introduced mechanisms to modulate attribute expression, they typically provide either detailed, object-specific localization of such a modification or full-scale fine-grained, nuanced control of attributes. No current approach offers both simultaneously, resulting in a gap when trying to achieve precise continuous and subject-specific attribute modulation in image generation. In this work, we demonstrate that token-level directions exist within commonly used CLIP text embeddings that enable fine-grained, subject-specific control of high-level attributes in T2I models. We introduce two methods to identify these directions: a simple, optimization-free technique and a learning-based approach that utilizes the T2I model to characterize semantic concepts more specifically. Our methods allow the augmentation of the prompt text input, enabling fine-grained control over multiple attributes of individual subjects simultaneously, without requiring any modifications to the diffusion model itself. This approach offers a unified solution that fills the gap between global and localized control, providing competitive flexibility and precision in text-guided image generation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyang Wang, Shoubin Yu, Elias Stengel-Eskin, Jaehong Yoon, Feng Cheng, Gedas Bertasius, Mohit Bansal</p>
<p>Abstract: Long-form video understanding is complicated by the high redundancy of video data and the abundance of query-irrelevant information. To tackle these challenges, we propose VideoTree, a training-free framework which builds a query-adaptive and hierarchical video representation for LLM reasoning over long-form videos. First, VideoTree extracts query-relevant information from the input video through an iterative process, progressively refining the selection of keyframes based on their relevance to the query. Furthermore, VideoTree leverages the inherent hierarchical structure of long video data, which is often overlooked by existing LLM-based methods. Specifically, we incorporate multi-granularity information into a tree-based representation, allowing VideoTree to extract query-relevant details from long videos in a coarse-to-fine manner. This enables the model to effectively handle a wide range of video queries with varying levels of detail. Finally, VideoTree aggregates the hierarchical query-relevant information within the tree structure and feeds it into an LLM reasoning model to answer the query. Our experiments show that our method improves both reasoning accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, VideoTree outperforms existing training-free approaches on EgoSchema and NExT-QA with less inference time, achieving 61.1% and 75.6% accuracy on the test set without additional video-specific training. Moreover, on the long split of Video-MME (average 44 minutes), VideoTree achieves better performance than GPT-4V and many other MLLMs that were extensively trained on video data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Iaroslav Okunevich, Alexandre Lombard, Tomas Krajnik, Yassine Ruichek, Zhi Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Robot social navigation needs to adapt to different human factors and environmental contexts. However, since these factors and contexts are difficult to predict and cannot be exhaustively enumerated, traditional learning-based methods have difficulty in ensuring the social attributes of robots in long-term and cross-environment deployments. This letter introduces an online context learning method that aims to empower robots to adapt to new social environments online. The proposed method adopts a two-layer structure. The bottom layer is built using a deep reinforcement learning-based method to ensure the output of basic robot navigation commands. The upper layer is implemented using an online robot learning-based method to socialize the control commands suggested by the bottom layer. Experiments using a community-wide simulator show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art ones. Experimental results in the most challenging scenarios show that our method improves the performance of the state-of-the-art by 8%.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenbin An, Feng Tian, Sicong Leng, Jiahao Nie, Haonan Lin, QianYing Wang, Ping Chen, Xiaoqin Zhang, Shijian Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite great success across various multimodal tasks, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) often encounter object hallucinations with generated textual responses being inconsistent with the actual objects in images. We examine different LVLMs and pinpoint that one root cause of object hallucinations lies with deficient attention on discriminative image features. Specifically, LVLMs often predominantly attend to prompt-irrelevant global features instead of prompt-relevant local features, undermining their visual grounding capacity and leading to object hallucinations. We propose Assembly of Global and Local Attention (AGLA), a training-free and plug-and-play approach that mitigates hallucinations by assembling global features for response generation and local features for visual discrimination simultaneously. Specifically, we introduce an image-prompt matching scheme that captures prompt-relevant local features from images, leading to an augmented view of the input image where prompt-relevant content is highlighted while irrelevant distractions are suppressed. Hallucinations can thus be mitigated with a calibrated logit distribution that is from generative global features of the original image and discriminative local features of the augmented image. Extensive experiments show the superiority of AGLA in LVLM hallucination mitigation, demonstrating its wide applicability across both discriminative and generative tasks.

I do this by seeking to convince the reader that harmful biases are an inevitable consequence arising from the design of any large language model as LLMs are currently formulated. To the extent that this is true, it suggests that the problem of harmful bias cannot be properly addressed without a serious reconsideration of AI driven by LLMs, going back to the foundational assumptions underlying their design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengbo Zhang, Yuxi Zhou, Jia Gong, Jun Liu, Zhigang Tu</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) enhances the performance of a student network by allowing it to learn the knowledge transferred from a teacher network incrementally. Existing methods dynamically adjust the temperature to enable the student network to adapt to the varying learning difficulties at different learning stages of KD. KD is a continuous process, but when adjusting the temperature, these methods consider only the immediate benefits of the operation in the current learning phase and fail to take into account its future returns. To address this issue, we formulate the adjustment of temperature as a sequential decision-making task and propose a method based on reinforcement learning, termed RLKD. Importantly, we design a novel state representation to enable the agent to make more informed action (i.e. instance temperature adjustment). To handle the problem of delayed rewards in our method due to the KD setting, we explore an instance reward calibration approach. In addition,we devise an efficient exploration strategy that enables the agent to learn valuable instance temperature adjustment policy more efficiently. Our framework can serve as a plug-and-play technique to be inserted into various KD methods easily, and we validate its effectiveness on both image classification and object detection tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sara Mandelli, Edoardo Daniele Cannas, Paolo Bestagini, Stefano Tebaldini, Stefano Tubaro</p>
<p>Abstract: The vast accessibility of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images through online portals has propelled the research across various fields. This widespread use and easy availability have unfortunately made SAR data susceptible to malicious alterations, such as local editing applied to the images for inserting or covering the presence of sensitive targets. Vulnerability is further emphasized by the fact that most SAR products, despite their original complex nature, are often released as amplitude-only information, allowing even inexperienced attackers to edit and easily alter the pixel content. To contrast malicious manipulations, in the last years the forensic community has begun to dig into the SAR manipulation issue, proposing detectors that effectively localize the tampering traces in amplitude images. Nonetheless, in this paper we demonstrate that an expert practitioner can exploit the complex nature of SAR data to obscure any signs of manipulation within a locally altered amplitude image. We refer to this approach as a counter-forensic attack. To achieve the concealment of manipulation traces, the attacker can simulate a re-acquisition of the manipulated scene by the SAR system that initially generated the pristine image. In doing so, the attacker can obscure any evidence of manipulation, making it appear as if the image was legitimately produced by the system. This attack has unique features that make it both highly generalizable and relatively easy to apply. First, it is a black-box attack, meaning it is not designed to deceive a specific forensic detector. Furthermore, it does not require a training phase and is not based on adversarial operations. We assess the effectiveness of the proposed counter-forensic approach across diverse scenarios, examining various manipulation operations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yixiu Zhao, Jiaxin Shi, Feng Chen, Shaul Druckmann, Lester Mackey, Scott Linderman</p>
<p>Abstract: Discrete diffusion has emerged as a powerful framework for generative modeling in discrete domains, yet efficiently sampling from these models remains challenging. Existing sampling strategies often struggle to balance computation and sample quality when the number of sampling steps is reduced, even when the model has learned the data distribution well. To address these limitations, we propose a predictor-corrector sampling scheme where the corrector is informed by the diffusion model to more reliably counter the accumulating approximation errors. To further enhance the effectiveness of our informed corrector, we introduce complementary architectural modifications based on hollow transformers and a simple tailored training objective that leverages more training signal. We use a synthetic example to illustrate the failure modes of existing samplers and show how informed correctors alleviate these problems. On tokenized ImageNet 256x256, this approach consistently produces superior samples with fewer steps, achieving improved FID scores for discrete diffusion models. These results underscore the potential of informed correctors for fast and high-fidelity generation using discrete diffusion.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yijia Shao, Tianshi Li, Weiyan Shi, Yanchen Liu, Diyi Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: As language models (LMs) are widely utilized in personalized communication scenarios (e.g., sending emails, writing social media posts) and endowed with a certain level of agency, ensuring they act in accordance with the contextual privacy norms becomes increasingly critical. However, quantifying the privacy norm awareness of LMs and the emerging privacy risk in LM-mediated communication is challenging due to (1) the contextual and long-tailed nature of privacy-sensitive cases, and (2) the lack of evaluation approaches that capture realistic application scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose PrivacyLens, a novel framework designed to extend privacy-sensitive seeds into expressive vignettes and further into agent trajectories, enabling multi-level evaluation of privacy leakage in LM agents' actions. We instantiate PrivacyLens with a collection of privacy norms grounded in privacy literature and crowdsourced seeds. Using this dataset, we reveal a discrepancy between LM performance in answering probing questions and their actual behavior when executing user instructions in an agent setup. State-of-the-art LMs, like GPT-4 and Llama-3-70B, leak sensitive information in 25.68% and 38.69% of cases, even when prompted with privacy-enhancing instructions. We also demonstrate the dynamic nature of PrivacyLens by extending each seed into multiple trajectories to red-team LM privacy leakage risk.

<p>Abstract: The increasing size of screening libraries poses a significant challenge for the development of virtual screening methods for drug discovery, necessitating a re-evaluation of traditional approaches in the era of big data. Although 3D pharmacophore screening remains a prevalent technique, its application to very large datasets is limited by the computational cost associated with matching query pharmacophores to database molecules. In this study, we introduce PharmacoMatch, a novel contrastive learning approach based on neural subgraph matching. Our method reinterprets pharmacophore screening as an approximate subgraph matching problem and enables efficient querying of conformational databases by encoding query-target relationships in the embedding space. We conduct comprehensive investigations of the learned representations and evaluate PharmacoMatch as pre-screening tool in a zero-shot setting. We demonstrate significantly shorter runtimes and comparable performance metrics to existing solutions, providing a promising speed-up for screening very large datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Zhang, Yang Yuan, Andrew Chi-Chih Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Diagram of Thought (DoT), a framework that models iterative reasoning in large language models (LLMs) as the construction of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) within a single model. Unlike conventional approaches that represent reasoning as linear chains or tree structures, DoT organizes propositions, critiques, refinements, and verifications into a unified DAG, enabling the exploration of complex reasoning pathways while preserving logical consistency. In this framework, each node encapsulates a proposition at various stages of evaluation, thereby facilitating iterative self-improvement through detailed natural language feedback. By leveraging auto-regressive next-token prediction augmented with role-specific tokens, DoT seamlessly transitions between generating ideas and engaging in critical evaluation, offering richer, context-aware feedback than binary signals. Moreover, we establish a rigorous mathematical foundation for DoT through Topos Theory, ensuring soundness and consistency in the reasoning process. This integrated approach not only simplifies both training and inference by eliminating the need for multiple models or external control mechanisms but also provides a principled framework for the design of next-generation reasoning-specialized models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kangsheng Wang, Xiao Zhang, Zizheng Guo, Tianyu Hu, Huimin Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Chain-based reasoning methods like chain of thought (CoT) play a rising role in solving reasoning tasks for large language models (LLMs). However, the causal illusions between \textit{a step of reasoning} and \textit{corresponding state transitions} are becoming a significant obstacle to advancing LLMs' reasoning capabilities, especially in long-range reasoning tasks. This paper proposes a non-chain-based reasoning framework for simultaneous consideration of causal significance and consistency, i.e., the Causal Significance and Consistency Enhancer (CSCE). We customize LLM's loss function utilizing treatment effect assessments to enhance its reasoning ability from two aspects: causal significance and consistency. This ensures that the model captures essential causal relationships and maintains robust and consistent performance across various scenarios. Additionally, we transform the reasoning process from the cascading multiple one-step reasoning commonly used in Chain-Based methods, like CoT, to a causal-enhanced method that outputs the entire reasoning process in one go, further improving the model's reasoning efficiency. Extensive experiments show that our method improves both the reasoning success rate and speed. These improvements further demonstrate that non-chain-based methods can also aid LLMs in completing reasoning tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Angela Lopez-Cardona, Carlos Segura, Alexandros Karatzoglou, Sergi Abadal, Ioannis Arapakis</p>
<p>Abstract: Advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP), have led to the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT, Llama, Claude, and Gemini, which excel across a range of tasks but require extensive fine-tuning to align their outputs with human expectations. A widely used method for achieving this alignment is Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), which, despite its success, faces challenges in accurately modelling human preferences. In this paper, we introduce GazeReward, a novel framework that integrates implicit feedback -- and specifically eye-tracking (ET) data -- into the Reward Model (RM). In addition, we explore how ET-based features can provide insights into user preferences. Through ablation studies we test our framework with different integration methods, LLMs, and ET generator models, demonstrating that our approach significantly improves the accuracy of the RM on established human preference datasets. This work advances the ongoing discussion on optimizing AI alignment with human values, exploring the potential of cognitive data for shaping future NLP research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qianli Ma, Xuefei Ning, Dongrui Liu, Li Niu, Linfeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models are trained by learning a sequence of models that reverse each step of noise corruption. Typically, the model parameters are fully shared across multiple timesteps to enhance training efficiency. However, since the denoising tasks differ at each timestep, the gradients computed at different timesteps may conflict, potentially degrading the overall performance of image generation. To solve this issue, this work proposes a \textbf{De}couple-then-\textbf{Me}rge (\textbf{DeMe}) framework, which begins with a pretrained model and finetunes separate models tailored to specific timesteps. We introduce several improved techniques during the finetuning stage to promote effective knowledge sharing while minimizing training interference across timesteps. Finally, after finetuning, these separate models can be merged into a single model in the parameter space, ensuring efficient and practical inference. Experimental results show significant generation quality improvements upon 6 benchmarks including Stable Diffusion on COCO30K, ImageNet1K, PartiPrompts, and DDPM on LSUN Church, LSUN Bedroom, and CIFAR10.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Po-han Li, Sandeep P. Chinchali, Ufuk Topcu</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal encoders like CLIP excel in tasks such as zero-shot image classification and cross-modal retrieval. However, they require excessive training data. We propose canonical similarity analysis (CSA), which uses two unimodal encoders to replicate multimodal encoders using limited data. CSA maps unimodal features into a multimodal space, using a new similarity score to retain only the multimodal information. CSA only involves the inference of unimodal encoders and a cubic-complexity matrix decomposition, eliminating the need for extensive GPU-based model training. Experiments show that CSA outperforms CLIP while requiring $50,000\times$ fewer multimodal data pairs to bridge the modalities given pre-trained unimodal encoders on ImageNet classification and misinformative news caption detection. CSA surpasses the state-of-the-art method to map unimodal features to multimodal features. We also demonstrate the ability of CSA with modalities beyond image and text, paving the way for future modality pairs with limited paired multimodal data but abundant unpaired unimodal data, such as lidar and text.</p>

<p>Abstract: Purpose: We introduce a novel methodology for voice pathology detection using the publicly available Saarbr\"ucken Voice Database (SVD) and a robust feature set combining commonly used acoustic handcrafted features with two novel ones: pitch difference (relative variation in fundamental frequency) and NaN feature (failed fundamental frequency estimation).
  Methods: We evaluate six machine learning (ML) algorithms -- support vector machine, k-nearest neighbors, naive Bayes, decision tree, random forest, and AdaBoost -- using grid search for feasible hyperparameters and 20480 different feature subsets. Top 1000 classification models -- feature subset combinations for each ML algorithm are validated with repeated stratified cross-validation. To address class imbalance, we apply K-Means SMOTE to augment the training data.
  Results: Our approach achieves 85.61%, 84.69% and 85.22% unweighted average recall (UAR) for females, males and combined results respectively. We intentionally omit accuracy as it is a highly biased metric for imbalanced data.
  Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that by following the proposed methodology and feature engineering, there is a potential in detection of various voice pathologies using ML models applied to the simplest vocal task, a sustained utterance of the vowel /a:/. To enable easier use of our methodology and to support our claims, we provide a publicly available GitHub repository with DOI 10.5281/zenodo.13771573.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaohao Rui, Lingzhi Chen, Zhenyu Tang, Lilong Wang, Mianxin Liu, Shaoting Zhang, Xiaosong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning has greatly facilitated medical image analysis by suppressing the training data requirement for real-world applications. Current paradigms predominantly rely on self-supervision within uni-modal image data, thereby neglecting the inter-modal correlations essential for effective learning of cross-modal image representations. This limitation is particularly significant for naturally grouped multi-modal data, e.g., multi-parametric MRI scans for a patient undergoing various functional imaging protocols in the same study. To bridge this gap, we conduct a novel multi-modal image pre-training with three proxy tasks to facilitate the learning of cross-modality representations and correlations using multi-modal brain MRI scans (over 2.4 million images in 16,022 scans of 3,755 patients), i.e., cross-modal image reconstruction, modality-aware contrastive learning, and modality template distillation. To demonstrate the generalizability of our pre-trained model, we conduct extensive experiments on various benchmarks with ten downstream tasks. The superior performance of our method is reported in comparison to state-of-the-art pre-training methods, with Dice Score improvement of 0.28\%-14.47\% across six segmentation benchmarks and a consistent accuracy boost of 0.65\%-18.07\% in four individual image classification tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaehong Yoon, Shoubin Yu, Vaidehi Patil, Huaxiu Yao, Mohit Bansal</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly enhanced their ability to generate high-quality images and videos, but they have also increased the risk of producing unsafe content. Existing unlearning/editing-based methods for safe generation remove harmful concepts from models but face several challenges: (1) They cannot instantly remove harmful concepts without training. (2) Their safe generation capabilities depend on collected training data. (3) They alter model weights, risking degradation in quality for content unrelated to toxic concepts. To address these, we propose SAFREE, a novel, training-free approach for safe T2I and T2V, that does not alter the model's weights. Specifically, we detect a subspace corresponding to a set of toxic concepts in the text embedding space and steer prompt embeddings away from this subspace, thereby filtering out harmful content while preserving intended semantics. To balance the trade-off between filtering toxicity and preserving safe concepts, SAFREE incorporates a novel self-validating filtering mechanism that dynamically adjusts the denoising steps when applying the filtered embeddings. Additionally, we incorporate adaptive re-attention mechanisms within the diffusion latent space to selectively diminish the influence of features related to toxic concepts at the pixel level. In the end, SAFREE ensures coherent safety checking, preserving the fidelity, quality, and safety of the output. SAFREE achieves SOTA performance in suppressing unsafe content in T2I generation compared to training-free baselines and effectively filters targeted concepts while maintaining high-quality images. It also shows competitive results against training-based methods. We extend SAFREE to various T2I backbones and T2V tasks, showcasing its flexibility and generalization. SAFREE provides a robust and adaptable safeguard for ensuring safe visual generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiyu Wang, Jiawei Li, Xiaoming Shi, Zhou Ye, Baichuan Mo, Wenze Lin, Shengtong Ju, Zhixuan Chu, Ming Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series analysis plays a critical role in numerous applications, supporting tasks such as forecasting, classification, anomaly detection, and imputation. In this work, we present the time series pattern machine (TSPM), a model designed to excel in a broad range of time series tasks through powerful representation and pattern extraction capabilities. Traditional time series models often struggle to capture universal patterns, limiting their effectiveness across diverse tasks. To address this, we define multiple scales in the time domain and various resolutions in the frequency domain, employing various mixing strategies to extract intricate, task-adaptive time series patterns. Specifically, we introduce a general-purpose TSPM that processes multi-scale time series using (1) multi-resolution time imaging (MRTI), (2) time image decomposition (TID), (3) multi-scale mixing (MCM), and (4) multi-resolution mixing (MRM) to extract comprehensive temporal patterns. MRTI transforms multi-scale time series into multi-resolution time images, capturing patterns across both temporal and frequency domains. TID leverages dual-axis attention to extract seasonal and trend patterns, while MCM hierarchically aggregates these patterns across scales. MRM adaptively integrates all representations across resolutions. This method achieves state-of-the-art performance across 8 time series analytical tasks, consistently surpassing both general-purpose and task-specific models. Our work marks a promising step toward the next generation of TSPMs, paving the way for further advancements in time series analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weikai Li, Ding Wang, Zijian Ding, Atefeh Sohrabizadeh, Zongyue Qin, Jason Cong, Yizhou Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: High-level synthesis (HLS) is a widely used tool in designing Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). HLS enables FPGA design with software programming languages by compiling the source code into an FPGA circuit. The source code includes a program (called "kernel") and several pragmas that instruct hardware synthesis, such as parallelization, pipeline, etc. While it is relatively easy for software developers to design the program, it heavily relies on hardware knowledge to design the pragmas, posing a big challenge for software developers. Recently, different machine learning algorithms, such as GNNs, have been proposed to automate the pragma design via performance prediction. However, when applying the trained model on new kernels, the significant domain shift often leads to unsatisfactory performance. We propose a more domain-generalizable model structure: a two-level hierarchical Mixture of Experts (MoE), that can be flexibly adapted to any GNN model. Different expert networks can learn to deal with different regions in the representation space, and they can utilize similar patterns between the old kernels and new kernels. In the low-level MoE, we apply MoE on three natural granularities of a program: node, basic block, and graph. The high-level MoE learns to aggregate the three granularities for the final decision. To train the hierarchical MoE stably, we further propose a two-stage training method to avoid expert polarization. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed hierarchical MoE.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yirong Sun, Dawei Zhu, Yanjun Chen, Erjia Xiao, Xinghao Chen, Xiaoyu Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have excelled in various NLP tasks, including machine translation (MT), yet most studies focus on sentence-level translation. This work investigates the inherent capability of instruction-tuned LLMs for document-level translation (docMT). Unlike prior approaches that require specialized techniques, we evaluate LLMs by directly prompting them to translate entire documents in a single pass. Our results show that this method improves translation quality compared to translating sentences separately, even without document-level fine-tuning. However, this advantage is not reflected in BLEU scores, which often favor sentence-based translations. We propose using the LLM-as-a-judge paradigm for evaluation, where GPT-4 is used to assess document coherence, accuracy, and fluency in a more nuanced way than n-gram-based metrics. Overall, our work demonstrates that instruction-tuned LLMs can effectively leverage document context for translation. However, we caution against using BLEU scores for evaluating docMT, as they often provide misleading outcomes, failing to capture the quality of document-level translation. Code and the outputs from GPT4-as-a-judge are available at https://github.com/EIT-NLP/BLEUless_DocMT</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxun Qu, Yongqiang Tang, Chenyang Zhang, Wensheng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Different from the traditional semi-supervised learning paradigm that is constrained by the close-world assumption, Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) presumes that the unlabeled dataset contains new categories not appearing in the labeled set, and aims to not only classify old categories but also discover new categories in the unlabeled data. Existing studies on GCD typically devote to transferring the general knowledge from the self-supervised pretrained model to the target GCD task via some fine-tuning strategies, such as partial tuning and prompt learning. Nevertheless, these fine-tuning methods fail to make a sound balance between the generalization capacity of pretrained backbone and the adaptability to the GCD task. To fill this gap, in this paper, we propose a novel adapter-tuning-based method named AdaptGCD, which is the first work to introduce the adapter tuning into the GCD task and provides some key insights expected to enlighten future research. Furthermore, considering the discrepancy of supervision information between the old and new classes, a multi-expert adapter structure equipped with a route assignment constraint is elaborately devised, such that the data from old and new classes are separated into different expert groups. Extensive experiments are conducted on 7 widely-used datasets. The remarkable improvements in performance highlight the effectiveness of our proposals.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jialin Lu, Junjie Shan, Ziqi Zhao, Ka-Ho Chow</p>
<p>Abstract: As object detection becomes integral to many safety-critical applications, understanding its vulnerabilities is essential. Backdoor attacks, in particular, pose a serious threat by implanting hidden triggers in victim models, which adversaries can later exploit to induce malicious behaviors during inference. However, current understanding is limited to single-target attacks, where adversaries must define a fixed malicious behavior (target) before training, making inference-time adaptability impossible. Given the large output space of object detection (including object existence prediction, bounding box estimation, and classification), the feasibility of flexible, inference-time model control remains unexplored. This paper introduces AnywhereDoor, a multi-target backdoor attack for object detection. Once implanted, AnywhereDoor allows adversaries to make objects disappear, fabricate new ones, or mislabel them, either across all object classes or specific ones, offering an unprecedented degree of control. This flexibility is enabled by three key innovations: (i) objective disentanglement to scale the number of supported targets; (ii) trigger mosaicking to ensure robustness even against region-based detectors; and (iii) strategic batching to address object-level data imbalances that hinder manipulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnywhereDoor grants attackers a high degree of control, improving attack success rates by 26% compared to adaptations of existing methods for such flexible control.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present PersonaCraft, a framework for controllable and occlusion-robust full-body personalized image synthesis of multiple individuals in complex scenes. Current methods struggle with occlusion-heavy scenarios and complete body personalization, as 2D pose conditioning lacks 3D geometry, often leading to ambiguous occlusions and anatomical distortions, and many approaches focus solely on facial identity. In contrast, our PersonaCraft integrates diffusion models with 3D human modeling, employing SMPLx-ControlNet, to utilize 3D geometry like depth and normal maps for robust 3D-aware pose conditioning and enhanced anatomical coherence. To handle fine-grained occlusions, we propose Occlusion Boundary Enhancer Network that exploits depth edge signals with occlusion-focused training, and Occlusion-Aware Classifier-Free Guidance strategy that selectively reinforces conditioning in occluded regions without affecting unoccluded areas. PersonaCraft can seamlessly be combined with Face Identity ControlNet, achieving full-body multi-human personalization and thus marking a significant advancement beyond prior approaches that concentrate only on facial identity. Our dual-pathway body shape representation with SMPLx-based shape parameters and textual refinement, enables precise full-body personalization and flexible user-defined body shape adjustments. Extensive quantitative experiments and user studies demonstrate that PersonaCraft significantly outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality, multi-person images with accurate personalization and robust occlusion handling.</p>

<p>Abstract: Wearable silent speech systems hold significant potential for restoring communication in patients with speech impairments. However, seamless, coherent speech remains elusive, and clinical efficacy is still unproven. Here, we present an AI-driven intelligent throat (IT) system that integrates throat muscle vibrations and carotid pulse signal sensors with large language model (LLM) processing to enable fluent, emotionally expressive communication. The system utilizes ultrasensitive textile strain sensors to capture high-quality signals from the neck area and supports token-level processing for real-time, continuous speech decoding, enabling seamless, delay-free communication. In tests with five stroke patients with dysarthria, IT's LLM agents intelligently corrected token errors and enriched sentence-level emotional and logical coherence, achieving low error rates (4.2% word error rate, 2.9% sentence error rate) and a 55% increase in user satisfaction. This work establishes a portable, intuitive communication platform for patients with dysarthria with the potential to be applied broadly across different neurological conditions and in multi-language support systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyu Chang, Xiaohao Chen, Zhichao Wei, Xuanpu Zhang, Qing-Guo Chen, Weihua Luo, Peipei Song, Xun Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Video Virtual Try-on aims to seamlessly transfer a reference garment onto a target person in a video while preserving both visual fidelity and temporal coherence. Existing methods typically rely on inpainting masks to define the try-on area, enabling accurate garment transfer for simple scenes (e.g., in-shop videos). However, these mask-based approaches struggle with complex real-world scenarios, as overly large and inconsistent masks often destroy spatial-temporal information, leading to distorted results. Mask-free methods alleviate this issue but face challenges in accurately determining the try-on area, especially for videos with dynamic body movements. To address these limitations, we propose PEMF-VTO, a novel Point-Enhanced Mask-Free Video Virtual Try-On framework that leverages sparse point alignments to explicitly guide garment transfer. Our key innovation is the introduction of point-enhanced guidance, which provides flexible and reliable control over both spatial-level garment transfer and temporal-level video coherence. Specifically, we design a Point-Enhanced Transformer (PET) with two core components: Point-Enhanced Spatial Attention (PSA), which uses frame-cloth point alignments to precisely guide garment transfer, and Point-Enhanced Temporal Attention (PTA), which leverages frame-frame point correspondences to enhance temporal coherence and ensure smooth transitions across frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our PEMF-VTO outperforms state-of-the-art methods, generating more natural, coherent, and visually appealing try-on videos, particularly for challenging in-the-wild scenarios.

<p>Abstract: Analyses of human motion kinematics have achieved tremendous advances. However, the production mechanism, known as human dynamics, is still undercovered. In this paper, we aim to push data-driven human dynamics understanding forward. We identify a major obstacle to this as the heterogeneity of existing human motion understanding efforts. Specifically, heterogeneity exists in not only the diverse kinematics representations and hierarchical dynamics representations but also in the data from different domains, namely biomechanics and reinforcement learning. With an in-depth analysis of the existing heterogeneity, we propose to emphasize the beneath homogeneity: all of them represent the homogeneous fact of human motion, though from different perspectives. Given this, we propose Homogeneous Dynamics Space (HDyS) as a fundamental space for human dynamics by aggregating heterogeneous data and training a homogeneous latent space with inspiration from the inverse-forward dynamics procedure. Leveraging the heterogeneous representations and datasets, HDyS achieves decent mapping between human kinematics and dynamics. We demonstrate the feasibility of HDyS with extensive experiments and applications. The project page is https://foruck.github.io/HDyS.</p>

<p>Abstract: Synchronization is an emergent and fundamental phenomenon in nature and engineered systems. Understanding the stability of a synchronized phenomenon is crucial for ensuring functionality in various complex systems. The stability of the synchronization phenomenon is extensively studied using the Master Stability Function (MSF). This powerful and elegant tool plays a pivotal role in determining the stability of synchronization states, providing deep insights into synchronization in coupled systems. Although MSF analysis has been used for 25 years to study the stability of synchronization states, a systematic investigation of MSF across various networked systems remains missing from the literature. In this article, we present a simplified and unified MSF analysis for diverse undirected and directed networked systems. We begin with the analytical MSF framework for pairwise-coupled identical systems with diffusive and natural coupling schemes and extend our analysis to directed networks and multilayer networks, considering both intra-layer and inter-layer interactions. Furthermore, we revisit the MSF framework to incorporate higher-order interactions alongside pairwise interactions. To enhance understanding, we also provide a numerical analysis of synchronization in coupled R\"ossler systems under pairwise diffusive coupling and propose algorithms for determining the MSF, identifying stability regimes, and classifying MSF functions. Overall, the primary goal of this review is to present a systematic study of MSF in coupled dynamical networks in a clear and structured manner, making this powerful tool more accessible. Furthermore, we highlight cases where the study of synchronization states using MSF remains underexplored. Additionally, we discuss recent research focusing on MSF analysis using time series data and machine learning approaches.</p>

To address this challenge, we propose HALLUCINOGEN, a novel visual question answering (VQA) benchmark that employs contextual reasoning prompts as hallucination attacks to evaluate the extent of hallucination in state-of-the-art LVLMs. Our benchmark provides a comprehensive study of the implicit reasoning capabilities of these models by first categorizing visual entities based on the ease of recognition in an image as either salient (prominent, visibly recognizable objects such as a car) or latent entities (such as identifying a disease from a chest X-ray), which are not readily visible and require domain knowledge or contextual reasoning for accurate inference. Next, we design hallucination attacks for both types of entities to assess hallucinations in LVLMs while performing various vision-language tasks, such as locating or reasoning about specific entities within an image, where models must perform implicit reasoning by verifying the existence of the queried entity within the image before generating responses. Finally, our extensive evaluations of eleven LVLMs, including powerful open-source models (like LLaMA-3.2 and DeepSeek-V2), commercial models like Gemini, and two hallucination mitigation strategies across multiple datasets, demonstrate that current LVLMs remain susceptible to hallucination attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiajun Cao, Yuan Zhang, Tao Huang, Ming Lu, Qizhe Zhang, Ruichuan An, Ningning MA, Shanghang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual encoders are fundamental components in vision-language models (VLMs), each showcasing unique strengths derived from various pre-trained visual foundation models. To leverage the various capabilities of these encoders, recent studies incorporate multiple encoders within a single VLM, leading to a considerable increase in computational cost. In this paper, we present Mixture-of-Visual-Encoder Knowledge Distillation (MoVE-KD), a novel framework that distills the unique proficiencies of multiple vision encoders into a single, efficient encoder model. Specifically, to mitigate conflicts and retain the unique characteristics of each teacher encoder, we employ low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and mixture-of-experts (MoEs) to selectively activate specialized knowledge based on input features, enhancing both adaptability and efficiency. To regularize the KD process and enhance performance, we propose an attention-based distillation strategy that adaptively weighs the different encoders and emphasizes valuable visual tokens, reducing the burden of replicating comprehensive but distinct features from multiple teachers. Comprehensive experiments on popular VLMs, such as LLaVA and LLaVA-NeXT, validate the effectiveness of our method. Our code is available at: https://github.com/hey-cjj/MoVE-KD.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zongxia Li, Xiyang Wu, Hongyang Du, Huy Nghiem, Guangyao Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Vision Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a transformative technology at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing, enabling machines to perceive and reason about the world through both visual and textual modalities. For example, models such as CLIP, Claude, and GPT-4V demonstrate strong reasoning and understanding abilities on visual and textual data and beat classical single modality vision models on zero-shot classification. Despite their rapid advancements in research and growing popularity in applications, a comprehensive survey of existing studies on VLMs is notably lacking, particularly for researchers aiming to leverage VLMs in their specific domains. To this end, we provide a systematic overview of VLMs in the following aspects: model information of the major VLMs developed over the past five years (2019-2024); the main architectures and training methods of these VLMs; summary and categorization of the popular benchmarks and evaluation metrics of VLMs; the applications of VLMs including embodied agents, robotics, and video generation; the challenges and issues faced by current VLMs such as hallucination, fairness, and safety.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaxing Zhao, Boyuan Sun, Xiang Chen, Xihan Wei, Qibin Hou</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce LLaVA-Octopus, a novel video multimodal large language model. LLaVA-Octopus adaptively weights features from different visual projectors based on user instructions, enabling us to leverage the complementary strengths of each projector. We observe that different visual projectors exhibit distinct characteristics when handling specific tasks. For instance, some projectors excel at capturing static details, while others are more effective at processing temporal information, and some are better suited for tasks requiring temporal coherence. By dynamically adjusting feature weights according to user instructions, LLaVA-Octopus dynamically selects and combines the most suitable features, significantly enhancing the model's performance in multimodal tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that LLaVA-Octopus achieves excellent performance across multiple benchmarks, especially in tasks such as video question answering, long video understanding, and comprehensive multi-choices benchmarks, highlighting its broad application potential.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xueyi Ke, Satoshi Tsutsui, Yayun Zhang, Bihan Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: Infants develop complex visual understanding rapidly, even preceding of the acquisition of linguistic inputs. As computer vision seeks to replicate the human vision system, understanding infant visual development may offer valuable insights. In this paper, we present an interdisciplinary study exploring this question: can a computational model that imitates the infant learning process develop broader visual concepts that extend beyond the vocabulary it has heard, similar to how infants naturally learn? To investigate this, we analyze a recently published model in Science by Vong et al.,which is trained on longitudinal, egocentric images of a single child paired with transcribed parental speech. We introduce a training-free framework that can discover visual concept neurons hidden in the model's internal representations. Our findings show that these neurons can classify objects outside its original vocabulary. Furthermore, we compare the visual representations in infant-like models with those in moder computer vision models, such as CLIP or ImageNet pre-trained model, highlighting key similarities and differences. Ultimately, our work bridges cognitive science and computer vision by analyzing the internal representations of a computational model trained on an infant's visual and linguistic inputs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi-Ping Chen, Vispi Karkaria, Ying-Kuan Tsai, Faith Rolark, Daniel Quispe, Robert X. Gao, Jian Cao, Wei Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Digital Twin -- a virtual replica of a physical system enabling real-time monitoring, model updating, prediction, and decision-making -- combined with recent advances in machine learning, offers new opportunities for proactive control strategies in autonomous manufacturing. However, achieving real-time decision-making with Digital Twins requires efficient optimization driven by accurate predictions of highly nonlinear manufacturing systems. This paper presents a simultaneous multi-step Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework for real-time decision-making, using a multivariate deep neural network, named Time-Series Dense Encoder (TiDE), as the surrogate model. Unlike conventional MPC models which only provide one-step ahead prediction, TiDE is capable of predicting future states within the prediction horizon in one shot (multi-step), significantly accelerating the MPC. Using Directed Energy Deposition (DED) additive manufacturing as a case study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MPC in achieving melt pool temperature tracking to ensure part quality, while reducing porosity defects by regulating laser power to maintain melt pool depth constraints. In this work, we first show that TiDE is capable of accurately predicting melt pool temperature and depth. Second, we demonstrate that the proposed MPC achieves precise temperature tracking while satisfying melt pool depth constraints within a targeted dilution range (10\%-30\%), reducing potential porosity defects. Compared to PID controller, the MPC results in smoother and less fluctuating laser power profiles with competitive or superior melt pool temperature control performance. This demonstrates the MPC's proactive control capabilities, leveraging time-series prediction and real-time optimization, positioning it as a powerful tool for future Digital Twin applications and real-time process optimization in manufacturing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kristof Meding</p>
<p>Abstract: What constitutes a fair decision? This question is not only difficult for humans but becomes more challenging when Artificial Intelligence (AI) models are used. In light of discriminatory algorithmic behaviors, the EU has recently passed the AI Act, which mandates specific rules for AI models, incorporating both traditional legal non-discrimination regulations and machine learning based algorithmic fairness concepts. This paper aims to bridge these two different concepts in the AI Act through: First a high-level introduction of both concepts targeting legal and computer science-oriented scholars, and second an in-depth analysis of the AI Act's relationship between legal non-discrimination regulations and algorithmic fairness. Our analysis reveals three key findings: (1.), most non-discrimination regulations target only high-risk AI systems. (2.), the regulation of high-risk systems encompasses both data input requirements and output monitoring, though these regulations are often inconsistent and raise questions of computational feasibility. (3.) Regulations for General Purpose AI Models, such as Large Language Models that are not simultaneously classified as high-risk systems, currently lack specificity compared to other regulations. Based on these findings, we recommend developing more specific auditing and testing methodologies for AI systems. This paper aims to serve as a foundation for future interdisciplinary collaboration between legal scholars and computer science-oriented machine learning researchers studying discrimination in AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taehan Kim, Wonduk Seo</p>
<p>Abstract: Global climate change has reduced crop resilience and pesticide efficacy, making reliance on synthetic pesticides inevitable, even though their widespread use poses significant health and environmental risks. While these pesticides remain a key tool in pest management, previous machine-learning applications in pesticide and agriculture have focused on classification or regression, leaving the fundamental challenge of generating new molecular structures or designing novel candidates unaddressed. In this paper, we propose Pesti-Gen, a novel generative model based on variational auto-encoders, designed to create pesticide candidates with optimized properties for the first time. Specifically, Pesti-Gen leverages a two-stage learning process: an initial pre-training phase that captures a generalized chemical structure representation, followed by a fine-tuning stage that incorporates toxicity-specific information. The model simultaneously optimizes over multiple toxicity metrics, such as (1) livestock toxicity and (2) aqua toxicity to generate environmentally friendly pesticide candidates. Notably, Pesti-Gen achieves approximately 68\% structural validity in generating new molecular structures, demonstrating the model's effectiveness in producing optimized and feasible pesticide candidates, thereby providing a new way for safer and more sustainable pest management solutions.</p>

<p>Abstract: The U.S. allocates nearly 18% of its GDP to healthcare but experiences lower life expectancy and higher preventable death rates compared to other high-income nations. Hospitals struggle to predict critical outcomes such as mortality, ICU admission, and prolonged hospital stays. Traditional early warning systems, like NEWS and MEWS, rely on static variables and fixed thresholds, limiting their adaptability, accuracy, and personalization. We developed the Enhanced Transformer for Health Outcome Simulation (ETHOS), an AI model that tokenizes patient health timelines (PHTs) from EHRs and uses transformer-based architectures to predict future PHTs. The Adaptive Risk Estimation System (ARES) leverages ETHOS to compute dynamic, personalized risk probabilities for clinician-defined critical events. ARES also features a personalized explainability module highlighting key clinical factors influencing risk estimates. We evaluated ARES on the MIMIC-IV v2.2 dataset in emergency department settings, benchmarking its performance against traditional early warning systems and machine learning models. From 299,721 unique patients, 285,622 PHTs (60% with hospital admissions) were processed, comprising over 357 million tokens. ETHOS outperformed benchmark models in predicting hospital admissions, ICU admissions, and prolonged stays, achieving superior AUC scores. Its risk estimates were robust across demographic subgroups, with calibration curves confirming model reliability. The explainability module provided valuable insights into patient-specific risk factors. ARES, powered by ETHOS, advances predictive healthcare AI by delivering dynamic, real-time, personalized risk estimation with patient-specific explainability. Its adaptability and accuracy offer a transformative tool for clinical decision-making, potentially improving patient outcomes and resource allocation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ai Chen, Yuxu Lu, Dong Yang, Junlin Zhou, Yan Fu, Duanbing Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Salient object detection (SOD) plays a critical role in intelligent transportation systems (ITS), facilitating the detection and segmentation of key visual elements in an image. However, adverse imaging conditions such as haze during the day, low light, and haze at night severely degrade image quality and hinder reliable object detection in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-knowledge-oriented nighttime haze imaging enhancer (MKoIE), which integrates three tasks: daytime dehazing, low-light enhancement, and nighttime dehazing. The MKoIE incorporates two key innovative components: First, the network employs a task-oriented node learning mechanism to handle three specific degradation types: day-time haze, low light, and night-time haze conditions, with an embedded self-attention module enhancing its performance in nighttime imaging. In addition, multi-receptive field enhancement module that efficiently extracts multi-scale features through three parallel depthwise separable convolution branches with different dilation rates, capturing comprehensive spatial information with minimal computational overhead to meet the requirements of real-time ITS deployment. To ensure optimal image reconstruction quality and visual characteristics, we suggest a hybrid loss function. Extensive experiments on different types of weather/imaging conditions illustrate that MKoIE surpasses existing methods, enhancing the reliability, accuracy, and operational efficiency of ITS.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen-Chen Zong, Sheng-Jun Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Active learning (AL), which iteratively queries the most informative examples from a large pool of unlabeled candidates for model training, faces significant challenges in the presence of open-set classes. Existing methods either prioritize query examples likely to belong to known classes, indicating low epistemic uncertainty (EU), or focus on querying those with highly uncertain predictions, reflecting high aleatoric uncertainty (AU). However, they both yield suboptimal performance, as low EU corresponds to limited useful information, and closed-set AU metrics for unknown class examples are less meaningful. In this paper, we propose an Energy-based Active Open-set Annotation (EAOA) framework, which effectively integrates EU and AU to achieve superior performance. EAOA features a $(C+1)$-class detector and a target classifier, incorporating an energy-based EU measure and a margin-based energy loss designed for the detector, alongside an energy-based AU measure for the target classifier. Another crucial component is the target-driven adaptive sampling strategy. It first forms a smaller candidate set with low EU scores to ensure closed-set properties, making AU metrics meaningful. Subsequently, examples with high AU scores are queried to form the final query set, with the candidate set size adjusted adaptively. Extensive experiments show that EAOA achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining high query precision and low training overhead.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoxin Liu, Zhiyuan Zhao, Shiduo Li, B. Aditya Prakash</p>
<p>Abstract: Reasoning ability is crucial for solving challenging tasks. With the advancement of foundation models, such as the emergence of large language models (LLMs), a wide range of reasoning strategies has been proposed, including test-time enhancements, such as Chain-ofThought, and post-training optimizations, as used in DeepSeek-R1. While these reasoning strategies have demonstrated effectiveness across various challenging language or vision tasks, their applicability and impact on time-series forecasting (TSF), particularly the challenging zero-shot TSF, remain largely unexplored. In particular, it is unclear whether zero-shot TSF benefits from reasoning and, if so, what types of reasoning strategies are most effective. To bridge this gap, we propose ReC4TS, the first benchmark that systematically evaluates the effectiveness of popular reasoning strategies when applied to zero-shot TSF tasks. ReC4TS conducts comprehensive evaluations across datasets spanning eight domains, covering both unimodal and multimodal with short-term and longterm forecasting tasks. More importantly, ReC4TS provides key insights: (1) Self-consistency emerges as the most effective test-time reasoning strategy; (2) Group-relative policy optimization emerges as a more suitable approach for incentivizing reasoning ability during post-training; (3) Multimodal TSF benefits more from reasoning strategies compared to unimodal TSF. Beyond these insights, ReC4TS establishes two pioneering starting blocks to support future zero-shot TSF reasoning research: (1) A novel dataset, TimeThinking, containing forecasting samples annotated with reasoning trajectories from multiple advanced LLMs, and (2) A new and simple test-time scaling-law validated on foundational TSF models enabled by self-consistency reasoning strategy.

<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable advances in various image generation tasks. However, their performance notably declines when generating images at resolutions higher than those used during the training period. Despite the existence of numerous methods for producing high-resolution images, they either suffer from inefficiency or are hindered by complex operations. In this paper, we propose RectifiedHR, an straightforward and efficient solution for training-free high-resolution image generation. Specifically, we introduce the noise refresh strategy, which theoretically only requires a few lines of code to unlock the model's high-resolution generation ability and improve efficiency. Additionally, we first observe the phenomenon of energy decay that may cause image blurriness during the high-resolution image generation process. To address this issue, we introduce average latent energy analysis and discover that an improved classifier-free guidance hyperparameter can significantly enhance generation performance. Our method is entirely training-free and boasts a simple implementation logic and efficient performance. Through extensive comparisons with numerous baseline methods, our RectifiedHR demonstrates superior effectiveness and efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaekyeom Kim, Sungryull Sohn, Gerrard Jeongwon Jo, Jihoon Choi, Kyunghoon Bae, Hwayoung Lee, Yongmin Park, Honglak Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper argues that a dataset's legal risk cannot be accurately assessed by its license terms alone; instead, tracking dataset redistribution and its full lifecycle is essential. However, this process is too complex for legal experts to handle manually at scale. Tracking dataset provenance, verifying redistribution rights, and assessing evolving legal risks across multiple stages require a level of precision and efficiency that exceeds human capabilities. Addressing this challenge effectively demands AI agents that can systematically trace dataset redistribution, analyze compliance, and identify legal risks. We develop an automated data compliance system called NEXUS and show that AI can perform these tasks with higher accuracy, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness than human experts. Our massive legal analysis of 17,429 unique entities and 8,072 license terms using this approach reveals the discrepancies in legal rights between the original datasets before redistribution and their redistributed subsets, underscoring the necessity of the data lifecycle-aware compliance. For instance, we find that out of 2,852 datasets with commercially viable individual license terms, only 605 (21%) are legally permissible for commercialization. This work sets a new standard for AI data governance, advocating for a framework that systematically examines the entire lifecycle of dataset redistribution to ensure transparent, legal, and responsible dataset management.</p>

<p>Abstract: Learnable Image Compression (LIC) has shown the potential to outperform standardized video codecs in RD efficiency, prompting the research for hardware-friendly implementations. Most existing LIC hardware implementations prioritize latency to RD-efficiency and through an extensive exploration of the hardware design space. We present a novel design paradigm where the burden of tuning the design for a specific hardware platform is shifted towards model dimensioning and without compromising on RD-efficiency. First, we design a framework for distilling a leaner student LIC model from a reference teacher: by tuning a single model hyperparameters, we can meet the constraints of different hardware platforms without a complex hardware design exploration. Second, we propose a hardware-friendly implementation of the Generalized Divisive Normalization - GDN activation that preserves RD efficiency even post parameter quantization. Third, we design a pipelined FPGA configuration which takes full advantage of available FPGA resources by leveraging parallel processing and optimizing resource allocation. Our experiments with a state of the art LIC model show that we outperform all existing FPGA implementations while performing very close to the original model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leonardo Berti, Flavio Giorgi, Gjergji Kasneci</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are leading a new technological revolution as one of the most promising research streams toward artificial general intelligence. The scaling of these models, accomplished by increasing the number of parameters and the magnitude of the training datasets, has been linked to various so-called emergent abilities that were previously unobserved. These emergent abilities, ranging from advanced reasoning and in-context learning to coding and problem-solving, have sparked an intense scientific debate: Are they truly emergent, or do they simply depend on external factors, such as training dynamics, the type of problems, or the chosen metric? What underlying mechanism causes them? Despite their transformative potential, emergent abilities remain poorly understood, leading to misconceptions about their definition, nature, predictability, and implications. In this work, we shed light on emergent abilities by conducting a comprehensive review of the phenomenon, addressing both its scientific underpinnings and real-world consequences. We first critically analyze existing definitions, exposing inconsistencies in conceptualizing emergent abilities. We then explore the conditions under which these abilities appear, evaluating the role of scaling laws, task complexity, pre-training loss, quantization, and prompting strategies. Our review extends beyond traditional LLMs and includes Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), which leverage reinforcement learning and inference-time search to amplify reasoning and self-reflection. However, emergence is not inherently positive. As AI systems gain autonomous reasoning capabilities, they also develop harmful behaviors, including deception, manipulation, and reward hacking. We highlight growing concerns about safety and governance, emphasizing the need for better evaluation frameworks and regulatory oversight.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dylan J. Foster, Zakaria Mhammedi, Dhruv Rohatgi</p>
<p>Abstract: Language model alignment (or, reinforcement learning) techniques that leverage active exploration -- deliberately encouraging the model to produce diverse, informative responses -- offer the promise of super-human capabilities. However, current understanding of algorithm design primitives for computationally efficient exploration with language models is limited. To better understand how to leverage access to powerful pre-trained generative models to improve the efficiency of exploration, we introduce a new computational framework for RL with language models, in which the learner interacts with the model through a sampling oracle. Focusing on the linear softmax model parameterization, we provide new results that reveal the computational-statistical tradeoffs of efficient exploration:
  1. Necessity of coverage: Coverage refers to the extent to which the pre-trained model covers near-optimal responses -- a form of hidden knowledge. We show that coverage, while not necessary for data efficiency, lower bounds the runtime of any algorithm in our framework.
  2. Inference-time exploration: We introduce a new algorithm, SpannerSampling, which obtains optimal data efficiency and is computationally efficient whenever the pre-trained model enjoys sufficient coverage, matching our lower bound. SpannerSampling leverages inference-time computation with the pre-trained model to reduce the effective search space for exploration.
  3. Insufficiency of training-time interventions: We contrast the result above by showing that training-time interventions that produce proper policies cannot achieve similar guarantees in polynomial time.
  4. Computational benefits of multi-turn exploration: Finally, we show that under additional representational assumptions, one can achieve improved runtime (replacing sequence-level coverage with token-level coverage) through multi-turn exploration.</p>

However, these models often struggle with basic image transformations. This paper investigates the image-level understanding of VLMs, specifically CLIP by OpenAI and SigLIP by Google. Our findings reveal that these models lack comprehension of multiple image-level augmentations. To facilitate this study, we created an augmented version of the Flickr8k dataset, pairing each image with a detailed description of the applied transformation. We further explore how this deficiency impacts downstream tasks, particularly in image editing, and evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art Image2Image models on simple transformations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicholas Roberts, Niladri Chatterji, Sharan Narang, Mike Lewis, Dieuwke Hupkes</p>
<p>Abstract: Scaling laws are a critical component of the LLM development pipeline, most famously as a way to forecast training decisions such as 'compute-optimally' trading-off parameter count and dataset size, alongside a more recent growing list of other crucial decisions. In this work, we ask whether compute-optimal scaling behaviour can be skill-dependent. In particular, we examine knowledge and reasoning-based skills such as knowledge-based QA and code generation, and we answer this question in the affirmative: scaling laws are skill-dependent. Next, to understand whether skill-dependent scaling is an artefact of the pretraining datamix, we conduct an extensive ablation of different datamixes and find that, also when correcting for datamix differences, knowledge and code exhibit fundamental differences in scaling behaviour. We conclude with an analysis of how our findings relate to standard compute-optimal scaling using a validation set, and find that a misspecified validation set can impact compute-optimal parameter count by nearly 50%, depending on its skill composition.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shunqi Mao, Chaoyi Zhang, Weidong Cai</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing vision-language models (VLMs) often suffer from visual hallucination, where the generated responses contain inaccuracies that are not grounded in the visual input. Efforts to address this issue without model finetuning primarily mitigate hallucination by reducing biases contrastively or amplifying the weights of visual embedding during decoding. However, these approaches improve visual perception at the cost of impairing the language reasoning capability. In this work, we propose the Perception Magnifier (PM), a novel visual decoding method that iteratively isolates relevant visual tokens based on attention and magnifies the corresponding regions, spurring the model to concentrate on fine-grained visual details during decoding. Specifically, by magnifying critical regions while preserving the structural and contextual information at each decoding step, PM allows the VLM to enhance its scrutiny of the visual input, hence producing more accurate and faithful responses. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that PM not only achieves superior hallucination mitigation but also enhances language generation while preserving strong reasoning capabilities.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luyuan Xie, Tianyu Luan, Wenyuan Cai, Guochen Yan, Zhaoyu Chen, Nan Xi, Yuejian Fang, Qingni Shen, Zhonghai Wu, Junsong Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning has wide applications in the medical field. It enables knowledge sharing among different healthcare institutes while protecting patients' privacy. However, existing federated learning systems are typically centralized, requiring clients to upload client-specific knowledge to a central server for aggregation. This centralized approach would integrate the knowledge from each client into a centralized server, and the knowledge would be already undermined during the centralized integration before it reaches back to each client. Besides, the centralized approach also creates a dependency on the central server, which may affect training stability if the server malfunctions or connections are unstable. To address these issues, we propose a decentralized federated learning framework named dFLMoE. In our framework, clients directly exchange lightweight head models with each other. After exchanging, each client treats both local and received head models as individual experts, and utilizes a client-specific Mixture of Experts (MoE) approach to make collective decisions. This design not only reduces the knowledge damage with client-specific aggregations but also removes the dependency on the central server to enhance the robustness of the framework. We validate our framework on multiple medical tasks, demonstrating that our method evidently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches under both model homogeneity and heterogeneity settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jun Yu, Lingsi Zhu, Yanjun Chi, Yunxiang Zhang, Yang Zheng, Yongqi Wang, Xilong Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Emotional Mimicry Intensity (EMI) estimation serves as a critical technology for understanding human social behavior and enhancing human-computer interaction experiences, where the core challenge lies in dynamic correlation modeling and robust fusion of multimodal temporal signals. To address the limitations of existing methods in insufficient exploitation of modal synergistic effects, noise sensitivity, and limited fine-grained alignment capabilities, this paper proposes a dual-stage cross-modal alignment framework. First, we construct vision-text and audio-text contrastive learning networks based on an improved CLIP architecture, achieving preliminary alignment in the feature space through modality-decoupled pre-training. Subsequently, we design a temporal-aware dynamic fusion module that combines Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN) and gated bidirectional LSTM to respectively capture the macro-evolution patterns of facial expressions and local dynamics of acoustic features. Innovatively, we introduce a quality-guided modality fusion strategy that enables modality compensation under occlusion and noisy scenarios through differentiable weight allocation. Experimental results on the Hume-Vidmimic2 dataset demonstrate that our method achieves an average Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.35 across six emotion dimensions, outperforming the best baseline by 40\%. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the dual-stage training strategy and dynamic fusion mechanism, providing a novel technical pathway for fine-grained emotion analysis in open environments.</p>
