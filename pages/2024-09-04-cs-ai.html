<p><b>Authors:</b> Sotaro Ishii, Tetsuro Tanaka</p>
<p>Abstract: To investigate the feasibility of solving Minishogi (Gogo Shogi) strongly, we need to know the number of its reachable positions from the initial position. However, there currently remains a significant gap between the lower and upper bounds of the value, since checking the legality of a Minishogi position is difficult. In this paper, we estimated the number of reachable positions by generating candidate positions using uniform random sampling and measuring the proportion of those reachable by a series of legal moves from the initial position. The experimental results revealed that the number of reachable Minishogi positions is approximately $2.38 \times 10^{18}$.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Melkamu Mersha, Khang Lam, Joseph Wood, Ali AlShami, Jugal Kalita</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence models encounter significant challenges due to their black-box nature, particularly in safety-critical domains such as healthcare, finance, and autonomous vehicles. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) addresses these challenges by providing explanations for how these models make decisions and predictions, ensuring transparency, accountability, and fairness. Existing studies have examined the fundamental concepts of XAI, its general principles, and the scope of XAI techniques. However, there remains a gap in the literature as there are no comprehensive reviews that delve into the detailed mathematical representations, design methodologies of XAI models, and other associated aspects. This paper provides a comprehensive literature review encompassing common terminologies and definitions, the need for XAI, beneficiaries of XAI, a taxonomy of XAI methods, and the application of XAI methods in different application areas. The survey is aimed at XAI researchers, XAI practitioners, AI model developers, and XAI beneficiaries who are interested in enhancing the trustworthiness, transparency, accountability, and fairness of their AI models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Carlos Medel-Ram\'irez, Hilario Medel-L\'opez</p>
<p>Abstract: The article focuses on the urgent issue of femicide in Veracruz, Mexico, and the development of the MFM_FEM_VER_CP_2024 model, a mathematical framework designed to predict femicide risk using fuzzy logic. This model addresses the complexity and uncertainty inherent in gender based violence by formalizing risk factors such as coercive control, dehumanization, and the cycle of violence. These factors are mathematically modeled through membership functions that assess the degree of risk associated with various conditions, including personal relationships and specific acts of violence. The study enhances the original model by incorporating new rules and refining existing membership functions, which significantly improve the model predictive accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> I. de Rodrigo, A. Sanchez-Cuadrado, J. Boal, A. J. Lopez-Lopez</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces the MERIT Dataset, a multimodal (text + image + layout) fully labeled dataset within the context of school reports. Comprising over 400 labels and 33k samples, the MERIT Dataset is a valuable resource for training models in demanding Visually-rich Document Understanding (VrDU) tasks. By its nature (student grade reports), the MERIT Dataset can potentially include biases in a controlled way, making it a valuable tool to benchmark biases induced in Language Models (LLMs). The paper outlines the dataset's generation pipeline and highlights its main features in the textual, visual, layout, and bias domains. To demonstrate the dataset's utility, we present a benchmark with token classification models, showing that the dataset poses a significant challenge even for SOTA models and that these would greatly benefit from including samples from the MERIT Dataset in their pretraining phase.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haowen Xu (Jeff), Jinghui Yuan (Jeff), Anye Zhou (Jeff), Guanhao Xu (Jeff), Wan Li (Jeff),  Xuegang (Jeff),  Ban, Xinyue Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Leveraging recent advances in generative AI, multi-agent systems are increasingly being developed to enhance the functionality and efficiency of smart city applications. This paper explores the transformative potential of large language models (LLMs) and emerging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technologies in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), paving the way for innovative solutions to address critical challenges in urban mobility. We begin by providing a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art in mobility data, ITS, and Connected Vehicles (CV) applications. Building on this review, we discuss the rationale behind RAG and examine the opportunities for integrating these Generative AI (GenAI) technologies into the smart mobility sector. We propose a conceptual framework aimed at developing multi-agent systems capable of intelligently and conversationally delivering smart mobility services to urban commuters, transportation operators, and decision-makers. Our approach seeks to foster an autonomous and intelligent approach that (a) promotes science-based advisory to reduce traffic congestion, accidents, and carbon emissions at multiple scales, (b) facilitates public education and engagement in participatory mobility management, and (c) automates specialized transportation management tasks and the development of critical ITS platforms, such as data analytics and interpretation, knowledge representation, and traffic simulations. By integrating LLM and RAG, our approach seeks to overcome the limitations of traditional rule-based multi-agent systems, which rely on fixed knowledge bases and limited reasoning capabilities. This integration paves the way for a more scalable, intuitive, and automated multi-agent paradigm, driving advancements in ITS and urban mobility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniela Schuster</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper establishes a connection between the fields of machine learning (ML) and philosophy concerning the phenomenon of behaving neutrally. It investigates a specific class of ML systems capable of delivering a neutral response to a given task, referred to as abstaining machine learning systems, that has not yet been studied from a philosophical perspective. The paper introduces and explains various abstaining machine learning systems, and categorizes them into distinct types. An examination is conducted on how abstention in the different machine learning system types aligns with the epistemological counterpart of suspended judgment, addressing both the nature of suspension and its normative profile. Additionally, a philosophical analysis is suggested on the autonomy and explainability of the abstaining response. It is argued, specifically, that one of the distinguished types of abstaining systems is preferable as it aligns more closely with our criteria for suspended judgment. Moreover, it is better equipped to autonomously generate abstaining outputs and offer explanations for abstaining outputs when compared to the other type.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxiang Wang, Xiao Yan, Shiyu Jin, Quanqing Xu, Chuanhui Yang, Yuanyuan Zhu, Chuang Hu, Bo Du, Jiawei Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-attributed graph (TAG) is an important type of graph structured data with text descriptions for each node. Few- and zero-shot node classification on TAGs have many applications in fields such as academia and social networks. However, the two tasks are challenging due to the lack of supervision signals, and existing methods only use the contrastive loss to align graph-based node embedding and language-based text embedding. In this paper, we propose Hound to improve accuracy by introducing more supervision signals, and the core idea is to go beyond the node-text pairs that come with data. Specifically, we design three augmentation techniques, i.e., node perturbation, text matching, and semantics negation to provide more reference nodes for each text and vice versa. Node perturbation adds/drops edges to produce diversified node embeddings that can be matched with a text. Text matching retrieves texts with similar embeddings to match with a node. Semantics negation uses a negative prompt to construct a negative text with the opposite semantics, which is contrasted with the original node and text. We evaluate Hound on 5 datasets and compare with 13 state-of-the-art baselines. The results show that Hound consistently outperforms all baselines, and its accuracy improvements over the best-performing baseline are usually over 5%.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00735">AgGym: An agricultural biotic stress simulation environment for ultra-precision management planning</a></h1>

<p>Abstract: Agricultural production requires careful management of inputs such as fungicides, insecticides, and herbicides to ensure a successful crop that is high-yielding, profitable, and of superior seed quality. Current state-of-the-art field crop management relies on coarse-scale crop management strategies, where entire fields are sprayed with pest and disease-controlling chemicals, leading to increased cost and sub-optimal soil and crop management. To overcome these challenges and optimize crop production, we utilize machine learning tools within a virtual field environment to generate localized management plans for farmers to manage biotic threats while maximizing profits. Specifically, we present AgGym, a modular, crop and stress agnostic simulation framework to model the spread of biotic stresses in a field and estimate yield losses with and without chemical treatments. Our validation with real data shows that AgGym can be customized with limited data to simulate yield outcomes under various biotic stress conditions. We further demonstrate that deep reinforcement learning (RL) policies can be trained using AgGym for designing ultra-precise biotic stress mitigation strategies with potential to increase yield recovery with less chemicals and lower cost. Our proposed framework enables personalized decision support that can transform biotic stress management from being schedule based and reactive to opportunistic and prescriptive. We also release the AgGym software implementation as a community resource and invite experts to contribute to this open-sourced publicly available modular environment framework.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00754">Cooperative Path Planning with Asynchronous Multiagent Reinforcement Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaming Yin, Weixiong Rao, Yu Xiao, Keshuang Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we study the shortest path problem (SPP) with multiple source-destination pairs (MSD), namely MSD-SPP, to minimize average travel time of all shortest paths. The inherent traffic capacity limits within a road network contributes to the competition among vehicles. Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) model cannot offer effective and efficient path planning cooperation due to the asynchronous decision making setting in MSD-SPP, where vehicles (a.k.a agents) cannot simultaneously complete routing actions in the previous time step. To tackle the efficiency issue, we propose to divide an entire road network into multiple sub-graphs and subsequently execute a two-stage process of inter-region and intra-region route planning. To address the asynchronous issue, in the proposed asyn-MARL framework, we first design a global state, which exploits a low-dimensional vector to implicitly represent the joint observations and actions of multi-agents. Then we develop a novel trajectory collection mechanism to decrease the redundancy in training trajectories. Additionally, we design a novel actor network to facilitate the cooperation among vehicles towards the same or close destinations and a reachability graph aimed at preventing infinite loops in routing paths. On both synthetic and real road networks, our evaluation result demonstrates that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art planning approaches.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00824">Accelerating Hybrid Agent-Based Models and Fuzzy Cognitive Maps: How to Combine Agents who Think Alike?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Philippe J. Giabbanelli, Jack T. Beerman</p>
<p>Abstract: While Agent-Based Models can create detailed artificial societies based on individual differences and local context, they can be computationally intensive. Modelers may offset these costs through a parsimonious use of the model, for example by using smaller population sizes (which limits analyses in sub-populations), running fewer what-if scenarios, or accepting more uncertainty by performing fewer simulations. Alternatively, researchers may accelerate simulations via hardware solutions (e.g., GPU parallelism) or approximation approaches that operate a tradeoff between accuracy and compute time. In this paper, we present an approximation that combines agents who `think alike', thus reducing the population size and the compute time. Our innovation relies on representing agent behaviors as networks of rules (Fuzzy Cognitive Maps) and empirically evaluating different measures of distance between these networks. Then, we form groups of think-alike agents via community detection and simplify them to a representative agent. Case studies show that our simplifications remain accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saransh Kumar Gupta, Lipika Dey, Partha Pratim Das, Ramesh Jain</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents an ontology design along with knowledge engineering, and multilingual semantic reasoning techniques to build an automated system for assimilating culinary information for Indian food in the form of a knowledge graph. The main focus is on designing intelligent methods to derive ontology designs and capture all-encompassing knowledge about food, recipes, ingredients, cooking characteristics, and most importantly, nutrition, at scale. We present our ongoing work in this workshop paper, describe in some detail the relevant challenges in curating knowledge of Indian food, and propose our high-level ontology design. We also present a novel workflow that uses AI, LLM, and language technology to curate information from recipe blog sites in the public domain to build knowledge graphs for Indian food. The methods for knowledge curation proposed in this paper are generic and can be replicated for any domain. The design is application-agnostic and can be used for AI-driven smart analysis, building recommendation systems for Personalized Digital Health, and complementing the knowledge graph for Indian food with contextual information such as user information, food biochemistry, geographic information, agricultural information, etc.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00837">You-Only-Randomize-Once: Shaping Statistical Properties in Constraint-based PCG</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jediah Katz, Bahar Bateni, Adam M. Smith</p>
<p>Abstract: In procedural content generation, modeling the generation task as a constraint satisfaction problem lets us define local and global constraints on the generated output. However, a generator's perceived quality often involves statistics rather than just hard constraints. For example, we may desire that generated outputs use design elements with a similar distribution to that of reference designs. However, such statistical properties cannot be expressed directly as a hard constraint on the generation of any one output. In contrast, methods which do not use a general-purpose constraint solver, such as Gumin's implementation of the WaveFunctionCollapse (WFC) algorithm, can control output statistics but have limited constraint propagation ability and cannot express non-local constraints. In this paper, we introduce You-Only-Randomize-Once (YORO) pre-rolling, a method for crafting a decision variable ordering for a constraint solver that encodes desired statistics in a constraint-based generator. Using a solver-based WFC as an example, we show that this technique effectively controls the statistics of tile-grid outputs generated by several off-the-shelf SAT solvers, while still enforcing global constraints on the outputs.1 Our approach is immediately applicable to WFC-like generation problems and it offers a conceptual starting point for controlling the design element statistics in other constraint-based generators.</p>

<p>Abstract: Human intelligence emerged through the process of natural selection and evolution on Earth. We investigate what it would take to re-create this process in silico. While past work has often focused on low-level processes (such as simulating physics or chemistry), we instead take a more targeted approach, aiming to evolve agents that can accumulate open-ended culture and technologies across generations. Towards this, we present JaxLife: an artificial life simulator in which embodied agents, parameterized by deep neural networks, must learn to survive in an expressive world containing programmable systems. First, we describe the environment and show that it can facilitate meaningful Turing-complete computation. We then analyze the evolved emergent agents' behavior, such as rudimentary communication protocols, agriculture, and tool use. Finally, we investigate how complexity scales with the amount of compute used. We believe JaxLife takes a step towards studying evolved behavior in more open-ended simulations.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Poppy Collis, Ryan Singh, Paul F Kinghorn, Christopher L Buckley</p>
<p>Abstract: An open problem in artificial intelligence is how systems can flexibly learn discrete abstractions that are useful for solving inherently continuous problems. Previous work in computational neuroscience has considered this functional integration of discrete and continuous variables during decision-making under the formalism of active inference (Parr, Friston & de Vries, 2017; Parr & Friston, 2018). However, their focus is on the expressive physical implementation of categorical decisions and the hierarchical mixed generative model is assumed to be known. As a consequence, it is unclear how this framework might be extended to learning. We therefore present a novel hierarchical hybrid active inference agent in which a high-level discrete active inference planner sits above a low-level continuous active inference controller. We make use of recent work in recurrent switching linear dynamical systems (rSLDS) which implement end-to-end learning of meaningful discrete representations via the piecewise linear decomposition of complex continuous dynamics (Linderman et al., 2016). The representations learned by the rSLDS inform the structure of the hybrid decision-making agent and allow us to (1) specify temporally-abstracted sub-goals in a method reminiscent of the options framework, (2) lift the exploration into discrete space allowing us to exploit information-theoretic exploration bonuses and (3) `cache' the approximate solutions to low-level problems in the discrete planner. We apply our model to the sparse Continuous Mountain Car task, demonstrating fast system identification via enhanced exploration and successful planning through the delineation of abstract sub-goals.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gemb Kaljavesi, Xiyan Su, Frank Diermeyer</p>
<p>Abstract: Online corner case detection is crucial for ensuring safety in autonomous driving vehicles. Current autonomous driving approaches can be categorized into modular approaches and end-to-end approaches. To leverage the advantages of both, we propose a method for online corner case detection that integrates an end-to-end approach into a modular system. The modular system takes over the primary driving task and the end-to-end network runs in parallel as a secondary one, the disagreement between the systems is then used for corner case detection. We implement this method on a real vehicle and evaluate it qualitatively. Our results demonstrate that end-to-end networks, known for their superior situational awareness, as secondary driving systems, can effectively contribute to corner case detection. These findings suggest that such an approach holds potential for enhancing the safety of autonomous vehicles.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> John Burden, Manuel Cebrian, Jose Hernandez-Orallo</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) present a dual-use dilemma: they enable beneficial applications while harboring potential for harm, particularly through conversational interactions. Despite various safeguards, advanced LLMs remain vulnerable. A watershed case was Kevin Roose's notable conversation with Bing, which elicited harmful outputs after extended interaction. This contrasts with simpler early jailbreaks that produced similar content more easily, raising the question: How much conversational effort is needed to elicit harmful information from LLMs? We propose two measures: Conversational Length (CL), which quantifies the conversation length used to obtain a specific response, and Conversational Complexity (CC), defined as the Kolmogorov complexity of the user's instruction sequence leading to the response. To address the incomputability of Kolmogorov complexity, we approximate CC using a reference LLM to estimate the compressibility of user instructions. Applying this approach to a large red-teaming dataset, we perform a quantitative analysis examining the statistical distribution of harmful and harmless conversational lengths and complexities. Our empirical findings suggest that this distributional analysis and the minimisation of CC serve as valuable tools for understanding AI safety, offering insights into the accessibility of harmful information. This work establishes a foundation for a new perspective on LLM safety, centered around the algorithmic complexity of pathways to harm.</p>

<p>Abstract: While LLMs in the RAG paradigm have shown remarkable performance on a variety of tasks, they still under-perform on unseen domains, especially on complex tasks like procedural question answering. In this work, we introduce a novel formalism and structure for manipulating text-based procedures. Based on this formalism, we further present a novel dataset called LCStep, scraped from the LangChain Python docs. Moreover, we extend the traditional RAG system to propose a novel system called analogy-augmented generation (AAG), that draws inspiration from human analogical reasoning and ability to assimilate past experiences to solve unseen problems. The proposed method uses a frozen language model with a custom procedure memory store to adapt to specialized knowledge. We demonstrate that AAG outperforms few-shot and RAG baselines on LCStep, RecipeNLG, and CHAMP datasets under a pairwise LLM-based evaluation, corroborated by human evaluation in the case of RecipeNLG.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Solim LeGris, Wai Keen Vong, Brenden M. Lake, Todd M. Gureckis</p>
<p>Abstract: The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) is a visual program synthesis benchmark designed to test challenging out-of-distribution generalization in humans and machines. Since 2019, limited progress has been observed on the challenge using existing artificial intelligence methods. Comparing human and machine performance is important for the validity of the benchmark. While previous work explored how well humans can solve tasks from the ARC benchmark, they either did so using only a subset of tasks from the original dataset, or from variants of ARC, and therefore only provided a tentative estimate of human performance. In this work, we obtain a more robust estimate of human performance by evaluating 1729 humans on the full set of 400 training and 400 evaluation tasks from the original ARC problem set. We estimate that average human performance lies between 73.3% and 77.2% correct with a reported empirical average of 76.2% on the training set, and between 55.9% and 68.9% correct with a reported empirical average of 64.2% on the public evaluation set. However, we also find that 790 out of the 800 tasks were solvable by at least one person in three attempts, suggesting that the vast majority of the publicly available ARC tasks are in principle solvable by typical crowd-workers recruited over the internet. Notably, while these numbers are slightly lower than earlier estimates, human performance still greatly exceeds current state-of-the-art approaches for solving ARC. To facilitate research on ARC, we publicly release our dataset, called H-ARC (human-ARC), which includes all of the submissions and action traces from human participants.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhen Zhang, Zhuolin Li, Wenyu Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Deriving a representative model using value function-based methods from the perspective of preference disaggregation has emerged as a prominent and growing topic in multi-criteria sorting (MCS) problems. A noteworthy observation is that many existing approaches to learning a representative model for MCS problems traditionally assume the monotonicity of criteria, which may not always align with the complexities found in real-world MCS scenarios. Consequently, this paper proposes some approaches to learning a representative model for MCS problems with non-monotonic criteria through the integration of the threshold-based value-driven sorting procedure. To do so, we first define some transformation functions to map the marginal values and category thresholds into a UTA-like functional space. Subsequently, we construct constraint sets to model non-monotonic criteria in MCS problems and develop optimization models to check and rectify the inconsistency of the decision maker's assignment example preference information. By simultaneously considering the complexity and discriminative power of the models, two distinct lexicographic optimization-based approaches are developed to derive a representative model for MCS problems with non-monotonic criteria. Eventually, we offer an illustrative example and conduct comprehensive simulation experiments to elaborate the feasibility and validity of the proposed approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoming Li, Zhaoliang Chen, Jonathan Zhang, Fei Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Effective planning is essential for the success of any task, from organizing a vacation to routing autonomous vehicles and developing corporate strategies. It involves setting goals, formulating plans, and allocating resources to achieve them. LLMs are particularly well-suited for automated planning due to their strong capabilities in commonsense reasoning. They can deduce a sequence of actions needed to achieve a goal from a given state and identify an effective course of action. However, it is frequently observed that plans generated through direct prompting often fail upon execution. Our survey aims to highlight the existing challenges in planning with language models, focusing on key areas such as embodied environments, optimal scheduling, competitive and cooperative games, task decomposition, reasoning, and planning. Through this study, we explore how LLMs transform AI planning and provide unique insights into the future of LM-assisted planning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonas Stein, Florentin D Hildebrandt, Barrett W Thomas, Marlin W Ulmer</p>
<p>Abstract: Home repair and installation services require technicians to visit customers and resolve tasks of different complexity. Technicians often have heterogeneous skills and working experiences. The geographical spread of customers makes achieving only perfect matches between technician skills and task requirements impractical. Additionally, technicians are regularly absent due to sickness. With non-perfect assignments regarding task requirement and technician skill, some tasks may remain unresolved and require a revisit and rework. Companies seek to minimize customer inconvenience due to delay. We model the problem as a sequential decision process where, over a number of service days, customers request service while heterogeneously skilled technicians are routed to serve customers in the system. Each day, our policy iteratively builds tours by adding "important" customers. The importance bases on analytical considerations and is measured by respecting routing efficiency, urgency of service, and risk of rework in an integrated fashion. We propose a state-dependent balance of these factors via reinforcement learning. A comprehensive study shows that taking a few non-perfect assignments can be quite beneficial for the overall service quality. We further demonstrate the value provided by a state-dependent parametrization.</p>

<p>Abstract: Background: Medication review is a structured interview of the patient, performed by the pharmacist and aimed at optimizing drug treatments. In practice, medication review is a long and cognitively-demanding task that requires specific knowledge. Clinical practice guidelines have been proposed, but their application is tedious. Methods: We designed ABiMed, a clinical decision support system for medication reviews, based on the implementation of the STOPP/START v2 guidelines and on the visual presentation of aggregated drug knowledge using tables, graphs and flower glyphs. We evaluated ABiMed with 39 community pharmacists during a randomized simulation trial, each pharmacist performing a medication review for two fictitious patients without ABiMed, and two others with ABiMed. We recorded the problems identified by the pharmacists, the interventions proposed, the response time, the perceived usability and the comments. Pharmacists' medication reviews were compared to an expert-designed gold standard. Results: With ABiMed, pharmacists found 1.6 times more relevant drug-related problems during the medication review (p=1.1e-12) and proposed better interventions (p=9.8e-9), without needing more time (p=0.56). The System Usability Scale score is 82.7, which is ranked "excellent". In their comments, pharmacists appreciated the visual aspect of ABiMed and its ability to compare the current treatment with the proposed one. A multifactor analysis showed no difference in the support offered by ABiMed according to the pharmacist's age or sex, in terms of percentage of problems identified or quality of the proposed interventions. Conclusions: The use of an intelligent and visual clinical decision support system can help pharmacists when they perform medication reviews. Our main perspective is the validation of the system in clinical conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Segev Shlomov, Ben wiesel, Aviad Sela, Ido Levy, Liane Galanti, Roy Abitbol</p>
<p>Abstract: General web-based agents are increasingly essential for interacting with complex web environments, yet their performance in real-world web applications remains poor, yielding extremely low accuracy even with state-of-the-art frontier models. We observe that these agents can be decomposed into two primary components: Planning and Grounding. Yet, most existing research treats these agents as black boxes, focusing on end-to-end evaluations which hinder meaningful improvements. We sharpen the distinction between the planning and grounding components and conduct a novel analysis by refining experiments on the Mind2Web dataset. Our work proposes a new benchmark for each of the components separately, identifying the bottlenecks and pain points that limit agent performance. Contrary to prevalent assumptions, our findings suggest that grounding is not a significant bottleneck and can be effectively addressed with current techniques. Instead, the primary challenge lies in the planning component, which is the main source of performance degradation. Through this analysis, we offer new insights and demonstrate practical suggestions for improving the capabilities of web agents, paving the way for more reliable agents.</p>

<p>Abstract: Dental disease is a prevalent chronic condition associated with substantial financial burden, personal suffering, and increased risk of systemic diseases. Despite widespread recommendations for twice-daily tooth brushing, adherence to recommended oral self-care behaviors remains sub-optimal due to factors such as forgetfulness and disengagement. To address this, we developed Oralytics, a mHealth intervention system designed to complement clinician-delivered preventative care for marginalized individuals at risk for dental disease. Oralytics incorporates an online reinforcement learning algorithm to determine optimal times to deliver intervention prompts that encourage oral self-care behaviors. We have deployed Oralytics in a registered clinical trial. The deployment required careful design to manage challenges specific to the clinical trials setting in the U.S. In this paper, we (1) highlight key design decisions of the RL algorithm that address these challenges and (2) conduct a re-sampling analysis to evaluate algorithm design decisions. A second phase (randomized control trial) of Oralytics is planned to start in spring 2025.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ralf Otte</p>
<p>Abstract: This article presents a heuristic view that shows that the inner states of consciousness experienced by every human being have a physical but imaginary hypercomplex basis. The hypercomplex description is necessary because certain processes of consciousness cannot be physically measured in principle, but nevertheless exist. Based on theoretical considerations, it could be possible - as a result of mathematical investigations into a so-called bicomplex algebra - to generate and use hypercomplex system states on machines in a targeted manner. The hypothesis of the existence of hypercomplex system states on machines is already supported by the surprising performance of highly complex AI systems. However, this has yet to be proven. In particular, there is a lack of experimental data that distinguishes such systems from other systems, which is why this question will be addressed in later articles. This paper describes the developed bicomplex algebra and possible applications of these findings to generate hypercomplex energy states on machines. In the literature, such system states are often referred to as machine consciousness. The article uses mathematical considerations to explain how artificial consciousness could be generated and what advantages this would have for such AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaogen Zhon, Yiyou Sun, Min Deng, Winnie Chiu Wing Chu, Qi Dou</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal learning leverages complementary information derived from different modalities, thereby enhancing performance in medical image segmentation. However, prevailing multimodal learning methods heavily rely on extensive well-annotated data from various modalities to achieve accurate segmentation performance. This dependence often poses a challenge in clinical settings due to limited availability of such data. Moreover, the inherent anatomical misalignment between different imaging modalities further complicates the endeavor to enhance segmentation performance. To address this problem, we propose a novel semi-supervised multimodal segmentation framework that is robust to scarce labeled data and misaligned modalities. Our framework employs a novel cross modality collaboration strategy to distill modality-independent knowledge, which is inherently associated with each modality, and integrates this information into a unified fusion layer for feature amalgamation. With a channel-wise semantic consistency loss, our framework ensures alignment of modality-independent information from a feature-wise perspective across modalities, thereby fortifying it against misalignments in multimodal scenarios. Furthermore, our framework effectively integrates contrastive consistent learning to regulate anatomical structures, facilitating anatomical-wise prediction alignment on unlabeled data in semi-supervised segmentation tasks. Our method achieves competitive performance compared to other multimodal methods across three tasks: cardiac, abdominal multi-organ, and thyroid-associated orbitopathy segmentations. It also demonstrates outstanding robustness in scenarios involving scarce labeled data and misaligned modalities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yueqi Xie, Tao Qi, Jingwei Yi, Ryan Whalen, Junming Huang, Qian Ding, Yu Xie, Xing Xie, Fangzhao Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: With the growing prevalence of generative artificial intelligence (AI), an increasing amount of content is no longer exclusively generated by humans but by generative AI models with human guidance. This shift presents notable challenges for the delineation of originality due to the varying degrees of human contribution in AI-assisted works. This study raises the research question of measuring human contribution in AI-assisted content generation and introduces a framework to address this question that is grounded in information theory. By calculating mutual information between human input and AI-assisted output relative to self-information of AI-assisted output, we quantify the proportional information contribution of humans in content generation. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed measure effectively discriminates between varying degrees of human contribution across multiple creative domains. We hope that this work lays a foundation for measuring human contributions in AI-assisted content generation in the era of generative AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kimji N. Pellano, Inga Str\"umke, Daniel Groos, Lars Adde, Espen Alexander F. Ihlen</p>
<p>Abstract: Early detection of Cerebral Palsy (CP) is crucial for effective intervention and monitoring. This paper tests the reliability and applicability of Explainable AI (XAI) methods using a deep learning method that predicts CP by analyzing skeletal data extracted from video recordings of infant movements. Specifically, we use XAI evaluation metrics -- namely faithfulness and stability -- to quantitatively assess the reliability of Class Activation Mapping (CAM) and Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) in this specific medical application. We utilize a unique dataset of infant movements and apply skeleton data perturbations without distorting the original dynamics of the infant movements. Our CP prediction model utilizes an ensemble approach, so we evaluate the XAI metrics performances for both the overall ensemble and the individual models. Our findings indicate that both XAI methods effectively identify key body points influencing CP predictions and that the explanations are robust against minor data perturbations. Grad-CAM significantly outperforms CAM in the RISv metric, which measures stability in terms of velocity. In contrast, CAM performs better in the RISb metric, which relates to bone stability, and the RRS metric, which assesses internal representation robustness. Individual models within the ensemble show varied results, and neither CAM nor Grad-CAM consistently outperform the other, with the ensemble approach providing a representation of outcomes from its constituent models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shilong Fan, Zhenyu Liu, Xinyu Gu, Haozhen Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Downlink channel temporal prediction is a critical technology in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. However, existing methods that rely on fixed-step historical sequences significantly limit the accuracy, practicality, and scalability of channel prediction. Recent advances have shown that large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong pattern recognition and reasoning abilities over complex sequences. The challenge lies in effectively aligning wireless communication data with the modalities used in natural language processing to fully harness these capabilities. In this work, we introduce Csi-LLM, a novel LLM-powered downlink channel prediction technique that models variable-step historical sequences. To ensure effective cross-modality application, we align the design and training of Csi-LLM with the processing of natural language tasks, leveraging the LLM's next-token generation capability for predicting the next step in channel state information (CSI). Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of this alignment strategy, with Csi-LLM consistently delivering stable performance improvements across various scenarios and showing significant potential in continuous multi-step prediction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangrui Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The importance of Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) has been increasingly recognized, given that NILM can enhance energy awareness and provide valuable insights for energy program design. Many existing NILM methods often rely on specialized devices to retrieve high-sampling complex signal data and focus on the high consumption appliances, hindering their applicability in real-world applications, especially when smart meters only provide low-resolution active power readings for households. In this paper, we propose a new approach using easily accessible weather data to achieve load disaggregation for a total of 12 appliances, encompassing both high and low consumption, in scenarios with very low sampling rates (hourly). Moreover, We develop a federated learning (FL) model that builds upon a sequence-to-sequence model to fulfil load disaggregation without data sharing. Our experiments demonstrate that the FL framework - L2GD can effectively handle statistical heterogeneity and avoid overfitting problems. By incorporating weather data, our approach significantly improves the performance of NILM.</p>

Our approach is robust across multiple models, outperforming alternatives and increasing the macro F1 of misinformation detection by as much as 20 percent compared to LLMs without search. We also conduct extensive analyses on the sources our system leverages and their biases, decisions in the construction of the system like the search tool and the knowledge base, the type of evidence needed and its impact on the results, and other parts of the overall process. By combining strong performance with in-depth understanding, we hope to provide building blocks for future search-enabled misinformation mitigation systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hua Yu, Yaqing Hou, Wenbin Pei, Qiang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diverse human motion prediction (HMP) aims to predict multiple plausible future motions given an observed human motion sequence. It is a challenging task due to the diversity of potential human motions while ensuring an accurate description of future human motions. Current solutions are either low-diversity or limited in expressiveness. Recent denoising diffusion models (DDPM) hold potential generative capabilities in generative tasks. However, introducing DDPM directly into diverse HMP incurs some issues. Although DDPM can increase the diversity of the potential patterns of human motions, the predicted human motions become implausible over time because of the significant noise disturbances in the forward process of DDPM. This phenomenon leads to the predicted human motions being hard to control, seriously impacting the quality of predicted motions and restricting their practical applicability in real-world scenarios. To alleviate this, we propose a novel conditional diffusion-based generative model, called DivDiff, to predict more diverse and realistic human motions. Specifically, the DivDiff employs DDPM as our backbone and incorporates Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and transformer mechanisms to encode the observed human motion sequence as a condition to instruct the reverse process of DDPM. More importantly, we design a diversified reinforcement sampling function (DRSF) to enforce human skeletal constraints on the predicted human motions. DRSF utilizes the acquired information from human skeletal as prior knowledge, thereby reducing significant disturbances introduced during the forward process. Extensive results received in the experiments on two widely-used datasets (Human3.6M and HumanEva-I) demonstrate that our model obtains competitive performance on both diversity and accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Sociotechnical requirements shape the governance of artificially intelligent (AI) systems. In an era where embodied AI technologies are rapidly reshaping various facets of contemporary society, their inherent dynamic adaptability presents a unique blend of opportunities and challenges. Traditional regulatory mechanisms, often designed for static -- or slower-paced -- technologies, find themselves at a crossroads when faced with the fluid and evolving nature of AI systems. Moreover, typical problems in AI, for example, the frequent opacity and unpredictability of the behaviour of the systems, add additional sociotechnical challenges.
  To address these interconnected issues, we introduce the concept of dynamic certification, an adaptive regulatory framework specifically crafted to keep pace with the continuous evolution of AI systems. The complexity of these challenges requires common progress in multiple domains: technical, socio-governmental, and regulatory. Our proposed transdisciplinary approach is designed to ensure the safe, ethical, and practical deployment of AI systems, aligning them bidirectionally with the real-world contexts in which they operate. By doing so, we aim to bridge the gap between rapid technological advancement and effective regulatory oversight, ensuring that AI systems not only achieve their intended goals but also adhere to ethical standards and societal values.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicholas Soures, Peter Helfer, Anurag Daram, Tej Pandit, Dhireesha Kudithipudi</p>
<p>Abstract: Catastrophic interference, the loss of previously learned information when learning new information, remains a major challenge in machine learning. Since living organisms do not seem to suffer from this problem, researchers have taken inspiration from biology to improve memory retention in artificial intelligence systems. However, previous attempts to use bio-inspired mechanisms have typically resulted in systems that rely on task boundary information during training and/or explicit task identification during inference, information that is not available in real-world scenarios. Here, we show that neuro-inspired mechanisms such as synaptic consolidation and metaplasticity can mitigate catastrophic interference in a spiking neural network, using only synapse-local information, with no need for task awareness, and with a fixed memory size that does not need to be increased when training on new tasks. Our model, TACOS, combines neuromodulation with complex synaptic dynamics to enable new learning while protecting previous information. We evaluate TACOS on sequential image recognition tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness in reducing catastrophic interference. Our results show that TACOS outperforms existing regularization techniques in domain-incremental learning scenarios. We also report the results of an ablation study to elucidate the contribution of each neuro-inspired mechanism separately.</p>

<p>Abstract: The landscape of social media content has evolved significantly, extending from text to multimodal formats. This evolution presents a significant challenge in combating misinformation. Previous research has primarily focused on single modalities or text-image combinations, leaving a gap in detecting multimodal misinformation. While the concept of entity consistency holds promise in detecting multimodal misinformation, simplifying the representation to a scalar value overlooks the inherent complexities of high-dimensional representations across different modalities. To address these limitations, we propose a Multimedia Misinformation Detection (MultiMD) framework for detecting misinformation from video content by leveraging cross-modal entity consistency. The proposed dual learning approach allows for not only enhancing misinformation detection performance but also improving representation learning of entity consistency across different modalities. Our results demonstrate that MultiMD outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models and underscore the importance of each modality in misinformation detection. Our research provides novel methodological and technical insights into multimodal misinformation detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohamed Mohsen, Hamada Rizk, Hirozumi Yamaguch, Moustafa Youssef</p>
<p>Abstract: Locating the persons moving through an environment without the necessity of them being equipped with special devices has become vital for many applications including security, IoT, healthcare, etc. Existing device-free indoor localization systems commonly rely on the utilization of Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and WiFi Channel State Information (CSI) techniques. However, the accuracy of RSSI is adversely affected by environmental factors like multi-path interference and fading. Additionally, the lack of standardization in CSI necessitates the use of specialized hardware and software. In this paper, we present TimeSense, a deep learning-based multi-person device-free indoor localization system that addresses these challenges. TimeSense leverages Time of Flight information acquired by the fine-time measurement protocol of IEEE 802.11-2016 standard. Specifically, the measured round trip time between the transmitter and receiver is influenced by the dynamic changes in the environment induced by human presence. TimeSense effectively detects this anomalous behavior using a stacked denoising auto-encoder model, thereby estimating the user's location. The system incorporates a probabilistic approach on top of the deep learning model to ensure seamless tracking of the users. The evaluation of TimeSene in two realistic environments demonstrates its efficacy, achieving a median localization accuracy of 1.57 and 2.65 meters. This surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art techniques by 49% and 103% in the two testbeds.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zicheng Zhang, Yingjie Zhou, Chunyi Li, Baixuan Zhao, Xiaohong Liu, Guangtao Zhai</p>
<p>Abstract: Quality assessment, which evaluates the visual quality level of multimedia experiences, has garnered significant attention from researchers and has evolved substantially through dedicated efforts. Before the advent of large models, quality assessment typically relied on small expert models tailored for specific tasks. While these smaller models are effective at handling their designated tasks and predicting quality levels, they often lack explainability and robustness. With the advancement of large models, which align more closely with human cognitive and perceptual processes, many researchers are now leveraging the prior knowledge embedded in these large models for quality assessment tasks. This emergence of quality assessment within the context of large models motivates us to provide a comprehensive review focusing on two key aspects: 1) the assessment of large models, and 2) the role of large models in assessment tasks. We begin by reflecting on the historical development of quality assessment. Subsequently, we move to detailed discussions of related works concerning quality assessment in the era of large models. Finally, we offer insights into the future progression and potential pathways for quality assessment in this new era. We hope this survey will enable a rapid understanding of the development of quality assessment in the era of large models and inspire further advancements in the field.</p>

<p>Abstract: Central Venous Lines (C-Lines) and Arterial Lines (A-Lines) are routinely used in the Critical Care Unit (CCU) for blood sampling, medication administration, and high-frequency blood pressure measurement. Judiciously accessing these lines is important, as over-utilization is associated with significant in-hospital morbidity and mortality. Documenting the frequency of line-access is an important step in reducing these adverse outcomes. Unfortunately, the current gold-standard for documentation is manual and subject to error, omission, and bias. The high-frequency blood pressure waveform data from sensors in these lines are often noisy and full of artifacts. Standard approaches in signal processing remove noise artifacts before meaningful analysis. However, from bedside observations, we characterized a distinct artifact that occurs during each instance of C-Line or A-Line use. These artifacts are buried amongst physiological waveform and extraneous noise. We focus on Machine Learning (ML) models that can detect these artifacts from waveform data in real-time - finding needles in needle stacks, in order to automate the documentation of line-access. We built and evaluated ML classifiers running in real-time at a major children's hospital to achieve this goal. We demonstrate the utility of these tools for reducing documentation burden, increasing available information for bedside clinicians, and informing unit-level initiatives to improve patient safety.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuting Hu, Dancheng Liu, Qingyun Wang, Charles Yu, Heng Ji, Jinjun Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: To address the challenge of automating knowledge discovery from a vast volume of literature, in this paper, we introduce a novel framework based on large language models (LLMs) that combines a progressive ontology prompting (POP) algorithm with a dual-agent system, named LLM-Duo, designed to enhance the automation of knowledge extraction from scientific articles. The POP algorithm utilizes a prioritized breadth-first search (BFS) across a predefined ontology to generate structured prompt templates and action orders, thereby guiding LLMs to discover knowledge in an automatic manner. Additionally, our LLM-Duo employs two specialized LLM agents: an explorer and an evaluator. These two agents work collaboratively and adversarially to enhance the reliability of the discovery and annotation processes. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms advanced baselines, enabling more accurate and complete annotations. To validate the effectiveness of our method in real-world scenarios, we employ our method in a case study of speech-language intervention discovery. Our method identifies 2,421 interventions from 64,177 research articles in the speech-language therapy domain. We curate these findings into a publicly accessible intervention knowledge base that holds significant potential to benefit the speech-language therapy community.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arief Purnama Muharram, Ayu Purwarianti</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated fact-checking is a key strategy to overcome the spread of COVID-19 misinformation on the internet. These systems typically leverage deep learning approaches through Natural Language Inference (NLI) to verify the truthfulness of information based on supporting evidence. However, one challenge that arises in deep learning is performance stagnation due to a lack of knowledge during training. This study proposes using a Knowledge Graph (KG) as external knowledge to enhance NLI performance for automated COVID-19 fact-checking in the Indonesian language. The proposed model architecture comprises three modules: a fact module, an NLI module, and a classifier module. The fact module processes information from the KG, while the NLI module handles semantic relationships between the given premise and hypothesis. The representation vectors from both modules are concatenated and fed into the classifier module to produce the final result. The model was trained using the generated Indonesian COVID-19 fact-checking dataset and the COVID-19 KG Bahasa Indonesia. Our study demonstrates that incorporating KGs can significantly improve NLI performance in fact-checking, achieving the best accuracy of 0,8616. This suggests that KGs are a valuable component for enhancing NLI performance in automated fact-checking.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nimrod Dvir</p>
<p>Abstract: This study explores the relationship between textual features and Information Engagement (IE) on digital platforms. It highlights the impact of computational linguistics and analytics on user interaction. The READ model is introduced to quantify key predictors like representativeness, ease of use, affect, and distribution, which forecast engagement levels. The model's effectiveness is validated through AB testing and randomized trials, showing strong predictive performance in participation (accuracy: 0.94), perception (accuracy: 0.85), perseverance (accuracy: 0.81), and overall IE (accuracy: 0.97).
  While participation metrics are strong, perception and perseverance show slightly lower recall and F1-scores, indicating some challenges. The study demonstrates that modifying text based on the READ model's insights leads to significant improvements. For example, increasing representativeness and positive affect boosts selection rates by 11 percent, raises evaluation averages from 3.98 to 4.46, and improves retention rates by 11 percent. These findings highlight the importance of linguistic factors in IE, providing a framework for enhancing digital text engagement. The research offers practical strategies applicable to fields like education, health, and media.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sujay Koujalgi, Andrew Anderson, Iyadunni Adenuga, Shikha Soneji, Rupika Dikkala, Teresita Guzman Nader, Leo Soccio, Sourav Panda, Rupak Kumar Das, Margaret Burnett, Jonathan Dodge</p>
<p>Abstract: Assessing an AI system's behavior-particularly in Explainable AI Systems-is sometimes done empirically, by measuring people's abilities to predict the agent's next move-but how to perform such measurements? In empirical studies with humans, an obvious approach is to frame the task as binary (i.e., prediction is either right or wrong), but this does not scale. As output spaces increase, so do floor effects, because the ratio of right answers to wrong answers quickly becomes very small. The crux of the problem is that the binary framing is failing to capture the nuances of the different degrees of "wrongness." To address this, we begin by proposing three mathematical bases upon which to measure "partial wrongness." We then uses these bases to perform two analyses on sequential decision-making domains: the first is an in-lab study with 86 participants on a size-36 action space; the second is a re-analysis of a prior study on a size-4 action space. Other researchers adopting our operationalization of the prediction task and analysis methodology will improve the rigor of user studies conducted with that task, which is particularly important when the domain features a large output space.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Florian Mai, Nathan Cornille, Marie-Francine Moens</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern language models predict the next token in the sequence by considering the past text through a powerful function such as attention. However, language models have no explicit mechanism that allows them to spend computation time for planning long-distance future text, leading to a suboptimal token prediction. In this paper, we propose a planner that predicts a latent plan for many sentences into the future. By sampling multiple plans at once, we condition the language model on an accurate approximation of the distribution of text continuations, which leads to better next token prediction accuracy. In effect, this allows trading computation time for prediction accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sagar Srinivas Sakhinana, Geethan Sannidhi, Venkataramana Runkana</p>
<p>Abstract: In the chemical and process industries, Process Flow Diagrams (PFDs) and Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs) are critical for design, construction, and maintenance. Recent advancements in Generative AI, such as Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) like GPT4 (Omni), have shown promise in understanding and interpreting process diagrams for Visual Question Answering (VQA). However, proprietary models pose data privacy risks, and their computational complexity prevents knowledge editing for domain-specific customization on consumer hardware. To overcome these challenges, we propose a secure, on-premises enterprise solution using a hierarchical, multi-agent Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework for open-domain question answering (ODQA) tasks, offering enhanced data privacy, explainability, and cost-effectiveness. Our novel multi-agent framework employs introspective and specialized sub-agents using open-source, small-scale multimodal models with the ReAct (Reason+Act) prompting technique for PFD and P&ID analysis, integrating multiple information sources to provide accurate and contextually relevant answers. Our approach, supported by iterative self-correction, aims to deliver superior performance in ODQA tasks. We conducted rigorous experimental studies, and the empirical results validated the proposed approach effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sizhen Bian, Pixi Kang, Julian Moosmann, Mengxi Liu, Pietro Bonazzi, Roman Rosipal, Michele Magno</p>
<p>Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) have garnered significant interest across various domains, including rehabilitation and robotics. Despite advancements in neural network-based EEG decoding, maintaining performance across diverse user populations remains challenging due to feature distribution drift. This paper presents an effective approach to address this challenge by implementing a lightweight and efficient on-device learning engine for wearable motor imagery recognition. The proposed approach, applied to the well-established EEGNet architecture, enables real-time and accurate adaptation to EEG signals from unregistered users. Leveraging the newly released low-power parallel RISC-V-based processor, GAP9 from Greeenwaves, and the Physionet EEG Motor Imagery dataset, we demonstrate a remarkable accuracy gain of up to 7.31\% with respect to the baseline with a memory footprint of 15.6 KByte. Furthermore, by optimizing the input stream, we achieve enhanced real-time performance without compromising inference accuracy. Our tailored approach exhibits inference time of 14.9 ms and 0.76 mJ per single inference and 20 us and 0.83 uJ per single update during online training. These findings highlight the feasibility of our method for edge EEG devices as well as other battery-powered wearable AI systems suffering from subject-dependant feature distribution drift.</p>

<p>Abstract: Background and Aims: This study evaluates the medical reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs) in gastroenterology.
  Methods: We used 300 gastroenterology board exam-style multiple-choice questions, 138 of which contain images to systematically assess the impact of model configurations and parameters and prompt engineering strategies utilizing GPT-3.5. Next, we assessed the performance of proprietary and open-source LLMs (versions), including GPT (3.5, 4, 4{\deg}, 4omini), Claude (3, 3.5), Gemini (1.0), Mistral, Llama (2, 3, 3.1), Mixtral, and Phi (3), across different interfaces (web and API), computing environments (cloud and local), and model precisions (with and without quantization). Finally, we assessed accuracy using a semiautomated pipeline.
  Results: Among the proprietary models, GPT-4o (73.7%) and Claude3.5-Sonnet (74.0%) achieved the highest accuracy, whereas Llama3-70b (54.7%) and Mixtral8x7b (54.3%) were the most accurate open-source models. Among the quantized open-source models, the 6-bit quantized Phi3-14b (48.7%) performed best. The scores of the quantized models were comparable to those of the full-precision models Llama2--7b, Llama2--13b, and Gemma2--9b. Notably, VLM performance on image-containing questions did not improve when the images were provided and worsened when LLM-generated captions were provided. In contrast, a 10% increase in accuracy was observed when images were accompanied by one-sentence human-crafted image descriptions.
  Conclusion: In conclusion, while LLMs exhibit robust zero-shot performance in medical reasoning, the integration of visual data remains a challenge for VLMs. Effective deployment involves carefully determining optimal model configurations, encouraging users to consider either the high performance of proprietary models or the flexible adaptability of open-source models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nguyen Quang Hieu, Dinh Thai Hoang, Diep N. Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: The ability to estimate 3D movements of users over edge computing-enabled networks, such as 5G/6G networks, is a key enabler for the new era of extended reality (XR) and Metaverse applications. Recent advancements in deep learning have shown advantages over optimization techniques for estimating 3D human poses given spare measurements from sensor signals, i.e., inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors attached to the XR devices. However, the existing works lack applicability to wireless systems, where transmitting the IMU signals over noisy wireless networks poses significant challenges. Furthermore, the potential redundancy of the IMU signals has not been considered, resulting in highly redundant transmissions. In this work, we propose a novel approach for redundancy removal and lightweight transmission of IMU signals over noisy wireless environments. Our approach utilizes a random Gaussian matrix to transform the original signal into a lower-dimensional space. By leveraging the compressive sensing theory, we have proved that the designed Gaussian matrix can project the signal into a lower-dimensional space and preserve the Set-Restricted Eigenvalue condition, subject to a power transmission constraint. Furthermore, we develop a deep generative model at the receiver to recover the original IMU signals from noisy compressed data, thus enabling the creation of 3D human body movements at the receiver for XR and Metaverse applications. Simulation results on a real-world IMU dataset show that our framework can achieve highly accurate 3D human poses of the user using only $82\%$ of the measurements from the original signals. This is comparable to an optimization-based approach, i.e., Lasso, but is an order of magnitude faster.</p>

By analyzing their inheritance and relevance, this review can provide research with ideas for applying traditional digital watermarking techniques to LLM watermarking, to promote the cross-integration and innovation of watermarking technology. In addition, this review examines the pros and cons of LLM watermarking. Considering the current multimodal development trend of LLMs, it provides a detailed analysis of emerging multimodal LLM watermarking, such as visual and audio data, to offer more reference ideas for relevant research.

<p>Abstract: This paper examines the application of ChatGPT, a large language model (LLM), for question-and-answer (Q&A) tasks in the highly specialized field of nuclear data. The primary focus is on evaluating ChatGPT's performance on a curated test dataset, comparing the outcomes of a standalone LLM with those generated through a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach. LLMs, despite their recent advancements, are prone to generating incorrect or 'hallucinated' information, which is a significant limitation in applications requiring high accuracy and reliability. This study explores the potential of utilizing RAG in LLMs, a method that integrates external knowledge bases and sophisticated retrieval techniques to enhance the accuracy and relevance of generated outputs. In this context, the paper evaluates ChatGPT's ability to answer domain-specific questions, employing two methodologies: A) direct response from the LLM, and B) response from the LLM within a RAG framework. The effectiveness of these methods is assessed through a dual mechanism of human and LLM evaluation, scoring the responses for correctness and other metrics. The findings underscore the improvement in performance when incorporating a RAG pipeline in an LLM, particularly in generating more accurate and contextually appropriate responses for nuclear domain-specific queries. Additionally, the paper highlights alternative approaches to further refine and improve the quality of answers in such specialized domains.</p>

<p>Abstract: As humanity stands on the brink of a new era of technological innovation, the ability to rapidly transform creative ideas into protected intellectual property (IP) is more crucial than ever. However, the conventional processes for patent drafting are fraught with challenges, demanding a nuanced understanding of advanced field knowledge and technical concepts. Existing large language models (LLMs), while powerful, often fall short in this IP creation domain due to their lack of specialized knowledge and context-awareness necessary for generating technically accurate patent documents. To bridge this critical gap, we propose a groundbreaking framework for Knowledge Fine-Tuning (KFT) of LLMs, designed to endow AI with the ability to autonomously mine, understand, and apply domain-specific knowledge. Our model, PatentGPT leverages a unique combination of knowledge graph-based pre-training, domain-specific supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Through extensive evaluation, PatentGPT has demonstrated outstanding performance, scoring up to approximately 400% higher in patent related benchmark tests compared to state-of-the-art models. By KFT method the model's capability to not only assist but also augment human creativity and innovation, our approach sets a new standard for AI-driven intellectual property generation, paving the way for more efficient and effective invention processes.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper explores the application of the Condorcet Jury theorem to the domain of sentiment analysis, specifically examining the performance of various large language models (LLMs) compared to simpler natural language processing (NLP) models. The theorem posits that a majority vote classifier should enhance predictive accuracy, provided that individual classifiers' decisions are independent. Our empirical study tests this theoretical framework by implementing a majority vote mechanism across different models, including advanced LLMs such as ChatGPT 4. Contrary to expectations, the results reveal only marginal improvements in performance when incorporating larger models, suggesting a lack of independence among them. This finding aligns with the hypothesis that despite their complexity, LLMs do not significantly outperform simpler models in reasoning tasks within sentiment analysis, showing the practical limits of model independence in the context of advanced NLP tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juncheng Xie, Shensian Syu, Hung-yi Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Instruction fine-tuning is crucial for today's large language models (LLMs) to learn to follow instructions and align with human preferences. Conventionally, supervised data, including the instruction and the correct response, is required for instruction fine-tuning. To obtain such data, some researchers prompted well-trained models like GPT-4 to generate instructions and correct responses. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that uses the first half of a random text from OpenWebText as the instruction and GPT-3.5-turbo or GPT-4-turbo to complete the text as the response. Despite the data being "non-instructional", we found that pre-trained LLMs fine-tuned on this data can gain instruction-following capabilities. This observation is verified by fine-tuning several well-known pre-trained LLMs (e.g., LLaMA-2-7B, LLaMA-3-8B, LLaMA-3-70B, Mistral-7B-v0.1). The "non-instructional data" also improved some models that underwent supervised fine-tuning and human preference alignment. Our LLaMA-3-70B-Instruct fine-tuned through "non-instructional data" is comparable with LLaMA-3.1-70B-Instruct on the Arena Hard leaderboard. We analyzed the "non-instructional data" and ensured it is devoid of content related to instruction fine-tuning. Our findings will inspire further investigation into how to develop instruction-following capabilities without explicit instruction-related data.</p>

How can suitable LLM techniques and evaluation methods be selected for clinical decision-making? To answer these questions, we performed a comprehensive analysis of LLM-based methods for disease diagnosis. This scoping review examined the types of diseases, associated organ systems, relevant clinical data, LLM techniques, and evaluation methods reported in existing studies. Furthermore, we offered guidelines for data preprocessing and the selection of appropriate LLM techniques and evaluation strategies for diagnostic tasks. We also assessed the limitations of current research and delineated the challenges and future directions in this research field. In summary, our review outlined a blueprint for LLM-based disease diagnosis, helping to streamline and guide future research endeavors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenyu Wang, Shuyu Kong, Li Wan, Biqiao Zhang, Yiteng Huang, Mumin Jin, Ming Sun, Xin Lei, Zhaojun Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing keyword spotting (KWS) systems primarily rely on predefined keyword phrases. However, the ability to recognize customized keywords is crucial for tailoring interactions with intelligent devices. In this paper, we present a novel Query-by-Example (QbyE) KWS system that employs spectral-temporal graph attentive pooling and multi-task learning. This framework aims to effectively learn speaker-invariant and linguistic-informative embeddings for QbyE KWS tasks. Within this framework, we investigate three distinct network architectures for encoder modeling: LiCoNet, Conformer and ECAPA_TDNN. The experimental results on a substantial internal dataset of $629$ speakers have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed QbyE framework in maximizing the potential of simpler models such as LiCoNet. Particularly, LiCoNet, which is 13x more efficient, achieves comparable performance to the computationally intensive Conformer model (1.98% vs. 1.63\% FRR at 0.3 FAs/Hr).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaobo Cui, Junyou Li, Luca Mouchel, Yiyang Feng, Boi Faltings</p>
<p>Abstract: To address this gap, our study introduces the concept of causal epistemic consistency, which focuses on the self-consistency of Large Language Models (LLMs) in differentiating intermediates with nuanced differences in causal reasoning. We propose a suite of novel metrics -- intensity ranking concordance, cross-group position agreement, and intra-group clustering -- to evaluate LLMs on this front. Through extensive empirical studies on 21 high-profile LLMs, including GPT-4, Claude3, and LLaMA3-70B, we have favoring evidence that current models struggle to maintain epistemic consistency in identifying the polarity and intensity of intermediates in causal reasoning. Additionally, we explore the potential of using internal token probabilities as an auxiliary tool to maintain causal epistemic consistency. In summary, our study bridges a critical gap in AI research by investigating the self-consistency over fine-grained intermediates involved in causal reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Nadeem, Shahab Saquib Sohail, Erik Cambria, Bj\"orn W. Schuller, Amir Hussain</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundational Large Language Models (LLMs) have changed the way we perceive technology. They have been shown to excel in tasks ranging from poem writing and coding to essay generation and puzzle solving. With the incorporation of image generation capability, they have become more comprehensive and versatile AI tools. At the same time, researchers are striving to identify the limitations of these tools to improve them further. Currently identified flaws include hallucination, biases, and bypassing restricted commands to generate harmful content. In the present work, we have identified a fundamental limitation related to the image generation ability of LLMs, and termed it The NO Syndrome. This negation blindness refers to LLMs inability to correctly comprehend NO related natural language prompts to generate the desired images. Interestingly, all tested LLMs including GPT-4, Gemini, and Copilot were found to be suffering from this syndrome. To demonstrate the generalization of this limitation, we carried out simulation experiments and conducted entropy-based and benchmark statistical analysis tests on various LLMs in multiple languages, including English, Hindi, and French. We conclude that the NO syndrome is a significant flaw in current LLMs that needs to be addressed. A related finding of this study showed a consistent discrepancy between image and textual responses as a result of this NO syndrome. We posit that the introduction of a negation context-aware reinforcement learning based feedback loop between the LLMs textual response and generated image could help ensure the generated text is based on both the LLMs correct contextual understanding of the negation query and the generated visual output.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aishik Nagar, Shantanu Jaiswal, Cheston Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown impressive zero- and few-shot performance on real-world visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks, alluding to their capabilities as visual reasoning engines. However, the benchmarks being used conflate "pure" visual reasoning with world knowledge, and also have questions that involve a limited number of reasoning steps. Thus, it remains unclear whether a VLM's apparent visual reasoning performance is due to its world knowledge, or due to actual visual reasoning capabilities.
  To clarify this ambiguity, we systematically benchmark and dissect the zero-shot visual reasoning capabilities of VLMs through synthetic datasets that require minimal world knowledge, and allow for analysis over a broad range of reasoning steps. We focus on two novel aspects of zero-shot visual reasoning: i) evaluating the impact of conveying scene information as either visual embeddings or purely textual scene descriptions to the underlying large language model (LLM) of the VLM, and ii) comparing the effectiveness of chain-of-thought prompting to standard prompting for zero-shot visual reasoning.
  We find that the underlying LLMs, when provided textual scene descriptions, consistently perform better compared to being provided visual embeddings. In particular, 18% higher accuracy is achieved on the PTR dataset. We also find that CoT prompting performs marginally better than standard prompting only for the comparatively large GPT-3.5-Turbo (175B) model, and does worse for smaller-scale models. This suggests the emergence of CoT abilities for visual reasoning in LLMs at larger scales even when world knowledge is limited. Overall, we find limitations in the abilities of VLMs and LLMs for more complex visual reasoning, and highlight the important role that LLMs can play in visual reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jun He, Andrew L. Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) into wholesale energy markets can greatly enhance grid flexibility, improve market efficiency, and contribute to a more sustainable energy future. As DERs -- such as solar PV panels and energy storage -- proliferate, effective mechanisms are needed to ensure that small prosumers can participate meaningfully in these markets. We study a wholesale market model featuring multiple DER aggregators, each controlling a portfolio of DER resources and bidding into the market on behalf of the DER asset owners. The key of our approach lies in recognizing the repeated nature of market interactions the ability of participants to learn and adapt over time. Specifically, Aggregators repeatedly interact with each other and with other suppliers in the wholesale market, collectively shaping wholesale electricity prices (aka the locational marginal prices (LMPs)). We model this multi-agent interaction using a mean-field game (MFG), which uses market information -- reflecting the average behavior of market participants -- to enable each aggregator to predict long-term LMP trends and make informed decisions. For each aggregator, because they control the DERs within their portfolio under certain contract structures, we employ a mean-field control (MFC) approach (as opposed to a MFG) to learn an optimal policy that maximizes the total rewards of the DERs under their management. We also propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based method to help each agent learn optimal strategies within the MFG framework, enhancing their ability to adapt to market conditions and uncertainties. Numerical simulations show that LMPs quickly reach a steady state in the hybrid mean-field approach. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that the combination of energy storage and mean-field learning significantly reduces price volatility compared to scenarios without storage.</p>

<p>Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) are being quickly adapted to many domains, including healthcare, their strengths and pitfalls remain under-explored. In our study, we examine the effects of prompt engineering to guide Large Language Models (LLMs) in delivering parts of a Problem-Solving Therapy (PST) session via text, particularly during the symptom identification and assessment phase for personalized goal setting. We present evaluation results of the models' performances by automatic metrics and experienced medical professionals. We demonstrate that the models' capability to deliver protocolized therapy can be improved with the proper use of prompt engineering methods, albeit with limitations. To our knowledge, this study is among the first to assess the effects of various prompting techniques in enhancing a generalist model's ability to deliver psychotherapy, focusing on overall quality, consistency, and empathy. Exploring LLMs' potential in delivering psychotherapy holds promise with the current shortage of mental health professionals amid significant needs, enhancing the potential utility of AI-based and AI-enhanced care services.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper examines the zero-shot ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to detect multiple-choice questions with no correct answer, a crucial aspect of educational assessment quality. We explore this ability not only as a measure of subject matter knowledge but also as an indicator of critical thinking within LLMs. Our experiments, utilizing a range of LLMs on diverse questions, highlight the significant performance gap between questions with a single correct answer and those without. Llama-3.1-405B stands out by successfully identifying the lack of a valid answer in many instances. These findings suggest that LLMs should prioritize critical thinking over blind instruction following and caution against their use in educational settings where questions with incorrect answers might lead to inaccurate evaluations. This research sets a benchmark for assessing critical thinking in LLMs and emphasizes the need for ongoing model alignment to ensure genuine user comprehension and assistance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeheng Wang, Timothy van der Laan, Muhammad Usman</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid growth of Internet of Things (IoT) devices necessitates efficient data compression techniques to handle the vast amounts of data generated by these devices. In this context, chemiresistive sensor arrays (CSAs), a simple-to-fabricate but crucial component in IoT systems, generate large volumes of data due to their simultaneous multi-sensor operations. Classical principal component analysis (cPCA) methods, a common solution to the data compression challenge, face limitations in preserving critical information during dimensionality reduction. In this study, we present quantum principal component analysis (qPCA) as a superior alternative to enhance information retention. Our findings demonstrate that qPCA outperforms cPCA in various back-end machine-learning modeling tasks, particularly in low-dimensional scenarios when limited Quantum bits (qubits) can be accessed. These results underscore the potential of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers, despite current qubit limitations, to revolutionize data processing in real-world IoT applications, particularly in enhancing the efficiency and reliability of CSA data compression and readout.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Baohao Liao, Christof Monz</p>
<p>Abstract: Parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) methods effectively adapt large language models (LLMs) to diverse downstream tasks, reducing storage and GPU memory demands. Despite these advantages, several applications pose new challenges to PEFT beyond mere parameter efficiency. One notable challenge involves the efficient deployment of LLMs equipped with multiple task- or user-specific adapters, particularly when different adapters are needed for distinct requests within the same batch. Another challenge is the interpretability of LLMs, which is crucial for understanding how LLMs function. Previous studies introduced various approaches to address different challenges. In this paper, we introduce a novel method, RoAd, which employs a straightforward 2D rotation to adapt LLMs and addresses all the above challenges: (1) RoAd is remarkably parameter-efficient, delivering optimal performance on GLUE, eight commonsense reasoning tasks and four arithmetic reasoning tasks with $<0.1\%$ trainable parameters; (2) RoAd facilitates the efficient serving of requests requiring different adapters within a batch, with an overhead comparable to element-wise multiplication instead of batch matrix multiplication; (3) RoAd enhances LLM's interpretability through integration within a framework of distributed interchange intervention, demonstrated via composition experiments.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper examines the Code-Switching (CS) phenomenon where two languages intertwine within a single utterance. There exists a noticeable need for research on the CS between English and Korean. We highlight that the current Equivalence Constraint (EC) theory for CS in other languages may only partially capture English-Korean CS complexities due to the intrinsic grammatical differences between the languages. We introduce a novel Koglish dataset tailored for English-Korean CS scenarios to mitigate such challenges. First, we constructed the Koglish-GLUE dataset to demonstrate the importance and need for CS datasets in various tasks. We found the differential outcomes of various foundation multilingual language models when trained on a monolingual versus a CS dataset. Motivated by this, we hypothesized that SimCSE, which has shown strengths in monolingual sentence embedding, would have limitations in CS scenarios. We construct a novel Koglish-NLI (Natural Language Inference) dataset using a CS augmentation-based approach to verify this. From this CS-augmented dataset Koglish-NLI, we propose a unified contrastive learning and augmentation method for code-switched embeddings, ConCSE, highlighting the semantics of CS sentences. Experimental results validate the proposed ConCSE with an average performance enhancement of 1.77\% on the Koglish-STS(Semantic Textual Similarity) tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinzhao Zhou, Yiqun Duan, Fred Chang, Thomas Do, Yu-Kai Wang, Chin-Teng Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: The remarkable success of large language models (LLMs) across various multi-modality applications is well established. However, integrating large language models with humans, or brain dynamics, remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we introduce BELT-2, a pioneering multi-task model designed to enhance both encoding and decoding performance from EEG signals. To bolster the quality of the EEG encoder, BELT-2 is the first work to innovatively 1) adopt byte-pair encoding (BPE)-level EEG-language alignment and 2) integrate multi-task training and decoding in the EEG domain. Inspired by the idea of \textbf{\textit{Bridging the Brain with GPT}}, we further connect the multi-task EEG encoder with LLMs by utilizing prefix-tuning on intermediary output from the EEG encoder. These innovative efforts make BELT-2 a pioneering breakthrough, making it the first work in the field capable of decoding coherent and readable sentences from non-invasive brain signals. Our experiments highlight significant advancements over prior techniques in both quantitative and qualitative measures, achieving a decoding performance with a BLEU-1 score of 52.2\% on the ZuCo dataset. Furthermore, BELT-2 shows a remarkable improvement ranging from 31\% to 162\% on other translation benchmarks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daoze Zhang, Zhizhang Yuan, Junru Chen, Kerui Chen, Yang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Physiological signals serve as indispensable clues for understanding various physiological states of human bodies. Most existing works have focused on a single type of physiological signals for a range of application scenarios. However, as the body is a holistic biological system, the inherent interconnection among various physiological data should not be neglected. In particular, given the brain's role as the control center for vital activities, electroencephalogram (EEG) exhibits significant correlations with other physiological signals. Therefore, the correlation between EEG and other physiological signals holds potential to improve performance in various scenarios. Nevertheless, achieving this goal is still constrained by several challenges: the scarcity of simultaneously collected physiological data, the differences in correlations between various signals, and the correlation differences between various tasks. To address these issues, we propose a unified physiological signal alignment framework, Brant-X, to model the correlation between EEG and other signals. Our approach (1) employs the EEG foundation model to data-efficiently transfer the rich knowledge in EEG to other physiological signals, and (2) introduces the two-level alignment to fully align the semantics of EEG and other signals from different semantic scales. In the experiments, Brant-X achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with task-agnostic and task-specific baselines on various downstream tasks in diverse scenarios, including sleep stage classification, emotion recognition, freezing of gaits detection, and eye movement communication. Moreover, the analysis on the arrhythmia detection task and the visualization in case study further illustrate the effectiveness of Brant-X in the knowledge transfer from EEG to other physiological signals.

<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have made significant strides in tackling challenging tasks in wireless systems, especially when an accurate wireless model is not available. However, when available data is limited, traditional DNNs often yield subpar results due to underfitting. At the same time, large language models (LLMs) exemplified by GPT-3, have remarkably showcased their capabilities across a broad range of natural language processing tasks. But whether and how LLMs can benefit challenging non-language tasks in wireless systems is unexplored. In this work, we propose to leverage the in-context learning ability (a.k.a. prompting) of LLMs to solve wireless tasks in the low data regime without any training or fine-tuning, unlike DNNs which require training. We further demonstrate that the performance of LLMs varies significantly when employed with different prompt templates. To solve this issue, we employ the latest LLM calibration methods. Our results reveal that using LLMs via ICL methods generally outperforms traditional DNNs on the symbol demodulation task and yields highly confident predictions when coupled with calibration techniques.</p>

In this paper, we propose a hybrid framework that integrates data-driven spatial dependency feature extraction with rule-assisted spatial dependency function mapping to augment domain knowledge. We demonstrate the superior performance of our framework in two comparative application scenarios, highlighting its ability to capture more localized spatial features in the reconstructed distribution fields. Furthermore, we underscore its potential to enhance nonlinear estimation capabilities through the application of transformed fuzzy rules and to quantify the inherent uncertainties associated with the observation data sets. Our framework introduces an innovative approach to spatial information estimation by synergistically combining observational data with rule-assisted domain knowledge.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate modeling and prediction of complex physical systems often rely on data assimilation techniques to correct errors inherent in model simulations. Traditional methods like the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) and its variants as well as the recently developed Ensemble Score Filters (EnSF) face significant challenges when dealing with high-dimensional and nonlinear Bayesian filtering problems with sparse observations, which are ubiquitous in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a novel data assimilation method, Latent-EnSF, which leverages EnSF with efficient and consistent latent representations of the full states and sparse observations to address the joint challenges of high dimensionlity in states and high sparsity in observations for nonlinear Bayesian filtering. We introduce a coupled Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with two encoders to encode the full states and sparse observations in a consistent way guaranteed by a latent distribution matching and regularization as well as a consistent state reconstruction. With comparison to several methods, we demonstrate the higher accuracy, faster convergence, and higher efficiency of Latent-EnSF for two challenging applications with complex models in shallow water wave propagation and medium-range weather forecasting, for highly sparse observations in both space and time.</p>

<p>Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly being integrated into scientific research, particularly in the social sciences, where understanding human behavior is critical. Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have shown promise in replicating human-like responses in various psychological experiments. However, the extent to which LLMs can effectively replace human subjects across diverse experimental contexts remains unclear. Here, we conduct a large-scale study replicating 154 psychological experiments from top social science journals with 618 main effects and 138 interaction effects using GPT-4 as a simulated participant. We find that GPT-4 successfully replicates 76.0 percent of main effects and 47.0 percent of interaction effects observed in the original studies, closely mirroring human responses in both direction and significance. However, only 19.44 percent of GPT-4's replicated confidence intervals contain the original effect sizes, with the majority of replicated effect sizes exceeding the 95 percent confidence interval of the original studies. Additionally, there is a 71.6 percent rate of unexpected significant results where the original studies reported null findings, suggesting potential overestimation or false positives. Our results demonstrate the potential of LLMs as powerful tools in psychological research but also emphasize the need for caution in interpreting AI-driven findings. While LLMs can complement human studies, they cannot yet fully replace the nuanced insights provided by human subjects.</p>

<p>Abstract: While deep learning models have been extensively utilized in motor imagery based EEG signal recognition, they often operate as black boxes. Motivated by neurological findings indicating that the mental imagery of left or right-hand movement induces event-related desynchronization (ERD) in the contralateral sensorimotor area of the brain, we propose a Mirror Contrastive Loss based Sliding Window Transformer (MCL-SWT) to enhance subject-independent motor imagery-based EEG signal recognition. Specifically, our proposed mirror contrastive loss enhances sensitivity to the spatial location of ERD by contrasting the original EEG signals with their mirror counterparts-mirror EEG signals generated by interchanging the channels of the left and right hemispheres of the EEG signals. Moreover, we introduce a temporal sliding window transformer that computes self-attention scores from high temporal resolution features, thereby improving model performance with manageable computational complexity. We evaluate the performance of MCL-SWT on subject-independent motor imagery EEG signal recognition tasks, and our experimental results demonstrate that MCL-SWT achieved accuracies of 66.48% and 75.62%, surpassing the state-of-the-art (SOTA) model by 2.82% and 2.17%, respectively. Furthermore, ablation experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed mirror contrastive loss. A code demo of MCL-SWT is available at https://github.com/roniusLuo/MCL_SWT.</p>

By employing carefully crafted positive and negative example prompts, we guide the model towards adopting sound reasoning logic.

Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves a 15.8% improvement over the Chain of Thought approach on the SVAMP dataset and a 21.5 % improvement on the GSM8K dataset. Further application of this method to a large-scale model with 175 billion parameters yields performance comparable to the best results on both aforementioned datasets. Finally, we conduct an analysis of errors during the reasoning process, providing valuable insights and directions for future research on reasoning tasks using large language models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) offer unprecedented natural language understanding and generation capabilities. However, existing surveys on LLMs in biomedicine often focus on specific applications or model architectures, lacking a comprehensive analysis that integrates the latest advancements across various biomedical domains. This review, based on an analysis of 484 publications sourced from databases including PubMed, Web of Science, and arXiv, provides an in-depth examination of the current landscape, applications, challenges, and prospects of LLMs in biomedicine, distinguishing itself by focusing on the practical implications of these models in real-world biomedical contexts. Firstly, we explore the capabilities of LLMs in zero-shot learning across a broad spectrum of biomedical tasks, including diagnostic assistance, drug discovery, and personalized medicine, among others, with insights drawn from 137 key studies. Then, we discuss adaptation strategies of LLMs, including fine-tuning methods for both uni-modal and multi-modal LLMs to enhance their performance in specialized biomedical contexts where zero-shot fails to achieve, such as medical question answering and efficient processing of biomedical literature. Finally, we discuss the challenges that LLMs face in the biomedicine domain including data privacy concerns, limited model interpretability, issues with dataset quality, and ethics due to the sensitive nature of biomedical data, the need for highly reliable model outputs, and the ethical implications of deploying AI in healthcare. To address these challenges, we also identify future research directions of LLM in biomedicine including federated learning methods to preserve data privacy and integrating explainable AI methodologies to enhance the transparency of LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anton Andreychuk, Konstantin Yakovlev, Aleksandr Panov, Alexey Skrynnik</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) is a challenging computational problem that typically requires to find collision-free paths for multiple agents in a shared environment. Solving MAPF optimally is NP-hard, yet efficient solutions are critical for numerous applications, including automated warehouses and transportation systems. Recently, learning-based approaches to MAPF have gained attention, particularly those leveraging deep reinforcement learning. Following current trends in machine learning, we have created a foundation model for the MAPF problems called MAPF-GPT. Using imitation learning, we have trained a policy on a set of pre-collected sub-optimal expert trajectories that can generate actions in conditions of partial observability without additional heuristics, reward functions, or communication with other agents. The resulting MAPF-GPT model demonstrates zero-shot learning abilities when solving the MAPF problem instances that were not present in the training dataset. We show that MAPF-GPT notably outperforms the current best-performing learnable-MAPF solvers on a diverse range of problem instances and is efficient in terms of computation (in the inference mode).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huan Zhang, Yu Song, Ziyu Hou, Santiago Miret, Bang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The emergence of specialized large language models (LLMs) has shown promise in addressing complex tasks for materials science. Many LLMs, however, often struggle with distinct complexities of material science tasks, such as materials science computational tasks, and often rely heavily on outdated implicit knowledge, leading to inaccuracies and hallucinations. To address these challenges, we introduce HoneyComb, the first LLM-based agent system specifically designed for materials science. HoneyComb leverages a novel, high-quality materials science knowledge base (MatSciKB) and a sophisticated tool hub (ToolHub) to enhance its reasoning and computational capabilities tailored to materials science. MatSciKB is a curated, structured knowledge collection based on reliable literature, while ToolHub employs an Inductive Tool Construction method to generate, decompose, and refine API tools for materials science. Additionally, HoneyComb leverages a retriever module that adaptively selects the appropriate knowledge source or tools for specific tasks, thereby ensuring accuracy and relevance. Our results demonstrate that HoneyComb significantly outperforms baseline models across various tasks in materials science, effectively bridging the gap between current LLM capabilities and the specialized needs of this domain. Furthermore, our adaptable framework can be easily extended to other scientific domains, highlighting its potential for broad applicability in advancing scientific research and applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are improving at an exceptional rate. However, these models are still susceptible to jailbreak attacks, which are becoming increasingly dangerous as models become increasingly powerful. In this work, we introduce a dataset of jailbreaks where each example can be input in both a single or a multi-turn format. We show that while equivalent in content, they are not equivalent in jailbreak success: defending against one structure does not guarantee defense against the other. Similarly, LLM-based filter guardrails also perform differently depending on not just the input content but the input structure. Thus, vulnerabilities of frontier models should be studied in both single and multi-turn settings; this dataset provides a tool to do so.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yijia Shao, Tianshi Li, Weiyan Shi, Yanchen Liu, Diyi Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: As language models (LMs) are widely utilized in personalized communication scenarios (e.g., sending emails, writing social media posts) and endowed with a certain level of agency, ensuring they act in accordance with the contextual privacy norms becomes increasingly critical. However, quantifying the privacy norm awareness of LMs and the emerging privacy risk in LM-mediated communication is challenging due to (1) the contextual and long-tailed nature of privacy-sensitive cases, and (2) the lack of evaluation approaches that capture realistic application scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose PrivacyLens, a novel framework designed to extend privacy-sensitive seeds into expressive vignettes and further into agent trajectories, enabling multi-level evaluation of privacy leakage in LM agents' actions. We instantiate PrivacyLens with a collection of privacy norms grounded in privacy literature and crowdsourced seeds. Using this dataset, we reveal a discrepancy between LM performance in answering probing questions and their actual behavior when executing user instructions in an agent setup. State-of-the-art LMs, like GPT-4 and Llama-3-70B, leak sensitive information in 25.68% and 38.69% of cases, even when prompted with privacy-enhancing instructions. We also demonstrate the dynamic nature of PrivacyLens by extending each seed into multiple trajectories to red-team LM privacy leakage risk.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gerardo Altamirano-G\'omez, Carlos Gershenson</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, several models using Quaternion-Valued Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs) for different problems have been proposed. Although the definition of the quaternion convolution layer is the same, there are different adaptations of other atomic components to the quaternion domain, e.g., pooling layers, activation functions, fully connected layers, etc. However, the effect of selecting a specific type of these components and the way in which their interactions affect the performance of the model still unclear. Understanding the impact of these choices on model performance is vital for effectively utilizing QCNNs. This paper presents a statistical analysis carried out on experimental data to compare the performance of existing components for the image classification problem. In addition, we introduce a novel Fully Quaternion ReLU activation function, which exploits the unique properties of quaternion algebra to improve model performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal sentiment recognition aims to learn representations from different modalities to identify human emotions. However, previous works does not suppresses the frame-level redundancy inherent in continuous time series, resulting in incomplete modality representations with noise. To address this issue, we propose the Temporal-invariant learning, which minimizes the distributional differences between time steps to effectively capture smoother time series patterns, thereby enhancing the quality of the representations and robustness of the model. To fully exploit the rich semantic information in textual knowledge, we propose a Text-Driven Fusion Module (TDFM). To guide cross-modal interactions, TDFM evaluates the correlations between different modality through modality-invariant representations. Furthermore, we introduce a modality discriminator to disentangle modality-invariant and modality-specific subspaces. Experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuai Peng, Di Fu, Liangcai Gao, Xiuqin Zhong, Hongguang Fu, Zhi Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has spurred extensive research into their domain-specific capabilities, particularly mathematical reasoning. However, most open-source LLMs focus solely on mathematical reasoning, neglecting the integration with visual injection, despite the fact that many mathematical tasks rely on visual inputs such as geometric diagrams, charts, and function plots. To fill this gap, we introduce \textbf{MultiMath-7B}, a multimodal large language model that bridges the gap between math and vision. \textbf{MultiMath-7B} is trained through a four-stage process, focusing on vision-language alignment, visual and math instruction-tuning, and process-supervised reinforcement learning. We also construct a novel, diverse and comprehensive multimodal mathematical dataset, \textbf{MultiMath-300K}, which spans K-12 levels with image captions and step-wise solutions. MultiMath-7B achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among open-source models on existing multimodal mathematical benchmarks and also excels on text-only mathematical benchmarks.

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00149">From Semantics to Hierarchy: A Hybrid Euclidean-Tangent-Hyperbolic Space Model for Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Siling Feng, Zhisheng Qi, Cong Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Temporal knowledge graph (TKG) reasoning predicts future events based on historical data, but it's challenging due to the complex semantic and hierarchical information involved. Existing Euclidean models excel at capturing semantics but struggle with hierarchy. Conversely, hyperbolic models manage hierarchical features well but fail to represent complex semantics due to limitations in shallow models' parameters and the absence of proper normalization in deep models relying on the L2 norm. Current solutions, as curvature transformations, are insufficient to address these issues. In this work, a novel hybrid geometric space approach that leverages the strengths of both Euclidean and hyperbolic models is proposed. Our approach transitions from single-space to multi-space parameter modeling, effectively capturing both semantic and hierarchical information. Initially, complex semantics are captured through a fact co-occurrence and autoregressive method with normalizations in Euclidean space. The embeddings are then transformed into Tangent space using a scaling mechanism, preserving semantic information while relearning hierarchical structures through a query-candidate separated modeling approach, which are subsequently transformed into Hyperbolic space. Finally, a hybrid inductive bias for hierarchical and semantic learning is achieved by combining hyperbolic and Euclidean scoring functions through a learnable query-specific mixing coefficient, utilizing embeddings from hyperbolic and Euclidean spaces. Experimental results on four TKG benchmarks demonstrate that our method reduces error relatively by up to 15.0% in mean reciprocal rank on YAGO compared to previous single-space models. Additionally, enriched visualization analysis validates the effectiveness of our approach, showing adaptive capabilities for datasets with varying levels of semantic and hierarchical complexity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Grigor Kirakosyan, Davit Karamyan</p>
<p>Abstract: Speech applications dealing with conversations require not only recognizing the spoken words but also determining who spoke when. The task of assigning words to speakers is typically addressed by merging the outputs of two separate systems, namely, an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system and a speaker diarization (SD) system. In practical settings, speaker diarization systems can experience significant degradation in performance due to a variety of factors, including uniform segmentation with a high temporal resolution, inaccurate word timestamps, incorrect clustering and estimation of speaker numbers, as well as background noise.
  Therefore, it is important to automatically detect errors and make corrections if possible. We used a second-pass speaker tagging correction system based on a non-autoregressive language model to correct mistakes in words placed at the borders of sentences spoken by different speakers. We first show that the employed error correction approach leads to reductions in word diarization error rate (WDER) on two datasets: TAL and test set of Fisher. Additionally, we evaluated our system in the Post-ASR Speaker Tagging Correction challenge and observed significant improvements in cpWER compared to baseline methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a lifelong condition that significantly influencing an individual's communication abilities and their social interactions. Early diagnosis and intervention are critical due to the profound impact of ASD's characteristic behaviors on foundational developmental stages. However, limitations of standardized diagnostic tools necessitate the development of objective and precise diagnostic methodologies. This paper proposes an end-to-end framework for automatically predicting the social communication severity of children with ASD from raw speech data. This framework incorporates an automatic speech recognition model, fine-tuned with speech data from children with ASD, followed by the application of fine-tuned pre-trained language models to generate a final prediction score. Achieving a Pearson Correlation Coefficient of 0.6566 with human-rated scores, the proposed method showcases its potential as an accessible and objective tool for the assessment of ASD.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Erwan Le Merrer, Gilles Tredan</p>
<p>Abstract: It is known that LLMs do hallucinate, that is, they return incorrect information as facts. In this paper, we introduce the possibility to study these hallucinations under a structured form: graphs. Hallucinations in this context are incorrect outputs when prompted for well known graphs from the literature (e.g. Karate club, Les Mis\'erables, graph atlas). These hallucinated graphs have the advantage of being much richer than the factual accuracy -- or not -- of a fact; this paper thus argues that such rich hallucinations can be used to characterize the outputs of LLMs. Our first contribution observes the diversity of topological hallucinations from major modern LLMs. Our second contribution is the proposal of a metric for the amplitude of such hallucinations: the Graph Atlas Distance, that is the average graph edit distance from several graphs in the graph atlas set. We compare this metric to the Hallucination Leaderboard, a hallucination rank that leverages 10,000 times more prompts to obtain its ranking.</p>

<p>Abstract: Complex mechanic systems simulation is important in many real-world applications. The de-facto numeric solver using Finite Element Method (FEM) suffers from computationally intensive overhead. Though with many progress on the reduction of computational time and acceptable accuracy, the recent CNN or GNN-based simulation models still struggle to effectively represent complex mechanic simulation caused by the long-range spatial dependency of distance mesh nodes and independently learning local and global representation. In this paper, we propose a novel two-level mesh graph network. The key of the network is to interweave the developed Graph Block and Attention Block to better learn mechanic interactions even for long-rang spatial dependency. Evaluation on three synthetic and one real datasets demonstrates the superiority of our work. For example, on the Beam dataset, our work leads to 54.3\% lower prediction errors and 9.87\% fewer learnable network parameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiayi Zhou, Jiaming Ji, Juntao Dai, Yaodong Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Aligning the behavior of Large language models (LLMs) with human intentions and values remains a critical challenge. Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) aligns LLMs by training a reward model (RM) on human preferences and fine-tuning the LLMs to maximize RM feedback. Despite its effectiveness and popularity, RLHF is prone to biased local optimization. It means RM fails to provide feedback that accurately aligns with human preference, causing LLMs to explore unexpected generalizations, and failing to achieve alignment objectives. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel \textit{sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) reward modeling} method. Its key insight is that learning from language feedback rather than scalar feedback improves RLHF without additional annotations. We replaced the reward modeling target from binary maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) with sequence MLE. This method enables richer and fine-grained language feedback without additional annotations, models, or training stages. Our experiments demonstrated its effectiveness, specifically, reducing the refusal-to-response paradigm in single-turn safety dialogues and the long-response bias in text summarization tasks. We provide further analysis that seq2seq RM improves RLHF performance across 2B and 7B LLMs on 3 NLP tasks, achieving an average win rate of 76.9\%. We further show that seq2seq RM can still improve the performance of RLHF under out-of-distribution prompts.</p>

<p>Abstract: Esophageal cancer is a major cause of cancer-related mortality internationally, with high recurrence rates and poor survival even among patients treated with curative-intent surgery. Investigating relevant prognostic factors and predicting prognosis can enhance post-operative clinical decision-making and potentially improve patients' outcomes. In this work, we assessed prognostic factor identification and discriminative performances of three models for Disease-Free Survival (DFS) and Overall Survival (OS) using a large multicenter international dataset from ENSURE study. We first employed Cox Proportional Hazards (CoxPH) model to assess the impact of each feature on outcomes. Subsequently, we utilised CoxPH and two deep neural network (DNN)-based models, DeepSurv and DeepHit, to predict DFS and OS. The significant prognostic factors identified by our models were consistent with clinical literature, with post-operative pathologic features showing higher significance than clinical stage features. DeepSurv and DeepHit demonstrated comparable discriminative accuracy to CoxPH, with DeepSurv slightly outperforming in both DFS and OS prediction tasks, achieving C-index of 0.735 and 0.74, respectively. While these results suggested the potential of DNNs as prognostic tools for improving predictive accuracy and providing personalised guidance with respect to risk stratification, CoxPH still remains an adequately good prediction model, with the data used in this study.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents a generative adversarial network (GAN) based approach for radar image enhancement. Although radar sensors remain robust for operations under adverse weather conditions, their application in autonomous vehicles (AVs) is commonly limited by the low-resolution data they produce. The primary goal of this study is to enhance the radar images to better depict the details and features of the environment, thereby facilitating more accurate object identification in AVs. The proposed method utilizes high-resolution, two-dimensional (2D) projected light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds as ground truth images and low-resolution radar images as inputs to train the GAN. The ground truth images were obtained through two main steps. First, a LiDAR point cloud map was generated by accumulating raw LiDAR scans. Then, a customized LiDAR point cloud cropping and projection method was employed to obtain 2D projected LiDAR point clouds. The inference process of the proposed method relies solely on radar images to generate an enhanced version of them. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through both qualitative and quantitative results. These results show that the proposed method can generate enhanced images with clearer object representation compared to the input radar images, even under adverse weather conditions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have gained attention for their ability to represent complex distributions and incorporate uncertainty, making them ideal for robust predictions in the presence of noisy or incomplete data. In this study, we develop and enhance score-based diffusion models in field reconstruction tasks, where the goal is to estimate complete spatial fields from partial observations. We introduce a condition encoding approach to construct a tractable mapping mapping between observed and unobserved regions using a learnable integration of sparse observations and interpolated fields as an inductive bias. With refined sensing representations and an unraveled temporal dimension, our method can handle arbitrary moving sensors and effectively reconstruct fields. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive benchmark of our approach against a deterministic interpolation-based method across various static and time-dependent PDEs. Our study attempts to addresses the gap in strong baselines for evaluating performance across varying sampling hyperparameters, noise levels, and conditioning methods. Our results show that diffusion models with cross-attention and the proposed conditional encoding generally outperform other methods under noisy conditions, although the deterministic method excels with noiseless data. Additionally, both the diffusion models and the deterministic method surpass the numerical approach in accuracy and computational cost for the steady problem. We also demonstrate the ability of the model to capture possible reconstructions and improve the accuracy of fused results in covariance-based correction tasks using ensemble sampling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sibo Cheng, Hector Chassagnon, Matthew Kasoar, Yike Guo, Rossella Arcucci</p>
<p>Abstract: Global wildfire models play a crucial role in anticipating and responding to changing wildfire regimes. JULES-INFERNO is a global vegetation and fire model simulating wildfire emissions and area burnt on a global scale. However, because of the high data dimensionality and system complexity, JULES-INFERNO's computational costs make it challenging to apply to fire risk forecasting with unseen initial conditions. Typically, running JULES-INFERNO for 30 years of prediction will take several hours on High Performance Computing (HPC) clusters. To tackle this bottleneck, two data-driven models are built in this work based on Deep Learning techniques to surrogate the JULES-INFERNO model and speed up global wildfire forecasting. More precisely, these machine learning models take global temperature, vegetation density, soil moisture and previous forecasts as inputs to predict the subsequent global area burnt on an iterative basis. Average Error per Pixel (AEP) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) are used as metrics to evaluate the performance of the proposed surrogate models. A fine tuning strategy is also proposed in this work to improve the algorithm performance for unseen scenarios. Numerical results show a strong performance of the proposed models, in terms of both computational efficiency (less than 20 seconds for 30 years of prediction on a laptop CPU) and prediction accuracy (with AEP under 0.3\% and SSIM over 98\% compared to the outputs of JULES-INFERNO).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuangquan Feng, Virginia R. de Sa</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatic facial action unit (AU) recognition is used widely in facial expression analysis. Most existing AU recognition systems aim for cross-participant non-calibrated generalization (NCG) to unseen faces without further calibration. However, due to the diversity of facial attributes across different identities, accurately inferring AU activation from single images of an unseen face is sometimes infeasible, even for human experts -- it is crucial to first understand how the face appears in its neutral expression, or significant bias may be incurred. Therefore, we propose to perform one-frame calibration (OFC) in AU recognition: for each face, a single image of its neutral expression is used as the reference image for calibration. With this strategy, we develop a Calibrating Siamese Network (CSN) for AU recognition and demonstrate its remarkable effectiveness with a simple iResNet-50 (IR50) backbone. On the DISFA, DISFA+, and UNBC-McMaster datasets, we show that our OFC CSN-IR50 model (a) substantially improves the performance of IR50 by mitigating facial attribute biases (including biases due to wrinkles, eyebrow positions, facial hair, etc.), (b) substantially outperforms the naive OFC method of baseline subtraction as well as (c) a fine-tuned version of this naive OFC method, and (d) also outperforms state-of-the-art NCG models for both AU intensity estimation and AU detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Srija Mukhopadhyay, Abhishek Rajgaria, Prerana Khatiwada, Vivek Gupta, Dan Roth</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at tasks requiring joint understanding of visual and linguistic information. A particularly promising yet under-explored application for these models lies in answering questions based on various kinds of maps. This study investigates the efficacy of VLMs in answering questions based on choropleth maps, which are widely used for data analysis and representation. To facilitate and encourage research in this area, we introduce a novel map-based question-answering benchmark, consisting of maps from three geographical regions (United States, India, China), each containing 1000 questions. Our benchmark incorporates 43 diverse question templates, requiring nuanced understanding of relative spatial relationships, intricate map features, and complex reasoning. It also includes maps with discrete and continuous values, encompassing variations in color-mapping, category ordering, and stylistic patterns, enabling comprehensive analysis. We evaluate the performance of multiple VLMs on this benchmark, highlighting gaps in their abilities and providing insights for improving such models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nuno Sousa e Silva</p>
<p>Abstract: This article provides a critical overview of the recently approved Artificial Intelligence Act. It starts by presenting the main structure, objectives, and approach of Regulation (EU) 2024/1689. A definition of key concepts follows, and then the material and territorial scope, as well as the timing of application, are analyzed. Although the Regulation does not explicitly set out principles, the main ideas of fairness, accountability, transparency, and equity in AI underly a set of rules of the regulation. This is discussed before looking at the ill-defined set of forbidden AI practices (manipulation and e exploitation of vulnerabilities, social scoring, biometric identification and classification, and predictive policing). It is highlighted that those rules deal with behaviors rather than AI systems. The qualification and regulation of high-risk AI systems are tackled, alongside the obligation of transparency for certain systems, the regulation of general-purpose models, and the rules on certification, supervision, and sanctions. The text concludes that even if the overall framework can be deemed adequate and balanced, the approach is so complex that it risks defeating its own purpose of promoting responsible innovation within the European Union and beyond its borders.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohamad Rida Rammal, Ruida Zhou, Suhas Diggavi</p>
<p>Abstract: Data valuation seeks to answer the important question, "How much is this data worth?" Existing data valuation methods have largely focused on discriminative models, primarily examining data value through the lens of its utility in training. However, with the push for ever-larger language models, relying on valuation methods that require training becomes increasingly expensive and dependent on specific techniques. We propose an alternative perspective on the data value problem for language models, centering around the plausibility of the data. We posit that data holds lesser value if it can be plausibly generated by the model itself. Starting from some intuitive criteria that align with our notions of valuable data, we develop a novel value function that is computationally tractable and derived from first principles with provable properties. We conduct a theoretical analysis of our value function and evaluate it across multiple scenarios and datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper explores the potential of a small, domain-specific language model trained exclusively on sports-related data. We investigate whether extensive training data with specially designed small model structures can overcome model size constraints. The study introduces the OnlySports collection, comprising OnlySportsLM, OnlySports Dataset, and OnlySports Benchmark. Our approach involves: 1) creating a massive 600 billion tokens OnlySports Dataset from FineWeb, 2) optimizing the RWKV architecture for sports-related tasks, resulting in a 196M parameters model with 20-layer, 640-dimension structure, 3) training the OnlySportsLM on part of OnlySports Dataset, and 4) testing the resultant model on OnlySports Benchmark. OnlySportsLM achieves a 37.62%/34.08% accuracy improvement over previous 135M/360M state-of-the-art models and matches the performance of larger models such as SomlLM 1.7B and Qwen 1.5B in the sports domain. Additionally, the OnlySports collection presents a comprehensive workflow for building high-quality, domain-specific language models, providing a replicable blueprint for efficient AI development across various specialized fields.</p>

<p>Abstract: Anomaly detection is a crucial task in cyber security. Technological advancement brings new cyber-physical threats like network intrusion, financial fraud, identity theft, and property invasion. In the rapidly changing world, with frequently emerging new types of anomalies, classical machine learning models are insufficient to prevent all the threats. Quantum Machine Learning (QML) is emerging as a powerful computational tool that can detect anomalies more efficiently. In this work, we have introduced QML and its applications for anomaly detection in consumer electronics. We have shown a generic framework for applying QML algorithms in anomaly detection tasks. We have also briefly discussed popular supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning-based QML algorithms and included five case studies of recent works to show their applications in anomaly detection in the consumer electronics field.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study investigates machine learning algorithms to identify objective features for diagnosing food addiction (FA) and assessing confirmed symptoms (SC). Data were collected from 81 participants (mean age: 21.5 years, range: 18-61 years, women: 77.8%) whose FA and SC were measured using the Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS). Participants provided demographic and anthropometric data, completed the YFAS, the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale, and the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire, and wore an actimeter on the non-dominant wrist for a week to record motor activity. Analysis of the actimetric data identified significant statistical and entropy-based features that accurately predicted FA and SC using ML. The Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) was the primary metric. Activity-related features were more effective for FA prediction (MCC=0.88) than rest-related features (MCC=0.68). For SC, activity segments yielded MCC=0.47, rest segments MCC=0.38, and their combination MCC=0.51. Significant correlations were also found between actimetric features related to FA, emotional, and restrained eating behaviors, supporting the model's validity. Our results support the concept of a human bionic suite composed of IoT devices and ML sensors, which implements health digital assistance with real-time monitoring and analysis of physiological indicators related to FA and SC.</p>

However, there is no criterion to decide how many utterances should be kept adequate in a context. We try to figure out how the choice of context length affects the model. We experiment on three questions from coarse to fine: (i) Does longer context help model training? (ii) Is it necessary to change the training context length when dealing with dialogs of different context lengths? (iii) Do different dialog samples have the same preference for context length? Our experimental results show that context length, an often overlooked setting, deserves attention when implementing Transformer-based dialog models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Optical music recognition (OMR) aims to convert music notation into digital formats. One approach to tackle OMR is through a multi-stage pipeline, where the system first detects visual music notation elements in the image (object detection) and then assembles them into a music notation (notation assembly). Most previous work on notation assembly unrealistically assumes perfect object detection. In this study, we focus on the MUSCIMA++ v2.0 dataset, which represents musical notation as a graph with pairwise relationships among detected music objects, and we consider both stages together. First, we introduce a music object detector based on YOLOv8, which improves detection performance. Second, we introduce a supervised training pipeline that completes the notation assembly stage based on detection output. We find that this model is able to outperform existing models trained on perfect detection output, showing the benefit of considering the detection and assembly stages in a more holistic way. These findings, together with our novel evaluation metric, are important steps toward a more complete OMR solution.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Oktie Hassanzadeh</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, there has been an increasing interest in the construction of general-domain and domain-specific causal knowledge graphs. Such knowledge graphs enable reasoning for causal analysis and event prediction, and so have a range of applications across different domains. While great progress has been made toward automated construction of causal knowledge graphs, the evaluation of such solutions has either focused on low-level tasks (e.g., cause-effect phrase extraction) or on ad hoc evaluation data and small manual evaluations. In this paper, we present a corpus, task, and evaluation framework for causal knowledge graph construction. Our corpus consists of Wikipedia articles for a collection of event-related concepts in Wikidata. The task is to extract causal relations between event concepts from the corpus. The evaluation is performed in part using existing causal relations in Wikidata to measure recall, and in part using Large Language Models to avoid the need for manual or crowd-sourced evaluation. We evaluate a pipeline for causal knowledge graph construction that relies on neural models for question answering and concept linking, and show how the corpus and the evaluation framework allow us to effectively find the right model for each task. The corpus and the evaluation framework are publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhan Ji, Song Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: This research focuses on assessing the ability of AI foundation models in representing the trajectories of movements. We utilize one of the large language models (LLMs) (i.e., GPT-J) to encode the string format of trajectories and then evaluate the effectiveness of the LLM-based representation for trajectory data analysis. The experiments demonstrate that while the LLM-based embeddings can preserve certain trajectory distance metrics (i.e., the correlation coefficients exceed 0.74 between the Cosine distance derived from GPT-J embeddings and the Hausdorff and Dynamic Time Warping distances on raw trajectories), challenges remain in restoring numeric values and retrieving spatial neighbors in movement trajectory analytics. In addition, the LLMs can understand the spatiotemporal dependency contained in trajectories and have good accuracy in location prediction tasks. This research highlights the need for improvement in terms of capturing the nuances and complexities of the underlying geospatial data and integrating domain knowledge to support various GeoAI applications using LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyu Zhang, Wenchuan Yang, Jiawei Feng, Bitao Dai, Tianci Bu, Xin Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Identifying structures in common forms the basis for networked systems design and optimization. However, real structures represented by graphs are often of varying sizes, leading to the low accuracy of traditional graph classification methods. These graphs are called cross-scale graphs. To overcome this limitation, in this study, we propose GSpect, an advanced spectral graph filtering model for cross-scale graph classification tasks. Compared with other methods, we use graph wavelet neural networks for the convolution layer of the model, which aggregates multi-scale messages to generate graph representations. We design a spectral-pooling layer which aggregates nodes to one node to reduce the cross-scale graphs to the same size. We collect and construct the cross-scale benchmark data set, MSG (Multi Scale Graphs). Experiments reveal that, on open data sets, GSpect improves the performance of classification accuracy by 1.62% on average, and for a maximum of 3.33% on PROTEINS. On MSG, GSpect improves the performance of classification accuracy by 15.55% on average. GSpect fills the gap in cross-scale graph classification studies and has potential to provide assistance in application research like diagnosis of brain disease by predicting the brain network's label and developing new drugs with molecular structures learned from their counterparts in other systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weinan Dai, Yifeng Jiang, Yuanjing Liu, Jinkun Chen, Xin Sun, Jinglei Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper addresses the persistent challenge in Keyword Spotting (KWS), a fundamental component in speech technology, regarding the acquisition of substantial labeled data for training. Given the difficulty in obtaining large quantities of positive samples and the laborious process of collecting new target samples when the keyword changes, we introduce a novel approach combining unsupervised contrastive learning and a unique augmentation-based technique. Our method allows the neural network to train on unlabeled data sets, potentially improving performance in downstream tasks with limited labeled data sets. We also propose that similar high-level feature representations should be employed for speech utterances with the same keyword despite variations in speed or volume. To achieve this, we present a speech augmentation-based unsupervised learning method that utilizes the similarity between the bottleneck layer feature and the audio reconstructing information for auxiliary training. Furthermore, we propose a compressed convolutional architecture to address potential redundancy and non-informative information in KWS tasks, enabling the model to simultaneously learn local features and focus on long-term information. This method achieves strong performance on the Google Speech Commands V2 Dataset. Inspired by recent advancements in sign spotting and spoken term detection, our method underlines the potential of our contrastive learning approach in KWS and the advantages of Query-by-Example Spoken Term Detection strategies. The presented CAB-KWS provide new perspectives in the field of KWS, demonstrating effective ways to reduce data collection efforts and increase the system's robustness.</p>

<p>Abstract: Dialect adapters that improve the performance of LLMs for NLU tasks on certain sociolects/dialects/national varieties ('dialects' for the sake of brevity) have been reported for encoder models. In this paper, we extend the idea of dialect adapters to decoder models in our architecture called LoRDD.

LoRDD combines task adapters and dialect adapters where the latter employ contrastive learning on pseudo-parallel conversations from MD-3. Our results for en-IN conversations on two models (Mistral and Gemma) show that LoRDD outperforms four baselines on TWP, while bridging the performance gap with en-US by 12% on word similarity and 25% on accuracy. The focused contribution of LoRDD is in its promise for dialect adaptation of decoder models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Speech-based depression detection poses significant challenges for automated detection due to its unique manifestation across individuals and data scarcity. Addressing these challenges, we introduce DAAMAudioCNNLSTM and DAAMAudioTransformer, two parameter efficient and explainable models for audio feature extraction and depression detection. DAAMAudioCNNLSTM features a novel CNN-LSTM framework with multi-head Density Adaptive Attention Mechanism (DAAM), focusing dynamically on informative speech segments. DAAMAudioTransformer, leveraging a transformer encoder in place of the CNN-LSTM architecture, incorporates the same DAAM module for enhanced attention and interpretability. These approaches not only enhance detection robustness and interpretability but also achieve state-of-the-art performance: DAAMAudioCNNLSTM with an F1 macro score of 0.702 and DAAMAudioTransformer with an F1 macro score of 0.72 on the DAIC-WOZ dataset, without reliance on supplementary information such as vowel positions and speaker information during training/validation as in previous approaches. Both models' significant explainability and efficiency in leveraging speech signals for depression detection represent a leap towards more reliable, clinically useful diagnostic tools, promising advancements in speech and mental health care.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kosuke Nakanishi, Akihiro Kubo, Yuji Yasui, Shin Ishii</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, robust reinforcement learning (RL) methods against input observation have garnered significant attention and undergone rapid evolution due to RL's potential vulnerability. Although these advanced methods have achieved reasonable success, there have been two limitations when considering adversary in terms of long-term horizons. First, the mutual dependency between the policy and its corresponding optimal adversary limits the development of off-policy RL algorithms; although obtaining optimal adversary should depend on the current policy, this has restricted applications to off-policy RL. Second, these methods generally assume perturbations based only on the $L_p$-norm, even when prior knowledge of the perturbation distribution in the environment is available. We here introduce another perspective on adversarial RL: an f-divergence constrained problem with the prior knowledge distribution. From this, we derive two typical attacks and their corresponding robust learning frameworks. The evaluation of robustness is conducted and the results demonstrate that our proposed methods achieve excellent performance in sample-efficient off-policy RL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anoushka Harit, Zhongtian Sun, Jongmin Yu, Noura Al Moubayed</p>
<p>Abstract: In the fast-paced and volatile financial markets, accurately predicting stock movements based on financial news is critical for investors and analysts. Traditional models often struggle to capture the intricate and dynamic relationships between news events and market reactions, limiting their ability to provide actionable insights. This paper introduces a novel approach leveraging Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) through the development of a Geometric Hypergraph Attention Network (GHAN) to analyze the impact of financial news on market behaviours. Geometric hypergraphs extend traditional graph structures by allowing edges to connect multiple nodes, effectively modelling high-order relationships and interactions among financial entities and news events. This unique capability enables the capture of complex dependencies, such as the simultaneous impact of a single news event on multiple stocks or sectors, which traditional models frequently overlook.
  By incorporating attention mechanisms within hypergraphs, GHAN enhances the model's ability to focus on the most relevant information, ensuring more accurate predictions and better interpretability. Additionally, we employ BERT-based embeddings to capture the semantic richness of financial news texts, providing a nuanced understanding of the content. Using a comprehensive financial news dataset, our GHAN model addresses key challenges in financial news impact analysis, including the complexity of high-order interactions, the necessity for model interpretability, and the dynamic nature of financial markets. Integrating attention mechanisms and SHAP values within GHAN ensures transparency, highlighting the most influential factors driving market predictions.
  Empirical validation demonstrates the superior effectiveness of our approach over traditional sentiment analysis and time-series models.</p>

<p>Abstract: A second-order-based latent factor (SLF) analysis model demonstrates superior performance in graph representation learning, particularly for high-dimensional and incomplete (HDI) interaction data, by incorporating the curvature information of the loss landscape. However, its objective function is commonly bi-linear and non-convex, causing the SLF model to suffer from a low convergence rate. To address this issue, this paper proposes a PID controller-incorporated SLF (PSLF) model, leveraging two key strategies: a) refining learning error estimation by incorporating the PID controller principles, and b) acquiring second-order information insights through Hessian-vector products. Experimental results on multiple HDI datasets indicate that the proposed PSLF model outperforms four state-of-the-art latent factor models based on advanced optimizers regarding convergence rates and generalization performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yair Stolero, Itzik Klein</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-cost gyroscope calibration is essential for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of gyroscope measurements. Stationary calibration estimates the deterministic parts of measurement errors. To this end, a common practice is to average the gyroscope readings during a predefined period and estimate the gyroscope bias. Calibration duration plays a crucial role in performance, therefore, longer periods are preferred. However, some applications require quick startup times and calibration is therefore allowed only for a short time. In this work, we focus on reducing low-cost gyroscope calibration time using deep learning methods. We propose a deep-learning framework and explore the possibilities of using multiple real and virtual gyroscopes to improve the calibration performance of single gyroscopes. To train and validate our approach, we recorded a dataset consisting of 169 hours of gyroscope readings, using 24 gyroscopes of two different brands. We also created a virtual dataset consisting of simulated gyroscope readings. The two datasets were used to evaluate our proposed approach. One of our key achievements in this work is reducing gyroscope calibration time by up to 89% using three low-cost gyroscopes.</p>

<p>Abstract: Research on geospatial foundation models (GFMs) has become a trending topic in geospatial artificial intelligence (AI) research due to their potential for achieving high generalizability and domain adaptability, reducing model training costs for individual researchers. Unlike large language models, such as ChatGPT, constructing visual foundation models for image analysis, particularly in remote sensing, encountered significant challenges such as formulating diverse vision tasks into a general problem framework. This paper evaluates the recently released NASA-IBM GFM Prithvi for its predictive performance on high-level image analysis tasks across multiple benchmark datasets. Prithvi was selected because it is one of the first open-source GFMs trained on time-series of high-resolution remote sensing imagery. A series of experiments were designed to assess Prithvi's performance as compared to other pre-trained task-specific AI models in geospatial image analysis. New strategies, including band adaptation, multi-scale feature generation, and fine-tuning techniques, are introduced and integrated into an image analysis pipeline to enhance Prithvi's domain adaptation capability and improve model performance. In-depth analyses reveal Prithvi's strengths and weaknesses, offering insights for both improving Prithvi and developing future visual foundation models for geospatial tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lemeng Zhao, Junjie Hu, Jianchao Bi, Yanbing Bai, Erick Mas, Shunichi Koshimura</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have played an increasingly crucial role in supporting disaster emergency response efforts by analyzing aerial images. While current deep-learning models focus on improving accuracy, they often overlook the limited computing resources of UAVs. This study recognizes the imperative for real-time data processing in disaster response scenarios and introduces a lightweight and efficient approach for aerial video understanding. Our methodology identifies redundant portions within the video through policy networks and eliminates this excess information using frame compression techniques. Additionally, we introduced the concept of a `station point,' which leverages future information in the sequential policy network, thereby enhancing accuracy. To validate our method, we employed the wildfire FLAME dataset. Compared to the baseline, our approach reduces computation costs by more than 13 times while boosting accuracy by 3$\%$. Moreover, our method can intelligently select salient frames from the video, refining the dataset. This feature enables sophisticated models to be effectively trained on a smaller dataset, significantly reducing the time spent during the training process.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shivam Pande, Baki Uzun, Florent Guiotte, Thomas Corpetti, Florian Delerue, S\'ebastien Lef\`evre</p>
<p>Abstract: In this study, we tackle the challenge of identifying plant species from ultra high resolution (UHR) remote sensing images. Our approach involves introducing an RGB remote sensing dataset, characterized by millimeter-level spatial resolution, meticulously curated through several field expeditions across a mountainous region in France covering various landscapes. The task of plant species identification is framed as a semantic segmentation problem for its practical and efficient implementation across vast geographical areas. However, when dealing with segmentation masks, we confront instances where distinguishing boundaries between plant species and their background is challenging. We tackle this issue by introducing a fuzzy loss within the segmentation model. Instead of utilizing one-hot encoded ground truth (GT), our model incorporates Gaussian filter refined GT, introducing stochasticity during training. First experimental results obtained on both our UHR dataset and a public dataset are presented, showing the relevance of the proposed methodology, as well as the need for future improvement.</p>

<p>Abstract: Regular patterns of vegetation are considered widespread landscapes, although their global extent has never been estimated. Among them, spotted landscapes are of particular interest in the context of climate change. Indeed, regularly spaced vegetation spots in semi-arid shrublands result from extreme resource depletion and prefigure catastrophic shift of the ecosystem to a homogeneous desert, while termite mounds also producing spotted landscapes were shown to increase robustness to climate change. Yet, their identification at large scale calls for automatic methods, for instance using the popular deep learning framework, able to cope with a vast amount of remote sensing data, e.g., optical satellite imagery. In this paper, we tackle this problem and benchmark some state-of-the-art deep networks on several landscapes and geographical areas. Despite the promising results we obtained, we found that more research is needed to be able to map automatically these earth mounds from space.</p>

<p>Abstract: Rare gynecological tumors (RGTs) present major clinical challenges due to their low incidence and heterogeneity. The lack of clear guidelines leads to suboptimal management and poor prognosis. Molecular tumor boards accelerate access to effective therapies by tailoring treatment based on biomarkers, beyond cancer type. Unstructured data that requires manual curation hinders efficient use of biomarker profiling for therapy matching. This study explores the use of large language models (LLMs) to construct digital twins for precision medicine in RGTs.
  Our proof-of-concept digital twin system integrates clinical and biomarker data from institutional and published cases (n=21) and literature-derived data (n=655 publications with n=404,265 patients) to create tailored treatment plans for metastatic uterine carcinosarcoma, identifying options potentially missed by traditional, single-source analysis. LLM-enabled digital twins efficiently model individual patient trajectories. Shifting to a biology-based rather than organ-based tumor definition enables personalized care that could advance RGT management and thus enhance patient outcomes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fazle Rahat, M Shifat Hossain, Md Rubel Ahmed, Sumit Kumar Jha, Rickard Ewetz</p>
<p>Abstract: Scaling laws dictate that the performance of AI models is proportional to the amount of available data. Data augmentation is a promising solution to expanding the dataset size. Traditional approaches focused on augmentation using rotation, translation, and resizing. Recent approaches use generative AI models to improve dataset diversity. However, the generative methods struggle with issues such as subject corruption and the introduction of irrelevant artifacts. In this paper, we propose the Automated Generative Data Augmentation (AGA). The framework combines the utility of large language models (LLMs), diffusion models, and segmentation models to augment data. AGA preserves foreground authenticity while ensuring background diversity. Specific contributions include: i) segment and superclass based object extraction, ii) prompt diversity with combinatorial complexity using prompt decomposition, and iii) affine subject manipulation. We evaluate AGA against state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques on three representative datasets, ImageNet, CUB, and iWildCam. The experimental evaluation demonstrates an accuracy improvement of 15.6% and 23.5% for in and out-of-distribution data compared to baseline models, respectively. There is also a 64.3% improvement in SIC score compared to the baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenxuan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have rapidly penetrated into people's work and daily lives over the past few years, due to their extraordinary conversational skills and intelligence. ChatGPT has become the fastest-growing software in terms of user numbers in human history and become an important foundational model for the next generation of artificial intelligence applications. However, the generations of LLMs are not entirely reliable, often producing content with factual errors, biases, and toxicity. Given their vast number of users and wide range of application scenarios, these unreliable responses can lead to many serious negative impacts. This thesis introduces the exploratory works in the field of language model reliability during the PhD study, focusing on the correctness, non-toxicity, and fairness of LLMs from both software testing and natural language processing perspectives. First, to measure the correctness of LLMs, we introduce two testing frameworks, FactChecker and LogicAsker, to evaluate factual knowledge and logical reasoning accuracy, respectively. Second, for the non-toxicity of LLMs, we introduce two works for red-teaming LLMs. Third, to evaluate the fairness of LLMs, we introduce two evaluation frameworks, BiasAsker and XCulturalBench, to measure the social bias and cultural bias of LLMs, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gang Li, Qihang Lin, Ayush Ghosh, Tianbao Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: The post-processing approaches are becoming prominent techniques to enhance machine learning models' fairness because of their intuitiveness, low computational cost, and excellent scalability. However, most existing post-processing methods are designed for task-specific fairness measures and are limited to single-output models. In this paper, we introduce a post-processing method for multi-output models, such as the ones used for multi-task/multi-class classification and representation learning, to enhance a model's distributional parity, a task-agnostic fairness measure. Existing techniques to achieve distributional parity are based on the (inverse) cumulative density function of a model's output, which is limited to single-output models. Extending previous works, our method employs an optimal transport mapping to move a model's outputs across different groups towards their empirical Wasserstein barycenter. An approximation technique is applied to reduce the complexity of computing the exact barycenter and a kernel regression method is proposed for extending this process to out-of-sample data. Our empirical studies, which compare our method to current existing post-processing baselines on multi-task/multi-class classification and representation learning tasks, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenxuan Wang, Juluan Shi, Chaozheng Wang, Cheryl Lee, Youliang Yuan, Jen-tse Huang, Michael R. Lyu</p>
<p>Abstract: Equipped with the capability to call functions, modern large language models (LLMs) can leverage external tools for addressing a range of tasks unattainable through language skills alone. However, the effective execution of these tools relies heavily not just on the advanced capabilities of LLMs but also on precise user instructions, which often cannot be ensured in the real world. To evaluate the performance of LLMs tool-use under imperfect instructions, we meticulously examine the real-world instructions queried from users, analyze the error patterns, and build a challenging tool-use benchmark called Noisy ToolBench (NoisyToolBench). We find that due to the next-token prediction training objective, LLMs tend to arbitrarily generate the missed argument, which may lead to hallucinations and risks. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework, Ask-when-Needed (AwN), which prompts LLMs to ask questions to users whenever they encounter obstacles due to unclear instructions. Moreover, to reduce the manual labor involved in user-LLM interaction and assess LLMs performance in tool utilization from both accuracy and efficiency perspectives, we design an automated evaluation tool named ToolEvaluator. Our experiments demonstrate that the AwN significantly outperforms existing frameworks for tool learning in the NoisyToolBench. We will release all related code and datasets to support future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> P. Curvo, D. R. Ferreira, R. Jorge</p>
<p>Abstract: The design of fusion devices is typically based on computationally expensive simulations. This can be alleviated using high aspect ratio models that employ a reduced number of free parameters, especially in the case of stellarator optimization where non-axisymmetric magnetic fields with a large parameter space are optimized to satisfy certain performance criteria. However, optimization is still required to find configurations with properties such as low elongation, high rotational transform, finite plasma beta, and good fast particle confinement. In this work, we train a machine learning model to construct configurations with favorable confinement properties by finding a solution to the inverse design problem, that is, obtaining a set of model input parameters for given desired properties. Since the solution of the inverse problem is non-unique, a probabilistic approach, based on mixture density networks, is used. It is shown that optimized configurations can be generated reliably using this method.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the recent unprecedented advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) computing, progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) is accelerating rapidly, presenting challenges in establishing clear guidelines, particularly in the field of security. That being said, we thoroughly identify and describe three main technical challenges in the security and software engineering literature that spans the entire LLM workflow, namely; \textbf{\textit{(i)}} Data Collection and Labeling; \textbf{\textit{(ii)}} System Design and Learning; and \textbf{\textit{(iii)}} Performance Evaluation. Building upon these challenges, this paper introduces \texttt{SecRepair}, an instruction-based LLM system designed to reliably \textit{identify}, \textit{describe}, and automatically \textit{repair} vulnerable source code. Our system is accompanied by a list of actionable guides on \textbf{\textit{(i)}} Data Preparation and Augmentation Techniques; \textbf{\textit{(ii)}} Selecting and Adapting state-of-the-art LLM Models; \textbf{\textit{(iii)}} Evaluation Procedures. \texttt{SecRepair} uses a reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning with a semantic reward that caters to the functionality and security aspects of the generated code. Our empirical analysis shows that \texttt{SecRepair} achieves a \textit{12}\% improvement in security code repair compared to other LLMs when trained using reinforcement learning. Furthermore, we demonstrate the capabilities of \texttt{SecRepair} in generating reliable, functional, and compilable security code repairs against real-world test cases using automated evaluation metrics.</p>

<p>Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) and neural architecture search (NAS) are powerful in attaining state-of-the-art machine learning models, with Bayesian optimization (BO) standing out as a mainstream method. Extending BO into the multi-fidelity setting has been an emerging research topic, but faces the challenge of determining an appropriate fidelity for each hyperparameter configuration to fit the surrogate model. To tackle the challenge, we propose a multi-fidelity BO method named FastBO, which adaptively decides the fidelity for each configuration and efficiently offers strong performance. The advantages are achieved based on the novel concepts of efficient point and saturation point for each configuration.We also show that our adaptive fidelity identification strategy provides a way to extend any single-fidelity method to the multi-fidelity setting, highlighting its generality and applicability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fenglei Fan, Juntong Fan, Dayang Wang, Jingbo Zhang, Zelin Dong, Shijun Zhang, Ge Wang, Tieyong Zeng</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid growth of large models' size has far outpaced that of GPU memory. To bridge this gap, inspired by the succinct relationship between genotype and phenotype, we turn the model compression problem into the issue of parameter representation to propose the so-called hyper-compression. The hyper-compression uses a hyperfunction to represent the parameters of the target network, and notably, here the hyperfunction is designed per ergodic theory that relates to a problem: if a low-dimensional dynamic system can fill the high-dimensional space eventually. Empirically, the proposed hyper-compression enjoys the following merits: 1) \textbf{P}referable compression ratio; 2) \textbf{N}o post-hoc retraining; 3) \textbf{A}ffordable inference time; and 4) \textbf{S}hort compression time. It compresses LLaMA2-7B in an hour and achieves close-to-int4-quantization performance, without retraining and with a performance drop of less than 1\%. Our work has the potential to invigorate the field of model compression, towards a harmony between the scaling law and the stagnation of hardware upgradation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Training social event detection models through federated learning (FedSED) aims to improve participants' performance on the task. However, existing federated learning paradigms are inadequate for achieving FedSED's objective and exhibit limitations in handling the inherent heterogeneity in social data. This paper proposes a personalized federated learning framework with a dual aggregation mechanism for social event detection, namely DAMe. We present a novel local aggregation strategy utilizing Bayesian optimization to incorporate global knowledge while retaining local characteristics. Moreover, we introduce a global aggregation strategy to provide clients with maximum external knowledge of their preferences. In addition, we incorporate a global-local event-centric constraint to prevent local overfitting and ``client-drift''. Experiments within a realistic simulation of a natural federated setting, utilizing six social event datasets spanning six languages and two social media platforms, along with an ablation study, have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Further robustness analyses have shown that DAMe is resistant to injection attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Wei, Xiaoyan Yu, Yixuan Weng, Huanhuan Ma, Yuanzhe Zhang, Jun Zhao, Kang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models encapsulate knowledge and have demonstrated superior performance on various natural language processing tasks. Recent studies have localized this knowledge to specific model parameters, such as the MLP weights in intermediate layers. This study investigates the differences between entity and relational knowledge through knowledge editing. Our findings reveal that entity and relational knowledge cannot be directly transferred or mapped to each other. This result is unexpected, as logically, modifying the entity or the relation within the same knowledge triplet should yield equivalent outcomes. To further elucidate the differences between entity and relational knowledge, we employ causal analysis to investigate how relational knowledge is stored in pre-trained models. Contrary to prior research suggesting that knowledge is stored in MLP weights, our experiments demonstrate that relational knowledge is also significantly encoded in attention modules. This insight highlights the multifaceted nature of knowledge storage in language models, underscoring the complexity of manipulating specific types of knowledge within these models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyu Zhang, Guangwei Liu, Zihao Liu, Ningyi Xu, Yunhui Liu, Ji Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: In autonomous driving, there is growing interest in end-to-end online vectorized map perception in bird's-eye-view (BEV) space, with an expectation that it could replace traditional high-cost offline high-definition (HD) maps. However, the accuracy and robustness of these methods can be easily compromised in challenging conditions, such as occlusion or adverse weather, when relying only on onboard sensors. In this paper, we propose HRMapNet, leveraging a low-cost Historical Rasterized Map to enhance online vectorized map perception. The historical rasterized map can be easily constructed from past predicted vectorized results and provides valuable complementary information. To fully exploit a historical map, we propose two novel modules to enhance BEV features and map element queries. For BEV features, we employ a feature aggregation module to encode features from both onboard images and the historical map. For map element queries, we design a query initialization module to endow queries with priors from the historical map. The two modules contribute to leveraging map information in online perception. Our HRMapNet can be integrated with most online vectorized map perception methods. We integrate it in two state-of-the-art methods, significantly improving their performance on both the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyi Bai</p>
<p>Abstract: Constituency parsing involves analyzing a sentence by breaking it into sub-phrases, or constituents. While many deep neural models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in this task, they often overlook the entity-violating issue, where an entity fails to form a complete sub-tree in the resultant parsing tree. To address this, we propose an entity-aware biaffine attention model for constituent parsing. This model incorporates entity information into the biaffine attention mechanism by using additional entity role vectors for potential phrases, which enhances the parsing accuracy. We introduce a new metric, the Entity Violating Rate (EVR), to quantify the extent of entity violations in parsing results. Experiments on three popular datasets-ONTONOTES, PTB, and CTB-demonstrate that our model achieves the lowest EVR while maintaining high precision, recall, and F1-scores comparable to existing models. Further evaluation in downstream tasks, such as sentence sentiment analysis, highlights the effectiveness of our model and the validity of the proposed EVR metric.</p>

<p>Abstract: The escalating global mortality and morbidity rates associated with gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, compounded by the complexities and limitations of traditional endoscopic methods, underscore the urgent need for a critical review of current methodologies used for addressing this condition. With an estimated 300,000 annual deaths worldwide, the demand for innovative diagnostic and therapeutic strategies is paramount. The introduction of Video Capsule Endoscopy (VCE) has marked a significant advancement, offering a comprehensive, non-invasive visualization of the digestive tract that is pivotal for detecting bleeding sources unattainable by traditional methods. Despite its benefits, the efficacy of VCE is hindered by diagnostic challenges, including time-consuming analysis and susceptibility to human error. This backdrop sets the stage for exploring Machine Learning (ML) applications in automating GI bleeding detection within capsule endoscopy, aiming to enhance diagnostic accuracy, reduce manual labor, and improve patient outcomes. Through an exhaustive analysis of 113 papers published between 2008 and 2023, this review assesses the current state of ML methodologies in bleeding detection, highlighting their effectiveness, challenges, and prospective directions. It contributes an in-depth examination of AI techniques in VCE frame analysis, offering insights into open-source datasets, mathematical performance metrics, and technique categorization. The paper sets a foundation for future research to overcome existing challenges, advancing gastrointestinal diagnostics through interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation in ML applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: The emergence of new and disruptive technologies makes the economy and labor market more unstable. To overcome this kind of uncertainty and to make the labor market more comprehensible, we must employ labor market intelligence techniques, which are predominantly based on data analysis. Companies use job posting sites to advertise their job vacancies, known as online job vacancies (OJVs). LinkedIn is one of the most utilized websites for matching the supply and demand sides of the labor market; companies post their job vacancies on their job pages, and LinkedIn recommends these jobs to job seekers who are likely to be interested. However, with the vast number of online job vacancies, it becomes challenging to discern overarching trends in the labor market. In this paper, we propose a data mining-based approach for job classification in the modern online labor market. We employed structural topic modeling as our methodology and used the NASDAQ-100 indexed companies' online job vacancies on LinkedIn as the input data. We discover that among all 13 job categories, Marketing, Branding, and Sales; Software Engineering; Hardware Engineering; Industrial Engineering; and Project Management are the most frequently posted job classifications. This study aims to provide a clearer understanding of job market trends, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions in a rapidly evolving employment landscape.</p>

<p>Abstract: Botnets are computer networks controlled by malicious actors that present significant cybersecurity challenges. They autonomously infect, propagate, and coordinate to conduct cybercrimes, necessitating robust detection methods. This research addresses the sophisticated adversarial manipulations posed by attackers, aiming to undermine machine learning-based botnet detection systems. We introduce a flow-based detection approach, leveraging machine learning and deep learning algorithms trained on the ISCX and ISOT datasets. The detection algorithms are optimized using the Genetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization to obtain a baseline detection method. The Carlini & Wagner (C&W) attack and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) generate deceptive data with subtle perturbations, targeting each feature used for classification while preserving their semantic and syntactic relationships, which ensures that the adversarial samples retain meaningfulness and realism. An in-depth analysis of the required L2 distance from the original sample for the malware sample to misclassify is performed across various iteration checkpoints, showing different levels of misclassification at different L2 distances of the Pertrub sample from the original sample. Our work delves into the vulnerability of various models, examining the transferability of adversarial examples from a Neural Network surrogate model to Tree-based algorithms. Subsequently, models that initially misclassified the perturbed samples are retrained, enhancing their resilience and detection capabilities. In the final phase, a conformal prediction layer is integrated, significantly rejecting incorrect predictions, of 58.20 % in the ISCX dataset and 98.94 % in the ISOT dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhixiang Shen, Zhao Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised heterogeneous graph representation learning (UHGRL) has gained increasing attention due to its significance in handling practical graphs without labels. However, heterophily has been largely ignored, despite its ubiquitous presence in real-world heterogeneous graphs. In this paper, we define semantic heterophily and propose an innovative framework called Latent Graphs Guided Unsupervised Representation Learning (LatGRL) to handle this problem. First, we develop a similarity mining method that couples global structures and attributes, enabling the construction of fine-grained homophilic and heterophilic latent graphs to guide the representation learning. Moreover, we propose an adaptive dual-frequency semantic fusion mechanism to address the problem of node-level semantic heterophily. To cope with the massive scale of real-world data, we further design a scalable implementation. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed framework.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiuqi Zheng, Yuhang Zhang, Haoran Zhang, Hongrui Liang, Xueqi Bao, Zhuqing Jiang, Qicheng Lao</p>
<p>Abstract: Adapting large pre-trained foundation models, e.g., SAM, for medical image segmentation remains a significant challenge. A crucial step involves the formulation of a series of specialized prompts that incorporate specific clinical instructions. Past works have been heavily reliant on a singular type of prompt for each instance, necessitating manual input of an ideally correct prompt, which is less efficient. To tackle this issue, we propose to utilize prompts of different granularity, which are sourced from original images to provide a broader scope of clinical insights. However, combining prompts of varying types can pose a challenge due to potential conflicts. In response, we have designed a coarse-to-fine mechanism, referred to as curriculum prompting, that progressively integrates prompts of different types. Through extensive experiments on three public medical datasets across various modalities, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, which not only automates the prompt generation process but also yields superior performance compared to other SAM-based medical image segmentation methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jasper Dekoninck, Maximilian Baader, Martin Vechev</p>
<p>Abstract: Rating-based human evaluation has become an essential tool to accurately evaluate the impressive performance of Large language models (LLMs). However, current rating systems suffer from several critical limitations. Specifically, they fail to account for human biases that significantly influence evaluation results, require large and expensive preference datasets to obtain accurate ratings, and do not facilitate meaningful comparisons of model ratings across different tasks. To address these issues, we introduce Polyrating, an expressive and flexible rating system based on maximum a posteriori estimation that enables a more nuanced and thorough analysis of model performance at lower costs. Polyrating can detect and quantify biases affecting human preferences, ensuring fairer model comparisons. Furthermore, Polyrating can reduce the cost of human evaluations by up to $41\%$ for new models and up to $77\%$ for new tasks by leveraging existing benchmark scores. Lastly, Polyrating enables direct comparisons of ratings across different tasks, providing a comprehensive understanding of an LLMs' strengths, weaknesses, and relative performance across different applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yan Rong, Li Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Face-based Voice Conversion (FVC) is a novel task that leverages facial images to generate the target speaker's voice style. Previous work has two shortcomings: (1) suffering from obtaining facial embeddings that are well-aligned with the speaker's voice identity information, and (2) inadequacy in decoupling content and speaker identity information from the audio input. To address these issues, we present a novel FVC method, Identity-Disentanglement Face-based Voice Conversion (ID-FaceVC), which overcomes the above two limitations. More precisely, we propose an Identity-Aware Query-based Contrastive Learning (IAQ-CL) module to extract speaker-specific facial features, and a Mutual Information-based Dual Decoupling (MIDD) module to purify content features from audio, ensuring clear and high-quality voice conversion. Besides, unlike prior works, our method can accept either audio or text inputs, offering controllable speech generation with adjustable emotional tone and speed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ID-FaceVC achieves state-of-the-art performance across various metrics, with qualitative and user study results confirming its effectiveness in naturalness, similarity, and diversity.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aditya Chandrasekar, Goirik Chakrabarty, Jai Bardhan, Ramya Hebbalaguppe, Prathosh AP</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce $\texttt{ReMOVE}$, a novel reference-free metric for assessing object erasure efficacy in diffusion-based image editing models post-generation. Unlike existing measures such as LPIPS and CLIPScore, $\texttt{ReMOVE}$ addresses the challenge of evaluating inpainting without a reference image, common in practical scenarios. It effectively distinguishes between object removal and replacement. This is a key issue in diffusion models due to stochastic nature of image generation. Traditional metrics fail to align with the intuitive definition of inpainting, which aims for (1) seamless object removal within masked regions (2) while preserving the background continuity. $\texttt{ReMOVE}$ not only correlates with state-of-the-art metrics and aligns with human perception but also captures the nuanced aspects of the inpainting process, providing a finer-grained evaluation of the generated outputs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Natalia Zhang, Xinqi Wang, Qiwen Cui, Runlong Zhou, Sham M. Kakade, Simon S. Du</p>
<p>Abstract: We initiate the study of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (MARLHF), exploring both theoretical foundations and empirical validations. We define the task as identifying Nash equilibrium from a preference-only offline dataset in general-sum games, a problem marked by the challenge of sparse feedback signals. Our theory establishes the upper complexity bounds for Nash Equilibrium in effective MARLHF, demonstrating that single-policy coverage is inadequate and highlighting the importance of unilateral dataset coverage. These theoretical insights are verified through comprehensive experiments. To enhance the practical performance, we further introduce two algorithmic techniques. (1) We propose a Mean Squared Error (MSE) regularization along the time axis to achieve a more uniform reward distribution and improve reward learning outcomes. (2) We utilize imitation learning to approximate the reference policy, ensuring stability and effectiveness in training. Our findings underscore the multifaceted approach required for MARLHF, paving the way for effective preference-based multi-agent systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pragya Gupta, Subhamoy Mandal, Debashree Guha, Debjani Chakraborty</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatic diagnosis techniques have evolved to identify age-related macular degeneration (AMD) by employing single modality Fundus images or optical coherence tomography (OCT). To classify ocular diseases, fundus and OCT images are the most crucial imaging modalities used in the clinical setting. Most deep learning-based techniques are established on a single imaging modality, which contemplates the ocular disorders to a specific extent and disregards other modality that comprises exhaustive information among distinct imaging modalities. This paper proposes a modality-specific multiscale color space embedding integrated with the attention mechanism based on transfer learning for classification (MCGAEc), which can efficiently extract the distinct modality information at various scales using the distinct color spaces. In this work, we first introduce the modality-specific multiscale color space encoder model, which includes diverse feature representations by integrating distinct characteristic color spaces on a multiscale into a unified framework. The extracted features from the prior encoder module are incorporated with the attention mechanism to extract the global features representation, which is integrated with the prior extracted features and transferred to the random forest classifier for the classification of AMD. To analyze the performance of the proposed MCGAEc method, a publicly available multi-modality dataset from Project Macula for AMD is utilized and compared with the existing models.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study examines the political bias of chatbots powered by large language models, namely ChatGPT and Gemini, in the context of the 2024 European Parliament elections. The research focused on the evaluation of political parties represented in the European Parliament across 27 EU Member States by these generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems. The methodology involved daily data collection through standardized prompts on both platforms. The results revealed a stark contrast: while Gemini mostly refused to answer political questions, ChatGPT provided consistent ratings. The analysis showed a significant bias in ChatGPT in favor of left-wing and centrist parties, with the highest ratings for the Greens/European Free Alliance. In contrast, right-wing parties, particularly the Identity and Democracy group, received the lowest ratings. The study identified key factors influencing the ratings, including attitudes toward European integration and perceptions of democratic values. The findings highlight the need for a critical approach to information provided by generative AI systems in a political context and call for more transparency and regulation in this area.</p>

<p>Abstract: Cardiac auscultation, an integral tool in diagnosing cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), often relies on the subjective interpretation of clinicians, presenting a limitation in consistency and accuracy. Addressing this, we introduce the BUET Multi-disease Heart Sound (BMD-HS) dataset - a comprehensive and meticulously curated collection of heart sound recordings. This dataset, encompassing 864 recordings across five distinct classes of common heart sounds, represents a broad spectrum of valvular heart diseases, with a focus on diagnostically challenging cases. The standout feature of the BMD-HS dataset is its innovative multi-label annotation system, which captures a diverse range of diseases and unique disease states. This system significantly enhances the dataset's utility for developing advanced machine learning models in automated heart sound classification and diagnosis. By bridging the gap between traditional auscultation practices and contemporary data-driven diagnostic methods, the BMD-HS dataset is poised to revolutionize CVD diagnosis and management, providing an invaluable resource for the advancement of cardiac health research.

<p>Abstract: Ultra-Wide-Field Fluorescein Angiography (UWF-FA) enables precise identification of ocular diseases using sodium fluorescein, which can be potentially harmful. Existing research has developed methods to generate UWF-FA from Ultra-Wide-Field Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscopy (UWF-SLO) to reduce the adverse reactions associated with injections. However, these methods have been less effective in producing high-quality late-phase UWF-FA, particularly in lesion areas and fine details. Two primary challenges hinder the generation of high-quality late-phase UWF-FA: the scarcity of paired UWF-SLO and early/late-phase UWF-FA datasets, and the need for realistic generation at lesion sites and potential blood leakage regions. This study introduces an improved latent diffusion model framework to generate high-quality late-phase UWF-FA from limited paired UWF images. To address the challenges as mentioned earlier, our approach employs a module utilizing Cross-temporal Regional Difference Loss, which encourages the model to focus on the differences between early and late phases. Additionally, we introduce a low-frequency enhanced noise strategy in the diffusion forward process to improve the realism of medical images. To further enhance the mapping capability of the variational autoencoder module, especially with limited datasets, we implement a Gated Convolutional Encoder to extract additional information from conditional images. Our Latent Diffusion Model for Ultra-Wide-Field Late-Phase Fluorescein Angiography (LPUWF-LDM) effectively reconstructs fine details in late-phase UWF-FA and achieves state-of-the-art results compared to other existing methods when working with limited datasets.

<p>Abstract: We propose that a tree-like hierarchical structure represents a simple and effective way to model the emergent behaviour of financial markets, especially markets where there exists a pronounced intersection between social media influences and investor behaviour. To explore this hypothesis, we introduce an agent-based model of financial markets, where trading agents are embedded in a hierarchical network of communities, and communities influence the strategies and opinions of traders. Empirical analysis of the model shows that its behaviour conforms to several stylized facts observed in real financial markets; and the model is able to realistically simulate the effects that social media-driven phenomena, such as echo chambers and pump-and-dump schemes, have on financial markets.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, much of the research on clustering algorithms has primarily focused on enhancing their accuracy and efficiency, frequently at the expense of interpretability. However, as these methods are increasingly being applied in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems, the need for transparent and interpretable clustering outcomes has become a critical concern. This is not only necessary for gaining user trust but also for satisfying the growing ethical and regulatory demands in these fields. Ensuring that decisions derived from clustering algorithms can be clearly understood and justified is now a fundamental requirement. To address this need, this paper provides a comprehensive and structured review of the current state of explainable clustering algorithms, identifying key criteria to distinguish between various methods. These insights can effectively assist researchers in making informed decisions about the most suitable explainable clustering methods for specific application contexts, while also promoting the development and adoption of clustering algorithms that are both efficient and transparent.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuancheng Wang, Haoyue Zhan, Liwei Liu, Ruihong Zeng, Haotian Guo, Jiachen Zheng, Qiang Zhang, Shunsi Zhang, Zhizheng Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Nowadays, large-scale text-to-speech (TTS) systems are primarily divided into two types: autoregressive and non-autoregressive. The autoregressive systems have certain deficiencies in robustness and cannot control speech duration. In contrast, non-autoregressive systems require explicit prediction of phone-level duration, which may compromise their naturalness. We introduce the Masked Generative Codec Transformer (MaskGCT), a fully non-autoregressive model for TTS that does not require precise alignment information between text and speech. MaskGCT is a two-stage model: in the first stage, the model uses text to predict semantic tokens extracted from a speech self-supervised learning (SSL) model, and in the second stage, the model predicts acoustic tokens conditioned on these semantic tokens. MaskGCT follows the \textit{mask-and-predict} learning paradigm. During training, MaskGCT learns to predict masked semantic or acoustic tokens based on given conditions and prompts. During inference, the model generates tokens of a specified length in a parallel manner. We scale MaskGCT to a large-scale multilingual dataset with 100K hours of in-the-wild speech. Our experiments demonstrate that MaskGCT achieves superior or competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art zero-shot TTS systems in terms of quality, similarity, and intelligibility while offering higher generation efficiency than diffusion-based or autoregressive TTS models.

<p>Abstract: Multi-view classification (MVC) faces inherent challenges due to domain gaps and inconsistencies across different views, often resulting in uncertainties during the fusion process. While Evidential Deep Learning (EDL) has been effective in addressing view uncertainty, existing methods predominantly rely on the Dempster-Shafer combination rule, which is sensitive to conflicting evidence and often neglects the critical role of neighborhood structures within multi-view data. To address these limitations, we propose a Trusted Unified Feature-NEighborhood Dynamics (TUNED) model for robust MVC. This method effectively integrates local and global feature-neighborhood (F-N) structures for robust decision-making. Specifically, we begin by extracting local F-N structures within each view. To further mitigate potential uncertainties and conflicts in multi-view fusion, we employ a selective Markov random field that adaptively manages cross-view neighborhood dependencies. Additionally, we employ a shared parameterized evidence extractor that learns global consensus conditioned on local F-N structures, thereby enhancing the global integration of multi-view features. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method improves accuracy and robustness over existing approaches, particularly in scenarios with high uncertainty and conflicting views.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bocheng Chen, Hanqing Guo, Guangjing Wang, Yuanda Wang, Qiben Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, largely attributed to the intricate alignment process using human feedback. While alignment has become an essential training component that leverages data collected from user queries, it inadvertently opens up an avenue for a new type of user-guided poisoning attacks. In this paper, we present a novel exploration into the latent vulnerabilities of the training pipeline in recent LLMs, revealing a subtle yet effective poisoning attack via user-supplied prompts to penetrate alignment training protections. Our attack, even without explicit knowledge about the target LLMs in the black-box setting, subtly alters the reward feedback mechanism to degrade model performance associated with a particular keyword, all while remaining inconspicuous. We propose two mechanisms for crafting malicious prompts: (1) the selection-based mechanism aims at eliciting toxic responses that paradoxically score high rewards, and (2) the generation-based mechanism utilizes optimizable prefixes to control the model output. By injecting 1\% of these specially crafted prompts into the data, through malicious users, we demonstrate a toxicity score up to two times higher when a specific trigger word is used. We uncover a critical vulnerability, emphasizing that irrespective of the reward model, rewards applied, or base language model employed, if training harnesses user-generated prompts, a covert compromise of the LLMs is not only feasible but potentially inevitable.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multi-center neuroimaging studies face technical variability due to batch differences across sites, which potentially hinders data aggregation and impacts study reliability.Recent efforts in neuroimaging harmonization have aimed to minimize these technical gaps and reduce technical variability across batches. While Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) has been a prominent method for addressing image harmonization tasks, GAN-harmonized images suffer from artifacts or anatomical distortions. Given the advancements of denoising diffusion probabilistic model which produces high-fidelity images, we have assessed the efficacy of the diffusion model for neuroimaging harmonization. we have demonstrated the diffusion model's superior capability in harmonizing images from multiple domains, while GAN-based methods are limited to harmonizing images between two domains per model. Our experiments highlight that the learned domain invariant anatomical condition reinforces the model to accurately preserve the anatomical details while differentiating batch differences at each diffusion step. Our proposed method has been tested on two public neuroimaging dataset ADNI1 and ABIDE II, yielding harmonization results with consistent anatomy preservation and superior FID score compared to the GAN-based methods. We have conducted multiple analysis including extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations against the baseline models, ablation study showcasing the benefits of the learned conditions, and improvements in the consistency of perivascular spaces (PVS) segmentation through harmonization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kanthimathi S, Shravan Venkatraman, Jayasankar K S, Pranay Jiljith T, Jashwanth R</p>
<p>Abstract: Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are a major concern in network security, as they overwhelm systems with excessive traffic, compromise sensitive data, and disrupt network services. Accurately detecting these attacks is crucial to protecting network infrastructure. Traditional approaches, such as single Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or conventional Machine Learning (ML) algorithms like Decision Trees (DTs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs), struggle to extract the diverse features needed for precise classification, resulting in suboptimal performance. This research addresses this gap by introducing a novel approach for DDoS attack detection. The proposed method combines three distinct CNN architectures: SA-Enabled CNN with XGBoost, SA-Enabled CNN with LSTM, and SA-Enabled CNN with Random Forest. Each model extracts features at multiple scales, while self-attention mechanisms enhance feature integration and relevance. The weighted ensemble approach ensures that both prominent and subtle features contribute to the final classification, improving adaptability to evolving attack patterns and novel threats. The proposed method achieves a precision of 98.71%, an F1-score of 98.66%, a recall of 98.63%, and an accuracy of 98.69%, outperforming traditional methods and setting a new benchmark in DDoS attack detection. This innovative approach addresses critical limitations in current models and advances the state of the art in network security.</p>

<p>Abstract: Serialized output training (SOT) attracts increasing attention due to its convenience and flexibility for multi-speaker automatic speech recognition (ASR). However, it is not easy to train with attention loss only. In this paper, we propose the overlapped encoding separation (EncSep) to fully utilize the benefits of the connectionist temporal classification (CTC) and attention hybrid loss. This additional separator is inserted after the encoder to extract the multi-speaker information with CTC losses. Furthermore, we propose the serialized speech information guidance SOT (GEncSep) to further utilize the separated encodings. The separated streams are concatenated to provide single-speaker information to guide attention during decoding. The experimental results on LibriMix show that the single-speaker encoding can be separated from the overlapped encoding. The CTC loss helps to improve the encoder representation under complex scenarios. GEncSep further improved performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haobo Yang, Shiyan Zhang, Zhuoyi Yang, Xinyu Zhang, Li Wang, Yifan Tang, Jilong Guo, Jun Li</p>
<p>Abstract: With the increasing complexity of the traffic environment, the significance of safety perception in intelligent driving is intensifying. Traditional methods in the field of intelligent driving perception rely on deep learning, which suffers from limited interpretability, often described as a "black box." This paper introduces a novel type of loss function, termed "Entropy Loss," along with an innovative training strategy. Entropy Loss is formulated based on the functionality of feature compression networks within the perception model. Drawing inspiration from communication systems, the information transmission process in a feature compression network is expected to demonstrate steady changes in information volume and a continuous decrease in information entropy. By modeling network layer outputs as continuous random variables, we construct a probabilistic model that quantifies changes in information volume. Entropy Loss is then derived based on these expectations, guiding the update of network parameters to enhance network interpretability. Our experiments indicate that the Entropy Loss training strategy accelerates the training process. Utilizing the same 60 training epochs, the accuracy of 3D object detection models using Entropy Loss on the KITTI test set improved by up to 4.47\% compared to models without Entropy Loss, underscoring the method's efficacy.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Blair Yang, Fuyang Cui, Keiran Paster, Jimmy Ba, Pashootan Vaezipoor, Silviu Pitis, Michael R. Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid development and dynamic nature of large language models (LLMs) make it difficult for conventional quantitative benchmarks to accurately assess their capabilities. We propose report cards, which are human-interpretable, natural language summaries of model behavior for specific skills or topics. We develop a framework to evaluate report cards based on three criteria: specificity (ability to distinguish between models), faithfulness (accurate representation of model capabilities), and interpretability (clarity and relevance to humans). We also propose an iterative algorithm for generating report cards without human supervision and explore its efficacy by ablating various design choices. Through experimentation with popular LLMs, we demonstrate that report cards provide insights beyond traditional benchmarks and can help address the need for a more interpretable and holistic evaluation of LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: LLMs demonstrate an uncanny ability to process unstructured data, and as such, have the potential to go beyond search and run complex, semantic analyses at scale. We describe the design of an unstructured analytics system, Aryn, and the tenets and use cases that motivate its design. With Aryn, users can specify queries in natural language and the system automatically determines a semantic plan and executes it to compute an answer from a large collection of unstructured documents using LLMs. At the core of Aryn is Sycamore, a declarative document processing engine, built using Ray, that provides a reliable distributed abstraction called {\em DocSets}. Sycamore allows users to analyze, enrich, and transform complex documents at scale. Aryn also comprises Luna, a query planner that translates natural language queries to Sycamore scripts, and the Aryn Partitioner, which takes raw PDFs and document images, and converts them to DocSets for downstream processing. Using Aryn, we demonstrate a real world use case for analyzing accident reports from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), and discuss some of the major challenges we encountered in deploying Aryn in the wild.</p>

<p>Abstract: Node-based programming languages are increasingly popular in media arts coding domains. These languages are designed to be accessible to users with limited coding experience, allowing them to achieve creative output without an extensive programming background. Using LLM-based code generation to further lower the barrier to creative output is an exciting opportunity. However, the best strategy for code generation for visual node-based programming languages is still an open question. In particular, such languages have multiple levels of representation in text, each of which may be used for code generation. In this work, we explore the performance of LLM code generation in audio programming tasks in visual programming languages at multiple levels of representation. We explore code generation through metaprogramming code representations for these languages (i.e., coding the language using a different high-level text-based programming language), as well as through direct node generation with JSON. We evaluate code generated in this way for two visual languages for audio programming on a benchmark set of coding problems. We measure both correctness and complexity of the generated code. We find that metaprogramming results in more semantically correct generated code, given that the code is well-formed (i.e., is syntactically correct and runs). We also find that prompting for richer metaprogramming using randomness and loops led to more complex code.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zilin Huang, Zihao Sheng, Lei Shi, Sikai Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: In the field of autonomous driving, developing safe and trustworthy autonomous driving policies remains a significant challenge. Recently, Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) has attracted substantial attention due to its potential to enhance training safety and sampling efficiency. Nevertheless, existing RLHF-enabled methods often falter when faced with imperfect human demonstrations, potentially leading to training oscillations or even worse performance than rule-based approaches. Inspired by the human learning process, we propose Physics-enhanced Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (PE-RLHF). This novel framework synergistically integrates human feedback (e.g., human intervention and demonstration) and physics knowledge (e.g., traffic flow model) into the training loop of reinforcement learning. The key advantage of PE-RLHF is its guarantee that the learned policy will perform at least as well as the given physics-based policy, even when human feedback quality deteriorates, thus ensuring trustworthy safety improvements. PE-RLHF introduces a Physics-enhanced Human-AI (PE-HAI) collaborative paradigm for dynamic action selection between human and physics-based actions, employs a reward-free approach with a proxy value function to capture human preferences, and incorporates a minimal intervention mechanism to reduce the cognitive load on human mentors. Extensive experiments across diverse driving scenarios demonstrate that PE-RLHF significantly outperforms traditional methods, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in safety, efficiency, and generalizability, even with varying quality of human feedback. The philosophy behind PE-RLHF not only advances autonomous driving technology but can also offer valuable insights for other safety-critical domains.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Derian Boer, Fabian Koch, Stefan Kramer</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently lack domain-specific knowledge and even fine-tuned models tend to hallucinate. Hence, more reliable models that can include external knowledge are needed. We present a pipeline, 4StepFocus, and specifically a preprocessing step, that can substantially improve the answers of LLMs. This is achieved by providing guided access to external knowledge making use of the model's ability to capture relational context and conduct rudimentary reasoning by themselves. The method narrows down potentially correct answers by triplets-based searches in a semi-structured knowledge base in a direct, traceable fashion, before switching to latent representations for ranking those candidates based on unstructured data. This distinguishes it from related methods that are purely based on latent representations. 4StepFocus consists of the steps: 1) Triplet generation for extraction of relational data by an LLM, 2) substitution of variables in those triplets to narrow down answer candidates employing a knowledge graph, 3) sorting remaining candidates with a vector similarity search involving associated non-structured data, 4) reranking the best candidates by the LLM with background data provided. Experiments on a medical, a product recommendation, and an academic paper search test set demonstrate that this approach is indeed a powerful augmentation. It not only adds relevant traceable background information from information retrieval, but also improves performance considerably in comparison to state-of-the-art methods. This paper presents a novel, largely unexplored direction and therefore provides a wide range of future work opportunities.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sajib Acharjee Dip, Kazi Hasan Ibn Arif, Uddip Acharjee Shuvo, Ishtiaque Ahmed Khan, Na Meng</p>
<p>Abstract: In the realm of dermatology, the complexity of diagnosing skin conditions manually necessitates the expertise of dermatologists. Accurate identification of various skin ailments, ranging from cancer to inflammatory diseases, is paramount. However, existing artificial intelligence (AI) models in dermatology face challenges, particularly in accurately diagnosing diseases across diverse skin tones, with a notable performance gap in darker skin. Additionally, the scarcity of publicly available, unbiased datasets hampers the development of inclusive AI diagnostic tools. To tackle the challenges in accurately predicting skin conditions across diverse skin tones, we employ a transfer-learning approach that capitalizes on the rich, transferable knowledge from various image domains. Our method integrates multiple pre-trained models from a wide range of sources, including general and specific medical images, to improve the robustness and inclusiveness of the skin condition predictions. We rigorously evaluated the effectiveness of these models using the Diverse Dermatology Images (DDI) dataset, which uniquely encompasses both underrepresented and common skin tones, making it an ideal benchmark for assessing our approach. Among all methods, Med-ViT emerged as the top performer due to its comprehensive feature representation learned from diverse image sources. To further enhance performance, we conducted domain adaptation using additional skin image datasets such as HAM10000. This adaptation significantly improved model performance across all models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youngseog Chung, Dhruv Malik, Jeff Schneider, Yuanzhi Li, Aarti Singh</p>
<p>Abstract: The traditional viewpoint on Sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) models is that instead of training a single large expert, which is computationally expensive, we can train many small experts. The hope is that if the total parameter count of the small experts equals that of the singular large expert, then we retain the representation power of the large expert while gaining computational tractability and promoting expert specialization. The recently introduced Soft MoE replaces the Sparse MoE's discrete routing mechanism with a differentiable gating function that smoothly mixes tokens. While this smooth gating function successfully mitigates the various training instabilities associated with Sparse MoE, it is unclear whether it induces implicit biases that affect Soft MoE's representation power or potential for expert specialization. We prove that Soft MoE with a single arbitrarily powerful expert cannot represent simple convex functions. This justifies that Soft MoE's success cannot be explained by the traditional viewpoint of many small experts collectively mimicking the representation power of a single large expert, and that multiple experts are actually necessary to achieve good representation power (even for a fixed total parameter count). Continuing along this line of investigation, we introduce a notion of expert specialization for Soft MoE, and while varying the number of experts yet fixing the total parameter count, we consider the following (computationally intractable) task. Given any input, how can we discover the expert subset that is specialized to predict this input's label? We empirically show that when there are many small experts, the architecture is implicitly biased in a fashion that allows us to efficiently approximate the specialized expert subset. Our method can be easily implemented to potentially reduce computation during inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Atsushi Otsuka, Kazuya Matsuo, Ryo Ishii, Narichika Nomoto, Hiroaki Sugiyama</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper addresses user-specific dialogs. In contrast to previous research on personalized dialogue focused on achieving virtual user dialogue as defined by persona descriptions, user-specific dialogue aims to reproduce real-user dialogue beyond persona-based dialogue. Fine-tuning using the target user's dialogue history is an efficient learning method for a user-specific model. However, it is prone to overfitting and model destruction due to the small amount of data. Therefore, we propose a learning method for user-specific models by combining parameter-efficient fine-tuning with a pre-trained dialogue model that includes user profiles. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning adds a small number of parameters to the entire model, so even small amounts of training data can be trained efficiently and are robust to model destruction. In addition, the pre-trained model, which is learned by adding simple prompts for automatically inferred user profiles, can generate speech with enhanced knowledge of the user's profile, even when there is little training data during fine-tuning. In experiments, we compared the proposed model with large-language-model utterance generation using prompts containing users' personal information. Experiments reproducing real users' utterances revealed that the proposed model can generate utterances with higher reproducibility than the compared methods, even with a small model.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown significant potential to automate various software development tasks, including code completion, test generation, and bug fixing. However, the application of LLMs for automated bug fixing remains challenging due to the complexity and diversity of real-world software systems. In this paper, we introduce MarsCode Agent, a novel framework that leverages LLMs to automatically identify and repair bugs in software code. MarsCode Agent combines the power of LLMs with advanced code analysis techniques to accurately localize faults and generate patches. Our approach follows a systematic process of planning, bug reproduction, fault localization, candidate patch generation, and validation to ensure high-quality bug fixes. We evaluated MarsCode Agent on SWE-bench, a comprehensive benchmark of real-world software projects, and our results show that MarsCode Agent achieves a high success rate in bug fixing compared to most of the existing automated approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhanwen Liu, Chao Li, Yang Wang, Nan Yang, Xing Fan, Jiaqi Ma, Xiangmo Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Motion prediction plays an essential role in autonomous driving systems, enabling autonomous vehicles to achieve more accurate local-path planning and driving decisions based on predictions of the surrounding vehicles. However, existing methods neglect the potential missing values caused by object occlusion, perception failures, etc., which inevitably degrades the trajectory prediction performance in real traffic scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a novel end-to-end framework for incomplete vehicle trajectory prediction, named Multi-scale Temporal Fusion Transformer (MTFT), which consists of the Multi-scale Attention Head (MAH) and the Continuity Representation-guided Multi-scale Fusion (CRMF) module. Specifically, the MAH leverages the multi-head attention mechanism to parallelly capture multi-scale motion representation of trajectory from different temporal granularities, thus mitigating the adverse effect of missing values on prediction. Furthermore, the multi-scale motion representation is input into the CRMF module for multi-scale fusion to obtain the robust temporal feature of the vehicle. During the fusion process, the continuity representation of vehicle motion is first extracted across time steps to guide the fusion, ensuring that the resulting temporal feature incorporates both detailed information and the overall trend of vehicle motion, which facilitates the accurate decoding of future trajectory that is consistent with the vehicle's motion trend. We evaluate the proposed model on four datasets derived from highway and urban traffic scenarios. The experimental results demonstrate its superior performance in the incomplete vehicle trajectory prediction task compared with state-of-the-art models, e.g., a comprehensive performance improvement of more than 39% on the HighD dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chao Gu, Ke Lin, Yiyang Luo, Jiahui Hou, Xiang-Yang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: To accurately understand engineering drawings, it is essential to establish the correspondence between images and their description tables within the drawings. Existing document understanding methods predominantly focus on text as the main modality, which is not suitable for documents containing substantial image information. In the field of visual relation detection, the structure of the task inherently limits its capacity to assess relationships among all entity pairs in the drawings. To address this issue, we propose a vision-based relation detection model, named ViRED, to identify the associations between tables and circuits in electrical engineering drawings. Our model mainly consists of three parts: a vision encoder, an object encoder, and a relation decoder. We implement ViRED using PyTorch to evaluate its performance. To validate the efficacy of ViRED, we conduct a series of experiments. The experimental results indicate that, within the engineering drawing dataset, our approach attained an accuracy of 96\% in the task of relation prediction, marking a substantial improvement over existing methodologies. The results also show that ViRED can inference at a fast speed even when there are numerous objects in a single engineering drawing.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose a novel symbolic music representation and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework specially designed for symbolic multitrack music generation. The main theme of symbolic music generation primarily encompasses the preprocessing of music data and the implementation of a deep learning framework. Current techniques dedicated to symbolic music generation generally encounter two significant challenges: training data's lack of information about chords and scales and the requirement of specially designed model architecture adapted to the unique format of symbolic music representation. In this paper, we solve the above problems by introducing new symbolic music representation with MusicLang chord analysis model. We propose our MMT-BERT architecture adapting to the representation. To build a robust multitrack music generator, we fine-tune a pre-trained MusicBERT model to serve as the discriminator, and incorporate relativistic standard loss. This approach, supported by the in-depth understanding of symbolic music encoded within MusicBERT, fortifies the consonance and humanity of music generated by our method. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach which strictly follows the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Function calling significantly extends the application boundary of large language models, where high-quality and diverse training data is critical for unlocking this capability. However, real function-calling data is quite challenging to collect and annotate, while synthetic data generated by existing pipelines tends to lack coverage and accuracy. In this paper, we present ToolACE, an automatic agentic pipeline designed to generate accurate, complex, and diverse tool-learning data. ToolACE leverages a novel self-evolution synthesis process to curate a comprehensive API pool of 26,507 diverse APIs. Dialogs are further generated through the interplay among multiple agents, guided by a formalized thinking process. To ensure data accuracy, we implement a dual-layer verification system combining rule-based and model-based checks. We demonstrate that models trained on our synthesized data, even with only 8B parameters, achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard, rivaling the latest GPT-4 models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrew Blinn, Xiang Li, June Hyung Kim, Cyrus Omar</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have reshaped the landscape of program synthesis. However, contemporary LLM-based code completion systems often hallucinate broken code because they lack appropriate context, particularly when working with definitions not in the training data nor near the cursor. This paper demonstrates that tight integration with the type and binding structure of a language, as exposed by its language server, can address this contextualization problem in a token-efficient manner. In short, we contend that AIs need IDEs, too! In particular, we integrate LLM code generation into the Hazel live program sketching environment. The Hazel Language Server identifies the type and typing context of the hole being filled, even in the presence of errors, ensuring that a meaningful program sketch is always available. This allows prompting with codebase-wide contextual information not lexically local to the cursor, nor necessarily in the same file, but that is likely to be semantically local to the developer's goal. Completions synthesized by the LLM are then iteratively refined via further dialog with the language server. To evaluate these techniques, we introduce MVUBench, a dataset of model-view-update (MVU) web applications. These applications serve as challenge problems due to their reliance on application-specific data structures. We find that contextualization with type definitions is particularly impactful. After introducing our ideas in the context of Hazel we duplicate our techniques and port MVUBench to TypeScript in order to validate the applicability of these methods to higher-resource languages. Finally, we outline ChatLSP, a conservative extension to the Language Server Protocol (LSP) that language servers can implement to expose capabilities that AI code completion systems of various designs can use to incorporate static context when generating prompts for an LLM.</p>

<p>Abstract: Sensitive information detection is crucial in content moderation to maintain safe online communities. Assisting in this traditionally manual process could relieve human moderators from overwhelming and tedious tasks, allowing them to focus solely on flagged content that may pose potential risks. Rapidly advancing large language models (LLMs) are known for their capability to understand and process natural language and so present a potential solution to support this process. This study explores the capabilities of five LLMs for detecting sensitive messages in the mental well-being domain within two online datasets and assesses their performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, F1 scores, and consistency. Our findings indicate that LLMs have the potential to be integrated into the moderation workflow as a convenient and precise detection tool. The best-performing model, GPT-4o, achieved an average accuracy of 99.5\% and an F1-score of 0.99. We discuss the advantages and potential challenges of using LLMs in the moderation workflow and suggest that future research should address the ethical considerations of utilising this technology.</p>

<p>Abstract: XNet introduces a wavelet-based X-shaped unified architecture for fully- and semi-supervised biomedical segmentation. So far, however, XNet still faces the limitations, including performance degradation when images lack high-frequency (HF) information, underutilization of raw images and insufficient fusion. To address these issues, we propose XNet v2, a low- and high-frequency complementary model. XNet v2 performs wavelet-based image-level complementary fusion, using fusion results along with raw images inputs three different sub-networks to construct consistency loss. Furthermore, we introduce a feature-level fusion module to enhance the transfer of low-frequency (LF) information and HF information. XNet v2 achieves state-of-the-art in semi-supervised segmentation while maintaining competitve results in fully-supervised learning. More importantly, XNet v2 excels in scenarios where XNet fails. Compared to XNet, XNet v2 exhibits fewer limitations, better results and greater universality. Extensive experiments on three 2D and two 3D datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of XNet v2.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zoey Chen, Zhao Mandi, Homanga Bharadhwaj, Mohit Sharma, Shuran Song, Abhishek Gupta, Vikash Kumar</p>
<p>Abstract: Generalization to unseen real-world scenarios for robot manipulation requires exposure to diverse datasets during training. However, collecting large real-world datasets is intractable due to high operational costs. For robot learning to generalize despite these challenges, it is essential to leverage sources of data or priors beyond the robot's direct experience. In this work, we posit that image-text generative models, which are pre-trained on large corpora of web-scraped data, can serve as such a data source. These generative models encompass a broad range of real-world scenarios beyond a robot's direct experience and can synthesize novel synthetic experiences that expose robotic agents to additional world priors aiding real-world generalization at no extra cost.
  In particular, our approach leverages pre-trained generative models as an effective tool for data augmentation. We propose a generative augmentation framework for semantically controllable augmentations and rapidly multiplying robot datasets while inducing rich variations that enable real-world generalization. Based on diverse augmentations of robot data, we show how scalable robot manipulation policies can be trained and deployed both in simulation and in unseen real-world environments such as kitchens and table-tops. By demonstrating the effectiveness of image-text generative models in diverse real-world robotic applications, our generative augmentation framework provides a scalable and efficient path for boosting generalization in robot learning at no extra human cost.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongpei Li, Han Zhang, Ziyan He, Yunkai Jia, Bo Jiang, Xiang Huang, Dongdong Ge</p>
<p>Abstract: The Integrated Process Planning and Scheduling (IPPS) problem combines process route planning and shop scheduling to achieve high efficiency in manufacturing and maximize resource utilization, which is crucial for modern manufacturing systems. Traditional methods using Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) and heuristic algorithms can not well balance solution quality and speed when solving IPPS. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) method. We model the IPPS problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and employ a Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (GNN) to capture the complex relationships among operations, machines, and jobs. To optimize the scheduling strategy, we use Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Experimental results show that, compared to traditional methods, our approach significantly improves solution efficiency and quality in large-scale IPPS instances, providing superior scheduling strategies for modern intelligent manufacturing systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Riccardo Taiello, Sergen Cansiz, Marc Vesin, Francesco Cremonesi, Lucia Innocenti, Melek \"Onen, Marco Lorenzi</p>
<p>Abstract: Deploying federated learning (FL) in real-world scenarios, particularly in healthcare, poses challenges in communication and security. In particular, with respect to the federated aggregation procedure, researchers have been focusing on the study of secure aggregation (SA) schemes to provide privacy guarantees over the model's parameters transmitted by the clients. Nevertheless, the practical availability of SA in currently available FL frameworks is currently limited, due to computational and communication bottlenecks. To fill this gap, this study explores the implementation of SA within the open-source Fed-BioMed framework. We implement and compare two SA protocols, Joye-Libert (JL) and Low Overhead Masking (LOM), by providing extensive benchmarks in a panel of healthcare data analysis problems. Our theoretical and experimental evaluations on four datasets demonstrate that SA protocols effectively protect privacy while maintaining task accuracy. Computational overhead during training is less than 1% on a CPU and less than 50% on a GPU for large models, with protection phases taking less than 10 seconds. Incorporating SA into Fed-BioMed impacts task accuracy by no more than 2% compared to non-SA scenarios. Overall this study demonstrates the feasibility of SA in real-world healthcare applications and contributes in reducing the gap towards the adoption of privacy-preserving technologies in sensitive applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Priyanka Chudasama, Anil Surisetty, Aakarsh Malhotra, Alok Singh</p>
<p>Abstract: Classification tasks present challenges due to class imbalances and evolving data distributions. Addressing these issues requires a robust method to handle imbalances while effectively detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples not encountered during training. This study introduces a novel OOD detection algorithm designed for tabular datasets, titled \textit{\textbf{D}eep \textbf{N}eural \textbf{N}etwork-based \textbf{G}aussian \textbf{D}escriptor for \textbf{I}mbalanced \textbf{T}abular \textbf{D}ata} (\textbf{DNN-GDITD}). The DNN-GDITD algorithm can be placed on top of any DNN to facilitate better classification of imbalanced data and OOD detection using spherical decision boundaries. Using a combination of Push, Score-based, and focal losses, DNN-GDITD assigns confidence scores to test data points, categorizing them as known classes or as an OOD sample. Extensive experimentation on tabular datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of DNN-GDITD compared to three OOD algorithms. Evaluation encompasses imbalanced and balanced scenarios on diverse tabular datasets, including a synthetic financial dispute dataset and publicly available tabular datasets like Gas Sensor, Drive Diagnosis, and MNIST, showcasing DNN-GDITD's versatility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaobin Lu, Xiaobin Hu, Jun Luo, Ben Zhu, Yaping Ruan, Wenqi Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: Blind face restoration endeavors to restore a clear face image from a degraded counterpart. Recent approaches employing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) as priors have demonstrated remarkable success in this field. However, these methods encounter challenges in achieving a balance between realism and fidelity, particularly in complex degradation scenarios. To inherit the exceptional realism generative ability of the diffusion model and also constrained by the identity-aware fidelity, we propose a novel diffusion-based framework by embedding the 3D facial priors as structure and identity constraints into a denoising diffusion process. Specifically, in order to obtain more accurate 3D prior representations, the 3D facial image is reconstructed by a 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) using an initial restored face image that has been processed by a pretrained restoration network. A customized multi-level feature extraction method is employed to exploit both structural and identity information of 3D facial images, which are then mapped into the noise estimation process. In order to enhance the fusion of identity information into the noise estimation, we propose a Time-Aware Fusion Block (TAFB). This module offers a more efficient and adaptive fusion of weights for denoising, considering the dynamic nature of the denoising process in the diffusion model, which involves initial structure refinement followed by texture detail enhancement.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our network performs favorably against state-of-the-art algorithms on synthetic and real-world datasets for blind face restoration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mevan Ekanayake, Zhifeng Chen, Gary Egan, Mehrtash Harandi, Zhaolin Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have recently advanced the field of deep learning due to their ability to learn continuous representations of signals without the need for large training datasets. Although INR methods have been studied for medical image super-resolution, their adaptability to localized priors in medical images has not been extensively explored. Medical images contain rich anatomical divisions that could provide valuable local prior information to enhance the accuracy and robustness of INRs. In this work, we propose a novel framework, referred to as the Semantically Conditioned INR (SeCo-INR), that conditions an INR using local priors from a medical image, enabling accurate model fitting and interpolation capabilities to achieve super-resolution. Our framework learns a continuous representation of the semantic segmentation features of a medical image and utilizes it to derive the optimal INR for each semantic region of the image. We tested our framework using several medical imaging modalities and achieved higher quantitative scores and more realistic super-resolution outputs compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaojie Xu, Tianshuo Xu, Fulong Ma, Yingcong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: We explore Bird's-Eye View (BEV) generation, converting a BEV map into its corresponding multi-view street images. Valued for its unified spatial representation aiding multi-sensor fusion, BEV is pivotal for various autonomous driving applications. Creating accurate street-view images from BEV maps is essential for portraying complex traffic scenarios and enhancing driving algorithms. Concurrently, diffusion-based conditional image generation models have demonstrated remarkable outcomes, adept at producing diverse, high-quality, and condition-aligned results. Nonetheless, the training of these models demands substantial data and computational resources. Hence, exploring methods to fine-tune these advanced models, like Stable Diffusion, for specific conditional generation tasks emerges as a promising avenue. In this paper, we introduce a practical framework for generating images from a BEV layout. Our approach comprises two main components: the Neural View Transformation and the Street Image Generation. The Neural View Transformation phase converts the BEV map into aligned multi-view semantic segmentation maps by learning the shape correspondence between the BEV and perspective views. Subsequently, the Street Image Generation phase utilizes these segmentations as a condition to guide a fine-tuned latent diffusion model. This finetuning process ensures both view and style consistency. Our model leverages the generative capacity of large pretrained diffusion models within traffic contexts, effectively yielding diverse and condition-coherent street view images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Xiang Tan, Malika Meghjani</p>
<p>Abstract: GPS-based vehicle localization and tracking suffers from unstable positional information commonly experienced in tunnel segments and in dense urban areas. Also, both Visual Odometry (VO) and Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO) are susceptible to adverse weather conditions that causes occlusions or blur on the visual input. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for vehicle localization that uses street network based map information to correct drifting odometry estimates and intermittent GPS measurements especially, in adversarial scenarios such as driving in rain and tunnels. Specifically, our approach is a flexible fusion algorithm that integrates intermittent GPS, drifting IMU and VO estimates together with 2D map information for robust vehicle localization and tracking. We refer to our approach as Map-Fusion. We robustly evaluate our proposed approach on four geographically diverse datasets from different countries ranging across clear and rain weather conditions. These datasets also include challenging visual segments in tunnels and underpasses. We show that with the integration of the map information, our Map-Fusion algorithm reduces the error of the state-of-the-art VO and VIO approaches across all datasets. We also validate our proposed algorithm in a real-world environment and in real-time on a hardware constrained mobile robot. Map-Fusion achieved 2.46m error in clear weather and 6.05m error in rain weather for a 150m route.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Varun Prakash Rajamohan, Senthil Kumar Jagatheesaperumal</p>
<p>Abstract: Robots find extensive applications in industry. In recent years, the influence of robots has also increased rapidly in domestic scenarios. The Q-learning algorithm aims to maximise the reward for reaching the goal. This paper proposes a modified version of the Q-learning algorithm, known as Q-learning with scaled distance metric (Q-SD). This algorithm enhances task learning and makes task completion more meaningful. A robotic manipulator (agent) applies the Q-SD algorithm to the task of table cleaning. Using Q-SD, the agent acquires the sequence of steps necessary to accomplish the task while minimising the manipulator's movement distance. We partition the table into grids of different dimensions. The first has a grid count of 3 times 3, and the second has a grid count of 4 times 4. Using the Q-SD algorithm, the maximum success obtained in these two environments was 86% and 59% respectively. Moreover, Compared to the conventional Q-learning algorithm, the drop in average distance moved by the agent in these two environments using the Q-SD algorithm was 8.61% and 6.7% respectively.</p>

<p>Abstract: At the intersection of creative text generation and literary theory, this study explores the role of literary metaphor and its capacity to generate a range of meanings. In this regard, literary metaphor is vital to the development of any particular language. To investigate whether the inclusion of original figurative language improves textual quality, we trained an LSTM-based language model in Afrikaans. The network produces phrases containing compellingly novel figures of speech. Specifically, the emphasis falls on how AI might be utilised as a defamiliarisation technique, which disrupts expected uses of language to augment poetic expression. Providing a literary perspective on text generation, the paper raises thought-provoking questions on aesthetic value, interpretation and evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuqi Liu, Wenqian Zhang, Sihan Ren, Chengyu Huang, Jingyi Yu, Lan Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Sign languages, used by around 70 million Deaf individuals globally, are visual languages that convey visual and contextual information. Current methods in vision-based sign language recognition (SLR) and translation (SLT) struggle with dialogue scenes due to limited dataset diversity and the neglect of contextually relevant information. To address these challenges, we introduce SCOPE (Sign language Contextual Processing with Embedding from LLMs), a novel context-aware vision-based SLR and SLT framework. For SLR, we utilize dialogue contexts through a multi-modal encoder to enhance gloss-level recognition. For subsequent SLT, we further fine-tune a Large Language Model (LLM) by incorporating prior conversational context. We also contribute a new sign language dataset that contains 72 hours of Chinese sign language videos in contextual dialogues across various scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our SCOPE framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets, including Phoenix-2014T, CSL-Daily, and our SCOPE dataset. Moreover, surveys conducted with participants from the Deaf community further validate the robustness and effectiveness of our approach in real-world applications. Both our dataset and code will be open-sourced to facilitate further research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dingshuo Chen, Zhixun Li, Yuyan Ni, Guibin Zhang, Ding Wang, Qiang Liu, Shu Wu, Jeffrey Xu Yu, Liang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: With the emergence of various molecular tasks and massive datasets, how to perform efficient training has become an urgent yet under-explored issue in the area. Data pruning (DP), as an oft-stated approach to saving training burdens, filters out less influential samples to form a coreset for training. However, the increasing reliance on pretrained models for molecular tasks renders traditional in-domain DP methods incompatible. Therefore, we propose a Molecular data Pruning framework for enhanced Generalization (MolPeg), which focuses on the source-free data pruning scenario, where data pruning is applied with pretrained models. By maintaining two models with different updating paces during training, we introduce a novel scoring function to measure the informativeness of samples based on the loss discrepancy. As a plug-and-play framework, MolPeg realizes the perception of both source and target domain and consistently outperforms existing DP methods across four downstream tasks. Remarkably, it can surpass the performance obtained from full-dataset training, even when pruning up to 60-70% of the data on HIV and PCBA dataset. Our work suggests that the discovery of effective data-pruning metrics could provide a viable path to both enhanced efficiency and superior generalization in transfer learning.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present a framework for assistive robot manipulation, which focuses on two fundamental challenges: first, efficiently adapting large-scale models to downstream scene affordance understanding tasks, especially in daily living scenarios where gathering multi-task data involving humans requires strenuous effort; second, effectively learning robot trajectories by grounding the visual affordance model. We tackle the first challenge by employing a parameter-efficient prompt tuning method that prepends learnable text prompts to the frozen vision model to predict manipulation affordances in multi-task scenarios. Then we propose to learn robot trajectories guided by affordances in a supervised Flow Matching method. Flow matching represents a robot visuomotor policy as a conditional process of flowing random waypoints to desired robot trajectories. Finally, we introduce a real-world dataset with 10 tasks across Activities of Daily Living to test our framework. Our extensive evaluation highlights that the proposed prompt tuning method for learning manipulation affordance with language prompter achieves competitive performance and even outperforms other finetuning protocols across data scales, while satisfying parameter efficiency. Learning multi-task robot trajectories with a single flow matching policy also leads to consistently better performance than alternative behavior cloning methods, especially given multimodal robot action distributions. Our framework seamlessly unifies affordance model learning and trajectory generation with flow matching for robot manipulation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaolong Wang, Zhi-Qi Cheng, Jue Wang, Xiaojiang Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: Fashion image editing is a crucial tool for designers to convey their creative ideas by visualizing design concepts interactively. Current fashion image editing techniques, though advanced with multimodal prompts and powerful diffusion models, often struggle to accurately identify editing regions and preserve the desired garment texture detail. To address these challenges, we introduce a new multimodal fashion image editing architecture based on latent diffusion models, called Detail-Preserved Diffusion Models (DPDEdit). DPDEdit guides the fashion image generation of diffusion models by integrating text prompts, region masks, human pose images, and garment texture images. To precisely locate the editing region, we first introduce Grounded-SAM to predict the editing region based on the user's textual description, and then combine it with other conditions to perform local editing. To transfer the detail of the given garment texture into the target fashion image, we propose a texture injection and refinement mechanism. Specifically, this mechanism employs a decoupled cross-attention layer to integrate textual descriptions and texture images, and incorporates an auxiliary U-Net to preserve the high-frequency details of generated garment texture. Additionally, we extend the VITON-HD dataset using a multimodal large language model to generate paired samples with texture images and textual descriptions. Extensive experiments show that our DPDEdit outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of image fidelity and coherence with the given multimodal inputs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Keyphrase Prediction (KP) is essential for identifying keyphrases in a document that can summarize its content. However, recent Natural Language Processing (NLP) advances have developed more efficient KP models using deep learning techniques. The limitation of a comprehensive exploration jointly both keyphrase extraction and generation using pre-trained language models spotlights a critical gap in the literature, compelling our survey paper to bridge this deficiency and offer a unified and in-depth analysis to address limitations in previous surveys. This paper extensively examines the topic of pre-trained language models for keyphrase prediction (PLM-KP), which are trained on large text corpora via different learning (supervisor, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and self-supervised) techniques, to provide respective insights into these two types of tasks in NLP, precisely, Keyphrase Extraction (KPE) and Keyphrase Generation (KPG). We introduce appropriate taxonomies for PLM-KPE and KPG to highlight these two main tasks of NLP. Moreover, we point out some promising future directions for predicting keyphrases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenshuai Liu, Yaru Fu, Yongna Guo, Fu Lee Wang, Wen Sun, Yan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Digital twins (DTs) have emerged as a promising enabler for representing the real-time states of physical worlds and realizing self-sustaining systems. In practice, DTs of physical devices, such as mobile users (MUs), are commonly deployed in multi-access edge computing (MEC) networks for the sake of reducing latency. To ensure the accuracy and fidelity of DTs, it is essential for MUs to regularly synchronize their status with their DTs. However, MU mobility introduces significant challenges to DT synchronization. Firstly, MU mobility triggers DT migration which could cause synchronization failures. Secondly, MUs require frequent synchronization with their DTs to ensure DT fidelity. Nonetheless, DT migration among MEC servers, caused by MU mobility, may occur infrequently. Accordingly, we propose a two-timescale DT synchronization and migration framework with reliability consideration by establishing a non-convex stochastic problem to minimize the long-term average energy consumption of MUs. We use Lyapunov theory to convert the reliability constraints and reformulate the new problem as a partially observable Markov decision-making process (POMDP). Furthermore, we develop a heterogeneous agent proximal policy optimization with Beta distribution (Beta-HAPPO) method to solve it. Numerical results show that our proposed Beta-HAPPO method achieves significant improvements in energy savings when compared with other benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate real-time object detection enhances the safety of advanced driver-assistance systems, making it an essential component in driving scenarios. With the rapid development of deep learning technology, CNN-based YOLO real-time object detectors have gained significant attention. However, the local focus of CNNs results in performance bottlenecks. To further enhance detector performance, researchers have introduced Transformer-based self-attention mechanisms to leverage global receptive fields, but their quadratic complexity incurs substantial computational costs. Recently, Mamba, with its linear complexity, has made significant progress through global selective scanning. Inspired by Mamba's outstanding performance, we propose a novel object detector: DS MYOLO. This detector captures global feature information through a simplified selective scanning fusion block (SimVSS Block) and effectively integrates the network's deep features. Additionally, we introduce an efficient channel attention convolution (ECAConv) that enhances cross-channel feature interaction while maintaining low computational complexity. Extensive experiments on the CCTSDB 2021 and VLD-45 driving scenarios datasets demonstrate that DS MYOLO exhibits significant potential and competitive advantage among similarly scaled YOLO series real-time object detectors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jin Song, Ming Zhong, George Em Karniadakis, Zhenya Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a new two-stage initial-value iterative neural network (IINN) algorithm for solitary wave computations of nonlinear wave equations based on traditional numerical iterative methods and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). Specifically, the IINN framework consists of two subnetworks, one of which is used to fit a given initial value, and the other incorporates physical information and continues training on the basis of the first subnetwork. Importantly, the IINN method does not require any additional data information including boundary conditions, apart from the given initial value. Corresponding theoretical guarantees are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our IINN method. The proposed IINN method is efficiently applied to learn some types of solutions in different nonlinear wave equations, including the one-dimensional (1D) nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations (NLS) equation (with and without potentials), the 1D saturable NLS equation with PT -symmetric optical lattices, the 1D focusing-defocusing coupled NLS equations, the KdV equation, the two-dimensional (2D) NLS equation with potentials, the 2D amended GP equation with a potential, the (2+1)-dimensional KP equation, and the 3D NLS equation with a potential. These applications serve as evidence for the efficacy of our method. Finally, by comparing with the traditional methods, we demonstrate the advantages of the proposed IINN method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhongyi Xia, Tianzhao Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Monocular depth estimation is a critical function in computer vision applications. This paper shows that large language models (LLMs) can effectively interpret depth with minimal supervision, using efficient resource utilization and a consistent neural network architecture. We introduce LLM-MDE, a multimodal framework that deciphers depth through language comprehension. Specifically, LLM-MDE employs two main strategies to enhance the pretrained LLM's capability for depth estimation: cross-modal reprogramming and an adaptive prompt estimation module. These strategies align vision representations with text prototypes and automatically generate prompts based on monocular images, respectively. Comprehensive experiments on real-world MDE datasets confirm the effectiveness and superiority of LLM-MDE, which excels in few-/zero-shot tasks while minimizing resource use. The source code is available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> M. Badouch, M. Boutaounte</p>
<p>Abstract: In e-commerce, web mining for page recommendations is widely used but often fails to meet user needs. To address this, we propose a novel solution combining semantic web mining with BP neural networks. We process user search logs to extract five key features: content priority, time spent, user feedback, recommendation semantics, and input deviation. These features are then fed into a BP neural network to classify and prioritize web pages. The prioritized pages are recommended to users. Using book sales pages for testing, our results demonstrate that this solution can quickly and accurately identify the pages users need. Our approach ensures that recommendations are more relevant and tailored to individual preferences, enhancing the online shopping experience. By leveraging advanced semantic analysis and neural network techniques, we bridge the gap between user expectations and actual recommendations. This innovative method not only improves accuracy but also speeds up the recommendation process, making it a valuable tool for e-commerce platforms aiming to boost user satisfaction and engagement. Additionally, our system ability to handle large datasets and provide real-time recommendations makes it a scalable and efficient solution for modern e-commerce challenges.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tuong Vy Nguyen, Johannes Hoster, Alexander Glaser, Kristian Hildebrand, Felix Biessmann</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative deep learning architectures can produce realistic, high-resolution fake imagery -- with potentially drastic societal implications. A key question in this context is: How easy is it to generate realistic imagery, in particular for niche domains. The iterative process required to achieve specific image content is difficult to automate and control. Especially for rare classes, it remains difficult to assess fidelity, meaning whether generative approaches produce realistic imagery and alignment, meaning how (well) the generation can be guided by human input. In this work, we present a large-scale empirical evaluation of generative architectures which we fine-tuned to generate synthetic satellite imagery. We focus on nuclear power plants as an example of a rare object category - as there are only around 400 facilities worldwide, this restriction is exemplary for many other scenarios in which training and test data is limited by the restricted number of occurrences of real-world examples. We generate synthetic imagery by conditioning on two kinds of modalities, textual input and image input obtained from a game engine that allows for detailed specification of the building layout. The generated images are assessed by commonly used metrics for automatic evaluation and then compared with human judgement from our conducted user studies to assess their trustworthiness. Our results demonstrate that even for rare objects, generation of authentic synthetic satellite imagery with textual or detailed building layouts is feasible. In line with previous work, we find that automated metrics are often not aligned with human perception -- in fact, we find strong negative correlations between commonly used image quality metrics and human ratings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoran Yang, Xiangyu Zhao, Sirui Huang, Qing Li, Guandong Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) is a potent paradigm for self-supervised graph learning that has attracted attention across various application scenarios. However, GCL for learning on Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs) has yet to be explored. Because conventional augmentation techniques like feature embedding masking cannot directly process textual attributes on TAGs. A naive strategy for applying GCL to TAGs is to encode the textual attributes into feature embeddings via a language model and then feed the embeddings into the following GCL module for processing. Such a strategy faces three key challenges: I) failure to avoid information loss, II) semantic loss during the text encoding phase, and III) implicit augmentation constraints that lead to uncontrollable and incomprehensible results. In this paper, we propose a novel GCL framework named LATEX-GCL to utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce textual augmentations and LLMs' powerful natural language processing (NLP) abilities to address the three limitations aforementioned to pave the way for applying GCL to TAG tasks. Extensive experiments on four high-quality TAG datasets illustrate the superiority of the proposed LATEX-GCL method.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingyuan Yao, Yukang Huo, Qingbin Tian, Jiayin Zhao, Xiao Liu, Ruifeng Wang, Haihua Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Growth, abnormal behavior, and diseases of fish can be early detected by monitoring fish tracking through the method of image processing, which is of great significance for factory aquaculture. However, underwater reflections and some reasons with fish, such as the high similarity , rapid swimming caused by stimuli and multi-object occlusion bring challenges to multi-target tracking of fish. To address these challenges, this paper establishes a complex multi-scene sturgeon tracking dataset and proposes a real-time end-to-end fish tracking model, FMRFT. In this model, the Mamba In Mamba (MIM) architecture with low memory consumption is introduced into the tracking algorithm to realize multi-frame video timing memory and fast feature extraction, which improves the efficiency of correlation analysis for contiguous frames in multi-fish video. Additionally, the superior feature interaction and a priori frame processing capabilities of RT-DETR are leveraged to provide an effective tracking algorithm. By incorporating the QTSI query interaction processing module, the model effectively handles occluded objects and redundant tracking frames, resulting in more accurate and stable fish tracking. Trained and tested on the dataset, the model achieves an IDF1 score of 90.3% and a MOTA accuracy of 94.3%. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed FMRFT model effectively addresses the challenges of high similarity and mutual occlusion in fish populations, enabling accurate tracking in factory farming environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrija Djurisic, Rosanne Liu, Mladen Nikolic</p>
<p>Abstract: The safe deployment of machine learning and AI models in open-world settings hinges critically on the ability to detect out-of-distribution (OOD) data accurately, data samples that contrast vastly from what the model was trained with. Current approaches to OOD detection often require further training the model, and/or statistics about the training data which may no longer be accessible. Additionally, many existing OOD detection methods struggle to maintain performance when transferred across different architectures. Our research tackles these issues by proposing a simple, post-hoc method that does not require access to the training data distribution, keeps a trained network intact, and holds strong performance across a variety of architectures. Our method, Logit Scaling (LTS), as the name suggests, simply scales the logits in a manner that effectively distinguishes between in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples. We tested our method on benchmarks across various scales, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet and OpenOOD. The experiments cover 3 ID and 14 OOD datasets, as well as 9 model architectures. Overall, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, robustness and adaptability across different architectures, paving the way towards a universally applicable solution for advanced OOD detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luoyu Mei, Shuai Wang, Yun Cheng, Ruofeng Liu, Zhimeng Yin, Wenchao Jiang, Shuai Wang, Wei Gong</p>
<p>Abstract: Semantic recognition is pivotal in virtual reality (VR) applications, enabling immersive and interactive experiences. A promising approach is utilizing millimeter-wave (mmWave) signals to generate point clouds. However, the high computational and memory demands of current mmWave point cloud models hinder their efficiency and reliability. To address this limitation, our paper introduces ESP-PCT, a novel Enhanced Semantic Performance Point Cloud Transformer with a two-stage semantic recognition framework tailored for VR applications. ESP-PCT takes advantage of the accuracy of sensory point cloud data and optimizes the semantic recognition process, where the localization and focus stages are trained jointly in an end-to-end manner. We evaluate ESP-PCT on various VR semantic recognition conditions, demonstrating substantial enhancements in recognition efficiency. Notably, ESP-PCT achieves a remarkable accuracy of 93.2% while reducing the computational requirements (FLOPs) by 76.9% and memory usage by 78.2% compared to the existing Point Transformer model simultaneously. These underscore ESP-PCT's potential in VR semantic recognition by achieving high accuracy and reducing redundancy.

<p>Abstract: The underlying framework for controlling autonomous robots and complex automation applications are Operating Systems (OS) capable of scheduling perception-and-control tasks, as well as providing real-time data communication to other robotic peers and remote cloud computers. In this paper, we introduce CyberCortex.AI, a robotics OS designed to enable heterogeneous AI-based robotics and complex automation applications. CyberCortex.AI is a decentralized distributed OS which enables robots to talk to each other, as well as to High Performance Computers (HPC) in the cloud. Sensory and control data from the robots is streamed towards HPC systems with the purpose of training AI algorithms, which are afterwards deployed on the robots. Each functionality of a robot (e.g. sensory data acquisition, path planning, motion control, etc.) is executed within a so-called DataBlock of Filters shared through the internet, where each filter is computed either locally on the robot itself, or remotely on a different robotic system. The data is stored and accessed via a so-called \textit{Temporal Addressable Memory} (TAM), which acts as a gateway between each filter's input and output. CyberCortex.AI has two main components: i) the CyberCortex.AI.inference system, which is a real-time implementation of the DataBlock running on the robots' embedded hardware, and ii) the CyberCortex.AI.dojo, which runs on an HPC computer in the cloud, and it is used to design, train and deploy AI algorithms. We present a quantitative and qualitative performance analysis of the proposed approach using two collaborative robotics applications: \textit{i}) a forest fires prevention system based on an Unitree A1 legged robot and an Anafi Parrot 4K drone, as well as \textit{ii}) an autonomous driving system which uses CyberCortex.AI for collaborative perception and motion control.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Eckel, Baohe Zhang, Joschka B\"odecker</p>
<p>Abstract: Safe reinforcement learning (SafeRL) extends standard reinforcement learning with the idea of safety, where safety is typically defined through the constraint of the expected cost return of a trajectory being below a set limit. However, this metric fails to distinguish how costs accrue, treating infrequent severe cost events as equal to frequent mild ones, which can lead to riskier behaviors and result in unsafe exploration. We introduce a new metric, expected maximum consecutive cost steps (EMCC), which addresses safety during training by assessing the severity of unsafe steps based on their consecutive occurrence. This metric is particularly effective for distinguishing between prolonged and occasional safety violations. We apply EMMC in both on- and off-policy algorithm for benchmarking their safe exploration capability. Finally, we validate our metric through a set of benchmarks and propose a new lightweight benchmark task, which allows fast evaluation for algorithm design.</p>

<p>Abstract: The primary goal of traffic accident anticipation is to foresee potential accidents in real time using dashcam videos, a task that is pivotal for enhancing the safety and reliability of autonomous driving technologies. In this study, we introduce an innovative framework, AccNet, which significantly advances the prediction capabilities beyond the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) 2D-based methods by incorporating monocular depth cues for sophisticated 3D scene modeling. Addressing the prevalent challenge of skewed data distribution in traffic accident datasets, we propose the Binary Adaptive Loss for Early Anticipation (BA-LEA). This novel loss function, together with a multi-task learning strategy, shifts the focus of the predictive model towards the critical moments preceding an accident. {We rigorously evaluate the performance of our framework on three benchmark datasets--Dashcam Accident Dataset (DAD), Car Crash Dataset (CCD), and AnAn Accident Detection (A3D), and DADA-2000 Dataset--demonstrating its superior predictive accuracy through key metrics such as Average Precision (AP) and mean Time-To-Accident (mTTA).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiace Zhu, Yingtao Shen, Jie Zhao, An Zou</p>
<p>Abstract: To enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), self-consistency has gained significant popularity by combining multiple sampling with majority voting. However, the state-of-the-art self-consistency approaches consume substantial computational resources and lead to significant additional time costs due to the multiple sampling. This prevents its full potential from being realized in scenarios where computational resources are critical. To improve the inference efficiency, this paper introduces \textit{path-consistency}, a method that leverages the confidence of answers generated in earlier branches to identify the prefix of the most promising path. By dynamically guiding the generation of subsequent branches based on this prefix, the \textit{path-consistency} mitigates both the errors and redundancies from random or less useful sampling in self-consistency. As a result, it can significantly accelerate the inference process by reducing the number of tokens generated. Our extensive empirical evaluation shows that the \textit{path-consistency} achieves significant acceleration in inference latency ranging from $7.8\%$ to $40.5\%$, while maintaining or even improving task accuracy across different datasets, including mathematical reasoning, common sense reasoning, symbolic reasoning, and code generation.</p>

<p>Abstract: We investigate the ability of Diffusion Variational Autoencoder ($\Delta$VAE) with unit sphere $\mathcal{S}^2$ as latent space to capture topological and geometrical structure and disentangle latent factors in datasets. For this, we introduce a new diagnostic of disentanglement: namely the topological degree of the encoder, which is a map from the data manifold to the latent space. By using tools from homology theory, we derive and implement an algorithm that computes this degree. We use the algorithm to compute the degree of the encoder of models that result from the training procedure. Our experimental results show that the $\Delta$VAE achieves relatively small LSBD scores, and that regardless of the degree after initialization, the degree of the encoder after training becomes $-1$ or $+1$, which implies that the resulting encoder is at least homotopic to a homeomorphism.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this work, we propose a deep learning-based imaging method for addressing the multi-frequency electromagnetic (EM) inverse scattering problem (ISP). By combining deep learning technology with EM physical laws, we have successfully developed a multi-frequency neural Born iterative method (NeuralBIM), guided by the principles of the single-frequency NeuralBIM. This method integrates multitask learning techniques with NeuralBIM's efficient iterative inversion process to construct a robust multi-frequency Born iterative inversion model. During training, the model employs a multitask learning approach guided by homoscedastic uncertainty to adaptively allocate the weights of each frequency's data. Additionally, an unsupervised learning method, constrained by the physical laws of ISP, is used to train the multi-frequency NeuralBIM model, eliminating the need for contrast and total field data. The effectiveness of the multi-frequency NeuralBIM is validated through synthetic and experimental data, demonstrating improvements in accuracy and computational efficiency for solving ISP. Moreover, this method exhibits strong generalization capabilities and noise resistance. The multi-frequency NeuralBIM method explores a novel inversion method for multi-frequency EM data and provides an effective solution for the electromagnetic ISP of multi-frequency data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Humanoid robots with behavioral autonomy have consistently been regarded as ideal collaborators in our daily lives and promising representations of embodied intelligence. Compared to fixed-based robotic arms, humanoid robots offer a larger operational space while significantly increasing the difficulty of control and planning. Despite the rapid progress towards general-purpose humanoid robots, most studies remain focused on locomotion ability with few investigations into whole-body coordination and tasks planning, thus limiting the potential to demonstrate long-horizon tasks involving both mobility and manipulation under open-ended verbal instructions. In this work, we propose a novel framework that learns, selects, and plans behaviors based on tasks in different scenarios. We combine reinforcement learning (RL) with whole-body optimization to generate robot motions and store them into a motion library. We further leverage the planning and reasoning features of the large language model (LLM), constructing a hierarchical task graph that comprises a series of motion primitives to bridge lower-level execution with higher-level planning. Experiments in simulation and real-world using the CENTAURO robot show that the language model based planner can efficiently adapt to new loco-manipulation tasks, demonstrating high autonomy from free-text commands in unstructured scenes.</p>

<p>Abstract: Brain tumors are the most common solid tumors in children and young adults, but the scarcity of large histopathology datasets has limited the application of computational pathology in this group. This study implements two weakly supervised multiple-instance learning (MIL) approaches on patch-features obtained from state-of-the-art histology-specific foundation models to classify pediatric brain tumors in hematoxylin and eosin whole slide images (WSIs) from a multi-center Swedish cohort. WSIs from 540 subjects (age 8.5$\pm$4.9 years) diagnosed with brain tumor were gathered from the six Swedish university hospitals. Instance (patch)-level features were obtained from WSIs using three pre-trained feature extractors: ResNet50, UNI and CONCH. Instances were aggregated using attention-based MIL (ABMIL) or clustering-constrained attention MIL (CLAM) for patient-level classification. Models were evaluated on three classification tasks based on the hierarchical classification of pediatric brain tumors: tumor category, family and type. Model generalization was assessed by training on data from two of the centers and testing on data from four other centers. Model interpretability was evaluated through attention-mapping. The highest classification performance was achieved using UNI features and AMBIL aggregation, with Matthew's correlation coefficient of 0.86$\pm$0.04, 0.63$\pm$0.04, and 0.53$\pm$0.05, for tumor category, family and type classification, respectively. When evaluating generalization, models utilizing UNI and CONCH features outperformed those using ResNet50. However, the drop in performance from the in-site to out-of-site testing was similar across feature extractors. These results show the potential of state-of-the-art computational pathology methods in diagnosing pediatric brain tumors at different hierarchical levels with fair generalizability on a multi-center national dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiacan Yu, Hannah An, Lenhart K. Schubert</p>
<p>Abstract: The zero-shot chain of thought (CoT) approach is often used in question answering (QA) by language models (LMs) for tasks that require multiple reasoning steps, typically enhanced by the prompt "Let's think step by step." However, some QA tasks hinge more on accessing relevant knowledge than on chaining reasoning steps. We introduce a simple general prompting technique, called PREP, that involves using two instances of LMs: the first (LM1) generates relevant information, and the second (LM2) answers the question based on this information. PREP is designed to be general and independent of the user's domain knowledge, making it applicable across various QA tasks without the need for specialized prompt engineering. To evaluate the effectiveness of our prompting method, we create a dataset of 100 binary-choice questions, derived from an extensive schematic dataset on artifact parts and material composition. These questions ask which of two artifacts is less likely to share materials with another artifact. Such questions probe the LM's knowledge of shared materials in the part structure of different artifacts. We test our method on our dataset and three published commonsense reasoning datasets. The average accuracy of our method is consistently higher than that of all the other tested methods across all the tested datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyu Chen, HanQin Cai, Fuqiang Liu, Jinhua Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: This study addresses the problem of convolutional kernel learning in univariate, multivariate, and multidimensional time series data, which is crucial for interpreting temporal patterns in time series and supporting downstream machine learning tasks. First, we propose formulating convolutional kernel learning for univariate time series as a sparse regression problem with a non-negative constraint, leveraging the properties of circular convolution and circulant matrices. Second, to generalize this approach to multivariate and multidimensional time series data, we use tensor computations, reformulating the convolutional kernel learning problem in the form of tensors. This is further converted into a standard sparse regression problem through vectorization and tensor unfolding operations. In the proposed methodology, the optimization problem is addressed using the existing non-negative subspace pursuit method, enabling the convolutional kernel to capture temporal correlations and patterns. To evaluate the proposed model, we apply it to several real-world time series datasets. On the multidimensional rideshare and taxi trip data from New York City and Chicago, the convolutional kernels reveal interpretable local correlations and cyclical patterns, such as weekly seasonality. In the context of multidimensional fluid flow data, both local and nonlocal correlations captured by the convolutional kernels can reinforce tensor factorization, leading to performance improvements in fluid flow reconstruction tasks. Thus, this study lays an insightful foundation for automatically learning convolutional kernels from time series data, with an emphasis on interpretability through sparsity and non-negativity constraints.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junhui He, Shangyu Wu, Weidong Wen, Chun Jason Xue, Qingan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) on edge devices presents significant challenges due to the substantial computational overhead and memory requirements. Activation sparsification can mitigate these challenges by reducing the number of activated neurons during inference. Existing methods typically employ thresholding-based sparsification based on the statistics of activation tensors. However, these methods do not explicitly model the impact of activation sparsification on performance, leading to suboptimal performance degradation. To address this issue, this paper reformulates the activation sparsification problem by introducing a new objective that optimizes the sparsification decisions. Building on this reformulation, we propose CHESS, a general activation sparsification approach via CHannel-wise thrEsholding and Selective Sparsification. First, channel-wise thresholding assigns a unique threshold to each activation channel in the feed-forward network (FFN) layers. Then, selective sparsification involves applying thresholding-based activation sparsification to specific layers within the attention modules. Finally, we detail the implementation of sparse kernels to accelerate LLM inference. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CHESS achieves lower performance degradation over 8 downstream tasks while activating fewer parameters compared to existing methods, thus speeding up the LLM inference by up to 1.27x.</p>

<p>Abstract: The majority of language model training builds on imitation learning. It covers pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, and affects the starting conditions for reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). The simplicity and scalability of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) for next token prediction led to its role as predominant paradigm. However, the broader field of imitation learning can more effectively utilize the sequential structure underlying autoregressive generation. We focus on investigating the inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) perspective to imitation, extracting rewards and directly optimizing sequences instead of individual token likelihoods and evaluate its benefits for fine-tuning large language models. We provide a new angle, reformulating inverse soft-Q-learning as a temporal difference regularized extension of MLE. This creates a principled connection between MLE and IRL and allows trading off added complexity with increased performance and diversity of generations in the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) setting. We find clear advantages for IRL-based imitation, in particular for retaining diversity while maximizing task performance, rendering IRL a strong alternative on fixed SFT datasets even without online data generation. Our analysis of IRL-extracted reward functions further indicates benefits for more robust reward functions via tighter integration of supervised and preference-based LLM post-training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Musfiqur Rahman, SayedHassan Khatoonabadi, Ahmad Abdellatif, Emad Shihab</p>
<p>Abstract: Using Large Language Models (LLMs) has gained popularity among software developers for generating source code. However, the use of LLM-generated code can introduce risks of adding suboptimal, defective, and vulnerable code. This makes it necessary to devise methods for the accurate detection of LLM-generated code. Toward this goal, we perform a case study of Claude 3 Haiku (or Claude 3 for brevity) on CodeSearchNet dataset. We divide our analyses into two parts: function-level and class-level. We extract 22 software metric features, such as Code Lines and Cyclomatic Complexity, for each level of granularity. We then analyze code snippets generated by Claude 3 and their human-authored counterparts using the extracted features to understand how unique the code generated by Claude 3 is. In the following step, we use the unique characteristics of Claude 3-generated code to build Machine Learning (ML) models and identify which features of the code snippets make them more detectable by ML models. Our results indicate that Claude 3 tends to generate longer functions, but shorter classes than humans, and this characteristic can be used to detect Claude 3-generated code with ML models with 82% and 66% accuracies for function-level and class-level snippets, respectively.</p>

<p>Abstract: Partitioning is a known problem in computer science and is critical in chip design workflows, as advancements in this area can significantly influence design quality and efficiency. Deep Learning (DL) techniques, particularly those involving Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), have demonstrated strong performance in various node, edge, and graph prediction tasks using both inductive and transductive learning methods. A notable area of recent interest within GNNs are pooling layers and their application to graph partitioning. While these methods have yielded promising results across social, computational, and other random graphs, their effectiveness has not yet been explored in the context of VLSI hypergraph netlists. In this study, we introduce a new set of synthetic partitioning benchmarks that emulate real-world netlist characteristics and possess a known upper bound for solution cut quality. We distinguish these benchmarks with the prior work and evaluate existing state-of-the-art partitioning algorithms alongside GNN-based approaches, highlighting their respective advantages and disadvantages.</p>

<p>Abstract: Much previous AI research has focused on developing monolithic models to maximize their intelligence and capability, with the primary goal of enhancing performance on specific tasks. In contrast, this paper explores an alternative approach: collaborative AI systems that use workflows to integrate models, data sources, and pipelines to solve complex and diverse tasks.

The core innovation of GenAgent lies in representing workflows with code, alongside constructing workflows with collaborative agents in a step-by-step manner. We implement GenAgent on the ComfyUI platform and propose a new benchmark, OpenComfy. The results demonstrate that GenAgent outperforms baseline approaches in both run-level and task-level evaluations, showing its capability to generate complex workflows with superior effectiveness and stability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zirui Xu, Vasileios Tzoumas</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce the first, to our knowledge, rigorous approach that enables multi-agent networks to self-configure their communication topology to balance the trade-off between scalability and optimality during multi-agent planning. We are motivated by the future of ubiquitous collaborative autonomy where numerous distributed agents will be coordinating via agent-to-agent communication to execute complex tasks such as traffic monitoring, event detection, and environmental exploration. But the explosion of information in such large-scale networks currently curtails their deployment due to impractical decision times induced by the computational and communication requirements of the existing near-optimal coordination algorithms. To overcome this challenge, we present the AlterNAting COordination and Network-Design Algorithm (Anaconda), a scalable algorithm that also enjoys near-optimality guarantees. Subject to the agents' bandwidth constraints, Anaconda enables the agents to optimize their local communication neighborhoods such that the action-coordination approximation performance of the network is maximized. Compared to the state of the art, Anaconda is an anytime self-configurable algorithm that quantifies its suboptimality guarantee for any type of network, from fully disconnected to fully centralized, and that, for sparse networks, is one order faster in terms of decision speed. To develop the algorithm, we quantify the suboptimality cost due to decentralization, i.e., due to communication-minimal distributed coordination. We also employ tools inspired by the literature on multi-armed bandits and submodular maximization subject to cardinality constraints. We demonstrate Anaconda in simulated scenarios of area monitoring and compare it with a state-of-the-art algorithm.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have opened new avenues for enhancing text classification efficiency in political science, surpassing traditional machine learning methods that often require extensive feature engineering, human labeling, and task-specific training. However, their effectiveness in achieving high classification accuracy remains questionable. This paper introduces a three-stage in-context learning approach that leverages LLMs to improve classification accuracy while minimizing experimental costs. Our method incorporates automatic enhanced prompt generation, adaptive exemplar selection, and a consensus mechanism that resolves discrepancies between two weaker LLMs, refined by an advanced LLM. We validate our approach using datasets from the BBC news reports, Kavanaugh Supreme Court confirmation, and 2018 election campaign ads. The results show significant improvements in classification F1 score (+0.36 for zero-shot classification) with manageable economic costs (-78% compared with human labeling), demonstrating that our method effectively addresses the limitations of traditional machine learning while offering a scalable and reliable solution for text analysis in political science.</p>

<p>Abstract: Human video generation task has gained significant attention with the advancement of deep generative models. Generating realistic videos with human movements is challenging in nature, due to the intricacies of human body topology and sensitivity to visual artifacts. The extensively studied 2D media generation methods take advantage of massive human media datasets, but struggle with 3D-aware control; whereas 3D avatar-based approaches, while offering more freedom in control, lack photorealism and cannot be harmonized seamlessly with background scene. We propose AMG, a method that combines the 2D photorealism and 3D controllability by conditioning video diffusion models on controlled rendering of 3D avatars. We additionally introduce a novel data processing pipeline that reconstructs and renders human avatar movements from dynamic camera videos. AMG is the first method that enables multi-person diffusion video generation with precise control over camera positions, human motions, and background style. We also demonstrate through extensive evaluation that it outperforms existing human video generation methods conditioned on pose sequences or driving videos in terms of realism and adaptability.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper examines covariate effects on fused whole body biometrics performance in the IARPA BRIAR dataset, specifically focusing on UAV platforms, elevated positions, and distances up to 1000 meters. The dataset includes outdoor videos compared with indoor images and controlled gait recordings. Normalized raw fusion scores relate directly to predicted false accept rates (FAR), offering an intuitive means for interpreting model results. A linear model is developed to predict biometric algorithm scores, analyzing their performance to identify the most influential covariates on accuracy at altitude and range. Weather factors like temperature, wind speed, solar loading, and turbulence are also investigated in this analysis.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuchen Yan, Jin Jiang, Yang Liu, Yixin Cao, Xin Xu, Mengdi zhang, Xunliang Cai, Jian Shao</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-correction is a novel method that can stimulate the potential reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). It involves detecting and correcting errors during the inference process when LLMs solve reasoning problems. However, recent works do not regard self-correction as a spontaneous and intrinsic capability of LLMs. Instead, such correction is achieved through post-hoc generation, external knowledge introduction, multi-model collaboration, and similar techniques. In this paper, we propose a series of mathematical LLMs called S$^3$c-Math, which are able to perform Spontaneous Step-level Self-correction for Mathematical reasoning. This capability helps LLMs to recognize whether their ongoing inference tends to contain errors and simultaneously correct these errors to produce a more reliable response. We proposed a method, which employs a step-level sampling approach to construct step-wise self-correction data for achieving such ability. Additionally, we implement a training strategy that uses above constructed data to equip LLMs with spontaneous step-level self-correction capacities. Our data and methods have been demonstrated to be effective across various foundation LLMs, consistently showing significant progress in evaluations on GSM8K, MATH, and other mathematical benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce the spontaneous step-level self-correction ability of LLMs in mathematical reasoning.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we study two classes of models, Recursive Neural Networks (RvNNs) and Transformers, and show that a tight connection between them emerges from the recent development of two recent models - Continuous Recursive Neural Networks (CRvNN) and Neural Data Routers (NDR). On one hand, CRvNN pushes the boundaries of traditional RvNN, relaxing its discrete structure-wise composition and ends up with a Transformer-like structure. On the other hand, NDR constrains the original Transformer to induce better structural inductive bias, ending up with a model that is close to CRvNN. Both models, CRvNN and NDR, show strong performance in algorithmic tasks and generalization in which simpler forms of RvNNs and Transformers fail. We explore these "bridge" models in the design space between RvNNs and Transformers, formalize their tight connections, discuss their limitations, and propose ideas for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaozong Gan, Guang Li, Ren Togo, Keisuke Maeda, Takahiro Ogawa, Miki Haseyama</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a new strategy called think twice before recognizing to improve fine-grained traffic sign recognition (TSR). Fine-grained TSR in the wild is difficult due to the complex road conditions, and existing approaches particularly struggle with cross-country TSR when data is lacking. Our strategy achieves effective fine-grained TSR by stimulating the multiple-thinking capability of large multimodal models (LMM). We introduce context, characteristic, and differential descriptions to design multiple thinking processes for the LMM. The context descriptions with center coordinate prompt optimization help the LMM to locate the target traffic sign in the original road images containing multiple traffic signs and filter irrelevant answers through the proposed prior traffic sign hypothesis. The characteristic description is based on few-shot in-context learning of template traffic signs, which decreases the cross-domain difference and enhances the fine-grained recognition capability of the LMM. The differential descriptions of similar traffic signs optimize the multimodal thinking capability of the LMM. The proposed method is independent of training data and requires only simple and uniform instructions. We conducted extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets and two real-world datasets from different countries, and the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art TSR results on all five datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: The considerable body of data available for evaluating biometric recognition systems in Research and Development (R\&D) environments has contributed to the increasingly common problem of target performance mismatch. Biometric algorithms are frequently tested against data that may not reflect the real world applications they target. From a Testing and Evaluation (T\&E) standpoint, this domain mismatch causes difficulty assessing when improvements in State-of-the-Art (SOTA) research actually translate to improved applied outcomes. This problem can be addressed with thoughtful preparation of data and experimental methods to reflect specific use-cases and scenarios.
  To that end, this paper evaluates research solutions for identifying individuals at ranges and altitudes, which could support various application areas such as counterterrorism, protection of critical infrastructure facilities, military force protection, and border security. We address challenges including image quality issues and reliance on face recognition as the sole biometric modality. By fusing face and body features, we propose developing robust biometric systems for effective long-range identification from both the ground and steep pitch angles. Preliminary results show promising progress in whole-body recognition. This paper presents these early findings and discusses potential future directions for advancing long-range biometric identification systems based on mission-driven metrics.</p>

<p>Abstract: Cross-domain speech enhancement (SE) is often faced with severe challenges due to the scarcity of noise and background information in an unseen target domain, leading to a mismatch between training and test conditions. This study puts forward a novel data simulation method to address this issue, leveraging noise-extractive techniques and generative adversarial networks (GANs) with only limited target noisy speech data. Notably, our method employs a noise encoder to extract noise embeddings from target-domain data. These embeddings aptly guide the generator to synthesize utterances acoustically fitted to the target domain while authentically preserving the phonetic content of the input clean speech. Furthermore, we introduce the notion of dynamic stochastic perturbation, which can inject controlled perturbations into the noise embeddings during inference, thereby enabling the model to generalize well to unseen noise conditions. Experiments on the VoiceBank-DEMAND benchmark dataset demonstrate that our domain-adaptive SE method outperforms an existing strong baseline based on data simulation.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces VoxHakka, a text-to-speech (TTS) system designed for Taiwanese Hakka, a critically under-resourced language spoken in Taiwan. Leveraging the YourTTS framework, VoxHakka achieves high naturalness and accuracy and low real-time factor in speech synthesis while supporting six distinct Hakka dialects. This is achieved by training the model with dialect-specific data, allowing for the generation of speaker-aware Hakka speech. To address the scarcity of publicly available Hakka speech corpora, we employed a cost-effective approach utilizing a web scraping pipeline coupled with automatic speech recognition (ASR)-based data cleaning techniques. This process ensured the acquisition of a high-quality, multi-speaker, multi-dialect dataset suitable for TTS training. Subjective listening tests conducted using comparative mean opinion scores (CMOS) demonstrate that VoxHakka significantly outperforms existing publicly available Hakka TTS systems in terms of pronunciation accuracy, tone correctness, and overall naturalness. This work represents a significant advancement in Hakka language technology and provides a valuable resource for language preservation and revitalization efforts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuo Li, Yuhao Du, Jinpeng Hu, Xiang Wan, Anningzhe Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown success in generating high-quality responses. In order to achieve better alignment with LLMs with human preference, various works are proposed based on specific optimization process, which, however, is not suitable to Black-Box LLMs like GPT-4, due to inaccessible parameters. In Black-Box LLMs case, their performance is highly dependent on the quality of the provided prompts. Existing methods to enhance response quality often involve a prompt refinement model, yet these approaches potentially suffer from semantic inconsistencies between the refined and original prompts, and typically overlook the relationship between them. To address these challenges, we introduce a self-instructed in-context learning framework that empowers LLMs to deliver more effective responses by generating reliable derived prompts to construct informative contextual environments. Our approach incorporates a self-instructed reinforcement learning mechanism, enabling direct interaction with the response model during derived prompt generation for better alignment. We then formulate querying as an in-context learning task, using responses from LLMs combined with the derived prompts to establish a contextual demonstration for the original prompt. This strategy ensures alignment with the original query, reduces discrepancies from refined prompts, and maximizes the LLMs' in-context learning capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method not only generates more reliable derived prompts but also significantly enhances LLMs' ability to deliver more effective responses, including Black-Box models such as GPT-4.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiheng Peng, Kai Zhao, Xiaoran Chen, Li Ma, Siyu Xia, Changjie Fan, Weijian Shang, Wei Jing</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficient, accurate and low-cost estimation of human skeletal information is crucial for a range of applications such as biology education and human-computer interaction. However, current simple skeleton models, which are typically based on 2D-3D joint points, fall short in terms of anatomical fidelity, restricting their utility in fields. On the other hand, more complex models while anatomically precise, are hindered by sophisticate multi-stage processing and the need for extra data like skin meshes, making them unsuitable for real-time applications. To this end, we propose the EA-RAS (Towards Efficient and Accurate End-to-End Reconstruction of Anatomical Skeleton), a single-stage, lightweight, and plug-and-play anatomical skeleton estimator that can provide real-time, accurate anatomically realistic skeletons with arbitrary pose using only a single RGB image input. Additionally, EA-RAS estimates the conventional human-mesh model explicitly, which not only enhances the functionality but also leverages the outside skin information by integrating features into the inside skeleton modeling process. In this work, we also develop a progressive training strategy and integrated it with an enhanced optimization process, enabling the network to obtain initial weights using only a small skin dataset and achieve self-supervision in skeleton reconstruction. Besides, we also provide an optional lightweight post-processing optimization strategy to further improve accuracy for scenarios that prioritize precision over real-time processing. The experiments demonstrated that our regression method is over 800 times faster than existing methods, meeting real-time requirements. Additionally, the post-processing optimization strategy provided can enhance reconstruction accuracy by over 50% and achieve a speed increase of more than 7 times.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen-Chi Chang, Ching-Yuan Chen, Hung-Shin Lee, Chih-Cheng Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: This study introduces a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of large language models (LLMs) in understanding and processing cultural knowledge, with a specific focus on Hakka culture as a case study. Leveraging Bloom's Taxonomy, the study develops a multi-dimensional framework that systematically assesses LLMs across six cognitive domains: Remembering, Understanding, Applying, Analyzing, Evaluating, and Creating. This benchmark extends beyond traditional single-dimensional evaluations by providing a deeper analysis of LLMs' abilities to handle culturally specific content, ranging from basic recall of facts to higher-order cognitive tasks such as creative synthesis. Additionally, the study integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology to address the challenges of minority cultural knowledge representation in LLMs, demonstrating how RAG enhances the models' performance by dynamically incorporating relevant external information. The results highlight the effectiveness of RAG in improving accuracy across all cognitive domains, particularly in tasks requiring precise retrieval and application of cultural knowledge. However, the findings also reveal the limitations of RAG in creative tasks, underscoring the need for further optimization. This benchmark provides a robust tool for evaluating and comparing LLMs in culturally diverse contexts, offering valuable insights for future research and development in AI-driven cultural knowledge preservation and dissemination.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bin Fu, Qiyang Wan, Jialin Li, Ruiping Wang, Xilin Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Categorization, a core cognitive ability in humans that organizes objects based on common features, is essential to cognitive science as well as computer vision. To evaluate the categorization ability of visual AI models, various proxy tasks on recognition from datasets to open world scenarios have been proposed. Recent development of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) has demonstrated impressive results in high-level visual tasks, such as visual question answering, video temporal reasoning, etc., utilizing the advanced architectures and large-scale multimodal instruction tuning. Previous researchers have developed holistic benchmarks to measure the high-level visual capability of LMMs, but there is still a lack of pure and in-depth quantitative evaluation of the most fundamental categorization ability. According to the research on human cognitive process, categorization can be seen as including two parts: category learning and category use. Inspired by this, we propose a novel, challenging, and efficient benchmark based on composite blocks, called ComBo, which provides a disentangled evaluation framework and covers the entire categorization process from learning to use. By analyzing the results of multiple evaluation tasks, we find that although LMMs exhibit acceptable generalization ability in learning new categories, there are still gaps compared to humans in many ways, such as fine-grained perception of spatial relationship and abstract category understanding. Through the study of categorization, we can provide inspiration for the further development of LMMs in terms of interpretability and generalization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hamza Farooq, Zuhair Zafar, Ahsan Saadat, Tariq M Khan, Shahzaib Iqbal, Imran Razzak</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate segmentation of skin lesions within dermoscopic images plays a crucial role in the timely identification of skin cancer for computer-aided diagnosis on mobile platforms. However, varying shapes of the lesions, lack of defined edges, and the presence of obstructions such as hair strands and marker colors make this challenge more complex. \textcolor{red}Additionally, skin lesions often exhibit subtle variations in texture and color that are difficult to differentiate from surrounding healthy skin, necessitating models that can capture both fine-grained details and broader contextual information. Currently, melanoma segmentation models are commonly based on fully connected networks and U-Nets. However, these models often struggle with capturing the complex and varied characteristics of skin lesions, such as the presence of indistinct boundaries and diverse lesion appearances, which can lead to suboptimal segmentation performance.To address these challenges, we propose a novel lightweight network specifically designed for skin lesion segmentation utilizing mobile devices, featuring a minimal number of learnable parameters (only 0.8 million). This network comprises an encoder-decoder architecture that incorporates conformer-based focal modulation attention, self-aware local and global spatial attention, and split channel-shuffle. The efficacy of our model has been evaluated on four well-established benchmark datasets for skin lesion segmentation: ISIC 2016, ISIC 2017, ISIC 2018, and PH2. Empirical findings substantiate its state-of-the-art performance, notably reflected in a high Jaccard index.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liang Geng</p>
<p>Abstract: Apples growing in natural environments often face severe visual obstructions from leaves and branches. This significantly increases the risk of false detections in object detection tasks, thereby escalating the challenge. Addressing this issue, we introduce a technique called "Occlusion-Enhanced Distillation" (OED). This approach utilizes occlusion information to regularize the learning of semantically aligned features on occluded datasets and employs Exponential Moving Average (EMA) to enhance training stability. Specifically, we first design an occlusion-enhanced dataset that integrates Grounding DINO and SAM methods to extract occluding elements such as leaves and branches from each sample, creating occlusion examples that reflect the natural growth state of fruits. Additionally, we propose a multi-scale knowledge distillation strategy, where the student network uses images with increased occlusions as inputs, while the teacher network employs images without natural occlusions. Through this setup, the strategy guides the student network to learn from the teacher across scales of semantic and local features alignment, effectively narrowing the feature distance between occluded and non-occluded targets and enhancing the robustness of object detection. Lastly, to improve the stability of the student network, we introduce the EMA strategy, which aids the student network in learning more generalized feature expressions that are less affected by the noise of individual image occlusions. Our method significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques through extensive comparative experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qianchi Zhang, Hainan Zhang, Liang Pang, Hongwei Zheng, Zhiming Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieved documents containing noise will hinder RAG from detecting answer clues and make the inference process slow and expensive. Therefore, context compression is necessary to enhance its accuracy and efficiency. Existing context compression methods use extractive or generative models to retain the most query-relevant sentences or apply the information bottleneck theory to preserve sufficient information. However, these methods may face issues such as over-compression or high computational costs. We observe that the retriever often ranks relevant documents at the top, but the exact number of documents needed to answer the query is uncertain due to the impact of query complexity and retrieval quality: complex queries like multi-hop questions may require retaining more documents than simpler queries, and a low-quality retrieval may need to rely on more documents to generate accurate outputs. Therefore, determining the minimum number of required documents (compression rate) is still a challenge for RAG. In this paper, we introduce AdaComp, a low-cost extractive context compression method that adaptively determines the compression rate based on both query complexity and retrieval quality. Specifically, we first annotate the minimum top-k documents necessary for the RAG system to answer the current query as the compression rate and then construct triplets of the query, retrieved documents, and its compression rate. Then, we use this triplet dataset to train a compression-rate predictor. Experiments on three QA datasets and one conversational Muiti-doc QA dataset show that AdaComp significantly reduces inference costs while maintaining performance nearly identical to uncompressed models, achieving a balance between efficiency and performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zixuan Guo, Yifan Xie, Weijing Xie, Peng Huang, Fei Ma, Fei Richard Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Dense colored point clouds enhance visual perception and are of significant value in various robotic applications. However, existing learning-based point cloud upsampling methods are constrained by computational resources and batch processing strategies, which often require subdividing point clouds into smaller patches, leading to distortions that degrade perceptual quality. To address this challenge, we propose a novel 2D-3D hybrid colored point cloud upsampling framework (GaussianPU) based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for robotic perception. This approach leverages 3DGS to bridge 3D point clouds with their 2D rendered images in robot vision systems. A dual scale rendered image restoration network transforms sparse point cloud renderings into dense representations, which are then input into 3DGS along with precise robot camera poses and interpolated sparse point clouds to reconstruct dense 3D point clouds. We have made a series of enhancements to the vanilla 3DGS, enabling precise control over the number of points and significantly boosting the quality of the upsampled point cloud for robotic scene understanding. Our framework supports processing entire point clouds on a single consumer-grade GPU, such as the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090, eliminating the need for segmentation and thus producing high-quality, dense colored point clouds with millions of points for robot navigation and manipulation tasks. Extensive experimental results on generating million-level point cloud data validate the effectiveness of our method, substantially improving the quality of colored point clouds and demonstrating significant potential for applications involving large-scale point clouds in autonomous robotics and human-robot interaction scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tiansheng Huang, Sihao Hu, Fatih Ilhan, Selim Furkan Tekin, Ling Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Harmful fine-tuning issue \citep{qi2023fine} poses serious safety concerns for Large language models' fine-tuning-as-a-service. While existing defenses \citep{huang2024vaccine,rosati2024representation} have been proposed to mitigate the issue, their performances are still far away from satisfactory, and the root cause of the problem has not been fully recovered. For the first time in the literature, we in this paper show that \textit{harmful perturbation} over the model weights should be the root cause of alignment-broken of harmful fine-tuning. In order to attenuate the negative impact of harmful perturbation, we propose an alignment-stage solution, dubbed Booster. Technically, along with the original alignment loss, we append a loss regularizer in the alignment stage's optimization. The regularizer ensures that the model's harmful loss reduction before/after simulated harmful perturbation is attenuated, thereby mitigating the subsequent fine-tuning risk. Empirical results show that Booster can effectively reduce the harmful score of the fine-tuned models while maintaining the performance of downstream tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruben D. Fonnegra, Maria Liliana Hern\'andez, Juan C. Caicedo, Gloria M. D\'iaz</p>
<p>Abstract: Contrast-enhancement pattern analysis is critical in breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to distinguish benign from probably malignant tumors. However, contrast-enhanced image acquisitions are time-consuming and very expensive. As an alternative to physical acquisition, this paper proposes a comprehensive pipeline for the generation of accurate long-term (late) contrast-enhanced breast MRI from the early counterpart. The proposed strategy focuses on preserving the contrast agent pattern in the enhanced regions while maintaining visual properties in the entire synthesized images. To that end, a novel loss function that leverages the biological behavior of contrast agent (CA) in tissue, given by the Time-Intensity (TI) enhancement curve, is proposed to optimize a pixel-attention based generative model. In addition, unlike traditional normalization and standardization methods, we developed a new normalization strategy that maintains the contrast enhancement pattern across the image sequences at multiple timestamps. This ensures the prevalence of the CA pattern after image preprocessing, unlike conventional approaches. Furthermore, in order to objectively evaluate the clinical quality of the synthesized images, two metrics are also introduced to measure the differences between the TI curves of enhanced regions of the acquired and synthesized images. The experimental results showed that the proposed strategy generates images that significantly outperform diagnostic quality in contrast-enhanced regions while maintaining the spatial features of the entire image. This results suggest a potential use of synthetic late enhanced images generated via deep learning in clinical scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyu Zhang, Linmei Hu, Luhao Zhang, Dandan Song, Heyan Huang, Liqiang Nie</p>
<p>Abstract: Sequential recommender systems are essential for discerning user preferences from historical interactions and facilitating targeted recommendations. Recent innovations employing Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced the field by encoding item semantics, yet they often necessitate substantial parameter tuning and are resource-demanding. Moreover, these works fails to consider the diverse characteristics of different types of users and thus diminishes the recommendation accuracy. In this paper, we propose a parameter-efficient Large Language Model Bi-Tuning framework for sequential recommendation with collaborative information (Laser). Specifically, Bi-Tuning works by inserting trainable virtual tokens at both the prefix and suffix of the input sequence and freezing the LLM parameters, thus optimizing the LLM for the sequential recommendation. In our Laser, the prefix is utilized to incorporate user-item collaborative information and adapt the LLM to the recommendation task, while the suffix converts the output embeddings of the LLM from the language space to the recommendation space for the follow-up item recommendation. Furthermore, to capture the characteristics of different types of users when integrating the collaborative information via the prefix, we introduce M-Former, a lightweight MoE-based querying transformer that uses a set of query experts to integrate diverse user-specific collaborative information encoded by frozen ID-based sequential recommender systems, significantly improving the accuracy of recommendations. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that Laser can parameter-efficiently adapt LLMs to effective recommender systems, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the field of eXplainable AI (XAI) in language models, the progression from local explanations of individual decisions to global explanations with high-level concepts has laid the groundwork for mechanistic interpretability, which aims to decode the exact operations. However, this paradigm has not been adequately explored in image models, where existing methods have primarily focused on class-specific interpretations. This paper introduces a novel approach to systematically trace the entire pathway from input through all intermediate layers to the final output within the whole dataset. We utilize Pointwise Feature Vectors (PFVs) and Effective Receptive Fields (ERFs) to decompose model embeddings into interpretable Concept Vectors. Then, we calculate the relevance between concept vectors with our Generalized Integrated Gradients (GIG), enabling a comprehensive, dataset-wide analysis of model behavior. We validate our method of concept extraction and concept attribution in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Our approach advances the understanding of semantic significance within image models, offering a holistic view of their operational mechanics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zach Eidex, Mojtaba Safari, Richard L. J. Qiu, David S. Yu, Hui-Kuo Shu, Hui Mao, Xiaofeng Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Objective: Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are commonly used in MRI scans of patients with gliomas to enhance brain tumor characterization using T1-weighted (T1W) MRI. However, there is growing concern about GBCA toxicity. This study develops a deep-learning framework to generate T1-postcontrast (T1C) from pre-contrast multiparametric MRI. Approach: We propose the tumor-aware vision transformer (TA-ViT) model that predicts high-quality T1C images. The predicted tumor region is significantly improved (P < .001) by conditioning the transformer layers from predicted segmentation maps through adaptive layer norm zero mechanism. The predicted segmentation maps were generated with the multi-parametric residual (MPR) ViT model and transformed into a latent space to produce compressed, feature-rich representations. The TA-ViT model predicted T1C MRI images of 501 glioma cases. Selected patients were split into training (N=400), validation (N=50), and test (N=51) sets. Main Results: Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that the TA-ViT model performs superior against the benchmark MRP-ViT model. Our method produces synthetic T1C MRI with high soft tissue contrast and more accurately reconstructs both the tumor and whole brain volumes. The synthesized T1C images achieved remarkable improvements in both tumor and healthy tissue regions compared to the MRP-ViT model. For healthy tissue and tumor regions, the results were as follows: NMSE: 8.53 +/- 4.61E-4; PSNR: 31.2 +/- 2.2; NCC: 0.908 +/- .041 and NMSE: 1.22 +/- 1.27E-4, PSNR: 41.3 +/- 4.7, and NCC: 0.879 +/- 0.042, respectively. Significance: The proposed method generates synthetic T1C images that closely resemble real T1C images. Future development and application of this approach may enable contrast-agent-free MRI for brain tumor patients, eliminating the risk of GBCA toxicity and simplifying the MRI scan protocol.</p>

<p>Abstract: Embodied AI systems, including AI-powered robots that autonomously interact with the physical world, stand to be significantly advanced by Large Language Models (LLMs), which enable robots to better understand complex language commands and perform advanced tasks with enhanced comprehension and adaptability, highlighting their potential to improve embodied AI capabilities. However, this advancement also introduces safety challenges, particularly in robotic navigation tasks. Improper safety management can lead to failures in complex environments and make the system vulnerable to malicious command injections, resulting in unsafe behaviours such as detours or collisions. To address these issues, we propose \textit{SafeEmbodAI}, a safety framework for integrating mobile robots into embodied AI systems. \textit{SafeEmbodAI} incorporates secure prompting, state management, and safety validation mechanisms to secure and assist LLMs in reasoning through multi-modal data and validating responses. We designed a metric to evaluate mission-oriented exploration, and evaluations in simulated environments demonstrate that our framework effectively mitigates threats from malicious commands and improves performance in various environment settings, ensuring the safety of embodied AI systems. Notably, In complex environments with mixed obstacles, our method demonstrates a significant performance increase of 267\% compared to the baseline in attack scenarios, highlighting its robustness in challenging conditions.</p>

To this end, this research introduces two novel deep learning models, SleepNet and DreamNet, to strike this balance. SleepNet seamlessly integrates supervised learning with unsupervised ``sleep" stages using pre-trained encoder models. Dedicated neurons within SleepNet are embedded in these unsupervised features, forming intermittent ``sleep" blocks that facilitate exploratory learning. Building upon the foundation of SleepNet, DreamNet employs full encoder-decoder frameworks to reconstruct the hidden states, mimicking the human "dreaming" process. This reconstruction process enables further exploration and refinement of the learned representations. Moreover, the principle ideas of our SleepNet and DreamNet are generic and can be applied to both computer vision and natural language processing downstream tasks. Through extensive empirical evaluations on diverse image and text datasets, SleepNet and DreanNet have demonstrated superior performance compared to state-of-the-art models, showcasing the strengths of unsupervised exploration and supervised precision afforded by our innovative approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenlong Huang, Chen Wang, Yunzhu Li, Ruohan Zhang, Li Fei-Fei</p>
<p>Abstract: Representing robotic manipulation tasks as constraints that associate the robot and the environment is a promising way to encode desired robot behaviors. However, it remains unclear how to formulate the constraints such that they are 1) versatile to diverse tasks, 2) free of manual labeling, and 3) optimizable by off-the-shelf solvers to produce robot actions in real-time. In this work, we introduce Relational Keypoint Constraints (ReKep), a visually-grounded representation for constraints in robotic manipulation. Specifically, ReKep is expressed as Python functions mapping a set of 3D keypoints in the environment to a numerical cost. We demonstrate that by representing a manipulation task as a sequence of Relational Keypoint Constraints, we can employ a hierarchical optimization procedure to solve for robot actions (represented by a sequence of end-effector poses in SE(3)) with a perception-action loop at a real-time frequency. Furthermore, in order to circumvent the need for manual specification of ReKep for each new task, we devise an automated procedure that leverages large vision models and vision-language models to produce ReKep from free-form language instructions and RGB-D observations. We present system implementations on a wheeled single-arm platform and a stationary dual-arm platform that can perform a large variety of manipulation tasks, featuring multi-stage, in-the-wild, bimanual, and reactive behaviors, all without task-specific data or environment models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenhan Yao, Zedong Xing, Xiarun Chen, Jia Liu, Yongqiang He, Weiping Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: One-shot voice conversion(VC) aims to change the timbre of any source speech to match that of the unseen target speaker with only one speech sample. Existing style transfer-based VC methods relied on speech representation disentanglement and suffered from accurately and independently encoding each speech component and recomposing back to converted speech effectively. To tackle this, we proposed Pureformer-VC, which utilizes Conformer blocks to build a disentangled encoder, and Zipformer blocks to build a style transfer decoder as the generator. In the decoder, we used effective styleformer blocks to integrate speaker characteristics into the generated speech effectively. The models used the generative VAE loss for encoding components and triplet loss for unsupervised discriminative training. We applied the styleformer method to Zipformer's shared weights for style transfer. The experimental results show that the proposed model achieves comparable subjective scores and exhibits improvements in objective metrics compared to existing methods in a one-shot voice conversion scenario.</p>

<p>Abstract: Training a fine-grained image recognition model with limited data presents a significant challenge, as the subtle differences between categories may not be easily discernible amidst distracting noise patterns. One commonly employed strategy is to leverage pretrained neural networks, which can generate effective feature representations for constructing an image classification model with a restricted dataset. However, these pretrained neural networks are typically trained for different tasks than the fine-grained visual recognition (FGVR) task at hand, which can lead to the extraction of less relevant features. Moreover, in the context of building FGVR models with limited data, these irrelevant features can dominate the training process, overshadowing more useful, generalizable discriminative features. Our research has identified a surprisingly simple solution to this challenge: we introduce a regularization technique to ensure that the magnitudes of the extracted features are evenly distributed. This regularization is achieved by maximizing the uniformity of feature magnitude distribution, measured through the entropy of the normalized features. The motivation behind this regularization is to remove bias in feature magnitudes from pretrained models, where some features may be more prominent and, consequently, more likely to be used for classification. Additionally, we have developed a dynamic weighting mechanism to adjust the strength of this regularization throughout the learning process. Despite its apparent simplicity, our approach has demonstrated significant performance improvements across various fine-grained visual recognition datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenyang Hu, Gaetan Frusque, Tianyang Wang, Fulei Chu, Olga Fink</p>
<p>Abstract: Deriving health indicators of rotating machines is crucial for their maintenance. However, this process is challenging for the prevalent adopted intelligent methods since they may take the whole data distributions, not only introducing noise interference but also lacking the explainability. To address these issues, we propose a diffusion-based weakly-supervised approach for deriving health indicators of rotating machines, enabling early fault detection and continuous monitoring of condition evolution. This approach relies on a classifier-free diffusion model trained using healthy samples and a few anomalies. This model generates healthy samples. and by comparing the differences between the original samples and the generated ones in the envelope spectrum, we construct an anomaly map that clearly identifies faults. Health indicators are then derived, which can explain the fault types and mitigate noise interference. Comparative studies on two cases demonstrate that the proposed method offers superior health monitoring effectiveness and robustness compared to baseline models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyungkeun Park, Jong-seok Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Logit-based knowledge distillation (KD) for classification is cost-efficient compared to feature-based KD but often subject to inferior performance. Recently, it was shown that the performance of logit-based KD can be improved by effectively delivering the probability distribution for the non-target classes from the teacher model, which is known as `implicit (dark) knowledge', to the student model. Through gradient analysis, we first show that this actually has an effect of adaptively controlling the learning of implicit knowledge. Then, we propose a new loss that enables the student to learn explicit knowledge (i.e., the teacher's confidence about the target class) along with implicit knowledge in an adaptive manner. Furthermore, we propose to separate the classification and distillation tasks for effective distillation and inter-class relationship modeling. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method, called adaptive explicit knowledge transfer (AEKT) method, achieves improved performance compared to the state-of-the-art KD methods on the CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Erzhi Liu, Jerry Yao-Chieh Hu, Alex Reneau, Zhao Song, Han Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a refined differentially private (DP) data structure for kernel density estimation (KDE), offering not only improved privacy-utility tradeoff but also better efficiency over prior results. Specifically, we study the mathematical problem: given a similarity function $f$ (or DP KDE) and a private dataset $X \subset \mathbb{R}^d$, our goal is to preprocess $X$ so that for any query $y\in\mathbb{R}^d$, we approximate $\sum_{x \in X} f(x, y)$ in a differentially private fashion. The best previous algorithm for $f(x,y) =\| x - y \|_1$ is the node-contaminated balanced binary tree by [Backurs, Lin, Mahabadi, Silwal, and Tarnawski, ICLR 2024]. Their algorithm requires $O(nd)$ space and time for preprocessing with $n=|X|$. For any query point, the query time is $d \log n$, with an error guarantee of $(1+\alpha)$-approximation and $\epsilon^{-1} \alpha^{-0.5} d^{1.5} R \log^{1.5} n$.
  In this paper, we improve the best previous result [Backurs, Lin, Mahabadi, Silwal, and Tarnawski, ICLR 2024] in three aspects:
  - We reduce query time by a factor of $\alpha^{-1} \log n$.
  - We improve the approximation ratio from $\alpha$ to 1.
  - We reduce the error dependence by a factor of $\alpha^{-0.5}$.
  From a technical perspective, our method of constructing the search tree differs from previous work [Backurs, Lin, Mahabadi, Silwal, and Tarnawski, ICLR 2024]. In prior work, for each query, the answer is split into $\alpha^{-1} \log n$ numbers, each derived from the summation of $\log n$ values in interval tree countings. In contrast, we construct the tree differently, splitting the answer into $\log n$ numbers, where each is a smart combination of two distance values, two counting values, and $y$ itself. We believe our tree structure may be of independent interest.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper describes the USTC-KXDIGIT system submitted to the ASVspoof5 Challenge for Track 1 (speech deepfake detection) and Track 2 (spoofing-robust automatic speaker verification, SASV). Track 1 showcases a diverse range of technical qualities from potential processing algorithms and includes both open and closed conditions. For these conditions, our system consists of a cascade of a frontend feature extractor and a back-end classifier. We focus on extensive embedding engineering and enhancing the generalization of the back-end classifier model. Specifically, the embedding engineering is based on hand-crafted features and speech representations from a self-supervised model, used for closed and open conditions, respectively. To detect spoof attacks under various adversarial conditions, we trained multiple systems on an augmented training set. Additionally, we used voice conversion technology to synthesize fake audio from genuine audio in the training set to enrich the synthesis algorithms. To leverage the complementary information learned by different model architectures, we employed activation ensemble and fused scores from different systems to obtain the final decision score for spoof detection. During the evaluation phase, the proposed methods achieved 0.3948 minDCF and 14.33% EER in the close condition, and 0.0750 minDCF and 2.59% EER in the open condition, demonstrating the robustness of our submitted systems under adversarial conditions. In Track 2, we continued using the CM system from Track 1 and fused it with a CNN-based ASV system. This approach achieved 0.2814 min-aDCF in the closed condition and 0.0756 min-aDCF in the open condition, showcasing superior performance in the SASV system.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Patrick Knab, Sascha Marton, Christian Bartelt, Robert Fuder</p>
<p>Abstract: Outlier detection is a crucial analytical tool in various fields. In critical systems like manufacturing, malfunctioning outlier detection can be costly and safety-critical. Therefore, there is a significant need for explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) when deploying opaque models in such environments. This study focuses on manufacturing time series data from a German automotive supply industry. We utilize autoencoders to compress the entire time series and then apply anomaly detection techniques to its latent features. For outlier interpretation, we (i) adopt widely used XAI techniques to the autoencoder's encoder. Additionally, (ii) we propose AEE, Aggregated Explanatory Ensemble, a novel approach that fuses explanations of multiple XAI techniques into a single, more expressive interpretation. For evaluation of explanations, (iii) we propose a technique to measure the quality of encoder explanations quantitatively. Furthermore, we qualitatively assess the effectiveness of outlier explanations with domain expertise.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hiromu Yakura, Ezequiel Lopez-Lopez, Levin Brinkmann, Ignacio Serna, Prateek Gupta, Iyad Rahwan</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents now interact with billions of humans in natural language, thanks to advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. This raises the question of whether AI has the potential to shape a fundamental aspect of human culture: the way we speak. Recent analyses revealed that scientific publications already exhibit evidence of AI-specific language. But this evidence is inconclusive, since scientists may simply be using AI to copy-edit their writing. To explore whether AI has influenced human spoken communication, we transcribed and analyzed about 280,000 English-language videos of presentations, talks, and speeches from more than 20,000 YouTube channels of academic institutions. We find a significant shift in the trend of word usage specific to words distinctively associated with ChatGPT following its release. These findings provide the first empirical evidence that humans increasingly imitate LLMs in their spoken language. Our results raise societal and policy-relevant concerns about the potential of AI to unintentionally reduce linguistic diversity, or to be deliberately misused for mass manipulation. They also highlight the need for further investigation into the feedback loops between machine behavior and human culture.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiwen Ni, Xiangtao Kong, Chengming Li, Xiping Hu, Ruifeng Xu, Jia Zhu, Min Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) relies heavily on the huge amount of pre-training data learned in the pre-training phase. The opacity of the pre-training process and the training data causes the results of many benchmark tests to become unreliable. If any model has been trained on a benchmark test set, it can seriously hinder the health of the field. In order to automate and efficiently test the capabilities of large language models, numerous mainstream benchmarks adopt a multiple-choice format. As the swapping of the contents of multiple-choice options does not affect the meaning of the question itself, we propose a simple and effective data leakage detection method based on this property. Specifically, we shuffle the contents of the options in the data to generate the corresponding derived data sets, and then detect data leakage based on the model's log probability distribution over the derived data sets. If there is a maximum and outlier in the set of log probabilities, it indicates that the data is leaked. Our method is able to work under black-box conditions without access to model training data or weights, effectively identifying data leakage from benchmark test sets in model pre-training data, including both normal scenarios and complex scenarios where options may have been shuffled intentionally or unintentionally. Through experiments based on two LLMs and benchmark designs, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. In addition, we evaluate the degree of data leakage of 31 mainstream open-source LLMs on four benchmark datasets and give a ranking of the leaked LLMs for each benchmark, and we find that the Qwen family of LLMs has the highest degree of data leakage.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ike Ebubechukwu, Johane Takeuchi, Antonello Ceravola, Frank Joublin</p>
<p>Abstract: As dialogue systems and chatbots increasingly integrate into everyday interactions, the need for efficient and accurate evaluation methods becomes paramount. This study explores the comparative performance of human and AI assessments across a range of dialogue scenarios, focusing on seven key performance indicators (KPIs): Coherence, Innovation, Concreteness, Goal Contribution, Commonsense Contradiction, Incorrect Fact, and Redundancy. Utilizing the GPT-4o API, we generated a diverse dataset of conversations and conducted a two-part experimental analysis. In Experiment 1, we evaluated multi-party conversations on Coherence, Innovation, Concreteness, and Goal Contribution, revealing that GPT models align closely with human judgments. Notably, both human and AI evaluators exhibited a tendency towards binary judgment rather than linear scaling, highlighting a shared challenge in these assessments. Experiment 2 extended the work of Finch et al. (2023) by focusing on dyadic dialogues and assessing Commonsense Contradiction, Incorrect Fact, and Redundancy. The results indicate that while GPT-4o demonstrates strong performance in maintaining factual accuracy and commonsense reasoning, it still struggles with reducing redundancy and self-contradiction. Our findings underscore the potential of GPT models to closely replicate human evaluation in dialogue systems, while also pointing to areas for improvement. This research offers valuable insights for advancing the development and implementation of more refined dialogue evaluation methodologies, contributing to the evolution of more effective and human-like AI communication tools.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this work, we explore the use and reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in musicology.

Our evaluation on 400 human-validated questions shows that current vanilla LLMs are less reliable than retrieval augmented generation from music dictionaries. This paper suggests that the potential of LLMs in musicology requires musicology driven research that can specialized LLMs by including accurate and reliable domain knowledge.</p>

<p>Abstract: Real-time object detection in indoor settings is a challenging area of computer vision, faced with unique obstacles such as variable lighting and complex backgrounds. This field holds significant potential to revolutionize applications like augmented and mixed realities by enabling more seamless interactions between digital content and the physical world. However, the scarcity of research specifically fitted to the intricacies of indoor environments has highlighted a clear gap in the literature. To address this, our study delves into the evaluation of existing datasets and computational models, leading to the creation of a refined dataset. This new dataset is derived from OpenImages v7, focusing exclusively on 32 indoor categories selected for their relevance to real-world applications. Alongside this, we present an adaptation of a CNN detection model, incorporating an attention mechanism to enhance the model's ability to discern and prioritize critical features within cluttered indoor scenes. Our findings demonstrate that this approach is not just competitive with existing state-of-the-art models in accuracy and speed but also opens new avenues for research and application in the field of real-time indoor object detection.</p>

<p>Abstract: While numerous methods achieving remarkable performance exist in the Object Detection literature, addressing data distribution shifts remains challenging. Continual Learning (CL) offers solutions to this issue, enabling models to adapt to new data while maintaining performance on previous data. This is particularly pertinent for edge devices, common in dynamic environments like automotive and robotics. In this work, we address the memory and computation constraints of edge devices in the Continual Learning for Object Detection (CLOD) scenario. Specifically, (i) we investigate the suitability of an open-source, lightweight, and fast detector, namely NanoDet, for CLOD on edge devices, improving upon larger architectures used in the literature. Moreover, (ii) we propose a novel CL method, called Latent Distillation~(LD), that reduces the number of operations and the memory required by state-of-the-art CL approaches without significantly compromising detection performance. Our approach is validated using the well-known VOC and COCO benchmarks, reducing the distillation parameter overhead by 74\% and the Floating Points Operations~(FLOPs) by 56\% per model update compared to other distillation methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion-based video generation technology has advanced significantly, catalyzing a proliferation of research in human animation. However, the majority of these studies are confined to same-modality driving settings, with cross-modality human body animation remaining relatively underexplored. In this paper, we introduce, an end-to-end audio-driven human animation framework that ensures hand integrity, identity consistency, and natural motion. The key design of CyberHost is the Region Codebook Attention mechanism, which improves the generation quality of facial and hand animations by integrating fine-grained local features with learned motion pattern priors. Furthermore, we have developed a suite of human-prior-guided training strategies, including body movement map, hand clarity score, pose-aligned reference feature, and local enhancement supervision, to improve synthesis results. To our knowledge, CyberHost is the first end-to-end audio-driven human diffusion model capable of facilitating zero-shot video generation within the scope of human body.

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) with extended context windows have significantly improved tasks such as information extraction, question answering, and complex planning scenarios. In order to achieve success in long context tasks, a large amount of work has been done to enhance the long context capabilities of the model through synthetic data. Existing methods typically utilize the Self-Instruct framework to generate instruction tuning data for better long context capability improvement. However, our preliminary experiments indicate that less than 35% of generated samples are multi-hop, and more than 40% exhibit poor quality, limiting comprehensive understanding and further research. To improve the quality of synthetic data, we propose the Multi-agent Interactive Multi-hop Generation (MIMG) framework, incorporating a Quality Verification Agent, a Single-hop Question Generation Agent, a Multiple Question Sampling Strategy, and a Multi-hop Question Merger Agent. This framework improves the data quality, with the proportion of high-quality, multi-hop, and diverse data exceeding 85%. Furthermore, we systematically investigate strategies for document selection, question merging, and validation techniques through extensive experiments across various models. Our findings show that our synthetic high-quality long-context instruction data significantly enhances model performance, even surpassing models trained on larger amounts of human-annotated data.

<p>Abstract: In this work, we present an efficient approach for capturing sign language in 3D, introduce the 3D-LEX v1.0 dataset, and detail a method for semi-automatic annotation of phonetic properties. Our procedure integrates three motion capture techniques encompassing high-resolution 3D poses, 3D handshapes, and depth-aware facial features, and attains an average sampling rate of one sign every 10 seconds. This includes the time for presenting a sign example, performing and recording the sign, and archiving the capture. The 3D-LEX dataset includes 1,000 signs from American Sign Language and an additional 1,000 signs from the Sign Language of the Netherlands. We showcase the dataset utility by presenting a simple method for generating handshape annotations directly from 3D-LEX. We produce handshape labels for 1,000 signs from American Sign Language and evaluate the labels in a sign recognition task. The labels enhance gloss recognition accuracy by 5% over using no handshape annotations, and by 1% over expert annotations. Our motion capture data supports in-depth analysis of sign features and facilitates the generation of 2D projections from any viewpoint. The 3D-LEX collection has been aligned with existing sign language benchmarks and linguistic resources, to support studies in 3D-aware sign language processing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lipeng Ma, Weidong Yang, Sihang Jiang, Ben Fei, Mingjie Zhou, Shuhao Li, Bo Xu, Yanghua Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Logs play a critical role in providing essential information for system monitoring and troubleshooting. Recently, with the success of pre-trained language models (PLMs) and large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing (NLP), smaller PLMs (such as BERT) and LLMs (like ChatGPT) have become the current mainstream approaches for log analysis. While LLMs possess rich knowledge, their high computational costs and unstable performance make LLMs impractical for analyzing logs directly. In contrast, smaller PLMs can be fine-tuned for specific tasks even with limited computational resources, making them more practical. However, these smaller PLMs face challenges in understanding logs comprehensively due to their limited expert knowledge. To better utilize the knowledge embedded within LLMs for log understanding, this paper introduces a novel knowledge enhancement framework, called LUK, which acquires expert knowledge from LLMs to empower log understanding on a smaller PLM. Specifically, we design a multi-expert collaboration framework based on LLMs consisting of different roles to acquire expert knowledge. In addition, we propose two novel pre-training tasks to enhance the log pre-training with expert knowledge. LUK achieves state-of-the-art results on different log analysis tasks and extensive experiments demonstrate expert knowledge from LLMs can be utilized more effectively to understand logs.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose Gradient Informed Neural Networks (GradINNs), a methodology inspired by Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) that can be used to efficiently approximate a wide range of physical systems for which the underlying governing equations are completely unknown or cannot be defined, a condition that is often met in complex engineering problems. GradINNs leverage prior beliefs about a system's gradient to constrain the predicted function's gradient across all input dimensions. This is achieved using two neural networks: one modeling the target function and an auxiliary network expressing prior beliefs, e.g., smoothness. A customized loss function enables training the first network while enforcing gradient constraints derived from the auxiliary network. We demonstrate the advantages of GradINNs, particularly in low-data regimes, on diverse problems spanning non time-dependent systems (Friedman function, Stokes Flow) and time-dependent systems (Lotka-Volterra, Burger's equation). Experimental results showcase strong performance compared to standard neural networks and PINN-like approaches across all tested scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Imanol Solano, Alejandro Pe\~na, Aythami Morales, Julian Fierrez, Ruben Tolosana, Francisco Zamora-Martinez, Javier San Agustin</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a novel metric designed, among other applications, to quantify biased behaviors of machine learning models. As its core, the metric consists of a new similarity metric between score distributions that balances both their general shapes and tails' probabilities. In that sense, our proposed metric may be useful in many application areas. Here we focus on and apply it to the operational evaluation of face recognition systems, with special attention to quantifying demographic biases; an application where our metric is especially useful. The topic of demographic bias and fairness in biometric recognition systems has gained major attention in recent years. The usage of these systems has spread in society, raising concerns about the extent to which these systems treat different population groups. A relevant step to prevent and mitigate demographic biases is first to detect and quantify them. Traditionally, two approaches have been studied to quantify differences between population groups in machine learning literature: 1) measuring differences in error rates, and 2) measuring differences in recognition score distributions. Our proposed Comprehensive Equity Index (CEI) trade-offs both approaches combining both errors from distribution tails and general distribution shapes. This new metric is well suited to real-world scenarios, as measured on NIST FRVT evaluations, involving high-performance systems and realistic face databases including a wide range of covariates and demographic groups. We first show the limitations of existing metrics to correctly assess the presence of biases in realistic setups and then propose our new metric to tackle these limitations. We tested the proposed metric with two state-of-the-art models and four widely used databases, showing its capacity to overcome the main flaws of previous bias metrics.</p>

<p>Abstract: A force field as accurate as quantum mechanics (QM) and as fast as molecular mechanics (MM), with which one can simulate a biomolecular system efficiently enough and meaningfully enough to get quantitative insights, is among the most ardent dreams of biophysicists -- a dream, nevertheless, not to be fulfilled any time soon. Machine learning force fields (MLFFs) represent a meaningful endeavor towards this direction, where differentiable neural functions are parametrized to fit ab initio energies, and furthermore forces through automatic differentiation. We argue that, as of now, the utility of the MLFF models is no longer bottlenecked by accuracy but primarily by their speed (as well as stability and generalizability), as many recent variants, on limited chemical spaces, have long surpassed the chemical accuracy of $1$ kcal/mol -- the empirical threshold beyond which realistic chemical predictions are possible -- though still magnitudes slower than MM. Hoping to kindle explorations and designs of faster, albeit perhaps slightly less accurate MLFFs, in this review, we focus our attention on the design space (the speed-accuracy tradeoff) between MM and ML force fields. After a brief review of the building blocks of force fields of either kind, we discuss the desired properties and challenges now faced by the force field development community, survey the efforts to make MM force fields more accurate and ML force fields faster, envision what the next generation of MLFF might look like.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdullah Arafat Miah, Yu Bi</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have long been recognized as vulnerable to backdoor attacks. By providing poisoned training data in the fine-tuning process, the attacker can implant a backdoor into the victim model. This enables input samples meeting specific textual trigger patterns to be classified as target labels of the attacker's choice. While such black-box attacks have been well explored in both computer vision and natural language processing (NLP), backdoor attacks relying on white-box attack philosophy have hardly been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we take the first step to introduce a new type of backdoor attack that conceals itself within the underlying model architecture. Specifically, we pcricKet1996!ropose to design separate backdoor modules consisting of two functions: trigger detection and noise injection. The add-on modules of model architecture layers can detect the presence of input trigger tokens and modify layer weights using Gaussian noise to disturb the feature distribution of the baseline model. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our attack methods using two model architecture settings on five different large language datasets. We demonstrate that the training-free architectural backdoor on a large language model poses a genuine threat. Unlike the-state-of-art work, it can survive the rigorous fine-tuning and retraining process, as well as evade output probability-based defense methods (i.e. BDDR).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wouter M. Kouw</p>
<p>Abstract: In nature, active inference agents must learn how observations of the world represent the state of the agent. In engineering, the physics behind sensors is often known reasonably accurately and measurement functions can be incorporated into generative models. When a measurement function is non-linear, the transformed variable is typically approximated with a Gaussian distribution to ensure tractable inference. We show that Gaussian approximations that are sensitive to the curvature of the measurement function, such as a second-order Taylor approximation, produce a state-dependent ambiguity term. This induces a preference over states, based on how accurately the state can be inferred from the observation. We demonstrate this preference with a robot navigation experiment where agents plan trajectories.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bozhidar Stevanoski, Ana-Maria Cretu, Yves-Alexandre de Montjoye</p>
<p>Abstract: Query-based systems (QBSs) are one of the key approaches for sharing data. QBSs allow analysts to request aggregate information from a private protected dataset. Attacks are a crucial part of ensuring QBSs are truly privacy-preserving. The development and testing of attacks is however very labor-intensive and unable to cope with the increasing complexity of systems. Automated approaches have been shown to be promising but are currently extremely computationally intensive, limiting their applicability in practice. We here propose QueryCheetah, a fast and effective method for automated discovery of privacy attacks against QBSs. We instantiate QueryCheetah on attribute inference attacks and show it to discover stronger attacks than previous methods while being 18 times faster than the state-of-the-art automated approach. We then show how QueryCheetah allows system developers to thoroughly evaluate the privacy risk, including for various attacker strengths and target individuals. We finally show how QueryCheetah can be used out-of-the-box to find attacks in larger syntaxes and workarounds around ad-hoc defenses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiwei Guo, Zhihan Li, Junjie Li, Chenpeng Du, Hankun Wang, Shuai Wang, Xie Chen, Kai Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a new speech discrete token vocoder, vec2wav 2.0, which advances voice conversion (VC). We use discrete tokens from speech self-supervised models as the content features of source speech, and treat VC as a prompted vocoding task. To amend the loss of speaker timbre in the content tokens, vec2wav 2.0 utilizes the WavLM features to provide strong timbre-dependent information. A novel adaptive Snake activation function is proposed to better incorporate timbre into the waveform reconstruction process. In this way, vec2wav 2.0 learns to alter the speaker timbre appropriately given different reference prompts. Also, no supervised data is required for vec2wav 2.0 to be effectively trained. Experimental results demonstrate that vec2wav 2.0 outperforms all other baselines to a considerable margin in terms of audio quality and speaker similarity in any-to-any VC. Ablation studies verify the effects made by the proposed techniques. Moreover, vec2wav 2.0 achieves competitive cross-lingual VC even only trained on monolingual corpus. Thus, vec2wav 2.0 shows timbre can potentially be manipulated only by speech token vocoders, pushing the frontiers of VC and speech synthesis.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generative AI has drawn significant attention from stakeholders in higher education. As it introduces new opportunities for personalized learning and tutoring support, it simultaneously poses challenges to academic integrity and leads to ethical issues. Consequently, governing responsible AI usage within higher education institutions (HEIs) becomes increasingly important. Leading universities have already published guidelines on Generative AI, with most attempting to embrace this technology responsibly. This study provides a new perspective by focusing on strategies for responsible AI governance as demonstrated in these guidelines. Through a case study of 14 prestigious universities in the United States, we identified the multi-unit governance of AI, the role-specific governance of AI, and the academic characteristics of AI governance from their AI guidelines. The strengths and potential limitations of these strategies and characteristics are discussed. The findings offer practical implications for guiding responsible AI usage in HEIs and beyond.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bobby Azad, Pourya Adibfar, Kaiqun Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: In healthcare, medical image segmentation is crucial for accurate disease diagnosis and the development of effective treatment strategies. Early detection can significantly aid in managing diseases and potentially prevent their progression. Machine learning, particularly deep convolutional neural networks, has emerged as a promising approach to addressing segmentation challenges. Traditional methods like U-Net use encoding blocks for local representation modeling and decoding blocks to uncover semantic relationships. However, these models often struggle with multi-scale objects exhibiting significant variations in texture and shape, and they frequently fail to capture long-range dependencies in the input data. Transformers designed for sequence-to-sequence predictions have been proposed as alternatives, utilizing global self-attention mechanisms. Yet, they can sometimes lack precise localization due to insufficient granular details. To overcome these limitations, we introduce TransDAE: a novel approach that reimagines the self-attention mechanism to include both spatial and channel-wise associations across the entire feature space, while maintaining computational efficiency. Additionally, TransDAE enhances the skip connection pathway with an inter-scale interaction module, promoting feature reuse and improving localization accuracy. Remarkably, TransDAE outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on the Synaps multi-organ dataset, even without relying on pre-trained weights.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peter Baile Chen, Fabian Wenz, Yi Zhang, Moe Kayali, Nesime Tatbul, Michael Cafarella, \c{C}a\u{g}atay Demiralp, Michael Stonebraker</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing text-to-SQL benchmarks have largely been constructed using publicly available tables from the web with human-generated tests containing question and SQL statement pairs. They typically show very good results and lead people to think that LLMs are effective at text-to-SQL tasks. In this paper, we apply off-the-shelf LLMs to a benchmark containing enterprise data warehouse data. In this environment, LLMs perform poorly, even when standard prompt engineering and RAG techniques are utilized. As we will show, the reasons for poor performance are largely due to three characteristics: (1) public LLMs cannot train on enterprise data warehouses because they are largely in the "dark web", (2) schemas of enterprise tables are more complex than the schemas in public data, which leads the SQL-generation task innately harder, and (3) business-oriented questions are often more complex, requiring joins over multiple tables and aggregations. As a result, we propose a new dataset BEAVER, sourced from real enterprise data warehouses together with natural language queries and their correct SQL statements which we collected from actual user history. We evaluated this dataset using recent LLMs and demonstrated their poor performance on this task. We hope this dataset will facilitate future researchers building more sophisticated text-to-SQL systems which can do better on this important class of data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenghao Qian, Mahdi Rezaei, Saeed Anwar, Wenjing Li, Tanveer Hussain, Mohsen Azarmi, Wei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Adverse conditions like snow, rain, nighttime, and fog, pose challenges for autonomous driving perception systems. Existing methods have limited effectiveness in improving essential computer vision tasks, such as semantic segmentation, and often focus on only one specific condition, such as removing rain or translating nighttime images into daytime ones. To address these limitations, we propose a method to improve the visual quality and clarity degraded by such adverse conditions. Our method, AllWeather-Net, utilizes a novel hierarchical architecture to enhance images across all adverse conditions. This architecture incorporates information at three semantic levels: scene, object, and texture, by discriminating patches at each level. Furthermore, we introduce a Scaled Illumination-aware Attention Mechanism (SIAM) that guides the learning towards road elements critical for autonomous driving perception. SIAM exhibits robustness, remaining unaffected by changes in weather conditions or environmental scenes. AllWeather-Net effectively transforms images into normal weather and daytime scenes, demonstrating superior image enhancement results and subsequently enhancing the performance of semantic segmentation, with up to a 5.3% improvement in mIoU in the trained domain. We also show our model's generalization ability by applying it to unseen domains without re-training, achieving up to 3.9% mIoU improvement.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruixin Shi, Weijia Guo, Shiming Ge</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-resolution face recognition is a challenging task due to the missing of informative details. Recent approaches based on knowledge distillation have proven that high-resolution clues can well guide low-resolution face recognition via proper knowledge transfer. However, due to the distribution difference between training and testing faces, the learned models often suffer from poor adaptability. To address that, we split the knowledge transfer process into distillation and adaptation steps, and propose an adaptable instance-relation distillation approach to facilitate low-resolution face recognition. In the approach, the student distills knowledge from high-resolution teacher in both instance level and relation level, providing sufficient cross-resolution knowledge transfer. Then, the learned student can be adaptable to recognize low-resolution faces with adaptive batch normalization in inference. In this manner, the capability of recovering missing details of familiar low-resolution faces can be effectively enhanced, leading to a better knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on low-resolution face recognition clearly demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of our approach.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite significant advancements in monocular depth estimation for static images, estimating video depth in the open world remains challenging, since open-world videos are extremely diverse in content, motion, camera movement, and length. We present DepthCrafter, an innovative method for generating temporally consistent long depth sequences with intricate details for open-world videos, without requiring any supplementary information such as camera poses or optical flow. DepthCrafter achieves generalization ability to open-world videos by training a video-to-depth model from a pre-trained image-to-video diffusion model, through our meticulously designed three-stage training strategy with the compiled paired video-depth datasets. Our training approach enables the model to generate depth sequences with variable lengths at one time, up to 110 frames, and harvest both precise depth details and rich content diversity from realistic and synthetic datasets. We also propose an inference strategy that processes extremely long videos through segment-wise estimation and seamless stitching. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple datasets reveal that DepthCrafter achieves state-of-the-art performance in open-world video depth estimation under zero-shot settings. Furthermore, DepthCrafter facilitates various downstream applications, including depth-based visual effects and conditional video generation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Building high-quality datasets for specialized tasks is a time-consuming and resource-intensive process that often requires specialized domain knowledge. We propose Corpus Retrieval and Augmentation for Fine-Tuning (CRAFT), a method for generating synthetic datasets, given a small number of user-written few-shots that demonstrate the task to be performed. Given the few-shot examples, we use large-scale public web-crawled corpora and similarity-based document retrieval to find other relevant human-written documents. Lastly, instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) augment the retrieved documents into custom-formatted task samples, which then can be used for fine-tuning. We demonstrate that CRAFT can efficiently generate large-scale task-specific training datasets for four diverse tasks: biology question-answering (QA), medicine QA and commonsense QA as well as summarization. Our experiments show that CRAFT-based models outperform or achieve comparable performance to general LLMs for QA tasks, while CRAFT-based summarization models outperform models trained on human-curated data by 46 preference points.</p>

<p>Abstract: Our ignorance of the winnability percentage of the solitaire card game `Klondike' has been described as "one of the embarrassments of applied mathematics". Klondike, the game in the Windows Solitaire program, is just one of many single-player card games, generically called 'patience' or 'solitaire' games, for which players have long wanted to know how likely a particular game is to be winnable. A number of different games have been studied empirically in the academic literature and by non-academic enthusiasts. Here we show that a single general purpose Artificial Intelligence program named `Solvitaire' can be used to determine the winnability percentage of 73 variants of 35 different single-player card games with a 95% confidence interval of +/- 0.1% or better. For example, we report the winnability of Klondike as 81.945%+/- 0.084% (in the `thoughtful' variant where the player knows the rank and suit of all cards), a 30-fold reduction in confidence interval over the best previous result. The vast majority of our results are either entirely new or represent significant improvements on previous knowledge.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Usef Faghihi, Amir Saki</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new causal methodology that accounts for the rarity and frequency of events in observational studies based on their relevance to the underlying problem. Specifically, we propose a direct causal effect metric called the Probabilistic Variational Causal Effect (PACE) and its variations adhering to certain postulates applicable to both non-binary and binary treatments. The PACE metric is derived by integrating the concept of total variation -- representing the purely causal component -- with interventions on the treatment value, combined with the probabilities of hypothetical transitioning between treatment levels. PACE features a parameter d, where lower values of d correspond to scenarios emphasizing rare treatment values, while higher values of d focus on situations where the causal impact of more frequent treatment levels is more relevant. Thus, instead of a single causal effect value, we provide a causal effect function of the degree d. Additionally, we introduce positive and negative PACE to measure the respective positive and negative causal changes in the outcome as exposure values shift. We also consider normalized versions of PACE, referred to as MEAN PACE. Furthermore, we provide an identifiability criterion for PACE to handle counterfactual challenges in observational studies, and we define several generalizations of our methodology. Lastly, we compare our framework with other well-known causal frameworks through the analysis of various examples.</p>

<p>Abstract: Constraint Programming (CP) is a useful technology for modeling and solving combinatorial constrained problems. On the one hand, on can use a library like PyCSP3 for easily modeling problems arising in various application fields (e.g., scheduling, planning, data-mining, cryptography, bio-informatics, organic chemistry, etc.). Problem instances can then be directly generated from specific models and data. On the other hand, for solving instances (notably, represented in XCSP3 format), one can use a constraint solver like ACE, which is presented in this paper. ACE is an open-source constraint solver, developed in Java, which focuses on integer variables (including 0/1-Boolean variables), state-of-the-art table constraints, popular global constraints, search heuristics and (mono-criterion) optimization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaxian Guo, Bo Yang, Paul Yoo, Bill Yuchen Lin, Yusuke Iwasawa, Yutaka Matsuo</p>
<p>Abstract: Unlike perfect information games, where all elements are known to every player, imperfect information games emulate the real-world complexities of decision-making under uncertain or incomplete information. GPT-4, the recent breakthrough in large language models (LLMs) trained on massive passive data, is notable for its knowledge retrieval and reasoning abilities. This paper delves into the applicability of GPT-4's learned knowledge for imperfect information games. To achieve this, we introduce \textbf{Suspicion-Agent}, an innovative agent that leverages GPT-4's capabilities for performing in imperfect information games. With proper prompt engineering to achieve different functions, Suspicion-Agent based on GPT-4 demonstrates remarkable adaptability across a range of imperfect information card games. Importantly, GPT-4 displays a strong high-order theory of mind (ToM) capacity, meaning it can understand others and intentionally impact others' behavior. Leveraging this, we design a planning strategy that enables GPT-4 to competently play against different opponents, adapting its gameplay style as needed, while requiring only the game rules and descriptions of observations as input. In the experiments, we qualitatively showcase the capabilities of Suspicion-Agent across three different imperfect information games and then quantitatively evaluate it in Leduc Hold'em. The results show that Suspicion-Agent can potentially outperform traditional algorithms designed for imperfect information games, without any specialized training or examples. In order to encourage and foster deeper insights within the community, we make our game-related data publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohamad Ali-Dib, Kristen Menou</p>
<p>Abstract: [Abridged abstract] Large Language Models (LLMs) can solve some undergraduate-level to graduate-level physics textbook problems and are proficient at coding. Combining these two capabilities could one day enable AI systems to simulate and predict the physical world.
  We present an evaluation of state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs on PhD-level to research-level computational physics problems. We condition LLM generation on the use of well-documented and widely-used packages to elicit coding capabilities in the physics and astrophysics domains. We contribute $\sim 50$ original and challenging problems in celestial mechanics (with REBOUND), stellar physics (with MESA), 1D fluid dynamics (with Dedalus) and non-linear dynamics (with SciPy). Since our problems do not admit unique solutions, we evaluate LLM performance on several soft metrics: counts of lines that contain different types of errors (coding, physics, necessity and sufficiency) as well as a more "educational" Pass-Fail metric focused on capturing the salient physical ingredients of the problem at hand.
  As expected, today's SOTA LLM (GPT4) zero-shot fails most of our problems, although about 40\% of the solutions could plausibly get a passing grade. About $70-90 \%$ of the code lines produced are necessary, sufficient and correct (coding \& physics). Physics and coding errors are the most common, with some unnecessary or insufficient lines. We observe significant variations across problem class and difficulty. We identify several failure modes of GPT4 in the computational physics domain.
  Our reconnaissance work provides a snapshot of current computational capabilities in classical physics and points to obvious improvement targets if AI systems are ever to reach a basic level of autonomy in physics simulation capabilities.</p>

<p>Abstract: The emergence of tools based on artificial intelligence has also led to the need of producing explanations which are understandable by a human being. In most approaches, the system is considered a black box, making it difficult to generate appropriate explanations. In this work, though, we consider a setting where models are transparent: probabilistic logic programming (PLP), a paradigm that combines logic programming for knowledge representation and probability to model uncertainty. However, given a query, the usual notion of explanation is associated with a set of choices, one for each random variable of the model. Unfortunately, such a set does not explain why the query is true and, in fact, it may contain choices that are actually irrelevant for the considered query. To improve this situation, we present in this paper an approach to explaining explanations which is based on defining a new query-driven inference mechanism for PLP where proofs are labeled with "choice expressions", a compact and easy to manipulate representation for sets of choices. The combination of proof trees and choice expressions allows us to produce comprehensible query justifications with a causal structure.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Teddy Ferdinan, Jan Koco\'n, Przemys{\l}aw Kazienko</p>
<p>Abstract: We address the main problem of self-learning LLM: the question of what to learn. We propose a self-learning LLM framework that enables an LLM to independently learn previously unknown knowledge through self-assessment of their own hallucinations. We introduce a concept called Point in the Unknown (PiU) to identify atomic knowledge unknown to a model, along with four methods for automatic PiUs identification, facilitating the creation of a self-learning loop that focuses exclusively on the absorption of currently unknown knowledge into the model. Additionally, we developed evaluation metrics to gauge an LLM's self-learning capability. Our experiments revealed that LLMs with at least 3B parameters that have undergone some instruction training would be able to perform self-learning well. We further proved the effectiveness of self-learning by comparing the performance of a model that has undergone self-learning to a model that has not. Our self-learning concept allows more efficient LLM updates and opens new perspectives for LLM knowledge exchange.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jen-tse Huang, Eric John Li, Man Ho Lam, Tian Liang, Wenxuan Wang, Youliang Yuan, Wenxiang Jiao, Xing Wang, Zhaopeng Tu, Michael R. Lyu</p>
<p>Abstract: Decision-making, a complicated task requiring various types of abilities, presents an excellent framework for assessing Large Language Models (LLMs). Our research investigates decision-making capabilities of LLMs through the lens of Game Theory. We focus specifically on games that support the simultaneous participation of more than two agents. We introduce GAMA($\gamma$)-Bench, which evaluates LLMs' Gaming Ability in Multi-Agent environments. $\gamma$-Bench includes eight classical multi-agent games and a scoring scheme specially designed to quantitatively assess LLMs' performance. Leveraging $\gamma$-Bench, we investigate LLMs' robustness, generalizability, and strategies for enhancement. Results reveal that while GPT-3.5 shows satisfying robustness, its generalizability is relatively limited. However, its performance can be improved through approaches such as Chain-of-Thought. Additionally, we evaluate twelve versions from six models, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Gemini, LLaMA-3.1, Mixtral, and Qwen-2. We find that Gemini-1.5-Pro outperforms other models with a score of $63.8$ out of $100$, followed by LLaMA-3.1-70B and GPT-4 with scores of $60.9$ and $60.5$, respectively.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kevin Xu, Yeganeh Kordi, Tanay Nayak, Ado Asija, Yizhong Wang, Kate Sanders, Adam Byerly, Jingyu Zhang, Benjamin Van Durme, Daniel Khashabi</p>
<p>Abstract: Can advanced multi-modal models effectively tackle complex web-based tasks? Such tasks are often found on crowdsourcing platforms, where crowdworkers engage in challenging micro-tasks within web-based environments.
  Building on this idea, we present TurkingBench, a benchmark consisting of tasks presented as web pages with textual instructions and multi-modal contexts. Unlike previous approaches that rely on artificially synthesized web pages, our benchmark uses natural HTML pages originally designed for crowdsourcing workers to perform various annotation tasks. Each task's HTML instructions are instantiated with different values derived from crowdsourcing tasks, creating diverse instances. This benchmark includes 32.2K instances spread across 158 tasks.
  To support the evaluation of TurkingBench, we have developed a framework that links chatbot responses to actions on web pages (e.g., modifying a text box, selecting a radio button). We assess the performance of cutting-edge private and open-source models, including language-only and vision-language models (such as GPT4 and InternVL), on this benchmark. Our results show that while these models outperform random chance, there is still significant room for improvement. We hope that this benchmark will drive progress in the evaluation and development of web-based agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shayne Longpre, Robert Mahari, Naana Obeng-Marnu, William Brannon, Tobin South, Katy Gero, Sandy Pentland, Jad Kabbara</p>
<p>Abstract: New capabilities in foundation models are owed in large part to massive, widely-sourced, and under-documented training data collections. Existing practices in data collection have led to challenges in tracing authenticity, verifying consent, preserving privacy, addressing representation and bias, respecting copyright, and overall developing ethical and trustworthy foundation models. In response, regulation is emphasizing the need for training data transparency to understand foundation models' limitations. Based on a large-scale analysis of the foundation model training data landscape and existing solutions, we identify the missing infrastructure to facilitate responsible foundation model development practices. We examine the current shortcomings of common tools for tracing data authenticity, consent, and documentation, and outline how policymakers, developers, and data creators can facilitate responsible foundation model development by adopting universal data provenance standards.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaesung Park, Sungchul Hong, Yoonseo Cho, Jong-June Jeon</p>
<p>Abstract: Sea ice at the North Pole is vital to global climate dynamics. However, accurately forecasting sea ice poses a significant challenge due to the intricate interaction among multiple variables. Leveraging the capability to integrate multiple inputs and powerful performances seamlessly, many studies have turned to neural networks for sea ice forecasting. This paper introduces a novel deep architecture named Unicorn, designed to forecast weekly sea ice. Our model integrates multiple time series images within its architecture to enhance its forecasting performance. Moreover, we incorporate a bottleneck layer within the U-Net architecture, serving as neural ordinary differential equations with convolution operations, to capture the spatiotemporal dynamics of latent variables. Through real data analysis with datasets spanning from 1998 to 2021, our proposed model demonstrates significant improvements over state-of-the-art models in the sea ice concentration forecasting task. It achieves an average MAE improvement of 12% compared to benchmark models. Additionally, our method outperforms existing approaches in sea ice extent forecasting, achieving a classification performance improvement of approximately 18%. These experimental results show the superiority of our proposed model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sohini Roychowdhury, Marko Krema, Anvar Mahammad, Brian Moore, Arijit Mukherjee, Punit Prakashchandra</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with retrieval augmented-generation (RAG) have been the optimal choice for scalable generative AI solutions in the recent past. Although RAG implemented with AI agents (agentic-RAG) has been recently popularized, its suffers from unstable cost and unreliable performances for Enterprise-level data-practices. Most existing use-cases that incorporate RAG with LLMs have been either generic or extremely domain specific, thereby questioning the scalability and generalizability of RAG-LLM approaches. In this work, we propose a unique LLM-based system where multiple LLMs can be invoked to enable data authentication, user-query routing, data-retrieval and custom prompting for question-answering capabilities from Enterprise-data tables. The source tables here are highly fluctuating and large in size and the proposed framework enables structured responses in under 10 seconds per query. Additionally, we propose a five metric scoring module that detects and reports hallucinations in the LLM responses. Our proposed system and scoring metrics achieve >90% confidence scores across hundreds of user queries in the sustainability, financial health and social media domains. Extensions to the proposed extreme RAG architectures can enable heterogeneous source querying using LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Evelyn Yee, Alice Li, Chenyu Tang, Yeon Ho Jung, Ramamohan Paturi, Leon Bergen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often improve their performance in downstream tasks when they generate Chain of Thought reasoning text before producing an answer. We investigate how LLMs recover from errors in Chain of Thought. Through analysis of error recovery behaviors, we find evidence for unfaithfulness in Chain of Thought, which occurs when models arrive at the correct answer despite invalid reasoning text. We identify factors that shift LLM recovery behavior: LLMs recover more frequently from obvious errors and in contexts that provide more evidence for the correct answer. Critically, these factors have divergent effects on faithful and unfaithful recoveries. Our results indicate that there are distinct mechanisms driving faithful and unfaithful error recoveries. Selective targeting of these mechanisms may be able to drive down the rate of unfaithful reasoning and improve model interpretability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daking Rai, Ziyu Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong arithmetic reasoning capabilities when prompted with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompts. However, we have only a limited understanding of how they are processed by LLMs. To demystify it, prior work has primarily focused on ablating different components in the CoT prompt and empirically observing their resulting LLM performance change. Yet, the reason why these components are important to LLM reasoning is not explored. To fill this gap, in this work, we investigate ``neuron activation'' as a lens to provide a unified explanation to observations made by prior work. Specifically, we look into neurons within the feed-forward layers of LLMs that may have activated their arithmetic reasoning capabilities, using Llama2 as an example. To facilitate this investigation, we also propose an approach based on GPT-4 to automatically identify neurons that imply arithmetic reasoning. Our analyses revealed that the activation of reasoning neurons in the feed-forward layers of an LLM can explain the importance of various components in a CoT prompt, and future research can extend it for a more complete understanding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vedant Shah, Dingli Yu, Kaifeng Lyu, Simon Park, Nan Rosemary Ke, Michael Mozer, Yoshua Bengio, Sanjeev Arora, Anirudh Goyal</p>
<p>Abstract: Current LLM training positions mathematical reasoning as a core capability. With publicly available sources fully tapped, there is unmet demand for diverse and challenging math questions. Relying solely on human experts is both time-consuming and costly, while LLM-generated questions often lack the requisite diversity and difficulty. We present a design framework that combines the strengths of LLMs with a human-in-the-loop approach to generate a diverse array of challenging math questions. We leverage LLM metacognition skills [Didolkar et al., 2024] of a strong LLM to extract core "skills" from existing math datasets. These skills serve as the basis for generating novel and difficult questions by prompting the LLM with random pairs of core skills. The use of two different skills within each question makes finding such questions an "out of distribution" task for both LLMs and humans. Our pipeline employs LLMs to iteratively generate and refine questions and solutions through multiturn prompting. Human annotators then verify and further refine the questions, with their efficiency enhanced via further LLM interactions. Applying this pipeline on skills extracted from the MATH dataset [Hendrycks et al., 2021] resulted in MATH$^2$ - a dataset of higher-quality math questions, as evidenced by: (a) Lower performance of all models on MATH$^2$ than on MATH (b) Higher performance on MATH when using MATH$^2$ questions as in-context examples. Although focused on mathematics, our methodology seems applicable to other domains requiring structured reasoning, and potentially as a component of scalable oversight. Also of interest is a striking relationship observed between models' performance on the new dataset: the success rate on MATH$^2$ is the square on MATH, suggesting that successfully solving the question in MATH$^2$ requires a nontrivial combination of two distinct math skills.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiasheng Zhang, Rex Ying, Jie Shao</p>
<p>Abstract: Temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) are valuable resources for capturing evolving relationships among entities, yet they are often plagued by noise, necessitating robust anomaly detection mechanisms. Existing dynamic graph anomaly detection approaches struggle to capture the rich semantics introduced by node and edge categories within TKGs, while TKG embedding methods lack interpretability, undermining the credibility of anomaly detection. Moreover, these methods falter in adapting to pattern changes and semantic drifts resulting from knowledge updates. To tackle these challenges, we introduce AnoT, an efficient TKG summarization method tailored for interpretable online anomaly detection in TKGs. AnoT begins by summarizing a TKG into a novel rule graph, enabling flexible inference of complex patterns in TKGs. When new knowledge emerges, AnoT maps it onto a node in the rule graph and traverses the rule graph recursively to derive the anomaly score of the knowledge. The traversal yields reachable nodes that furnish interpretable evidence for the validity or the anomalous of the new knowledge. Overall, AnoT embodies a detector-updater-monitor architecture, encompassing a detector for offline TKG summarization and online scoring, an updater for real-time rule graph updates based on emerging knowledge, and a monitor for estimating the approximation error of the rule graph. Experimental results on four real-world datasets demonstrate that AnoT surpasses existing methods significantly in terms of accuracy and interoperability. All of the raw datasets and the implementation of AnoT are provided in https://github.com/zjs123/ANoT.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongqiu Wu, Zekai Xu, Tianyang Xu, Shize Wei, Yan Wang, Jiale Hong, Weiqi Wu, Hai Zhao, Min Zhang, Zhezhi He</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the \emph{virtual world}, a cyberspace where people can live in. An ideal virtual world shares great similarity with our real world. One of the crucial aspects is its evolving nature, reflected by individuals' capability to grow and thereby influence the objective world. Such dynamics is unpredictable and beyond the reach of existing systems. For this, we propose a special engine called \textbf{\emph{Delta-Engine}} to drive this virtual world. $\Delta$ associates the world's evolution to the engine's scalability. It consists of a base engine and a neural proxy. The base engine programs the prototype of the virtual world; given a trigger, the neural proxy generates new snippets on the base engine through \emph{incremental prediction}. This paper presents a full-stack introduction to the delta-engine. The key feature of the delta-engine is its scalability to unknown elements within the world, Technically, it derives from the prefect co-work of the neural proxy and the base engine, and the alignment with high-quality data. We introduce an engine-oriented fine-tuning method that embeds the base engine into the proxy. We then discuss the human-LLM collaborative design to produce novel and interesting data efficiently. Eventually, we propose three evaluation principles to comprehensively assess the performance of a delta engine: naive evaluation, incremental evaluation, and adversarial evaluation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Drawing inspiration from animal navigation strategies, we introduce a novel computational model for navigation and mapping, rooted in biologically inspired principles. Animals exhibit remarkable navigation abilities by efficiently using memory, imagination, and strategic decision-making to navigate complex and aliased environments. Building on these insights, we integrate traditional cognitive mapping approaches with an Active Inference Framework (AIF) to learn an environment structure in a few steps. Through the incorporation of topological mapping for long-term memory and AIF for navigation planning and structure learning, our model can dynamically apprehend environmental structures and expand its internal map with predicted beliefs during exploration. Comparative experiments with the Clone-Structured Graph (CSCG) model highlight our model's ability to rapidly learn environmental structures in a single episode, with minimal navigation overlap. this is achieved without prior knowledge of the dimensions of the environment or the type of observations, showcasing its robustness and effectiveness in navigating ambiguous environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chris Lu, Cong Lu, Robert Tjarko Lange, Jakob Foerster, Jeff Clune, David Ha</p>
<p>Abstract: One of the grand challenges of artificial general intelligence is developing agents capable of conducting scientific research and discovering new knowledge. While frontier models have already been used as aides to human scientists, e.g. for brainstorming ideas, writing code, or prediction tasks, they still conduct only a small part of the scientific process. This paper presents the first comprehensive framework for fully automatic scientific discovery, enabling frontier large language models to perform research independently and communicate their findings. We introduce The AI Scientist, which generates novel research ideas, writes code, executes experiments, visualizes results, describes its findings by writing a full scientific paper, and then runs a simulated review process for evaluation. In principle, this process can be repeated to iteratively develop ideas in an open-ended fashion, acting like the human scientific community. We demonstrate its versatility by applying it to three distinct subfields of machine learning: diffusion modeling, transformer-based language modeling, and learning dynamics. Each idea is implemented and developed into a full paper at a cost of less than $15 per paper. To evaluate the generated papers, we design and validate an automated reviewer, which we show achieves near-human performance in evaluating paper scores. The AI Scientist can produce papers that exceed the acceptance threshold at a top machine learning conference as judged by our automated reviewer. This approach signifies the beginning of a new era in scientific discovery in machine learning: bringing the transformative benefits of AI agents to the entire research process of AI itself, and taking us closer to a world where endless affordable creativity and innovation can be unleashed on the world's most challenging problems.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tiansheng Huang, Gautam Bhattacharya, Pratik Joshi, Josh Kimball, Ling Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Safety aligned Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable to harmful fine-tuning attacks \cite{qi2023fine}-- a few harmful data mixed in the fine-tuning dataset can break the LLMs's safety alignment. Existing mitigation strategies include alignment stage solutions \cite{huang2024vaccine, rosati2024representation} and fine-tuning stage solutions \cite{huang2024lazy,mukhoti2023fine}. However, our evaluation shows that both categories of defenses fail \textit{when some specific training hyper-parameters are chosen} -- a large learning rate or a large number of training epochs in the fine-tuning stage can easily invalidate the defense, which however, is necessary to guarantee finetune performance. To this end, we propose Antidote, a post-fine-tuning stage solution, which remains \textbf{\textit{agnostic to the training hyper-parameters in the fine-tuning stage}}. Antidote relies on the philosophy that by removing the harmful parameters, the harmful model can be recovered from the harmful behaviors, regardless of how those harmful parameters are formed in the fine-tuning stage. With this philosophy, we introduce a one-shot pruning stage after harmful fine-tuning to remove the harmful weights that are responsible for the generation of harmful content. Despite its embarrassing simplicity, empirical results show that Antidote can reduce harmful score while maintaining accuracy on downstream tasks.Our project page is at \url{https://huangtiansheng.github.io/Antidote_gh_page/}</p>

However, very little work focuses on learning action costs, which in turn allows us to rank the different plans.

To solve this problem we present $LACFIP^k$, an algorithm to learn action's costs from unlabeled input plans. We provide theoretical and empirical results showing how $LACFIP^k$ can successfully solve this task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhibo Jin, Jiayu Zhang, Zhiyu Zhu, Yuchen Zhang, Jiahao Huang, Jianlong Zhou, Fang Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Transferable adversarial attacks pose significant threats to deep neural networks, particularly in black-box scenarios where internal model information is inaccessible. Studying adversarial attack methods helps advance the performance of defense mechanisms and explore model vulnerabilities. These methods can uncover and exploit weaknesses in models, promoting the development of more robust architectures. However, current methods for transferable attacks often come with substantial computational costs, limiting their deployment and application, especially in edge computing scenarios. Adversarial generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), are characterized by their ability to generate samples without the need for retraining after an initial training phase. GE-AdvGAN, a recent method for transferable adversarial attacks, is based on this principle. In this paper, we propose a novel general framework for gradient editing-based transferable attacks, named GE-AdvGAN+, which integrates nearly all mainstream attack methods to enhance transferability while significantly reducing computational resource consumption. Our experiments demonstrate the compatibility and effectiveness of our framework. Compared to the baseline AdvGAN, our best-performing method, GE-AdvGAN++, achieves an average ASR improvement of 47.8. Additionally, it surpasses the latest competing algorithm, GE-AdvGAN, with an average ASR increase of 5.9. The framework also exhibits enhanced computational efficiency, achieving 2217.7 FPS, outperforming traditional methods such as BIM and MI-FGSM.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boxuan Wang, Haonan Duan, Yanhao Feng, Xu Chen, Yongjie Fu, Zhaobin Mo, Xuan Di</p>
<p>Abstract: Social norm is defined as a shared standard of acceptable behavior in a society. The emergence of social norms fosters coordination among agents without any hard-coded rules, which is crucial for the large-scale deployment of AVs in an intelligent transportation system. This paper explores the application of LLMs in understanding and modeling social norms in autonomous driving games. We introduce LLMs into autonomous driving games as intelligent agents who make decisions according to text prompts. These agents are referred to as LLM-based agents. Our framework involves LLM-based agents playing Markov games in a multi-agent system (MAS), allowing us to investigate the emergence of social norms among individual agents. We aim to identify social norms by designing prompts and utilizing LLMs on textual information related to the environment setup and the observations of LLM-based agents. Using the OpenAI Chat API powered by GPT-4.0, we conduct experiments to simulate interactions and evaluate the performance of LLM-based agents in two driving scenarios: unsignalized intersection and highway platoon. The results show that LLM-based agents can handle dynamically changing environments in Markov games, and social norms evolve among LLM-based agents in both scenarios. In the intersection game, LLM-based agents tend to adopt a conservative driving policy when facing a potential car crash. The advantage of LLM-based agents in games lies in their strong operability and analyzability, which facilitate experimental design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruochen Li, Teerth Patel, Qingyun Wang, Xinya Du</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning research, crucial for technological advancements and innovation, often faces significant challenges due to its inherent complexity, slow pace of experimentation, and the necessity for specialized expertise. Motivated by this, we present a new systematic framework, autonomous Machine Learning Research with large language models (MLR-Copilot), designed to enhance machine learning research productivity through the automatic generation and implementation of research ideas using Large Language Model (LLM) agents. The framework consists of three phases: research idea generation, experiment implementation, and implementation execution. First, existing research papers are used to generate hypotheses and experimental plans vis IdeaAgent powered by LLMs. Next, the implementation generation phase translates these plans into executables with ExperimentAgent. This phase leverages retrieved prototype code and optionally retrieves candidate models and data. Finally, the execution phase, also managed by ExperimentAgent, involves running experiments with mechanisms for human feedback and iterative debugging to enhance the likelihood of achieving executable research outcomes. We evaluate our framework on five machine learning research tasks and the experimental results show the framework's potential to facilitate the research progress and innovations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has paved the way for revolutionary decision-making processes, which if harnessed appropriately, can contribute to advancements in various sectors, from healthcare to economics. However, its black box nature presents significant ethical challenges related to bias and transparency. AI applications are hugely impacted by biases, presenting inconsistent and unreliable findings, leading to significant costs and consequences, highlighting and perpetuating inequalities and unequal access to resources. Hence, developing safe, reliable, ethical, and Trustworthy AI systems is essential.
  Our team of researchers working with Trustworthy and Responsible AI, part of the Transdisciplinary Scholarship Initiative within the University of Calgary, conducts research on Trustworthy and Responsible AI, including fairness, bias mitigation, reproducibility, generalization, interpretability, and authenticity. In this paper, we review and discuss the intricacies of AI biases, definitions, methods of detection and mitigation, and metrics for evaluating bias. We also discuss open challenges with regard to the trustworthiness and widespread application of AI across diverse domains of human-centric decision making, as well as guidelines to foster Responsible and Trustworthy AI models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Tahir Rafique, Ahmed Mustafa, Hasan Sajid</p>
<p>Abstract: The growing demand for road use in urban areas has led to significant traffic congestion, posing challenges that are costly to mitigate through infrastructure expansion alone. As an alternative, optimizing existing traffic management systems, particularly through adaptive traffic signal control, offers a promising solution. This paper explores the use of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enhance traffic signal operations at intersections, aiming to reduce congestion without extensive sensor networks. We introduce two RL-based algorithms: a turn-based agent, which dynamically prioritizes traffic signals based on real-time queue lengths, and a time-based agent, which adjusts signal phase durations according to traffic conditions while following a fixed phase cycle. By representing the state as a scalar queue length, our approach simplifies the learning process and lowers deployment costs. The algorithms were tested in four distinct traffic scenarios using seven evaluation metrics to comprehensively assess performance. Simulation results demonstrate that both RL algorithms significantly outperform conventional traffic signal control systems, highlighting their potential to improve urban traffic flow efficiently.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ganesh Prasath Ramani, Shirish Karande, Santhosh V, Yash Bhatia</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as formidable instruments capable of comprehending and producing human-like text. This paper explores the potential of LLMs, to shape user perspectives and subsequently influence their decisions on particular tasks. This capability finds applications in diverse domains such as Investment, Credit cards and Insurance, wherein they assist users in selecting appropriate insurance policies, investment plans, Credit cards, Retail, as well as in Behavioral Change Support Systems (BCSS).
  We present a sophisticated multi-agent framework wherein a consortium of agents operate in collaborative manner. The primary agent engages directly with user agents through persuasive dialogue, while the auxiliary agents perform tasks such as information retrieval, response analysis, development of persuasion strategies, and validation of facts. Empirical evidence from our experiments demonstrates that this collaborative methodology significantly enhances the persuasive efficacy of the LLM. We continuously analyze the resistance of the user agent to persuasive efforts and counteract it by employing a combination of rule-based and LLM-based resistance-persuasion mapping techniques.
  We employ simulated personas and generate conversations in insurance, banking, and retail domains to evaluate the proficiency of large language models (LLMs) in recognizing, adjusting to, and influencing various personality types. Concurrently, we examine the resistance mechanisms employed by LLM simulated personas. Persuasion is quantified via measurable surveys before and after interaction, LLM-generated scores on conversation, and user decisions (purchase or non-purchase).</p>

<p>Abstract: Image colorization estimates RGB colors for grayscale images or video frames to improve their aesthetic and perceptual quality. Over the last decade, deep learning techniques for image colorization have significantly progressed, necessitating a systematic survey and benchmarking of these techniques. This article presents a comprehensive survey of recent state-of-the-art deep learning-based image colorization techniques, describing their fundamental block architectures, inputs, optimizers, loss functions, training protocols, training data, etc. It categorizes the existing colorization techniques into seven classes and discusses important factors governing their performance, such as benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics. We highlight the limitations of existing datasets and introduce a new dataset specific to colorization. We perform an extensive experimental evaluation of existing image colorization methods using both existing datasets and our proposed one. Finally, we discuss the limitations of existing methods and recommend possible solutions and future research directions for this rapidly evolving topic of deep image colorization.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nancy Bhutani, Soumen Pachal, Avinash Achar</p>
<p>Abstract: Arrival/Travel times for public transit exhibit variability on account of factors like seasonality, dwell times at bus stops, traffic signals, travel demand fluctuation etc. The developing world in particular is plagued by additional factors like lack of lane discipline, excess vehicles, diverse modes of transport and so on. This renders the bus arrival time prediction (BATP) to be a challenging problem especially in the developing world. A novel data-driven model based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) is proposed for BATP (in real-time) in the current work. The model intelligently incorporates both spatial and temporal correlations in a unique (non-linear) fashion distinct from existing approaches. In particular, we propose a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) based Encoder-Decoder(ED) OR Seq2Seq RNN model (originally introduced for language translation) for BATP. The geometry of the dynamic real time BATP problem enables a nice fit with the Encoder-Decoder based RNN structure. We feed relevant additional synchronized inputs (from previous trips) at each step of the decoder (a feature classically unexplored in machine translation applications). Further motivated from accurately modelling congestion influences on travel time prediction, we additionally propose to use a bidirectional layer at the decoder (something unexplored in other time-series based ED application contexts). The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated on real field data collected from challenging traffic conditions. Our experiments indicate that the proposed method outperforms diverse existing state-of-art data-driven approaches proposed for the same problem.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Borui Cai, Yong Xiang, Longxiang Gao, Di Wu, He Zhang, Jiong Jin, Tom Luan</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) that maps entities and relations into vector representations is essential for downstream applications. Conventional KGE methods require high-dimensional representations to learn the complex structure of knowledge graph, but lead to oversized model parameters. Recent advances reduce parameters by low-dimensional entity representations, while developing techniques (e.g., knowledge distillation or reinvented representation forms) to compensate for reduced dimension. However, such operations introduce complicated computations and model designs that may not benefit large knowledge graphs. To seek a simple strategy to improve the parameter efficiency of conventional KGE models, we take inspiration from that deeper neural networks require exponentially fewer parameters to achieve expressiveness comparable to wider networks for compositional structures. We view all entity representations as a single-layer embedding network, and conventional KGE methods that adopt high-dimensional entity representations equal widening the embedding network to gain expressiveness. To achieve parameter efficiency, we instead propose a deeper embedding network for entity representations, i.e., a narrow entity embedding layer plus a multi-layer dimension lifting network (LiftNet). Experiments on three public datasets show that by integrating LiftNet, four conventional KGE methods with 16-dimensional representations achieve comparable link prediction accuracy as original models that adopt 512-dimensional representations, saving 68.4% to 96.9% parameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sourav Das, Guglielmo Camporese, Shaokang Cheng, Lamberto Ballan</p>
<p>Abstract: Long-term trajectory forecasting is an important and challenging problem in the fields of computer vision, machine learning, and robotics. One fundamental difficulty stands in the evolution of the trajectory that becomes more and more uncertain and unpredictable as the time horizon grows, subsequently increasing the complexity of the problem. To overcome this issue, in this paper, we propose Di-Long, a new method that employs the distillation of a short-term trajectory model forecaster that guides a student network for long-term trajectory prediction during the training process. Given a total sequence length that comprehends the allowed observation for the student network and the complementary target sequence, we let the student and the teacher solve two different related tasks defined over the same full trajectory: the student observes a short sequence and predicts a long trajectory, whereas the teacher observes a longer sequence and predicts the remaining short target trajectory. The teacher's task is less uncertain, and we use its accurate predictions to guide the student through our knowledge distillation framework, reducing long-term future uncertainty. Our experiments show that our proposed Di-Long method is effective for long-term forecasting and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Intersection Drone Dataset (inD) and the Stanford Drone Dataset (SDD).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhixian Wang, Qingsong Wen, Chaoli Zhang, Liang Sun, Yi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Electrical load forecasting plays a crucial role in decision-making for power systems, including unit commitment and economic dispatch. The integration of renewable energy sources and the occurrence of external events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have rapidly increased uncertainties in load forecasting. The uncertainties in load forecasting can be divided into two types: epistemic uncertainty and aleatoric uncertainty. Separating these types of uncertainties can help decision-makers better understand where and to what extent the uncertainty is, thereby enhancing their confidence in the following decision-making. This paper proposes a diffusion-based Seq2Seq structure to estimate epistemic uncertainty and employs the robust additive Cauchy distribution to estimate aleatoric uncertainty. Our method not only ensures the accuracy of load forecasting but also demonstrates the ability to separate the two types of uncertainties and be applicable to different levels of loads.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonas Oppenlaender</p>
<p>Abstract: Humankind is entering a novel creative era in which anybody can synthesize digital information using generative artificial intelligence (AI). Text-to-image generation, in particular, has become vastly popular and millions of practitioners produce AI-generated images and AI art online. This chapter first gives an overview of the key developments that enabled a healthy co-creative online ecosystem around text-to-image generation to rapidly emerge, followed by a high-level description of key elements in this ecosystem. A particular focus is placed on prompt engineering, a creative practice that has been embraced by the AI art community. It is then argued that the emerging co-creative ecosystem constitutes an intelligent system on its own - a system that both supports human creativity, but also potentially entraps future generations and limits future development efforts in AI. The chapter discusses the potential risks and dangers of cultivating this co-creative ecosystem, such as the bias inherent in today's training data, potential quality degradation in future image generation systems due to synthetic data becoming common place, and the potential long-term effects of text-to-image generation on people's imagination, ambitions, and development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sakina Fatima, Hadi Hemmati, Lionel Briand</p>
<p>Abstract: Flaky tests are problematic because they non-deterministically pass or fail for the same software version under test, causing confusion and wasting development effort. While machine learning models have been used to predict flakiness and its root causes, there is much less work on providing support to fix the problem. To address this gap, in this paper, we focus on predicting the type of fix that is required to remove flakiness and then repair the test code on that basis. We do this for a subset of flaky tests where the root cause of flakiness is in the test itself and not in the production code. One key idea is to guide the repair process with additional knowledge about the test's flakiness in the form of its predicted fix category. Thus, we first propose a framework that automatically generates labeled datasets for 13 fix categories and trains models to predict the fix category of a flaky test by analyzing the test code only. Our experimental results using code models and few-shot learning show that we can correctly predict most of the fix categories. To show the usefulness of such fix category labels for automatically repairing flakiness, we augment the prompts of GPT-3.5 Turbo, a Large Language Model (LLM), with such extra knowledge to request repair suggestions. The results show that our suggested fix category labels, complemented with in-context learning, significantly enhance the capability of GPT-3.5 Turbo in generating fixes for flaky tests. Based on the execution and analysis of a sample of GPT-repaired flaky tests, we estimate that a large percentage of such repairs (roughly between 51% and 83%) can be expected to pass. For the failing repaired tests, on average, 16% of the test code needs to be further changed for them to pass.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yonglin Li, Jing Zhang, Xiao Teng, Long Lan, Xinwang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has gained significant attention for its impressive performance in image segmentation. However, it lacks proficiency in referring video object segmentation (RVOS) due to the need for precise user-interactive prompts and a limited understanding of different modalities, such as language and vision. This paper presents the RefSAM model, which explores the potential of SAM for RVOS by incorporating multi-view information from diverse modalities and successive frames at different timestamps in an online manner. Our proposed approach adapts the original SAM model to enhance cross-modality learning by employing a lightweight Cross-Modal MLP that projects the text embedding of the referring expression into sparse and dense embeddings, serving as user-interactive prompts. Additionally, we have introduced the hierarchical dense attention module to fuse hierarchical visual semantic information with sparse embeddings to obtain fine-grained dense embeddings, and an implicit tracking module to generate a tracking token and provide historical information for the mask decoder. Furthermore, we employ a parameter-efficient tuning strategy to align and fuse the language and vision features effectively. Through comprehensive ablation studies, we demonstrate our model's practical and effective design choices. Extensive experiments conducted on Refer-Youtube-VOS, Ref-DAVIS17, and three referring image segmentation datasets validate the superiority and effectiveness of our RefSAM model over existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shreyas Vaidya, Arvind Kumar Sharma, Prajwal Gatti, Anand Mishra</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we study the task of ``visually'' translating scene text from a source language (e.g., Hindi) to a target language (e.g., English). Visual translation involves not just the recognition and translation of scene text but also the generation of the translated image that preserves visual features of the source scene text, such as font, size, and background. There are several challenges associated with this task, such as translation with limited context, deciding between translation and transliteration, accommodating varying text lengths within fixed spatial boundaries, and preserving the font and background styles of the source scene text in the target language. To address this problem, we make the following contributions: (i) We study visual translation as a standalone problem for the first time in the literature. (ii) We present a cascaded framework for visual translation that combines state-of-the-art modules for scene text recognition, machine translation, and scene text synthesis as a baseline for the task. (iii) We propose a set of task-specific design enhancements to design a variant of the baseline to obtain performance improvements. (iv) Currently, the existing related literature lacks any comprehensive performance evaluation for this novel task. To fill this gap, we introduce several automatic and user-assisted evaluation metrics designed explicitly for evaluating visual translation. Further, we evaluate presented baselines for translating scene text between Hindi and English. Our experiments demonstrate that although we can effectively perform visual translation over a large collection of scene text images, the presented baseline only partially addresses challenges posed by visual translation tasks. We firmly believe that this new task and the limitations of existing models, as reported in this paper, should encourage further research in visual translation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Carlos E. Luis, Alessandro G. Bottero, Julia Vinogradska, Felix Berkenkamp, Jan Peters</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantifying uncertainty about a policy's long-term performance is important to solve sequential decision-making tasks. We study the problem from a model-based Bayesian reinforcement learning perspective, where the goal is to learn the posterior distribution over value functions induced by parameter (epistemic) uncertainty of the Markov decision process. Previous work restricts the analysis to a few moments of the distribution over values or imposes a particular distribution shape, e.g., Gaussians. Inspired by distributional reinforcement learning, we introduce a Bellman operator whose fixed-point is the value distribution function. Based on our theory, we propose Epistemic Quantile-Regression (EQR), a model-based algorithm that learns a value distribution function. We combine EQR with soft actor-critic (SAC) for policy optimization with an arbitrary differentiable objective function of the learned value distribution. Evaluation across several continuous-control tasks shows performance benefits with respect to both model-based and model-free algorithms.

<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has proven effective in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences, but gathering high-quality preference labels is expensive. RL from AI Feedback (RLAIF), introduced in Bai et al., offers a promising alternative that trains the reward model (RM) on preferences generated by an off-the-shelf LLM. Across the tasks of summarization, helpful dialogue generation, and harmless dialogue generation, we show that RLAIF achieves comparable performance to RLHF. Furthermore, we take a step towards "self-improvement" by demonstrating that RLAIF can outperform a supervised fine-tuned baseline even when the AI labeler is the same size as the policy, or even the exact same checkpoint as the initial policy. Finally, we introduce direct-RLAIF (d-RLAIF) - a technique that circumvents RM training by obtaining rewards directly from an off-the-shelf LLM during RL, which achieves superior performance to canonical RLAIF. Our results suggest that RLAIF can achieve performance on-par with using human feedback, offering a potential solution to the scalability limitations of RLHF.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Lu, Wenxuan Li, Mi Zhang, Xudong Pan, Min Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: To protect the intellectual property of well-trained deep neural networks (DNNs), black-box watermarks, which are embedded into the prediction behavior of DNN models on a set of specially-crafted samples and extracted from suspect models using only API access, have gained increasing popularity in both academy and industry. Watermark robustness is usually implemented against attackers who steal the protected model and obfuscate its parameters for watermark removal. However, current robustness evaluations are primarily performed under moderate attacks or unrealistic settings. Existing removal attacks could only crack a small subset of the mainstream black-box watermarks, and fall short in four key aspects: incomplete removal, reliance on prior knowledge of the watermark, performance degradation, and high dependency on data.
  In this paper, we propose a watermark-agnostic removal attack called \textsc{Neural Dehydration} (\textit{abbrev.} \textsc{Dehydra}), which effectively erases all ten mainstream black-box watermarks from DNNs, with only limited or even no data dependence. In general, our attack pipeline exploits the internals of the protected model to recover and unlearn the watermark message. We further design target class detection and recovered sample splitting algorithms to reduce the utility loss and achieve data-free watermark removal on five of the watermarking schemes. We conduct comprehensive evaluation of \textsc{Dehydra} against ten mainstream black-box watermarks on three benchmark datasets and DNN architectures. Compared with existing removal attacks, \textsc{Dehydra} achieves strong removal effectiveness across all the covered watermarks, preserving at least $90\%$ of the stolen model utility, under the data-limited settings, i.e., less than $2\%$ of the training data or even data-free.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lanning Wei, Huan Zhao, Xiaohan Zheng, Zhiqiang He, Quanming Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: Designing versatile graph learning approaches is important, considering the diverse graphs and tasks existing in real-world applications. Existing methods have attempted to achieve this target through automated machine learning techniques, pre-training and fine-tuning strategies, and large language models. However, these methods are not versatile enough for graph learning, as they work on either limited types of graphs or a single task. In this paper, we propose to explore versatile graph learning approaches with LLM-based agents, and the key insight is customizing the graph learning procedures for diverse graphs and tasks. To achieve this, we develop several LLM-based agents, equipped with diverse profiles, tools, functions and human experience. They collaborate to configure each procedure with task and data-specific settings step by step towards versatile solutions, and the proposed method is dubbed GL-Agent. By evaluating on diverse tasks and graphs, the correct results of the agent and its comparable performance showcase the versatility of the proposed method, especially in complex scenarios.The low resource cost and the potential to use open-source LLMs highlight the efficiency of GL-Agent.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiwei Guo, Chenpeng Du, Ziyang Ma, Xie Chen, Kai Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Although diffusion models in text-to-speech have become a popular choice due to their strong generative ability, the intrinsic complexity of sampling from diffusion models harms their efficiency. Alternatively, we propose VoiceFlow, an acoustic model that utilizes a rectified flow matching algorithm to achieve high synthesis quality with a limited number of sampling steps. VoiceFlow formulates the process of generating mel-spectrograms into an ordinary differential equation conditional on text inputs, whose vector field is then estimated. The rectified flow technique then effectively straightens its sampling trajectory for efficient synthesis. Subjective and objective evaluations on both single and multi-speaker corpora showed the superior synthesis quality of VoiceFlow compared to the diffusion counterpart. Ablation studies further verified the validity of the rectified flow technique in VoiceFlow.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chi-en Amy Tai, Matthew Keller, Saeejith Nair, Yuhao Chen, Yifan Wu, Olivia Markham, Krish Parmar, Pengcheng Xi, Heather Keller, Sharon Kirkpatrick, Alexander Wong</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate dietary intake estimation is critical for informing policies and programs to support healthy eating, as malnutrition has been directly linked to decreased quality of life. However self-reporting methods such as food diaries suffer from substantial bias. Other conventional dietary assessment techniques and emerging alternative approaches such as mobile applications incur high time costs and may necessitate trained personnel. Recent work has focused on using computer vision and machine learning to automatically estimate dietary intake from food images, but the lack of comprehensive datasets with diverse viewpoints, modalities and food annotations hinders the accuracy and realism of such methods. To address this limitation, we introduce NutritionVerse-Synth, the first large-scale dataset of 84,984 photorealistic synthetic 2D food images with associated dietary information and multimodal annotations (including depth images, instance masks, and semantic masks). Additionally, we collect a real image dataset, NutritionVerse-Real, containing 889 images of 251 dishes to evaluate realism. Leveraging these novel datasets, we develop and benchmark NutritionVerse, an empirical study of various dietary intake estimation approaches, including indirect segmentation-based and direct prediction networks. We further fine-tune models pretrained on synthetic data with real images to provide insights into the fusion of synthetic and real data. Finally, we release both datasets (NutritionVerse-Synth, NutritionVerse-Real) on https://www.kaggle.com/nutritionverse/datasets as part of an open initiative to accelerate machine learning for dietary sensing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shengyu Mao, Xiaohan Wang, Mengru Wang, Yong Jiang, Pengjun Xie, Fei Huang, Ningyu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative task focused on editing the personality traits of Large Language Models (LLMs). This task seeks to adjust the models' responses to opinion-related questions on specified topics since an individual's personality often manifests in the form of their expressed opinions, thereby showcasing different personality traits. Specifically, we construct PersonalityEdit, a new benchmark dataset to address this task. Drawing on the theory in Social Psychology, we isolate three representative traits, namely Neuroticism, Extraversion, and Agreeableness, as the foundation for our benchmark. We then gather data using GPT-4, generating responses that align with a specified topic and embody the targeted personality trait. We conduct comprehensive experiments involving various baselines and discuss the representation of personality behavior in LLMs. Our findings uncover potential challenges of the proposed task, illustrating several remaining issues. We anticipate that our work can stimulate further annotation in model editing and personality-related research. Code is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/EasyEdit.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chao Feng, Alberto Huertas Celdran, Janosch Baltensperger, Enrique Tomas Martinez Beltran, Gerome Bovet, Burkhard Stiller</p>
<p>Abstract: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) emerges as an innovative paradigm to train collaborative models, addressing the single point of failure limitation. However, the security and trustworthiness of FL and DFL are compromised by poisoning attacks, negatively impacting its performance. Existing defense mechanisms have been designed for centralized FL and they do not adequately exploit the particularities of DFL. Thus, this work introduces Sentinel, a defense strategy to counteract poisoning attacks in DFL. Sentinel leverages the accessibility of local data and defines a three-step aggregation protocol consisting of similarity filtering, bootstrap validation, and normalization to safeguard against malicious model updates. Sentinel has been evaluated with diverse datasets and data distributions. Besides, various poisoning attack types and threat levels have been verified. The results improve the state-of-the-art performance against both untargeted and targeted poisoning attacks when data follows an IID (Independent and Identically Distributed) configuration. Besides, under non-IID configuration, it is analyzed how performance degrades both for Sentinel and other state-of-the-art robust aggregation methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhikai Xue, Guoxiu He, Zhuoren Jiang, Sichen Gu, Yangyang Kang, Star Zhao, Wei Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: The scientific impact of academic papers is influenced by intricate factors such as dynamic popularity and inherent contribution. Existing models typically rely on static graphs for citation count estimation, failing to differentiate among its sources. In contrast, we propose distinguishing effects derived from various factors and predicting citation increments as estimated potential impacts within the dynamic context. In this research, we introduce a novel model, DPPDCC, which Disentangles the Potential impacts of Papers into Diffusion, Conformity, and Contribution values. It encodes temporal and structural features within dynamic heterogeneous graphs derived from the citation networks and applies various auxiliary tasks for disentanglement. By emphasizing comparative and co-cited/citing information and aggregating snapshots evolutionarily, DPPDCC captures knowledge flow within the citation network. Afterwards, popularity is outlined by contrasting augmented graphs to extract the essence of citation diffusion and predicting citation accumulation bins for quantitative conformity modeling. Orthogonal constraints ensure distinct modeling of each perspective, preserving the contribution value. To gauge generalization across publication times and replicate the realistic dynamic context, we partition data based on specific time points and retain all samples without strict filtering. Extensive experiments on three datasets validate DPPDCC's superiority over baselines for papers published previously, freshly, and immediately, with further analyses confirming its robustness.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Branislav Pecher, Ivan Srba, Maria Bielikova</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning with limited labelled data, such as prompting, in-context learning, fine-tuning, meta-learning or few-shot learning, aims to effectively train a model using only a small amount of labelled samples. However, these approaches have been observed to be excessively sensitive to the effects of uncontrolled randomness caused by non-determinism in the training process. The randomness negatively affects the stability of the models, leading to large variances in results across training runs. When such sensitivity is disregarded, it can unintentionally, but unfortunately also intentionally, create an imaginary perception of research progress. Recently, this area started to attract research attention and the number of relevant studies is continuously growing. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of 415 papers addressing the effects of randomness on the stability of learning with limited labelled data. We distinguish between four main tasks addressed in the papers (investigate/evaluate; determine; mitigate; benchmark/compare/report randomness effects), providing findings for each one. Furthermore, we identify and discuss seven challenges and open problems together with possible directions to facilitate further research. The ultimate goal of this survey is to emphasise the importance of this growing research area, which so far has not received an appropriate level of attention, and reveal impactful directions for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuntao Shou, Wei Ai, Tao Meng, Nan Yin, Keqin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The age estimation task aims to predict the age of an individual by analyzing facial features in an image. The development of age estimation can improve the efficiency and accuracy of various applications (e.g., age verification and secure access control, etc.). In recent years, contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) has been widely used in various multimodal tasks and has made some progress in the field of age estimation. However, existing CLIP-based age estimation methods require high memory usage (quadratic complexity) when globally modeling images, and lack an error feedback mechanism to prompt the model about the quality of age prediction results. To tackle the above issues, we propose a novel CLIP-driven Image-Language Fusion for Correcting Inverse Age Estimation (CILF-CIAE). Specifically, we first introduce the CLIP model to extract image features and text semantic information respectively, and map them into a highly semantically aligned high-dimensional feature space. Next, we designed a new Transformer architecture (i.e., FourierFormer) to achieve channel evolution and spatial interaction of images, and to fuse image and text semantic information. Compared with the quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism, the proposed Fourierformer is of linear log complexity. To further narrow the semantic gap between image and text features, we utilize an efficient contrastive multimodal learning module that supervises the multimodal fusion process of FourierFormer through contrastive loss for image-text matching, thereby improving the interaction effect between different modalities. Finally, we introduce reversible age estimation, which uses end-to-end error feedback to reduce the error rate of age predictions. Through extensive experiments on multiple data sets, CILF-CIAE has achieved better age prediction results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuntao Shou, Wei Ai, Tao Meng, Nan Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Remote sensing segmentation has a wide range of applications in environmental protection, and urban change detection, etc. Despite the success of deep learning-based remote sensing segmentation methods (e.g., CNN and Transformer), they are not flexible enough to model irregular objects. In addition, existing graph contrastive learning methods usually adopt the way of maximizing mutual information to keep the node representations consistent between different graph views, which may cause the model to learn task-independent redundant information. To tackle the above problems, this paper treats images as graph structures and introduces a simple contrastive vision GNN (SC-ViG) architecture for remote sensing segmentation. Specifically, we construct a node-masked and edge-masked graph view to obtain an optimal graph structure representation, which can adaptively learn whether to mask nodes and edges. Furthermore, this paper innovatively introduces information bottleneck theory into graph contrastive learning to maximize task-related information while minimizing task-independent redundant information. Finally, we replace the convolutional module in UNet with the SC-ViG module to complete the segmentation and classification tasks of remote sensing images. Extensive experiments on publicly available real datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art remote sensing image segmentation methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junhyuk So, Jungwon Lee, Eunhyeok Park</p>
<p>Abstract: The substantial computational costs of diffusion models, especially due to the repeated denoising steps necessary for high-quality image generation, present a major obstacle to their widespread adoption. While several studies have attempted to address this issue by reducing the number of score function evaluations (NFE) using advanced ODE solvers without fine-tuning, the decreased number of denoising iterations misses the opportunity to update fine details, resulting in noticeable quality degradation. In our work, we introduce an advanced acceleration technique that leverages the temporal redundancy inherent in diffusion models. Reusing feature maps with high temporal similarity opens up a new opportunity to save computation resources without compromising output quality. To realize the practical benefits of this intuition, we conduct an extensive analysis and propose a novel method, FRDiff. FRDiff is designed to harness the advantages of both reduced NFE and feature reuse, achieving a Pareto frontier that balances fidelity and latency trade-offs in various generative tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a versatile framework for optimizing long-term goals. Although many real-world problems can be formalized with RL, learning and deploying a performant RL policy requires a system designed to address several important challenges, including the exploration-exploitation dilemma, partial observability, dynamic action spaces, and safety concerns. While the importance of these challenges has been well recognized, existing open-source RL libraries do not explicitly address them. This paper introduces Pearl, a Production-Ready RL software package designed to embrace these challenges in a modular way. In addition to presenting benchmarking results, we also highlight examples of Pearl's ongoing industry adoption to demonstrate its advantages for production use cases. Pearl is open sourced on GitHub at github.com/facebookresearch/pearl and its official website is pearlagent.github.io.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the machine learning ecosystem, hardware selection is often regarded as a mere utility, overshadowed by the spotlight on algorithms and data. This oversight is particularly problematic in contexts like ML-as-a-service platforms, where users often lack control over the hardware used for model deployment. How does the choice of hardware impact generalization properties? This paper investigates the influence of hardware on the delicate balance between model performance and fairness. We demonstrate that hardware choices can exacerbate existing disparities, attributing these discrepancies to variations in gradient flows and loss surfaces across different demographic groups. Through both theoretical and empirical analysis, the paper not only identifies the underlying factors but also proposes an effective strategy for mitigating hardware-induced performance imbalances.</p>

<p>Abstract: As corporations rush to integrate large language models (LLMs) to their search offerings, it is critical that they provide factually accurate information that is robust to any presuppositions that a user may express. In this work, we introduce UPHILL, a dataset consisting of health-related queries with varying degrees of presuppositions. Using UPHILL, we evaluate the factual accuracy and consistency of InstructGPT, ChatGPT, and BingChat models. We find that while model responses rarely disagree with true health claims (posed as questions), they often fail to challenge false claims: responses from InstructGPT agree with 32% of the false claims, ChatGPT 26% and BingChat 23%. As we increase the extent of presupposition in input queries, the responses from InstructGPT and ChatGPT agree with the claim considerably more often, regardless of its veracity. Responses from BingChat, which rely on retrieved webpages, are not as susceptible. Given the moderate factual accuracy, and the inability of models to consistently correct false assumptions, our work calls for a careful assessment of current LLMs for use in high-stakes scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (DocVQA) has quickly grown into a central task of document understanding. But despite the fact that documents contain sensitive or copyrighted information, none of the current DocVQA methods offers strong privacy guarantees. In this work, we explore privacy in the domain of DocVQA for the first time, highlighting privacy issues in state of the art multi-modal LLM models used for DocVQA, and explore possible solutions. Specifically, we focus on invoice processing as a realistic document understanding scenario, and propose a large scale DocVQA dataset comprising invoice documents and associated questions and answers. We employ a federated learning scheme, that reflects the real-life distribution of documents in different businesses, and we explore the use case where the data of the invoice provider is the sensitive information to be protected. We demonstrate that non-private models tend to memorise, a behaviour that can lead to exposing private information. We then evaluate baseline training schemes employing federated learning and differential privacy in this multi-modal scenario, where the sensitive information might be exposed through either or both of the two input modalities: vision (document image) or language (OCR tokens). Finally, we design attacks exploiting the memorisation effect of the model, and demonstrate their effectiveness in probing a representative DocVQA models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Ai, Yuntao Shou, Tao Meng, Nan Yin, Keqin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: With the continuous development of deep learning (DL), the task of multimodal dialogue emotion recognition (MDER) has recently received extensive research attention, which is also an essential branch of DL. The MDER aims to identify the emotional information contained in different modalities, e.g., text, video, and audio, in different dialogue scenes. However, existing research has focused on modeling contextual semantic information and dialogue relations between speakers while ignoring the impact of event relations on emotion. To tackle the above issues, we propose a novel Dialogue and Event Relation-Aware Graph Convolutional Neural Network for Multimodal Emotion Recognition (DER-GCN) method. It models dialogue relations between speakers and captures latent event relations information. Specifically, we construct a weighted multi-relationship graph to simultaneously capture the dependencies between speakers and event relations in a dialogue. Moreover, we also introduce a Self-Supervised Masked Graph Autoencoder (SMGAE) to improve the fusion representation ability of features and structures. Next, we design a new Multiple Information Transformer (MIT) to capture the correlation between different relations, which can provide a better fuse of the multivariate information between relations. Finally, we propose a loss optimization strategy based on contrastive learning to enhance the representation learning ability of minority class features. We conduct extensive experiments on the IEMOCAP and MELD benchmark datasets, which verify the effectiveness of the DER-GCN model. The results demonstrate that our model significantly improves both the average accuracy and the f1 value of emotion recognition.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiao Wang, Jiandong Jin, Chenglong Li, Jin Tang, Cheng Zhang, Wei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing pedestrian attribute recognition (PAR) algorithms adopt pre-trained CNN (e.g., ResNet) as their backbone network for visual feature learning, which might obtain sub-optimal results due to the insufficient employment of the relations between pedestrian images and attribute labels. In this paper, we formulate PAR as a vision-language fusion problem and fully exploit the relations between pedestrian images and attribute labels. Specifically, the attribute phrases are first expanded into sentences, and then the pre-trained vision-language model CLIP is adopted as our backbone for feature embedding of visual images and attribute descriptions. The contrastive learning objective connects the vision and language modalities well in the CLIP-based feature space, and the Transformer layers used in CLIP can capture the long-range relations between pixels. Then, a multi-modal Transformer is adopted to fuse the dual features effectively and feed-forward network is used to predict attributes. To optimize our network efficiently, we propose the region-aware prompt tuning technique to adjust very few parameters (i.e., only the prompt vectors and classification heads) and fix both the pre-trained VL model and multi-modal Transformer. Our proposed PAR algorithm only adjusts 0.75% learnable parameters compared with the fine-tuning strategy. It also achieves new state-of-the-art performance on both standard and zero-shot settings for PAR, including RAPv1, RAPv2, WIDER, PA100K, and PETA-ZS, RAP-ZS datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Naveen Raman, Mateo Espinosa Zarlenga, Juyeon Heo, Mateja Jamnik</p>
<p>Abstract: Concept-based methods explain model predictions using human-understandable concepts. These models require accurate concept predictors, yet the faithfulness of existing concept predictors to their underlying concepts is unclear. In this paper, we investigate the faithfulness of Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs), a popular family of concept-based architectures, by looking at whether they respect "localities" in datasets. Localities involve using only relevant features when predicting a concept's value. When localities are not considered, concepts may be predicted based on spuriously correlated features, degrading performance and robustness. This work examines how CBM predictions change when perturbing model inputs, and reveals that CBMs may not capture localities, even when independent concepts are localised to non-overlapping feature subsets. Our empirical and theoretical results demonstrate that datasets with correlated concepts may lead to accurate but uninterpretable models that fail to learn localities. Overall, we find that CBM interpretability is fragile, as CBMs occasionally rely upon spurious features, necessitating further research into the robustness of concept predictors.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent studies indicate that Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 with Vision (GPT-4V) outperforms human physicians in medical challenge tasks. However, these evaluations primarily focused on the accuracy of multi-choice questions alone. Our study extends the current scope by conducting a comprehensive analysis of GPT-4V's rationales of image comprehension, recall of medical knowledge, and step-by-step multimodal reasoning when solving New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) Image Challenges - an imaging quiz designed to test the knowledge and diagnostic capabilities of medical professionals. Evaluation results confirmed that GPT-4V performs comparatively to human physicians regarding multi-choice accuracy (81.6% vs. 77.8%). GPT-4V also performs well in cases where physicians incorrectly answer, with over 78% accuracy. However, we discovered that GPT-4V frequently presents flawed rationales in cases where it makes the correct final choices (35.5%), most prominent in image comprehension (27.2%). Regardless of GPT-4V's high accuracy in multi-choice questions, our findings emphasize the necessity for further in-depth evaluations of its rationales before integrating such multimodal AI models into clinical workflows.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jishnu Ray Chowdhury, Cornelia Caragea</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we comprehensively study the inductive biases of two major approaches to augmenting Transformers with a recurrent mechanism: (1) the approach of incorporating a depth-wise recurrence similar to Universal Transformers; and (2) the approach of incorporating a chunk-wise temporal recurrence like Temporal Latent Bottleneck. Furthermore, we propose and investigate novel ways to extend and combine the above methods - for example, we propose a global mean-based dynamic halting mechanism for Universal Transformers and an augmentation of Temporal Latent Bottleneck with elements from Universal Transformer. We compare the models and probe their inductive biases in several diagnostic tasks, such as Long Range Arena (LRA), flip-flop language modeling, ListOps, and Logical Inference.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kawin Ethayarajh, Winnie Xu, Niklas Muennighoff, Dan Jurafsky, Douwe Kiela</p>
<p>Abstract: Kahneman & Tversky's $\textit{prospect theory}$ tells us that humans perceive random variables in a biased but well-defined manner (1992); for example, humans are famously loss-averse. We show that objectives for aligning LLMs with human feedback implicitly incorporate many of these biases -- the success of these objectives (e.g., DPO) over cross-entropy minimization can partly be ascribed to them belonging to a family of loss functions that we call $\textit{human-aware losses}$ (HALOs). However, the utility functions these methods attribute to humans still differ from those in the prospect theory literature. Using a Kahneman-Tversky model of human utility, we propose a HALO that directly maximizes the utility of generations instead of maximizing the log-likelihood of preferences, as current methods do. We call this approach KTO, and it matches or exceeds the performance of preference-based methods at scales from 1B to 30B, despite only learning from a binary signal of whether an output is desirable. More broadly, our work suggests that there is no one HALO that is universally superior; the best loss depends on the inductive biases most appropriate for a given setting, an oft-overlooked consideration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen Qian, Jie Zhang, Wei Yao, Dongrui Liu, Zhenfei Yin, Yu Qiao, Yong Liu, Jing Shao</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring the trustworthiness of large language models (LLMs) is crucial. Most studies concentrate on fully pre-trained LLMs to better understand and improve LLMs' trustworthiness. In this paper, to reveal the untapped potential of pre-training, we pioneer the exploration of LLMs' trustworthiness during this period, focusing on five key dimensions: reliability, privacy, toxicity, fairness, and robustness. To begin with, we apply linear probing to LLMs. The high probing accuracy suggests that \textit{LLMs in early pre-training can already distinguish concepts in each trustworthiness dimension}. Therefore, to further uncover the hidden possibilities of pre-training, we extract steering vectors from a LLM's pre-training checkpoints to enhance the LLM's trustworthiness. Finally, inspired by~\citet{choi2023understanding} that mutual information estimation is bounded by linear probing accuracy, we also probe LLMs with mutual information to investigate the dynamics of trustworthiness during pre-training. We are the first to observe a similar two-phase phenomenon: fitting and compression~\citep{shwartz2017opening}. This research provides an initial exploration of trustworthiness modeling during LLM pre-training, seeking to unveil new insights and spur further developments in the field. We will make our code publicly accessible at \url{https://github.com/ChnQ/TracingLLM}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liang Chen, Haozhe Zhao, Tianyu Liu, Shuai Bai, Junyang Lin, Chang Zhou, Baobao Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this study, we identify the inefficient attention phenomena in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), notably within prominent models like LLaVA-1.5, QwenVL-Chat and Video-LLaVA. We find out that the attention computation over visual tokens is of extreme inefficiency in the deep layers of popular LVLMs, suggesting a need for a sparser approach compared to textual data handling. To this end, we introduce FastV, a versatile plug-and-play method designed to optimize computational efficiency by learning adaptive attention patterns in early layers and pruning visual tokens in subsequent ones. Our evaluations demonstrate FastV's ability to dramatically reduce computational costs (e.g., a 45 reduction in FLOPs for LLaVA-1.5-13B) without sacrificing performance in a wide range of image and video understanding tasks. The computational efficiency and performance trade-off of FastV are highly customizable and pareto-efficient. It can compress the FLOPs of a 13B-parameter model to achieve a lower budget than that of a 7B-parameter model, while still maintaining superior performance. We believe FastV has practical values for deployment of LVLMs in edge devices and commercial models. Code is released at https://github.com/pkunlp-icler/FastV.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sara Sterlie, Nina Weng, Aasa Feragen</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative AI, such as large language models, has undergone rapid development within recent years. As these models become increasingly available to the public, concerns arise about perpetuating and amplifying harmful biases in applications. Gender stereotypes can be harmful and limiting for the individuals they target, whether they consist of misrepresentation or discrimination. Recognizing gender bias as a pervasive societal construct, this paper studies how to uncover and quantify the presence of gender biases in generative language models. In particular, we derive generative AI analogues of three well-known non-discrimination criteria from classification, namely independence, separation and sufficiency. To demonstrate these criteria in action, we design prompts for each of the criteria with a focus on occupational gender stereotype, specifically utilizing the medical test to introduce the ground truth in the generative AI context. Our results address the presence of occupational gender bias within such conversational language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Binqi Sun, Tomasz Kloda, Marco Caccamo</p>
<p>Abstract: The rigid gang task model is based on the idea of executing multiple threads simultaneously on a fixed number of processors to increase efficiency and performance. Although there is extensive literature on global rigid gang scheduling, partitioned approaches have several practical advantages (e.g., task isolation and reduced scheduling overheads). In this paper, we propose a new partitioned scheduling strategy for rigid gang tasks, named strict partitioning. The method creates disjoint partitions of tasks and processors to avoid inter-partition interference. Moreover, it tries to assign tasks with similar volumes (i.e., parallelisms) to the same partition so that the intra-partition interference can be reduced. Within each partition, the tasks can be scheduled using any type of scheduler, which allows the use of a less pessimistic schedulability test. Extensive synthetic experiments and a case study based on Edge TPU benchmarks show that strict partitioning achieves better schedulability performance than state-of-the-art global gang schedulability analyses for both preemptive and non-preemptive rigid gang task sets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyi Zhou, Ashish Sharma, Amy X. Zhang, Tim Althoff</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-world misinformation, often multimodal, can be partially or fully factual but misleading using diverse tactics like conflating correlation with causation. Such misinformation is severely understudied, challenging to address, and harms various social domains, particularly on social media, where it can spread rapidly. High-quality and timely correction of misinformation that identifies and explains its (in)accuracies effectively reduces false beliefs. Despite the wide acceptance of manual correction, it is difficult to be timely and scalable. While LLMs have versatile capabilities that could accelerate misinformation correction, they struggle due to a lack of recent information, a tendency to produce false content, and limitations in addressing multimodal information. We propose MUSE, an LLM augmented with access to and credibility evaluation of up-to-date information. By retrieving evidence as refutations or supporting context, MUSE identifies and explains content (in)accuracies with references. It conducts multimodal retrieval and interprets visual content to verify and correct multimodal content. Given the absence of a comprehensive evaluation approach, we propose 13 dimensions of misinformation correction quality. Then, fact-checking experts evaluate responses to social media content that are not presupposed to be misinformation but broadly include (partially) incorrect and correct posts that may (not) be misleading. Results demonstrate MUSE's ability to write high-quality responses to potential misinformation--across modalities, tactics, domains, political leanings, and for information that has not previously been fact-checked online--within minutes of its appearance on social media. Overall, MUSE outperforms GPT-4 by 37% and even high-quality responses from laypeople by 29%. Our work provides a general methodological and evaluative framework to correct misinformation at scale.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali Karami, Thi Kieu Khanh Ho, Narges Armanfard</p>
<p>Abstract: Skeleton-based video anomaly detection (SVAD) is a crucial task in computer vision. Accurately identifying abnormal patterns or events enables operators to promptly detect suspicious activities, thereby enhancing safety. Achieving this demands a comprehensive understanding of human motions, both at body and region levels, while also accounting for the wide variations of performing a single action. However, existing studies fail to simultaneously address these crucial properties. This paper introduces a novel, practical and lightweight framework, namely Graph-Jigsaw Conditioned Diffusion Model for Skeleton-based Video Anomaly Detection (GiCiSAD) to overcome the challenges associated with SVAD. GiCiSAD consists of three novel modules: the Graph Attention-based Forecasting module to capture the spatio-temporal dependencies inherent in the data, the Graph-level Jigsaw Puzzle Maker module to distinguish subtle region-level discrepancies between normal and abnormal motions, and the Graph-based Conditional Diffusion model to generate a wide spectrum of human motions. Extensive experiments on four widely used skeleton-based video datasets show that GiCiSAD outperforms existing methods with significantly fewer training parameters, establishing it as the new state-of-the-art.</p>

<p>Abstract: Neural Code Intelligence -- leveraging deep learning to understand, generate, and optimize code -- holds immense potential for transformative impacts on the whole society. Bridging the gap between Natural Language and Programming Language, this domain has drawn significant attention from researchers in both research communities over the past few years. This survey presents a systematic and chronological review of the advancements in code intelligence, encompassing over 50 representative models and their variants, more than 20 categories of tasks, and an extensive coverage of over 680 related works. We follow the historical progression to trace the paradigm shifts across different research phases (e.g., from modeling code with recurrent neural networks to the era of Large Language Models). Concurrently, we highlight the major technical transitions in models, tasks, and evaluations spanning through different stages. For applications, we also observe a co-evolving shift. It spans from initial endeavors to tackling specific scenarios, through exploring a diverse array of tasks during its rapid expansion, to currently focusing on tackling increasingly complex and varied real-world challenges. Building on our examination of the developmental trajectories, we further investigate the emerging synergies between code intelligence and broader machine intelligence, uncovering new cross-domain opportunities and illustrating the substantial influence of code intelligence across various domains. Finally, we delve into both the opportunities and challenges associated with this field, alongside elucidating our insights on the most promising research directions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> George Panagopoulos, Daniele Malitesta, Fragkiskos D. Malliaros, Jun Pang</p>
<p>Abstract: Estimating causal effects in e-commerce tends to involve costly treatment assignments which can be impractical in large-scale settings. Leveraging machine learning to predict such treatment effects without actual intervention is a standard practice to diminish the risk. However, existing methods for treatment effect prediction tend to rely on training sets of substantial size, which are built from real experiments and are thus inherently risky to create. In this work we propose a graph neural network to diminish the required training set size, relying on graphs that are common in e-commerce data. Specifically, we view the problem as node regression with a restricted number of labeled instances, develop a two-model neural architecture akin to previous causal effect estimators, and test varying message-passing layers for encoding. Furthermore, as an extra step, we combine the model with an acquisition function to guide the creation of the training set in settings with extremely low experimental budget. The framework is flexible since each step can be used separately with other models or treatment policies. The experiments on real large-scale networks indicate a clear advantage of our methodology over the state of the art, which in many cases performs close to random, underlining the need for models that can generalize with limited supervision to reduce experimental risks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhipeng Zhao, Bowen Li, Yi Du, Taimeng Fu, Chen Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Motion prediction is critical for autonomous off-road driving, however, it presents significantly more challenges than on-road driving because of the complex interaction between the vehicle and the terrain. Traditional physics-based approaches encounter difficulties in accurately modeling dynamic systems and external disturbance. In contrast, data-driven neural networks require extensive datasets and struggle with explicitly capturing the fundamental physical laws, which can easily lead to poor generalization. By merging the advantages of both methods, neuro-symbolic approaches present a promising direction. These methods embed physical laws into neural models, potentially significantly improving generalization capabilities. However, no prior works were evaluated in real-world settings for off-road driving. To bridge this gap, we present PhysORD, a neural-symbolic approach integrating the conservation law, i.e., the Euler-Lagrange equation, into data-driven neural models for motion prediction in off-road driving. Our experiments showed that PhysORD can accurately predict vehicle motion and tolerate external disturbance by modeling uncertainties. It outperforms existing methods both in accuracy and efficiency and demonstrates data-efficient learning and generalization ability in long-term prediction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xusen Guo (Frank), Qiming Zhang (Frank), Junyue Jiang (Frank), Mingxing Peng (Frank), Meixin Zhu (Frank),  Hao (Frank),  Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Traffic forecasting is crucial for intelligent transportation systems. It has experienced significant advancements thanks to the power of deep learning in capturing latent patterns of traffic data. However, recent deep-learning architectures require intricate model designs and lack an intuitive understanding of the mapping from input data to predicted results. Achieving both accuracy and explainability in traffic prediction models remains a challenge due to the complexity of traffic data and the inherent opacity of deep learning models. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Traffic flow Prediction model based on Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate explainable traffic predictions, named xTP-LLM. By transferring multi-modal traffic data into natural language descriptions, xTP-LLM captures complex time-series patterns and external factors from comprehensive traffic data. The LLM framework is fine-tuned using language-based instructions to align with spatial-temporal traffic flow data. Empirically, xTP-LLM shows competitive accuracy compared with deep learning baselines, while providing an intuitive and reliable explanation for predictions. This paper contributes to advancing explainable traffic prediction models and lays a foundation for future exploration of LLM applications in transportation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to use LLM for explainable prediction of traffic flows.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Vallstrom</p>
<p>Abstract: With an evolutionary approach, the basis of morality can be explained as adaptations to problems of cooperation. With 'evolution' taken in a broad sense, evolving AIs that satisfy the conditions for evolution to apply will be subject to the same cooperative evolutionary pressure as biological entities. Here the adaptiveness of increased cooperation as material safety and wealth increase is discussed -- for humans, for other societies, and for AIs. Diminishing beneficial returns from increased access to material resources also suggests the possibility that, on the whole, there will be no incentive to for instance colonize entire galaxies, thus providing a possible explanation of the Fermi paradox, wondering where everybody is. It is further argued that old societies could engender, give way to, super-AIs, since it is likely that super-AIs are feasible, and fitter. Closing is an aside on effective ways for morals and goals to affect life and society, emphasizing environments, cultures, and laws, and exemplified by how to eat.
  Appended are an algorithm for colonizing for example a galaxy quickly, models of the evolution of cooperation and fairness under diminishing returns, and software for simulating signaling development. It is also noted that there can be no exponential colonization or reproduction, for mathematical reasons, as each entity takes up a certain amount of space.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, generative AI (GenAI), like large language models and text-to-image models, has received significant attention across various domains. However, ensuring the responsible generation of content by these models is crucial for their real-world applicability. This raises an interesting question: What should responsible GenAI generate, and what should it not? To answer the question, this paper investigates the practical responsible requirements of both textual and visual generative models, outlining five key considerations: generating truthful content, avoiding toxic content, refusing harmful instruction, leaking no training data-related content, and ensuring generated content identifiable. Specifically, we review recent advancements and challenges in addressing these requirements. Besides, we discuss and emphasize the importance of responsible GenAI across healthcare, education, finance, and artificial general intelligence domains. Through a unified perspective on both textual and visual generative models, this paper aims to provide insights into practical safety-related issues and further benefit the community in building responsible GenAI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aounon Kumar, Himabindu Lakkaraju</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being integrated into search engines to provide natural language responses tailored to user queries. Customers and end-users are also becoming more dependent on these models for quick and easy purchase decisions. In this work, we investigate whether recommendations from LLMs can be manipulated to enhance a product's visibility. We demonstrate that adding a strategic text sequence (STS) -- a carefully crafted message -- to a product's information page can significantly increase its likelihood of being listed as the LLM's top recommendation. To understand the impact of STS, we use a catalog of fictitious coffee machines and analyze its effect on two target products: one that seldom appears in the LLM's recommendations and another that usually ranks second. We observe that the strategic text sequence significantly enhances the visibility of both products by increasing their chances of appearing as the top recommendation. This ability to manipulate LLM-generated search responses provides vendors with a considerable competitive advantage and has the potential to disrupt fair market competition. Just as search engine optimization (SEO) revolutionized how webpages are customized to rank higher in search engine results, influencing LLM recommendations could profoundly impact content optimization for AI-driven search services.

<p><b>Authors:</b> William Watson, Nicole Cho, Nishan Srishankar</p>
<p>Abstract: Hallucination continues to be one of the most critical challenges in the institutional adoption journey of Large Language Models (LLMs). While prior studies have primarily focused on the post-generation analysis and refinement of outputs, this paper centers on the effectiveness of queries in eliciting accurate responses from LLMs. We present HalluciBot, a model that estimates the query's propensity to hallucinate before generation, without invoking any LLMs during inference. HalluciBot can serve as a proxy reward model for query rewriting, offering a general framework to estimate query quality based on accuracy and consensus. In essence, HalluciBot investigates how poorly constructed queries can lead to erroneous outputs - moreover, by employing query rewriting guided by HalluciBot's empirical estimates, we demonstrate that 95.7% output accuracy can be achieved for Multiple Choice questions. The training procedure for HalluciBot consists of perturbing 369,837 queries n times, employing n+1 independent LLM agents, sampling an output from each query, conducting a Multi-Agent Monte Carlo simulation on the sampled outputs, and training an encoder classifier. The idea of perturbation is the outcome of our ablation studies that measures the increase in output diversity (+12.5 agreement spread) by perturbing a query in lexically different but semantically similar ways. Therefore, HalluciBot paves the way to ratiocinate (76.0% test F1 score, 46.6% in saved computation on hallucinatory queries), rewrite (+30.2% positive class transition from hallucinatory to non-hallucinatory), rank (+50.6% positive class transition from hallucinatory to non-hallucinatory), and route queries to effective pipelines.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce phi-3-mini, a 3.8 billion parameter language model trained on 3.3 trillion tokens, whose overall performance, as measured by both academic benchmarks and internal testing, rivals that of models such as Mixtral 8x7B and GPT-3.5 (e.g., phi-3-mini achieves 69% on MMLU and 8.38 on MT-bench), despite being small enough to be deployed on a phone. Our training dataset is a scaled-up version of the one used for phi-2, composed of heavily filtered publicly available web data and synthetic data. The model is also further aligned for robustness, safety, and chat format. We also provide parameter-scaling results with a 7B, 14B models trained for 4.8T tokens, called phi-3-small, phi-3-medium, both significantly more capable than phi-3-mini (e.g., respectively 75%, 78% on MMLU, and 8.7, 8.9 on MT-bench). To enhance multilingual, multimodal, and long-context capabilities, we introduce three models in the phi-3.5 series: phi-3.5-mini, phi-3.5-MoE, and phi-3.5-Vision. The phi-3.5-MoE, a 16 x 3.8B MoE model with 6.6 billion active parameters, achieves superior performance in language reasoning, math, and code tasks compared to other open-source models of similar scale, such as Llama 3.1 and the Mixtral series, and on par with Gemini-1.5-Flash and GPT-4o-mini. Meanwhile, phi-3.5-Vision, a 4.2 billion parameter model derived from phi-3.5-mini, excels in reasoning tasks and is adept at handling both single-image and text prompts, as well as multi-image and text prompts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xu Han, Yuan Tang, Zhaoxuan Wang, Xianzhi Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing Transformer-based models for point cloud analysis suffer from quadratic complexity, leading to compromised point cloud resolution and information loss. In contrast, the newly proposed Mamba model, based on state space models (SSM), outperforms Transformer in multiple areas with only linear complexity. However, the straightforward adoption of Mamba does not achieve satisfactory performance on point cloud tasks. In this work, we present Mamba3D, a state space model tailored for point cloud learning to enhance local feature extraction, achieving superior performance, high efficiency, and scalability potential. Specifically, we propose a simple yet effective Local Norm Pooling (LNP) block to extract local geometric features. Additionally, to obtain better global features, we introduce a bidirectional SSM (bi-SSM) with both a token forward SSM and a novel backward SSM that operates on the feature channel. Extensive experimental results show that Mamba3D surpasses Transformer-based counterparts and concurrent works in multiple tasks, with or without pre-training. Notably, Mamba3D achieves multiple SoTA, including an overall accuracy of 92.6% (train from scratch) on the ScanObjectNN and 95.1% (with single-modal pre-training) on the ModelNet40 classification task, with only linear complexity.

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive generalization capabilities on specific tasks with human-written instruction data. However, the limited quantity, diversity, and professional expertise of such instruction data raise concerns about the performance of LLMs in psychotherapy tasks when provided with domain-specific instructions. To address this, we firstly propose Domain-Specific Assistant Instructions based on AlexanderStreet therapy, and secondly, we use an adaption fine-tuning method and retrieval augmented generation method to improve pre-trained LLMs. Through quantitative evaluation of linguistic quality using automatic and human evaluation, we observe that pre-trained LLMs on Psychotherapy Assistant Instructions outperform state-of-the-art LLMs response baselines. Our Assistant-Instruction approach offers a half-annotation method to align pre-trained LLMs with instructions and provide pre-trained LLMs with more psychotherapy knowledge.</p>

<p>Abstract: The global decline in bee populations poses significant risks to agriculture, biodiversity, and environmental stability. To bridge the gap in existing data, we introduce ApisTox, a comprehensive dataset focusing on the toxicity of pesticides to honey bees (Apis mellifera). This dataset combines and leverages data from existing sources such as ECOTOX and PPDB, providing an extensive, consistent, and curated collection that surpasses the previous datasets. ApisTox incorporates a wide array of data, including toxicity levels for chemicals, details such as time of their publication in literature, and identifiers linking them to external chemical databases. This dataset may serve as an important tool for environmental and agricultural research, but also can support the development of policies and practices aimed at minimizing harm to bee populations. Finally, ApisTox offers a unique resource for benchmarking molecular property prediction methods on agrochemical compounds, facilitating advancements in both environmental science and cheminformatics. This makes it a valuable tool for both academic research and practical applications in bee conservation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values and preferences is essential for making them helpful and safe. However, building efficient tools to perform alignment can be challenging, especially for the largest and most competent LLMs which often contain tens or hundreds of billions of parameters. We create NeMo-Aligner, a toolkit for model alignment that can efficiently scale to a thousand GPUs for training the largest open-source LLMs such as Nemotron 4 340B and Llama 3.1 405B. NeMo-Aligner comes with highly optimized and scalable implementations for major paradigms of model alignment such as: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), SteerLM, and Self-Play Fine-Tuning (SPIN). Additionally, our toolkit supports running most of the alignment techniques in a Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) setting. NeMo-Aligner is designed for extensibility, allowing support for other alignment techniques with minimal effort. It is open-sourced with Apache 2.0 License and we invite community contributions at https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Aligner</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saikat Chakraborty, Gabriel Ebner, Siddharth Bhat, Sarah Fakhoury, Sakina Fatima, Shuvendu Lahiri, Nikhil Swamy</p>
<p>Abstract: Proof-oriented programs mix computational content with proofs of program correctness. However, the human effort involved in programming and proving is still substantial, despite the use of Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers to automate proofs in languages such as F*.
  Seeking to spur research on using AI to automate the construction of proof-oriented programs, we curate a dataset of 600K lines of open-source F* programs and proofs, including software used in production systems ranging from Windows and Linux, to Python and Firefox. Our dataset includes around 32K top-level F* definitions, each representing a type-directed program and proof synthesis problem -- producing a definition given a formal specification expressed as an F* type. We provide a program-fragment checker that queries F* to check the correctness of candidate solutions. We believe this is the largest corpus of SMT-assisted program proofs coupled with a reproducible program-fragment checker.
  Grounded in this dataset, we investigate the use of AI to synthesize programs and their proofs in F*, with promising results. Our main finding in that the performance of fine-tuned smaller language models (such as Phi-2 or StarCoder) compare favorably with large language models (such as GPT-4), at a much lower computational cost. We also identify various type-based retrieval augmentation techniques and find that they boost performance significantly. With detailed error analysis and case studies, we identify potential strengths and weaknesses of models and techniques and suggest directions for future improvements.</p>

<p>Abstract: People communicate in more than 7,000 languages around the world, with around 780 languages spoken in India alone. Despite this linguistic diversity, research on Sentiment Analysis has predominantly focused on English text data, resulting in a disproportionate availability of sentiment resources for English. This paper examines the performance of transformer models in Sentiment Analysis tasks across multilingual datasets and text that has undergone machine translation. By comparing the effectiveness of these models in different linguistic contexts, we gain insights into their performance variations and potential implications for sentiment analysis across diverse languages. We also discuss the shortcomings and potential for future work towards the end.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxuan Lu, Shengwei Xu, Yichi Zhang, Yuqing Kong, Grant Schoenebeck</p>
<p>Abstract: Peer prediction mechanisms motivate high-quality feedback with provable guarantees. However, current methods only apply to rather simple reports, like multiple-choice or scalar numbers. We aim to broaden these techniques to the larger domain of text-based reports, drawing on the recent developments in large language models. This vastly increases the applicability of peer prediction mechanisms as textual feedback is the norm in a large variety of feedback channels: peer reviews, e-commerce customer reviews, and comments on social media.
  We introduce two mechanisms, the Generative Peer Prediction Mechanism (GPPM) and the Generative Synopsis Peer Prediction Mechanism (GSPPM). These mechanisms utilize LLMs as predictors, mapping from one agent's report to a prediction of her peer's report. Theoretically, we show that when the LLM prediction is sufficiently accurate, our mechanisms can incentivize high effort and truth-telling as an (approximate) Bayesian Nash equilibrium. Empirically, we confirm the efficacy of our mechanisms through experiments conducted on two real datasets: the Yelp review dataset and the ICLR OpenReview dataset. We highlight the results that on the ICLR dataset, our mechanisms can differentiate three quality levels -- human-written reviews, GPT-4-generated reviews, and GPT-3.5-generated reviews in terms of expected scores. Additionally, GSPPM penalizes LLM-generated reviews more effectively than GPPM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Patryk Krukowski, Anna Bielawska, Kamil Ksi\k{a}\.zek, Pawe{\l} Wawrzy\'nski, Pawe{\l} Batorski, Przemys{\l}aw Spurek</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, a new Continual Learning (CL) paradigm was presented to control catastrophic forgetting, called Interval Continual Learning (InterContiNet), which relies on enforcing interval constraints on the neural network parameter space. Unfortunately, InterContiNet training is challenging due to the high dimensionality of the weight space, making intervals difficult to manage. To address this issue, we introduce \our{} \footnote{The source code is available at https://github.com/gmum/HyperInterval}, a technique that employs interval arithmetic within the embedding space and utilizes a hypernetwork to map these intervals to the target network parameter space. We train interval embeddings for consecutive tasks and train a hypernetwork to transform these embeddings into weights of the target network. An embedding for a given task is trained along with the hypernetwork, preserving the response of the target network for the previous task embeddings. Interval arithmetic works with a more manageable, lower-dimensional embedding space rather than directly preparing intervals in a high-dimensional weight space. Our model allows faster and more efficient training. Furthermore, \our{} maintains the guarantee of not forgetting. At the end of training, we can choose one universal embedding to produce a single network dedicated to all tasks. In such a framework, hypernetwork is used only for training and, finally, we can utilize one set of weights. \our{} obtains significantly better results than InterContiNet and gives SOTA results on several benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aparna Elangovan, Ling Liu, Lei Xu, Sravan Bodapati, Dan Roth</p>
<p>Abstract: In this position paper, we argue that human evaluation of generative large language models (LLMs) should be a multidisciplinary undertaking that draws upon insights from disciplines such as user experience research and human behavioral psychology to ensure that the experimental design and results are reliable. The conclusions from these evaluations, thus, must consider factors such as usability, aesthetics, and cognitive biases. We highlight how cognitive biases can conflate fluent information and truthfulness, and how cognitive uncertainty affects the reliability of rating scores such as Likert. Furthermore, the evaluation should differentiate the capabilities and weaknesses of increasingly powerful large language models -- which requires effective test sets. The scalability of human evaluation is also crucial to wider adoption. Hence, to design an effective human evaluation system in the age of generative NLP, we propose the ConSiDERS-The-Human evaluation framework consisting of 6 pillars -- Consistency, Scoring Criteria, Differentiating, User Experience, Responsible, and Scalability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeffery Dick, Saptarshi Nath, Christos Peridis, Eseoghene Benjamin, Soheil Kolouri, Andrea Soltoggio</p>
<p>Abstract: Context detection involves labeling segments of an online stream of data as belonging to different tasks. Task labels are used in lifelong learning algorithms to perform consolidation or other procedures that prevent catastrophic forgetting. Inferring task labels from online experiences remains a challenging problem. Most approaches assume finite and low-dimension observation spaces or a preliminary training phase during which task labels are learned. Moreover, changes in the transition or reward functions can be detected only in combination with a policy, and therefore are more difficult to detect than changes in the input distribution. This paper presents an approach to learning both policies and labels in an online deep reinforcement learning setting. The key idea is to use distance metrics, obtained via optimal transport methods, i.e., Wasserstein distance, on suitable latent action-reward spaces to measure distances between sets of data points from past and current streams. Such distances can then be used for statistical tests based on an adapted Kolmogorov-Smirnov calculation to assign labels to sequences of experiences. A rollback procedure is introduced to learn multiple policies by ensuring that only the appropriate data is used to train the corresponding policy. The combination of task detection and policy deployment allows for the optimization of lifelong reinforcement learning agents without an oracle that provides task labels. The approach is tested using two benchmarks and the results show promising performance when compared with related context detection algorithms. The results suggest that optimal transport statistical methods provide an explainable and justifiable procedure for online context detection and reward optimization in lifelong reinforcement learning.</p>

With the rapid development of LLMs gradually surpassing human capabilities, traditional alignment methods based on human-annotation are increasingly unable to meet the scalability demands. Therefore, there is an urgent need to explore new sources of automated alignment signals and technical approaches. In this paper, we systematically review the recently emerging methods of automated alignment, attempting to explore how to achieve effective, scalable, automated alignment once the capabilities of LLMs exceed those of humans. Specifically, we categorize existing automated alignment methods into 4 major categories based on the sources of alignment signals and discuss the current status and potential development of each category. Additionally, we explore the underlying mechanisms that enable automated alignment and discuss the essential factors that make automated alignment technologies feasible and effective from the fundamental role of alignment.</p>

<p>Abstract: Implicit neural representations have emerged as a powerful paradigm to represent signals such as images and sounds. This approach aims to utilize neural networks to parameterize the implicit function of the signal. However, when representing implicit functions, traditional neural networks such as ReLU-based multilayer perceptrons face challenges in accurately modeling high-frequency components of signals. Recent research has begun to explore the use of Fourier Neural Networks (FNNs) to overcome this limitation. In this paper, we propose Quantum Implicit Representation Network (QIREN), a novel quantum generalization of FNNs. Furthermore, through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that QIREN possesses a quantum advantage over classical FNNs. Lastly, we conducted experiments in signal representation, image superresolution, and image generation tasks to show the superior performance of QIREN compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Our work not only incorporates quantum advantages into implicit neural representations but also uncovers a promising application direction for Quantum Neural Networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaina Raza, Mizanur Rahman, Michael R. Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have greatly enhanced natural language processing (NLP) applications. Nevertheless, these models often inherit biases from their training data. Despite the availability of various datasets, most are limited to one or two NLP tasks (typically classification or evaluation) and lack comprehensive evaluations across a broader range of NLP tasks. To address this gap, we introduce the Bias Evaluations Across Domains (BEADs) dataset, designed to support a wide array of NLP tasks, including text classification, token classification, bias quantification, and benign language generation. A key focus of this paper is the gold label subset of BEADs, an important portion of the data verified by experts to ensure high reliability. BEADs provides data for both fine-tuning, including classification and language generation tasks, and for evaluating LLMs. Our findings indicate that BEADs effectively identifies numerous biases when fine-tuned on this dataset. It also reduces biases when used for fine-tuning language generation task, while preserving language quality. The results also reveal some prevalent demographic biases in LLMs when BEADs is used for evaluation in demographic task. The benchmarking results highlight the efficacy of fine-tuning LLMs for bias identification and the necessity of comprehensive bias evaluation. We make BEADs publicly available to promote more responsible AI development. The dataset can be accessed at https://huggingface.co/datasets/shainar/BEAD .</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Motoki Omura, Takayuki Osa, Yusuke Mukuta, Tatsuya Harada</p>
<p>Abstract: In offline reinforcement learning, in-sample learning methods have been widely used to prevent performance degradation caused by evaluating out-of-distribution actions from the dataset. Extreme Q-learning (XQL) employs a loss function based on the assumption that Bellman error follows a Gumbel distribution, enabling it to model the soft optimal value function in an in-sample manner. It has demonstrated strong performance in both offline and online reinforcement learning settings. However, issues remain, such as the instability caused by the exponential term in the loss function and the risk of the error distribution deviating from the Gumbel distribution. Therefore, we propose Maclaurin Expanded Extreme Q-learning to enhance stability. In this method, applying Maclaurin expansion to the loss function in XQL enhances stability against large errors. This approach involves adjusting the modeled value function between the value function under the behavior policy and the soft optimal value function, thus achieving a trade-off between stability and optimality depending on the order of expansion. It also enables adjustment of the error distribution assumption from a normal distribution to a Gumbel distribution. Our method significantly stabilizes learning in online RL tasks from DM Control, where XQL was previously unstable. Additionally, it improves performance in several offline RL tasks from D4RL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yelysei Bondarenko, Riccardo Del Chiaro, Markus Nagel</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are omnipresent, however their practical deployment is challenging due to their ever increasing computational and memory demands. Quantization is one of the most effective ways to make them more compute and memory efficient. Quantization-aware training (QAT) methods, generally produce the best quantized performance, however it comes at the cost of potentially long training time and excessive memory usage, making it impractical when applying for LLMs. Inspired by parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) and low-rank adaptation (LoRA) literature, we propose LR-QAT -- a lightweight and memory-efficient QAT algorithm for LLMs. LR-QAT employs several components to save memory without sacrificing predictive performance: (a) low-rank auxiliary weights that are aware of the quantization grid; (b) a downcasting operator using fixed-point or double-packed integers and (c) checkpointing. Unlike most related work, our method (i) is inference-efficient, leading to no additional overhead compared to traditional PTQ; (ii) can be seen as a general extended pretraining framework, meaning that the resulting model can still be utilized for any downstream task afterwards; (iii) can be applied across a wide range of quantization settings, such as different choices quantization granularity, activation quantization, and seamlessly combined with many PTQ techniques. We apply LR-QAT to LLaMA-1/2/3 and Mistral model families and validate its effectiveness on several downstream tasks. Our method outperforms common post-training quantization (PTQ) approaches and reaches the same model performance as full-model QAT at the fraction of its memory usage. Specifically, we can train a 7B LLM on a single consumer grade GPU with 24GB of memory. Our source code is available at https://github.com/qualcomm-ai-research/LR-QAT</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Owen Dugan, Donato Manuel Jimenez Beneto, Charlotte Loh, Zhuo Chen, Rumen Dangovski, Marin Solja\v{c}i\'c</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite significant advancements in text generation and reasoning, Large Language Models (LLMs) still face challenges in accurately performing complex arithmetic operations. Language model systems often enable LLMs to generate code for arithmetic operations to achieve accurate calculations. However, this approach compromises speed and security, and fine-tuning risks the language model losing prior capabilities. We propose a framework that enables exact arithmetic in a single autoregressive step, providing faster, more secure, and more interpretable LLM systems with arithmetic capabilities. We use the hidden states of a LLM to control a symbolic architecture that performs arithmetic. Our implementation using Llama 3 with OccamNet as a symbolic model (OccamLlama) achieves 100\% accuracy on single arithmetic operations ($+,-,\times,\div,\sin{},\cos{},\log{},\exp{},\sqrt{}$), outperforming GPT 4o with and without a code interpreter. Furthermore, OccamLlama outperforms GPT 4o with and without a code interpreter on average across a range of mathematical problem solving benchmarks, demonstrating that OccamLLMs can excel in arithmetic tasks, even surpassing much larger models. We will make our code public shortly.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the profound development of large language models(LLMs), their safety concerns have garnered increasing attention. However, there is a scarcity of Chinese safety benchmarks for LLMs, and the existing safety taxonomies are inadequate, lacking comprehensive safety detection capabilities in authentic Chinese scenarios. In this work, we introduce CHiSafetyBench, a dedicated safety benchmark for evaluating LLMs' capabilities in identifying risky content and refusing answering risky questions in Chinese contexts. CHiSafetyBench incorporates a dataset that covers a hierarchical Chinese safety taxonomy consisting of 5 risk areas and 31 categories. This dataset comprises two types of tasks: multiple-choice questions and question-answering, evaluating LLMs from the perspectives of risk content identification and the ability to refuse answering risky questions respectively. Utilizing this benchmark, we validate the feasibility of automatic evaluation as a substitute for human evaluation and conduct comprehensive automatic safety assessments on mainstream Chinese LLMs. Our experiments reveal the varying performance of different models across various safety domains, indicating that all models possess considerable potential for improvement in Chinese safety capabilities. Our dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/UnicomAI/UnicomBenchmark/tree/main/CHiSafetyBench.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liman Wang, Hanyang Zhong</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper examines the role of cognitive biases in the decision-making processes of large language models (LLMs), challenging the conventional goal of eliminating all biases. We show that certain cognitive biases when properly balanced, can enhance decision-making efficiency through rational deviations and heuristic shortcuts. By introducing heuristic moderation and an abstention option, which allows LLMs to withhold responses when uncertain, we reduce error rates, improve decision accuracy, and optimize decision rates. Using the Balance Rigor and Utility (BRU) dataset, developed through expert collaboration, our findings demonstrate that targeted inspection of cognitive biases aligns LLM decisions more closely with human reasoning, enhancing reliability and suggesting strategies for future improvements. This approach offers a novel way to leverage cognitive biases to improve the practical utility of LLMs across various applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nam Le Hai, Dung Manh Nguyen, Nghi D. Q. Bui</p>
<p>Abstract: CodeLLMs have gained widespread adoption for code generation tasks, yet their capacity to handle repository-level code generation with complex contextual dependencies remains underexplored. Our work underscores the critical importance of leveraging repository-level contexts to generate executable and functionally correct code. We present \textbf{\methodnamews}, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate repository-level code generation, with a focus on three key aspects: executability, functional correctness through comprehensive test case generation, and accurate utilization of cross-file contexts. Our study examines a controlled scenario where developers specify essential code dependencies (contexts), challenging models to integrate them effectively. Additionally, we introduce an instruction-tuned dataset that enhances CodeLLMs' ability to leverage dependencies, along with a new metric, \textit{Dependency Invocation Rate (DIR)}, to quantify context utilization. Experimental results reveal that while pretrained LLMs demonstrate superior performance in terms of correctness, instruction-tuned models excel in context utilization and debugging capabilities. \methodnamews offers a comprehensive evaluation framework for assessing code functionality and alignment with developer intent, thereby advancing the development of more reliable CodeLLMs for real-world applications.

<p>Abstract: We present FairX, an open-source Python-based benchmarking tool designed for the comprehensive analysis of models under the umbrella of fairness, utility, and eXplainability (XAI). FairX enables users to train benchmarking bias-mitigation models and evaluate their fairness using a wide array of fairness metrics, data utility metrics, and generate explanations for model predictions, all within a unified framework. Existing benchmarking tools do not have the way to evaluate synthetic data generated from fair generative models, also they do not have the support for training fair generative models either. In FairX, we add fair generative models in the collection of our fair-model library (pre-processing, in-processing, post-processing) and evaluation metrics for evaluating the quality of synthetic fair data. This version of FairX supports both tabular and image datasets. It also allows users to provide their own custom datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kris De Asis, Richard S. Sutton</p>
<p>Abstract: Many reinforcement learning algorithms are built on an assumption that an agent interacts with an environment over fixed-duration, discrete time steps. However, physical systems are continuous in time, requiring a choice of time-discretization granularity when digitally controlling them. Furthermore, such systems do not wait for decisions to be made before advancing the environment state, necessitating the study of how the choice of discretization may affect a reinforcement learning algorithm. In this work, we consider the relationship between the definitions of the continuous-time and discrete-time returns. Specifically, we acknowledge an idiosyncrasy with naively applying a discrete-time algorithm to a discretized continuous-time environment, and note how a simple modification can better align the return definitions. This observation is of practical consideration when dealing with environments where time-discretization granularity is a choice, or situations where such granularity is inherently stochastic.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyan Jiang, Xueguang Ma, Wenhu Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: In traditional RAG framework, the basic retrieval units are normally short. The common retrievers like DPR normally work with 100-word Wikipedia paragraphs. Such a design forces the retriever to search over a large corpus to find the `needle' unit. In contrast, the readers only need to generate answers from the short retrieved units. The imbalanced `heavy' retriever and `light' reader design can lead to sub-optimal performance. The loss of contextual information in the short, chunked units may increase the likelihood of introducing hard negatives during the retrieval stage. Additionally, the reader might not fully leverage the capabilities of recent advancements in LLMs. In order to alleviate the imbalance, we propose a new framework LongRAG, consisting of a `long retriever' and a `long reader'. In the two Wikipedia-based datasets, NQ and HotpotQA, LongRAG processes the entire Wikipedia corpus into 4K-token units by grouping related documents. By increasing the unit size, we significantly reduce the total number of units. This greatly reduces the burden on the retriever, resulting in strong retrieval performance with only a few (less than 8) top units. Without requiring any training, LongRAG achieves an EM of 62.7% on NQ and 64.3% on HotpotQA, which are on par with the (fully-trained) SoTA model. Furthermore, we test on two non-Wikipedia-based datasets, Qasper and MultiFieldQA-en. LongRAG processes each individual document as a single (long) unit rather than chunking them into smaller units. By doing so, we achieve an F1 score of 25.9% on Qasper and 57.5% on MultiFieldQA-en. Our study offers insights into the future roadmap for combining RAG with long-context LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jialang Xu, Nazir Sirajudeen, Matthew Boal, Nader Francis, Danail Stoyanov, Evangelos Mazomenos</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated detection of surgical errors can improve robotic-assisted surgery. Despite promising progress, existing methods still face challenges in capturing rich temporal context to establish long-term dependencies while maintaining computational efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical model named SEDMamba, which incorporates the selective state space model (SSM) into surgical error detection, facilitating efficient long sequence modelling with linear complexity. SEDMamba enhances selective SSM with a bottleneck mechanism and fine-to-coarse temporal fusion (FCTF) to detect and temporally localize surgical errors in long videos. The bottleneck mechanism compresses and restores features within their spatial dimension, thereby reducing computational complexity. FCTF utilizes multiple dilated 1D convolutional layers to merge temporal information across diverse scale ranges, accommodating errors of varying duration. Our work also contributes the first-of-its-kind, frame-level, in-vivo surgical error dataset to support error detection in real surgical cases. Specifically, we deploy the clinically validated observational clinical human reliability assessment tool (OCHRA) to annotate the errors during suturing tasks in an open-source radical prostatectomy dataset (SAR-RARP50). Experimental results demonstrate that our SEDMamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods with at least 1.82% AUC and 3.80% AP performance gains with significantly reduced computational complexity. The corresponding error annotations, code and models will be released at https://github.com/wzjialang/SEDMamba.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in generating coherent text, but they often struggle with context awareness, leading to inaccuracies in tasks requiring faithful adherence to provided information. We introduce FastMem, a novel method designed to enhance instruction fine-tuned LLMs' context awareness through fast memorization of the prompt. FastMem maximizes the likelihood of the prompt before inference by fine-tuning only the last Feed-Forward Network (FFN) module. This targeted approach ensures efficient optimization without overfitting, significantly improving the model's ability to comprehend and accurately follow the context. Our experiments demonstrate substantial gains in reading comprehension, text summarization and adherence to output structures. For instance, FastMem improves the accuracy of Llama 3-8B-Inst on the NQ-SWAP dataset from 59.1% to 71.6%, and reduces the output structure failure rate of Qwen 1.5-4B-Chat from 34.9% to 25.5%. Extensive experimental results highlight FastMem's potential to offer a robust solution to enhance the reliability and accuracy of LLMs in various applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuntao Shou, Wei Ai, Jiayi Du, Tao Meng, Haiyan Liu, Nan Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: The task of multi-modal emotion recognition in conversation (MERC) aims to analyze the genuine emotional state of each utterance based on the multi-modal information in the conversation, which is crucial for conversation understanding. Existing methods focus on using graph neural networks (GNN) to model conversational relationships and capture contextual latent semantic relationships. However, due to the complexity of GNN, existing methods cannot efficiently capture the potential dependencies between long-distance utterances, which limits the performance of MERC. In this paper, we propose an Efficient Long-distance Latent Relation-aware Graph Neural Network (ELR-GNN) for multi-modal emotion recognition in conversations. Specifically, we first use pre-extracted text, video and audio features as input to Bi-LSTM to capture contextual semantic information and obtain low-level utterance features. Then, we use low-level utterance features to construct a conversational emotion interaction graph. To efficiently capture the potential dependencies between long-distance utterances, we use the dilated generalized forward push algorithm to precompute the emotional propagation between global utterances and design an emotional relation-aware operator to capture the potential semantic associations between different utterances. Furthermore, we combine early fusion and adaptive late fusion mechanisms to fuse latent dependency information between speaker relationship information and context. Finally, we obtain high-level discourse features and feed them into MLP for emotion prediction. Extensive experimental results show that ELR-GNN achieves state-of-the-art performance on the benchmark datasets IEMOCAP and MELD, with running times reduced by 52\% and 35\%, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vishnu Asutosh Dasu, Ashish Kumar, Saeid Tizpaz-Niari, Gang Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates neuron dropout as a post-processing bias mitigation for deep neural networks (DNNs). Neural-driven software solutions are increasingly applied in socially critical domains with significant fairness implications. While neural networks are exceptionally good at finding statistical patterns from data, they may encode and amplify existing biases from the historical data. Existing bias mitigation algorithms often require modifying the input dataset or the learning algorithms. We posit that the prevalent dropout methods that prevent over-fitting during training by randomly dropping neurons may be an effective and less intrusive approach to improve the fairness of pre-trained DNNs. However, finding the ideal set of neurons to drop is a combinatorial problem. We propose NeuFair, a family of post-processing randomized algorithms that mitigate unfairness in pre-trained DNNs via dropouts during inference after training. Our randomized search is guided by an objective to minimize discrimination while maintaining the model's utility. We show that our design of randomized algorithms is effective and efficient in improving fairness (up to 69%) with minimal or no model performance degradation. We provide intuitive explanations of these phenomena and carefully examine the influence of various hyperparameters of search algorithms on the results. Finally, we empirically and conceptually compare NeuFair to different state-of-the-art bias mitigators.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents dilated Residual Network (ResNet) models for disease classification from retinal fundus images. Dilated convolution filters are used to replace normal convolution filters in the higher layers of the ResNet model (dilated ResNet) in order to improve the receptive field compared to the normal ResNet model for disease classification. This study introduces computer-assisted diagnostic tools that employ deep learning, enhanced with explainable AI techniques. These techniques aim to make the tool's decision-making process transparent, thereby enabling medical professionals to understand and trust the AI's diagnostic decision. They are particularly relevant in today's healthcare landscape, where there is a growing demand for transparency in AI applications to ensure their reliability and ethical use. The dilated ResNet is used as a replacement for the normal ResNet to enhance the classification accuracy of retinal eye diseases and reduce the required computing time. The dataset used in this work is the Ocular Disease Intelligent Recognition (ODIR) dataset which is a structured ophthalmic database with eight classes covering most of the common retinal eye diseases. The evaluation metrics used in this work include precision, recall, accuracy, and F1 score. In this work, a comparative study has been made between normal ResNet models and dilated ResNet models on five variants namely ResNet-18, ResNet-34, ResNet-50, ResNet-101, and ResNet-152. The dilated ResNet model shows promising results as compared to normal ResNet with an average F1 score of 0.71, 0.70, 0.69, 0.67, and 0.70 respectively for the above respective variants in ODIR multiclass disease classification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yibo Miao, Yifan Zhu, Yinpeng Dong, Lijia Yu, Jun Zhu, Xiao-Shan Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent development of Sora leads to a new era in text-to-video (T2V) generation. Along with this comes the rising concern about its security risks. The generated videos may contain illegal or unethical content, and there is a lack of comprehensive quantitative understanding of their safety, posing a challenge to their reliability and practical deployment. Previous evaluations primarily focus on the quality of video generation. While some evaluations of text-to-image models have considered safety, they cover fewer aspects and do not address the unique temporal risk inherent in video generation. To bridge this research gap, we introduce T2VSafetyBench, a new benchmark designed for conducting safety-critical assessments of text-to-video models. We define 12 critical aspects of video generation safety and construct a malicious prompt dataset including real-world prompts, LLM-generated prompts and jailbreak attack-based prompts. Based on our evaluation results, we draw several important findings, including: 1) no single model excels in all aspects, with different models showing various strengths; 2) the correlation between GPT-4 assessments and manual reviews is generally high; 3) there is a trade-off between the usability and safety of text-to-video generative models. This indicates that as the field of video generation rapidly advances, safety risks are set to surge, highlighting the urgency of prioritizing video safety. We hope that T2VSafetyBench can provide insights for better understanding the safety of video generation in the era of generative AI.</p>

<p>Abstract: Decentralized planning is a key element of cooperative multi-agent systems for information gathering tasks. However, despite the high frequency of agent failures in realistic large deployment scenarios, current approaches perform poorly in the presence of failures, by not converging at all, and/or by making very inefficient use of resources (e.g. energy). In this work, we propose Attritable MCTS (A-MCTS), a decentralized MCTS algorithm capable of timely and efficient adaptation to changes in the set of active agents. It is based on the use of a global reward function for the estimation of each agent's local contribution, and regret matching for coordination. We evaluate its effectiveness in realistic data-harvesting problems under different scenarios. We show both theoretically and experimentally that A-MCTS enables efficient adaptation even under high failure rates. Results suggest that, in the presence of frequent failures, our solution improves substantially over the best existing approaches in terms of global utility and scalability.</p>

Algorithms such as Value Iteration and Temporal Difference (TD) learning have a slow convergence rate and become inefficient in these tasks. When the transition distributions are given, PID VI was recently introduced to accelerate the convergence of Value Iteration using ideas from control theory. Inspired by this, we introduce PID TD Learning and PID Q-Learning algorithms for the RL setting, in which only samples from the environment are available. We give a theoretical analysis of the convergence of PID TD Learning and its acceleration compared to the conventional TD Learning. We also introduce a method for adapting PID gains in the presence of noise and empirically verify its effectiveness.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents a fast and cost-effective method for diagnosing cardiac abnormalities with high accuracy and reliability using low-cost systems in clinics. The primary limitation of automatic diagnosing of cardiac diseases is the rarity of correct and acceptable labeled samples, which can be expensive to prepare. To address this issue, two methods are proposed in this work. The first method is a unique Multi-Branch Deep Convolutional Neural Network (MBDCN) architecture inspired by human auditory processing, specifically designed to optimize feature extraction by employing various sizes of convolutional filters and audio signal power spectrum as input. In the second method, called as Long short-term memory-Convolutional Neural (LSCN) model, Additionally, the network architecture includes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network blocks to improve feature extraction in the time domain. The innovative approach of combining multiple parallel branches consisting of the one-dimensional convolutional layers along with LSTM blocks helps in achieving superior results in audio signal processing tasks. The experimental results demonstrate superiority of the proposed methods over the state-of-the-art techniques. The overall classification accuracy of heart sounds with the LSCN network is more than 96%. The efficiency of this network is significant compared to common feature extraction methods such as Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and wavelet transform. Therefore, the proposed method shows promising results in the automatic analysis of heart sounds and has potential applications in the diagnosis and early detection of cardiovascular diseases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruokai Yin, Youngeun Kim, Di Wu, Priyadarshini Panda</p>
<p>Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have gained significant research attention in the last decade due to their potential to drive resource-constrained edge devices. Though existing SNN accelerators offer high efficiency in processing sparse spikes with dense weights, opportunities are less explored in SNNs with sparse weights, i.e., dual-sparsity. In this work, we study the acceleration of dual-sparse SNNs, focusing on their core operation, sparse-matrix-sparse-matrix multiplication (spMspM). We observe that naively running a dual-sparse SNN on existing spMspM accelerators designed for dual-sparse Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) exhibits sub-optimal efficiency. The main challenge is that processing timesteps, a natural property of SNNs, introduces an extra loop to ANN spMspM, leading to longer latency and more memory traffic. To address the problem, we propose a fully temporal-parallel (FTP) dataflow, which minimizes both data movement across timesteps and the end-to-end latency of dual-sparse SNNs. To maximize the efficiency of FTP dataflow, we propose an FTP-friendly spike compression mechanism that efficiently compresses single-bit spikes and ensures contiguous memory access. We further propose an FTP-friendly inner-join circuit that can lower the cost of the expensive prefix-sum circuits with almost no throughput penalty. All the above techniques for FTP dataflow are encapsulated in LoAS, a Low-latency inference Accelerator for dual-sparse SNNs. With FTP dataflow, compression, and inner-join, running dual-sparse SNN workloads on LoAS demonstrates significant speedup (up to $8.51\times$) and energy reduction (up to $3.68\times$) compared to running it on prior dual-sparse accelerators.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhilash Singh, Seyed Muhammad Hossein Mousavi, Kumar Gaurav</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduced the Scorpion Hunting Strategy (SHS), a novel population-based, nature-inspired optimisation algorithm. This algorithm draws inspiration from the hunting strategy of scorpions, which identify, locate, and capture their prey using the alpha and beta vibration operators. These operators control the SHS algorithm's exploitation and exploration abilities. To formulate an optimisation method, we mathematically simulate these dynamic events and behaviors. We evaluate the effectiveness of the SHS algorithm by employing 20 benchmark functions (including 10 conventional and 10 CEC2020 functions), using both qualitative and quantitative analyses. Through a comparative analysis with 12 state-of-the-art meta-heuristic algorithms, we demonstrate that the proposed SHS algorithm yields exceptionally promising results. These findings are further supported by statistically significant results obtained through the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Additionally, the ranking of SHS, as determined by the average rank derived from the Friedman test, positions it at the forefront when compared to other algorithms. Going beyond theoretical validation, we showcase the practical utility of the SHS algorithm by applying it to six distinct real-world optimisation tasks. These applications illustrate the algorithm's potential in addressing complex optimisation challenges. In summary, this work not only introduces the innovative SHS algorithm but also substantiates its effectiveness and versatility through rigorous benchmarking and real-world problem-solving scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the significant potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating Register Transfer Level (RTL) code, with notable advancements showcased by commercial models such as GPT-4 and Claude3-Opus. However, these proprietary LLMs often raise concerns regarding privacy and security. While open-source LLMs offer solutions to these concerns, they typically underperform commercial models in RTL code generation tasks, primarily due to the scarcity of high-quality open-source RTL datasets. To address this challenge, we introduce OriGen , a fully open-source framework that incorporates self-reflection capabilities and a novel dataset augmentation methodology for generating high-quality, large-scale RTL code. Our approach employs a code-tocode augmentation technique to enhance the quality of open-source RTL code datasets. Furthermore, OriGen can rectify syntactic errors through a self-reflection process that leverages compiler feedback. Experimental results demonstrate that OriGen significantly outperforms other open-source alternatives in RTL code generation. It surpasses the previous best-performing open-source LLM by 12.8% and even exceeds GPT-4 Turbo in the pass@1 metric on the VerilogEval-Human benchmark. Moreover, OriGen exhibits superior capabilities in self-reflection and error correction, outperforming GPT-4 by 19.9% on a benchmark designed to evaluate self-reflection capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maximilian G. Schuh, Davide Boldini, Annkathrin I. Bohne, Stephan A. Sieber</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate prediction of drug-target interactions is critical for advancing drug discovery. By reducing time and cost, machine learning and deep learning can accelerate this laborious discovery process. In a novel approach, BarlowDTI, we utilise the powerful Barlow Twins architecture for feature-extraction while considering the structure of the target protein. Our method achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance against multiple established benchmarks using only one-dimensional input. The use of gradient boosting machine as the underlying predictor ensures fast and efficient predictions without the need for substantial computational resources. We also investigate how the model reaches its decision based on individual training samples. By comparing co-crystal structures, we find that BarlowDTI effectively exploits catalytically active and stabilising residues, highlighting the model's ability to generalise from one-dimensional input data. In addition, we further benchmark new baselines against existing methods. Together, these innovations improve the efficiency and effectiveness of drug-target interaction predictions, providing robust tools for accelerating drug development and deepening the understanding of molecular interactions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sungmin Kang, Jaeha Song, Jihie Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding the morphological structure of medical images and precisely segmenting the region of interest or abnormality is an important task that can assist in diagnosis. However, the unique properties of medical imaging make clear segmentation difficult,and the high cost and time-consuming task of labeling leads to a coarse-grained representation of ground truth. Facing with these problems, we propose a novel Diffusion Transformer Segmentation (DTS) model for robust segmentation in the presence of noise. We propose an alternative to the dominant Denoising U-Net encoder through experiments applying a transformer architecture, which captures global dependency through self-attention. Additionally, we propose k-neighbor label smoothing, reverse boundary attention, and self-supervised learning with morphology-driven learning to improve the ability to identify complex structures. Our model, which analyzes the morphological representation of images, shows better results than the previous models in various medical imaging modalities, including CT, MRI, and lesion images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel N. Nissani (Nissensohn)</p>
<p>Abstract: Contrastive Learning (CL) has been successfully applied to classification and other downstream tasks related to concrete concepts, such as objects contained in the ImageNet dataset. No attempts seem to have been made so far in applying this promising scheme to more abstract entities. A prominent example of these could be the concept of (discrete) Quantity. CL can be frequently interpreted as a self-supervised scheme guided by some profound and ubiquitous conservation principle (e.g. conservation of identity in object classification tasks). In this introductory work we apply a suitable conservation principle to the semi-abstract concept of natural numbers by which discrete quantities can be estimated or predicted. We experimentally show, by means of a toy problem, that contrastive learning can be trained to count at a glance with high accuracy both at human as well as at super-human ranges.. We compare this with the results of a trained-to-count at a glance supervised learning (SL) neural network scheme of similar architecture. We show that both schemes exhibit similar good performance on baseline experiments, where the distributions of the training and testing stages are equal. Importantly, we demonstrate that in some generalization scenarios, where training and testing distributions differ, CL boasts more robust and much better error performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dillon Bowen, Brendan Murphy, Will Cai, David Khachaturov, Adam Gleave, Kellin Pelrine</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent work shows that LLMs are vulnerable to data poisoning, in which they are trained on partially corrupted or harmful data. Poisoned data is hard to detect, breaks guardrails, and leads to undesirable and harmful behavior. Given the intense efforts by leading labs to train and deploy increasingly larger and more capable LLMs, it is critical to ask if the risk of data poisoning will be naturally mitigated by scale, or if it is an increasing threat. We consider three threat models by which data poisoning can occur: malicious fine-tuning, imperfect data curation, and intentional data contamination. Our experiments evaluate the effects of data poisoning on 23 frontier LLMs ranging from 1.5-72 billion parameters on three datasets which speak to each of our threat models. We find that larger LLMs are increasingly vulnerable, learning harmful behavior significantly more quickly than smaller LLMs with even minimal data poisoning. These results underscore the need for robust safeguards against data poisoning in larger LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaozhou Ye, Kevin I-Kai Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays a crucial role in various applications such as human-computer interaction and healthcare monitoring. However, challenges persist in HAR models due to the data distribution differences between training and real-world data distributions, particularly evident in cross-user scenarios. This paper introduces a novel framework, termed Diffusion-based Noise-centered Adversarial Learning Domain Adaptation (Diff-Noise-Adv-DA), designed to address these challenges by leveraging generative diffusion modeling and adversarial learning techniques. Traditional HAR models often struggle with the diversity of user behaviors and sensor data distributions. Diff-Noise-Adv-DA innovatively integrates the inherent noise within diffusion models, harnessing its latent information to enhance domain adaptation. Specifically, the framework transforms noise into a critical carrier of activity and domain class information, facilitating robust classification across different user domains. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of Diff-Noise-Adv-DA in improving HAR model performance across different users, surpassing traditional domain adaptation methods. The framework not only mitigates distribution mismatches but also enhances data quality through noise-based denoising techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuqi Xue, Yiqi Liu, Lifeng Nai, Jian Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Cloud platforms today have been deploying hardware accelerators like neural processing units (NPUs) for powering machine learning (ML) inference services. To maximize the resource utilization while ensuring reasonable quality of service, a natural approach is to virtualize NPUs for efficient resource sharing for multi-tenant ML services. However, virtualizing NPUs for modern cloud platforms is not easy. This is not only due to the lack of system abstraction support for NPU hardware, but also due to the lack of architectural and ISA support for enabling fine-grained dynamic operator scheduling for virtualized NPUs.
  We present Neu10, a holistic NPU virtualization framework. We investigate virtualization techniques for NPUs across the entire software and hardware stack. Neu10 consists of (1) a flexible NPU abstraction called vNPU, which enables fine-grained virtualization of the heterogeneous compute units in a physical NPU (pNPU); (2) a vNPU resource allocator that enables pay-as-you-go computing model and flexible vNPU-to-pNPU mappings for improved resource utilization and cost-effectiveness; (3) an ISA extension of modern NPU architecture for facilitating fine-grained tensor operator scheduling for multiple vNPUs. We implement Neu10 based on a production-level NPU simulator. Our experiments show that Neu10 improves the throughput of ML inference services by up to 1.4$\times$ and reduces the tail latency by up to 4.6$\times$, while improving the NPU utilization by 1.2$\times$ on average, compared to state-of-the-art NPU sharing approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Se-eun Yoon, Ahmad Bin Rabiah, Zaid Alibadi, Surya Kallumadi, Julian McAuley</p>
<p>Abstract: Customers reach out to online live chat agents with various intents, such as asking about product details or requesting a return. In this paper, we propose the problem of predicting user intent from browsing history and address it through a two-stage approach. The first stage classifies a user's browsing history into high-level intent categories. Here, we represent each browsing history as a text sequence of page attributes and use the ground-truth class labels to fine-tune pretrained Transformers. The second stage provides a large language model (LLM) with the browsing history and predicted intent class to generate fine-grained intents. For automatic evaluation, we use a separate LLM to judge the similarity between generated and ground-truth intents, which closely aligns with human judgments. Our two-stage approach yields significant performance gains compared to generating intents without the classification stage.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Niklas Wretblad, Oskar Holmstr\"om, Erik Larsson, Axel Wiks\"ater, Oscar S\"oderlund, Hjalmar \"Ohman, Ture Pont\'en, Martin Forsberg, Martin S\"orme, Fredrik Heintz</p>
<p>Abstract: Relational databases often suffer from uninformative descriptors of table contents, such as ambiguous columns and hard-to-interpret values, impacting both human users and Text-to-SQL models. This paper explores the use of large language models (LLMs) to generate informative column descriptions as a semantic layer for relational databases. Using the BIRD-Bench development set, we created ColSQL, a dataset with gold-standard column descriptions generated and refined by LLMs and human annotators. We evaluated several instruction-tuned models, finding that GPT-4o and Command R+ excelled in generating high-quality descriptions. Additionally, we applied an LLM-as-a-judge to evaluate model performance. Although this method does not align well with human evaluations, we included it to explore its potential and to identify areas for improvement. More work is needed to improve the reliability of automatic evaluations for this task. We also find that detailed column descriptions significantly improve Text-to-SQL execution accuracy, especially when columns are uninformative. This study establishes LLMs as effective tools for generating detailed metadata, enhancing the usability of relational databases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinqi Jin, Zhui Zhu, Xikai Sun, Fan Dang, Jiangchuan Liu, Jingao Xu, Kebin Liu, Xinlei Chen, Yunhao Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural enhancement through super-resolution (SR) deep neural networks (DNNs) opens up new possibilities for ultra-high-definition (UHD) live streaming over existing encoding and networking infrastructure. Yet, the heavy SR DNN inference overhead leads to severe deployment challenges. To reduce the overhead, existing systems propose to apply DNN-based SR only on carefully selected anchor frames while upscaling non-anchor frames via the lightweight reusing-based SR approach. However, frame-level scheduling is coarse-grained and fails to deliver optimal efficiency. In this work, we propose Palantir, the first neural-enhanced UHD live streaming system with fine-grained patch-level scheduling. Two novel techniques are incorporated into Palantir to select the most beneficial anchor patches and support latency-sensitive UHD live streaming applications. Firstly, under the guidance of our pioneering and theoretical analysis, Palantir constructs a directed acyclic graph (DAG) for lightweight yet accurate SR quality estimation under any possible anchor patch set. Secondly, to further optimize the scheduling latency, Palantir improves parallelizability by refactoring the computation subprocedure of the estimation process into a sparse matrix-matrix multiplication operation.
  The evaluation results suggest that Palantir incurs a negligible scheduling latency accounting for less than 5.7% of the end-to-end latency requirement. When compared to the naive method of applying DNN-based SR on all the frames, Palantir can reduce the SR DNN inference overhead by 20 times (or 60 times) while preserving 54.0-82.6% (or 32.8-64.0%) of the quality gain. When compared to the state-of-the-art real-time frame-level scheduling strategy, Palantir can reduce the SR DNN inference overhead by 80.1% at most (and 38.4% on average) without sacrificing the video quality.</p>

<p>Abstract: The advances in the digital era have led to rapid dissemination of information. This has also aggravated the spread of misinformation and disinformation. This has potentially serious consequences, such as civil unrest. While fact-checking aims to combat this, manual fact-checking is cumbersome and not scalable. While automated fact-checking approaches exist, they do not operate in real-time and do not always account for spread of misinformation through different modalities. This is particularly important as proactive fact-checking on live streams in real-time can help people be informed of false narratives and prevent catastrophic consequences that may cause civil unrest. This is particularly relevant with the rapid dissemination of information through video on social media platforms or other streams like political rallies and debates. Hence, in this work we develop a platform named LiveFC, that can aid in fact-checking live audio streams in real-time. LiveFC has a user-friendly interface that displays the claims detected along with their veracity and evidence for live streams with associated speakers for claims from respective segments. The app can be accessed at http://livefc.factiverse.ai and a screen recording of the demo can be found at https://bit.ly/3WVAoIw.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lei Huang, Jiaming Guo, Guanhua He, Xishan Zhang, Rui Zhang, Shaohui Peng, Shaoli Liu, Tianshi Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating long-term texts such as novels using artificial intelligence has always been a challenge. A common approach is to use large language models (LLMs) to construct a hierarchical framework that first plans and then writes. Despite the fact that the generated novels reach a sufficient length, they exhibit poor logical coherence and appeal in their plots and deficiencies in character and event depiction, ultimately compromising the overall narrative quality. In this paper, we propose a method named Extracting Excelsior and Expanding. Ex3 initially extracts structure information from raw novel data. By combining this structure information with the novel data, an instruction-following dataset is meticulously crafted. This dataset is then utilized to fine-tune the LLM, aiming for excelsior generation performance. In the final stage, a tree-like expansion method is deployed to facilitate the generation of arbitrarily long novels. Evaluation against previous methods showcases Ex3's ability to produce higher-quality long-form novels.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in generative AI, particularly Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), have revolutionized image synthesis and manipulation. However, these generative techniques raises concerns about data misappropriation and intellectual property infringement. Adversarial attacks on machine learning models have been extensively studied, and a well-established body of research has extended these techniques as a benign metric to prevent the underlying misuse of generative AI. Current approaches to safeguarding images from manipulation by LDMs are limited by their reliance on model-specific knowledge and their inability to significantly degrade semantic quality of generated images. In response to these shortcomings, we propose the Posterior Collapse Attack (PCA) based on the observation that VAEs suffer from posterior collapse during training. Our method minimizes dependence on the white-box information of target models to get rid of the implicit reliance on model-specific knowledge. By accessing merely a small amount of LDM parameters, in specific merely the VAE encoder of LDMs, our method causes a substantial semantic collapse in generation quality, particularly in perceptual consistency, and demonstrates strong transferability across various model architectures. Experimental results show that PCA achieves superior perturbation effects on image generation of LDMs with lower runtime and VRAM. Our method outperforms existing techniques, offering a more robust and generalizable solution that is helpful in alleviating the socio-technical challenges posed by the rapidly evolving landscape of generative AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saakaar Bhatnagar, Andrew Comerford, Zelu Xu, Davide Berti Polato, Araz Banaeizadeh, Alessandro Ferraris</p>
<p>Abstract: As the demand for lithium-ion batteries rapidly increases there is a need to design these cells in a safe manner to mitigate thermal runaway. Thermal runaway in batteries leads to an uncontrollable temperature rise and potentially fires, which is a major safety concern. Typically, when modelling the chemical kinetics of thermal runaway calorimetry data ( e.g. Accelerating Rate Calorimetry (ARC)) is needed to determine the temperature-driven decomposition kinetics. Conventional methods of fitting Arrhenius Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) thermal runaway models to Accelerated Rate Calorimetry (ARC) data make several assumptions that reduce the fidelity and generalizability of the obtained model. In this paper, Chemical Reaction Neural Networks (CRNNs) are trained to fit the kinetic parameters of N-equation Arrhenius ODEs to ARC data obtained from a Molicel 21700 P45B. The models are found to be better approximations of the experimental data. The flexibility of the method is demonstrated by experimenting with two-equation and four-equation models. Thermal runaway simulations are conducted in 3D using the obtained kinetic parameters, showing the applicability of the obtained thermal runaway models to large-scale simulations.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present xGen-VideoSyn-1, a text-to-video (T2V) generation model capable of producing realistic scenes from textual descriptions. Building on recent advancements, such as OpenAI's Sora, we explore the latent diffusion model (LDM) architecture and introduce a video variational autoencoder (VidVAE). VidVAE compresses video data both spatially and temporally, significantly reducing the length of visual tokens and the computational demands associated with generating long-sequence videos. To further address the computational costs, we propose a divide-and-merge strategy that maintains temporal consistency across video segments. Our Diffusion Transformer (DiT) model incorporates spatial and temporal self-attention layers, enabling robust generalization across different timeframes and aspect ratios. We have devised a data processing pipeline from the very beginning and collected over 13M high-quality video-text pairs. The pipeline includes multiple steps such as clipping, text detection, motion estimation, aesthetics scoring, and dense captioning based on our in-house video-LLM model. Training the VidVAE and DiT models required approximately 40 and 642 H100 days, respectively. Our model supports over 14-second 720p video generation in an end-to-end way and demonstrates competitive performance against state-of-the-art T2V models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luyang Luo, Mingxiang Wu, Mei Li, Yi Xin, Qiong Wang, Varut Vardhanabhuti, Winnie CW Chu, Zhenhui Li, Juan Zhou, Pranav Rajpurkar, Hao Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the imaging technique with the highest sensitivity for detecting breast cancer and is routinely used for women at high risk. Despite the comprehensive multiparametric protocol of breast MRI, existing artificial intelligence-based studies predominantly rely on single sequences and have limited validation. Here we report a large mixture-of-modality-experts model (MOME) that integrates multiparametric MRI information within a unified structure, offering a noninvasive method for personalized breast cancer management. We have curated the largest multiparametric breast MRI dataset, involving 5,205 patients from three hospitals in the north, southeast, and southwest of China, for the development and extensive evaluation of our model. MOME demonstrated accurate and robust identification of breast cancer. It achieved comparable performance for malignancy recognition to that of four senior radiologists and significantly outperformed a junior radiologist, with 0.913 AUROC, 0.948 AUPRC, 0.905 F1 score, and 0.723 MCC. Our findings suggest that MOME could reduce the need for biopsies in BI-RADS 4 patients with a ratio of 7.3%, classify triple-negative breast cancer with an AUROC of 0.709, and predict pathological complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy with an AUROC of 0.694. The model further supports scalable and interpretable inference, adapting to missing modalities and providing decision explanations by highlighting lesions and measuring modality contributions. MOME exemplifies a discriminative, robust, scalable, and interpretable multimodal model, paving the way for noninvasive, personalized management of breast cancer patients based on multiparametric breast imaging data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Memoona Aziz, Umair Rehman, Syed Ali Safi, Amir Zaib Abbasi</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancements in AI technologies have revolutionized the production of graphical content across various sectors, including entertainment, advertising, and e-commerce. These developments have spurred the need for robust evaluation methods to assess the quality and realism of AI-generated images. To address this, we conducted three studies. First, we introduced and validated a questionnaire called Visual Verity, which measures photorealism, image quality, and text-image alignment. Second, we applied this questionnaire to assess images from AI models (DALL-E2, DALL-E3, GLIDE, Stable Diffusion) and camera-generated images, revealing that camera-generated images excelled in photorealism and text-image alignment, while AI models led in image quality. We also analyzed statistical properties, finding that camera-generated images scored lower in hue, saturation, and brightness. Third, we evaluated computational metrics' alignment with human judgments, identifying MS-SSIM and CLIP as the most consistent with human assessments. Additionally, we proposed the Neural Feature Similarity Score (NFSS) for assessing image quality. Our findings highlight the need for refining computational metrics to better capture human visual perception, thereby enhancing AI-generated content evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seungbeom Hu, ChanJun Park, Andrew Ferraiuolo, Sang-Ki Ko, Jinwoo Kim, Haein Song, Jieung Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Determining the optimal size of a neural network is critical, as it directly impacts runtime performance and memory usage. Pruning is a well-established model compression technique that reduces the size of neural networks while mathematically guaranteeing accuracy preservation. However, many recent pruning methods overlook the global contributions of individual model components, making it difficult to ensure that a pruned model meets the desired dataset and performance requirements. To address these challenges, we developed a new pruning algorithm, MPruner, that leverages mutual information through vector similarity. MPruner utilizes layer clustering with the Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) similarity metric, allowing us to incorporate global information from the neural network for more precise and efficient layer-wise pruning. We evaluated MPruner across various architectures and configurations, demonstrating its versatility and providing practical guidelines. MPruner achieved up to a 50% reduction in parameters and memory usage for CNN and transformer-based models, with minimal to no loss in accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid progress in Deep Learning (DL) and Large Language Models (LLMs) has exponentially increased demands of computational power and bandwidth. This, combined with the high costs of faster computing chips and interconnects, has significantly inflated High Performance Computing (HPC) construction costs. To address these challenges, we introduce the Fire-Flyer AI-HPC architecture, a synergistic hardware-software co-design framework and its best practices. For DL training, we deployed the Fire-Flyer 2 with 10,000 PCIe A100 GPUs, achieved performance approximating the DGX-A100 while reducing costs by half and energy consumption by 40%. We specifically engineered HFReduce to accelerate allreduce communication and implemented numerous measures to keep our Computation-Storage Integrated Network congestion-free. Through our software stack, including HaiScale, 3FS, and HAI-Platform, we achieved substantial scalability by overlapping computation and communication. Our system-oriented experience from DL training provides valuable insights to drive future advancements in AI-HPC.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, foundation models (FMs) such as large language models (LLMs) and latent diffusion models (LDMs) have profoundly impacted diverse sectors, including music. This comprehensive review examines state-of-the-art (SOTA) pre-trained models and foundation models in music, spanning from representation learning, generative learning and multimodal learning. We first contextualise the significance of music in various industries and trace the evolution of AI in music. By delineating the modalities targeted by foundation models, we discover many of the music representations are underexplored in FM development. Then, emphasis is placed on the lack of versatility of previous methods on diverse music applications, along with the potential of FMs in music understanding, generation and medical application. By comprehensively exploring the details of the model pre-training paradigm, architectural choices, tokenisation, finetuning methodologies and controllability, we emphasise the important topics that should have been well explored, like instruction tuning and in-context learning, scaling law and emergent ability, as well as long-sequence modelling etc. A dedicated section presents insights into music agents, accompanied by a thorough analysis of datasets and evaluations essential for pre-training and downstream tasks. Finally, by underscoring the vital importance of ethical considerations, we advocate that following research on FM for music should focus more on such issues as interpretability, transparency, human responsibility, and copyright issues. The paper offers insights into future challenges and trends on FMs for music, aiming to shape the trajectory of human-AI collaboration in the music realm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anis Bourou, Val\'erie Mezger, Auguste Genovesio</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have seen significant advancements, leading to their widespread adoption across various fields. The original GAN architecture enables the generation of images without any specific control over the content, making it an unconditional generation process. However, many practical applications require precise control over the generated output, which has led to the development of conditional GANs (cGANs) that incorporate explicit conditioning to guide the generation process. cGANs extend the original framework by incorporating additional information (conditions), enabling the generation of samples that adhere to that specific criteria. Various conditioning methods have been proposed, each differing in how they integrate the conditioning information into both the generator and the discriminator networks. In this work, we review the conditioning methods proposed for GANs, exploring the characteristics of each method and highlighting their unique mechanisms and theoretical foundations. Furthermore, we conduct a comparative analysis of these methods, evaluating their performance on various image datasets. Through these analyses, we aim to provide insights into the strengths and limitations of various conditioning techniques, guiding future research and application in generative modeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xing Ai, Guanyu Zhu, Yulin Zhu, Yu Zheng, Gaolei Li, Jianhua Li, Kai Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated commendable performance for graph-structured data. Yet, GNNs are often vulnerable to adversarial structural attacks as embedding generation relies on graph topology. Existing efforts are dedicated to purifying the maliciously modified structure or applying adaptive aggregation, thereby enhancing the robustness against adversarial structural attacks. It is inevitable for a defender to consume heavy computational costs due to lacking prior knowledge about modified structures. To this end, we propose an efficient defense method, called Simple and Fast Robust Graph Neural Network (SFR-GNN), supported by mutual information theory. The SFR-GNN first pre-trains a GNN model using node attributes and then fine-tunes it over the modified graph in the manner of contrastive learning, which is free of purifying modified structures and adaptive aggregation, thus achieving great efficiency gains. Consequently, SFR-GNN exhibits a 24%--162% speedup compared to advanced robust models, demonstrating superior robustness for node classification tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuan Shi, Jing Yan, Xiaoli Tang, Lingjuan Lyu, Boi Faltings</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing sophistication of text-to-image generative models has led to complex challenges in defining and enforcing copyright infringement criteria and protection. Existing methods, such as watermarking and dataset deduplication, fail to provide comprehensive solutions due to the lack of standardized metrics and the inherent complexity of addressing copyright infringement in diffusion models. To deal with these challenges, we propose a Reinforcement Learning-based Copyright Protection(RLCP) method for Text-to-Image Diffusion Model, which minimizes the generation of copyright-infringing content while maintaining the quality of the model-generated dataset. Our approach begins with the introduction of a novel copyright metric grounded in copyright law and court precedents on infringement. We then utilize the Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization (DDPO) framework to guide the model through a multi-step decision-making process, optimizing it using a reward function that incorporates our proposed copyright metric. Additionally, we employ KL divergence as a regularization term to mitigate some failure modes and stabilize RL fine-tuning. Experiments conducted on 3 mixed datasets of copyright and non-copyright images demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces copyright infringement risk while maintaining image quality.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multi-vector dense models, such as ColBERT, have proven highly effective in information retrieval. ColBERT's late interaction scoring approximates the joint query-document attention seen in cross-encoders while maintaining inference efficiency closer to traditional dense retrieval models, thanks to its bi-encoder architecture and recent optimizations in indexing and search. In this paper, we introduce a novel architecture and a training framework to support long context window and multilingual retrieval. Leveraging Matryoshka Representation Loss, we further demonstrate that the reducing the embedding dimensionality from 128 to 64 has insignificant impact on the model's retrieval performance and cut storage requirements by up to 50%. Our new model, Jina-ColBERT-v2, demonstrates strong performance across a range of English and multilingual retrieval tasks,</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihao Chen, Zefang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Channel pruning is a promising method for accelerating and compressing convolutional neural networks. However, current pruning algorithms still remain unsolved problems that how to assign layer-wise pruning ratios properly and discard the least important channels with a convincing criterion. In this paper, we present a novel channel pruning approach via information theory and interpretability of neural networks. Specifically, we regard information entropy as the expected amount of information for convolutional layers. In addition, if we suppose a matrix as a system of linear equations, a higher-rank matrix represents there exist more solutions to it, which indicates more uncertainty. From the point of view of information theory, the rank can also describe the amount of information. In a neural network, considering the rank and entropy as two information indicators of convolutional layers, we propose a fusion function to reach a compromise of them, where the fusion results are defined as ``information concentration''. When pre-defining layer-wise pruning ratios, we employ the information concentration as a reference instead of heuristic and engineering tuning to provide a more interpretable solution. Moreover, we leverage Shapley values, which are a potent tool in the interpretability of neural networks, to evaluate the channel contributions and discard the least important channels for model compression while maintaining its performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and promising performance of our method. For example, our method improves the accuracy by 0.21% when reducing 45.5% FLOPs and removing 40.3% parameters for ResNet-56 on CIFAR-10. Moreover, our method obtains loss in Top-1/Top-5 accuracies of 0.43%/0.11% by reducing 41.6% FLOPs and removing 35.0% parameters for ResNet-50 on ImageNet.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sachin Shukla, Omid Mirzaei</p>
<p>Abstract: In the pursuit of an effective spam detection system, the focus has often been on identifying known spam patterns either through rule-based detection systems or machine learning (ML) solutions that rely on keywords. However, both systems are susceptible to evasion techniques and zero-day attacks that can be achieved at low cost. Therefore, an email that bypassed the defense system once can do it again in the following days, even though rules are updated or the ML models are retrained. The recurrence of failures to detect emails that exhibit layout similarities to previously undetected spam is concerning for customers and can erode their trust in a company. Our observations show that threat actors reuse email kits extensively and can bypass detection with little effort, for example, by making changes to the content of emails. In this work, we propose an email visual similarity detection approach, named Pisco, to improve the detection capabilities of an email threat defense system. We apply our proof of concept to some real-world samples received from different sources. Our results show that email kits are being reused extensively and visually similar emails are sent to our customers at various time intervals. Therefore, this method could be very helpful in situations where detection features that rely on textual features and keywords are bypassed, an occurrence our observations show happens frequently.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jutika Borah, Kumaresh Sarmah, Hidam Kumarjit Singh</p>
<p>Abstract: Imaging techniques such as Chest X-rays, whole slide images, and optical coherence tomography serve as the initial screening and detection for a wide variety of medical pulmonary and ophthalmic conditions respectively. This paper investigates the intricacies of using pretrained deep convolutional neural networks with transfer learning across diverse medical imaging datasets with varying modalities for binary and multiclass classification. We conducted a comprehensive performance analysis with ten network architectures and model families each with pretraining and random initialization. Our finding showed that the use of pretrained models as fixed feature extractors yields poor performance irrespective of the datasets. Contrary, histopathology microscopy whole slide images have better performance. It is also found that deeper and more complex architectures did not necessarily result in the best performance. This observation implies that the improvements in ImageNet are not parallel to the medical imaging tasks. Within a medical domain, the performance of the network architectures varies within model families with shifts in datasets. This indicates that the performance of models within a specific modality may not be conclusive for another modality within the same domain. This study provides a deeper understanding of the applications of deep learning techniques in medical imaging and highlights the impact of pretrained networks across different medical imaging datasets under five different experimental settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chun Tong Lei, Hon Ming Yam, Zhongliang Guo, Chun Pong Lau</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural networks, despite their remarkable performance in widespread applications, including image classification, are also known to be vulnerable to subtle adversarial noise. Although some diffusion-based purification methods have been proposed, for example, DiffPure, those methods are time-consuming. In this paper, we propose One Step Control Purification (OSCP), a diffusion-based purification model that can purify the adversarial image in one Neural Function Evaluation (NFE) in diffusion models. We use Latent Consistency Model (LCM) and ControlNet for our one-step purification. OSCP is computationally friendly and time efficient compared to other diffusion-based purification methods; we achieve defense success rate of 74.19\% on ImageNet, only requiring 0.1s for each purification. Moreover, there is a fundamental incongruence between consistency distillation and adversarial perturbation. To address this ontological dissonance, we propose Gaussian Adversarial Noise Distillation (GAND), a novel consistency distillation framework that facilitates a more nuanced reconciliation of the latent space dynamics, effectively bridging the natural and adversarial manifolds. Our experiments show that the GAND does not need a Full Fine Tune (FFT); PEFT, e.g., LoRA is sufficient.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks have been widely applied in critical decision-making areas that demand interpretable predictions, leading to the flourishing development of interpretability algorithms. However, current graph interpretability algorithms tend to emphasize generality and often overlook biological significance, thereby limiting their applicability in predicting cancer drug responses. In this paper, we propose a novel post-hoc interpretability algorithm for cancer drug response prediction, CETExplainer, which incorporates a controllable edge-type-specific weighting mechanism. It considers the mutual information between subgraphs and predictions, proposing a structural scoring approach to provide fine-grained, biologically meaningful explanations for predictive models. We also introduce a method for constructing ground truth based on real-world datasets to quantitatively evaluate the proposed interpretability algorithm. Empirical analysis on the real-world dataset demonstrates that CETExplainer achieves superior stability and improves explanation quality compared to leading algorithms, thereby offering a robust and insightful tool for cancer drug prediction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Naoki Wake, Atsushi Kanehira, Kazuhiro Sasabuchi, Jun Takamatsu, Katsushi Ikeuchi</p>
<p>Abstract: Video action localization aims to find timings of a specific action from a long video. Although existing learning-based approaches have been successful, those require annotating videos that come with a considerable labor cost. This paper proposes a learning-free, open-vocabulary approach based on emerging off-the-shelf vision-language models (VLM). The challenge stems from the fact that VLMs are neither designed to process long videos nor tailored for finding actions. We overcome these problems by extending an iterative visual prompting technique. Specifically, we sample video frames into a concatenated image with frame index labels, making a VLM guess a frame that is considered to be closest to the start/end of the action. Iterating this process by narrowing a sampling time window results in finding a specific frame of start and end of an action. We demonstrate that this sampling technique yields reasonable results, illustrating a practical extension of VLMs for understanding videos. A sample code is available at https://microsoft.github.io/VLM-Video-Action-Localization/.</p>
