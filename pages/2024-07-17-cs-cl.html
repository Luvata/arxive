<p><b>Authors:</b> Sandra C. Matz, Heinrich Peters, Paul W. Eastwick, Moran Cerf, Eli J. Finkel</p>
<p>Abstract: What makes people 'click' on a first date and become mutually attracted to one another? While understanding and predicting the dynamics of romantic interactions used to be exclusive to human judgment, we show that Large Language Models (LLMs) can detect romantic attraction during brief getting-to-know-you interactions. Examining data from 964 speed dates, we show that ChatGPT (and Claude 3) can predict both objective and subjective indicators of speed dating success (r=0.12-0.23). ChatGPT's predictions of actual matching (i.e., the exchange of contact information) were not only on par with those of human judges who had access to the same information but incremental to speed daters' own predictions. While some of the variance in ChatGPT's predictions can be explained by common content dimensions (such as the valence of the conversations) the fact that there remains a substantial proportion of unexplained variance suggests that ChatGPT also picks up on conversational dynamics. In addition, ChatGPT's judgments showed substantial overlap with those made by the human observers (mean r=0.29), highlighting similarities in their representation of romantic attraction that is, partially, independent of accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Ensuring the general efficacy and goodness for human beings from medical large language models (LLM) before real-world deployment is crucial. However, a widely accepted and accessible evaluation process for medical LLM, especially in the Chinese context, remains to be established. In this work, we introduce "MedBench", a comprehensive, standardized, and reliable benchmarking system for Chinese medical LLM. First, MedBench assembles the currently largest evaluation dataset (300,901 questions) to cover 43 clinical specialties and performs multi-facet evaluation on medical LLM. Second, MedBench provides a standardized and fully automatic cloud-based evaluation infrastructure, with physical separations for question and ground truth. Third, MedBench implements dynamic evaluation mechanisms to prevent shortcut learning and answer remembering. Applying MedBench to popular general and medical LLMs, we observe unbiased, reproducible evaluation results largely aligning with medical professionals' perspectives. This study establishes a significant foundation for preparing the practical applications of Chinese medical LLMs. MedBench is publicly accessible at https://medbench.opencompass.org.cn.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hossein Ghorbanfekr, Pieter Jan Kerstens, Katrijn Dirix</p>
<p>Abstract: Geological borehole descriptions contain detailed textual information about the composition of the subsurface. However, their unstructured format presents significant challenges for extracting relevant features into a structured format. This paper introduces GEOBERTje: a domain adapted large language model trained on geological borehole descriptions from Flanders (Belgium) in the Dutch language. This model effectively extracts relevant information from the borehole descriptions and represents it into a numeric vector space. Showcasing just one potential application of GEOBERTje, we finetune a classifier model on a limited number of manually labeled observations. This classifier categorizes borehole descriptions into a main, second and third lithology class. We show that our classifier outperforms both a rule-based approach and GPT-4 of OpenAI. This study exemplifies how domain adapted large language models enhance the efficiency and accuracy of extracting information from complex, unstructured geological descriptions. This offers new opportunities for geological analysis and modeling using vast amounts of data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alicja R\k{a}czkowska, Aleksandra Osowska-Kurczab, Jacek Szczerbi\'nski, Kalina Jasinska-Kobus, Klaudia Nazarko</p>
<p>Abstract: Label noise remains a challenge for training robust classification models. Most methods for mitigating label noise have been benchmarked using primarily datasets with synthetic noise. While the need for datasets with realistic noise distribution has partially been addressed by web-scraped benchmarks such as WebVision and Clothing1M, those benchmarks are restricted to the computer vision domain. With the growing importance of Transformer-based models, it is crucial to establish text classification benchmarks for learning with noisy labels. In this paper, we present AlleNoise, a new curated text classification benchmark dataset with real-world instance-dependent label noise, containing over 500,000 examples across approximately 5,600 classes, complemented with a meaningful, hierarchical taxonomy of categories. The noise distribution comes from actual users of a major e-commerce marketplace, so it realistically reflects the semantics of human mistakes. In addition to the noisy labels, we provide human-verified clean labels, which help to get a deeper insight into the noise distribution, unlike web-scraped datasets typically used in the field. We demonstrate that a representative selection of established methods for learning with noisy labels is inadequate to handle such real-world noise. In addition, we show evidence that these algorithms do not alleviate excessive memorization. As such, with AlleNoise, we set the bar high for the development of label noise methods that can handle real-world label noise in text classification tasks. The code and dataset are available for download at https://github.com/allegro/AlleNoise.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sinan Sonlu, Bennie Bendiksen, Funda Durupinar, U\u{g}ur G\"ud\"ukbay</p>
<p>Abstract: This work investigates how personality expression and embodiment affect personality perception and learning in educational conversational agents. We extend an existing personality-driven conversational agent framework by integrating LLM-based conversation support tailored to an educational application. We describe a user study built on this system to evaluate two distinct personality styles: high extroversion and agreeableness and low extroversion and agreeableness. For each personality style, we assess three models: (1) a dialogue-only model that conveys personality through dialogue, (2) an animated human model that expresses personality solely through dialogue, and (3) an animated human model that expresses personality through both dialogue and body and facial animations. The results indicate that all models are positively perceived regarding both personality and learning outcomes. Models with high personality traits are perceived as more engaging than those with low personality traits. We provide a comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analysis of perceived personality traits, learning parameters, and user experiences based on participant ratings of the model types and personality styles, as well as users' responses to open-ended questions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Armand Nicolicioiu, Eugenia Iofinova, Eldar Kurtic, Mahdi Nikdan, Andrei Panferov, Ilia Markov, Nir Shavit, Dan Alistarh</p>
<p>Abstract: The availability of powerful open-source large language models (LLMs) opens exciting use-cases, such as automated personal assistants that adapt to the user's unique data and demands. Two key desiderata for such assistants are personalization-in the sense that the assistant should reflect the user's own style-and privacy-in the sense that users may prefer to always store their personal data locally, on their own computing device. We present a new design for such an automated assistant, for the specific use case of personal assistant for email generation, which we call Panza. Specifically, Panza can be both trained and inferenced locally on commodity hardware, and is personalized to the user's writing style. Panza's personalization features are based on a new technique called data playback, which allows us to fine-tune an LLM to better reflect a user's writing style using limited data. We show that, by combining efficient fine-tuning and inference methods, Panza can be executed entirely locally using limited resources-specifically, it can be executed within the same resources as a free Google Colab instance. Finally, our key methodological contribution is a careful study of evaluation metrics, and of how different choices of system components (e.g. the use of Retrieval-Augmented Generation or different fine-tuning approaches) impact the system's performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jessica Foo, Shaun Khoo</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent in a wide variety of applications, concerns about the safety of their outputs have become more significant. Most efforts at safety-tuning or moderation today take on a predominantly Western-centric view of safety, especially for toxic, hateful, or violent speech. In this paper, we describe LionGuard, a Singapore-contextualized moderation classifier that can serve as guardrails against unsafe LLM outputs. When assessed on Singlish data, LionGuard outperforms existing widely-used moderation APIs, which are not finetuned for the Singapore context, by 14% (binary) and up to 51% (multi-label). Our work highlights the benefits of localization for moderation classifiers and presents a practical and scalable approach for low-resource languages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhimin Li, Haichao Miao, Valerio Pascucci, Shusen Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent introduction of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) combine the inherent power of large language models (LLMs) with the renewed capabilities to reason about the multimodal context. The potential usage scenarios for MLLMs significantly outpace their text-only counterparts. Many recent works in visualization have demonstrated MLLMs' capability to understand and interpret visualization results and explain the content of the visualization to users in natural language. In the machine learning community, the general vision capabilities of MLLMs have been evaluated and tested through various visual understanding benchmarks. However, the ability of MLLMs to accomplish specific visualization tasks based on visual perception has not been properly explored and evaluated, particularly, from a visualization-centric perspective.
  In this work, we aim to fill the gap by utilizing the concept of visualization literacy to evaluate MLLMs. We assess MLLMs' performance over two popular visualization literacy evaluation datasets (VLAT and mini-VLAT). Under the framework of visualization literacy, we develop a general setup to compare different multimodal large language models (e.g., GPT4-o, Claude 3 Opus, Gemini 1.5 Pro) as well as against existing human baselines. Our study demonstrates MLLMs' competitive performance in visualization literacy, where they outperform humans in certain tasks such as identifying correlations, clusters, and hierarchical structures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Do Huu Dat, Do Duc Anh, Anh Tuan Luu, Wray Buntine</p>
<p>Abstract: While diffusion models excel at conditional generating high-quality images, prior works in discrete diffusion models were not evaluated on conditional long-text generation. In this work, we address the limitations of prior discrete diffusion models for conditional long-text generation, particularly in long sequence-to-sequence tasks such as abstractive summarization. Despite fast decoding speeds compared to autoregressive methods, previous diffusion models failed on the abstractive summarization task due to the incompatibility between the backbone architectures and the random noising process. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel semantic-aware noising process that enables Transformer backbones to handle long sequences effectively. Additionally, we propose CrossMamba, an adaptation of the Mamba model to the encoder-decoder paradigm, which integrates seamlessly with the random absorbing noising process. Our approaches achieve state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark summarization datasets: Gigaword, CNN/DailyMail, and Arxiv, outperforming existing discrete diffusion models on ROUGE metrics as well as possessing much faster speed in inference compared to autoregressive models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaiqi Zhang, Shuai Yuan, Honghan Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLM), the evaluation of LLM becomes increasingly important. Measuring text generation tasks such as summarization and article creation is very difficult. Especially in specific application domains (e.g., to-business or to-customer service), in-house evaluation criteria have to meet not only general standards (correctness, helpfulness and creativity, etc.) but also specific needs of customers and business security requirements at the same time, making the evaluation more difficult. So far, the evaluation of LLM in business scenarios has mainly relied on manual, which is expensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a model-based evaluation method: TALEC, which allows users to flexibly set their own evaluation criteria, and uses in-context learning (ICL) to teach judge model these in-house criteria. In addition, we try combining zero-shot and few-shot to make the judge model focus on more information. We also propose a prompt paradigm and an engineering approach to adjust and iterate the shots ,helping judge model to better understand the complex criteria. We then compare fine-tuning with ICL, finding that fine-tuning can be replaced by ICL. TALEC demonstrates a strong capability to accurately reflect human preferences and achieves a correlation of over 80% with human judgments, outperforming even the inter-human correlation in some tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daan Kepel, Konstantina Valogianni</p>
<p>Abstract: Prompt engineering is a crucial yet challenging task for optimizing the performance of large language models (LLMs) on customized tasks. This pioneering research introduces the Automatic Prompt Engineering Toolbox (APET), which enables GPT-4 to autonomously apply prompt engineering techniques. By leveraging sophisticated strategies such as Expert Prompting, Chain of Thought, and Tree of Thoughts, APET empowers GPT-4 to dynamically optimize prompts, resulting in substantial improvements in tasks like Word Sorting (4.4% increase) and Geometric Shapes (6.8% increase). Despite encountering challenges in complex tasks such as Checkmate in One (-14.8%), these findings demonstrate the transformative potential of APET in automating complex prompt optimization processes without the use of external data. Overall, this research represents a significant leap in AI development, presenting a robust framework for future innovations in autonomous AI systems and highlighting the ability of GPT-4 to bring prompt engineering theory to practice. It establishes a foundation for enhancing performance in complex task performance and broadening the practical applications of these techniques in real-world scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jakub M. Tomczak</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI systems by enabling communication with machines using natural language. Recent developments in Generative AI (GenAI) like Vision-Language Models (GPT-4V) and Gemini have shown great promise in using LLMs as multimodal systems. This new research line results in building Generative AI systems, GenAISys for short, that are capable of multimodal processing and content creation, as well as decision-making. GenAISys use natural language as a communication means and modality encoders as I/O interfaces for processing various data sources. They are also equipped with databases and external specialized tools, communicating with the system through a module for information retrieval and storage. This paper aims to explore and state new research directions in Generative AI Systems, including how to design GenAISys (compositionality, reliability, verifiability), build and train them, and what can be learned from the system-based perspective. Cross-disciplinary approaches are needed to answer open questions about the inner workings of GenAI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guorun Wang, Lucia Specia</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image models are known to propagate social biases. For example when prompted to generate images of people in certain professions, these models tend to systematically generate specific genders or ethnicity. In this paper, we show that this bias is already present in the text encoder of the model and introduce a Mixture-of-Experts approach by identifying text-encoded bias in the latent space and then creating a bias-identification gate. More specifically, we propose MoESD (Mixture of Experts Stable Diffusion) with BiAs (Bias Adapters) to mitigate gender bias. We also demonstrate that a special token is essential during the mitigation process. With experiments focusing on gender bias, we demonstrate that our approach successfully mitigates gender bias while maintaining image quality.</p>

<p>Abstract: The integration of large language models into public transit systems represents a significant advancement in urban transportation management and passenger experience. This study examines the impact of LLMs within San Antonio's public transit system, leveraging their capabilities in natural language processing, data analysis, and real time communication. By utilizing GTFS and other public transportation information, the research highlights the transformative potential of LLMs in enhancing route planning, reducing wait times, and providing personalized travel assistance. Our case study is the city of San Antonio as part of a project aiming to demonstrate how LLMs can optimize resource allocation, improve passenger satisfaction, and support decision making processes in transit management. We evaluated LLM responses to questions related to both information retrieval and also understanding. Ultimately, we believe that the adoption of LLMs in public transit systems can lead to more efficient, responsive, and user-friendly transportation networks, providing a model for other cities to follow.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tzu-Heng Huang, Catherine Cao, Vaishnavi Bhargava, Frederic Sala</p>
<p>Abstract: Large pretrained models can be used as annotators, helping replace or augment crowdworkers and enabling distilling generalist models into smaller specialist models. Unfortunately, this comes at a cost: employing top-of-the-line models often requires paying thousands of dollars for API calls, while the resulting datasets are static and challenging to audit. To address these challenges, we propose a simple alternative: rather than directly querying labels from pretrained models, we task models to generate programs that can produce labels. These programs can be stored and applied locally, re-used and extended, and cost orders of magnitude less. Our system, Alchemist, obtains comparable to or better performance than large language model-based annotation in a range of tasks for a fraction of the cost: on average, improvements amount to a 12.9% enhancement while the total labeling costs across all datasets are reduced by a factor of approximately 500x.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Robert Friel, Masha Belyi, Atindriyo Sanyal</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a standard architectural pattern for incorporating domain-specific knowledge into user-facing chat applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). RAG systems are characterized by (1) a document retriever that queries a domain-specific corpus for context information relevant to an input query, and (2) an LLM that generates a response based on the provided query and context. However, comprehensive evaluation of RAG systems remains a challenge due to the lack of unified evaluation criteria and annotated datasets. In response, we introduce RAGBench: the first comprehensive, large-scale RAG benchmark dataset of 100k examples. It covers five unique industry-specific domains and various RAG task types. RAGBench examples are sourced from industry corpora such as user manuals, making it particularly relevant for industry applications. Further, we formalize the TRACe evaluation framework: a set of explainable and actionable RAG evaluation metrics applicable across all RAG domains. We release the labeled dataset at https://huggingface.co/datasets/rungalileo/ragbench. RAGBench explainable labels facilitate holistic evaluation of RAG systems, enabling actionable feedback for continuous improvement of production applications. Thorough extensive benchmarking, we find that LLM-based RAG evaluation methods struggle to compete with a finetuned RoBERTa model on the RAG evaluation task. We identify areas where existing approaches fall short and propose the adoption of RAGBench with TRACe towards advancing the state of RAG evaluation systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Oluyemi Enoch Amujo, Shanchieh Jay Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have expanded into various domains. However, there remains a need to evaluate how these models perform when prompted with commonplace queries compared to domain-specific queries, which may be useful for benchmarking prior to fine-tuning domain-specific downstream tasks. This study evaluates LLMs, specifically Gemma-2B and Gemma-7B, across diverse domains, including cybersecurity, medicine, and finance, compared to common knowledge queries. This study employs a comprehensive methodology to evaluate foundational models, encompassing problem formulation, data analysis, and the development of novel outlier detection techniques. This methodological rigor enhances the credibility of the presented evaluation frameworks. This study focused on assessing inference time, response length, throughput, quality, and resource utilization and investigated the correlations between these factors. The results indicate that model size and types of prompts used for inference significantly influenced response length and quality. In addition, common prompts, which include various types of queries, generate diverse and inconsistent responses at irregular intervals. In contrast, domain-specific prompts consistently generate concise responses within a reasonable time. Overall, this study underscores the need for comprehensive evaluation frameworks to enhance the reliability of benchmarking procedures in multidomain AI research.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11007">Panacea: A foundation model for clinical trial search, summarization, design, and recruitment</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiacheng Lin, Hanwen Xu, Zifeng Wang, Sheng Wang, Jimeng Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Clinical trials are fundamental in developing new drugs, medical devices, and treatments. However, they are often time-consuming and have low success rates. Although there have been initial attempts to create large language models (LLMs) for clinical trial design and patient-trial matching, these models remain task-specific and not adaptable to diverse clinical trial tasks. To address this challenge, we propose a clinical trial foundation model named Panacea, designed to handle multiple tasks, including trial search, trial summarization, trial design, and patient-trial matching. We also assemble a large-scale dataset, named TrialAlign, of 793,279 trial documents and 1,113,207 trial-related scientific papers, to infuse clinical knowledge into the model by pre-training. We further curate TrialInstruct, which has 200,866 of instruction data for fine-tuning. These resources enable Panacea to be widely applicable for a range of clinical trial tasks based on user requirements.
  We evaluated Panacea on a new benchmark, named TrialPanorama, which covers eight clinical trial tasks. Our method performed the best on seven of the eight tasks compared to six cutting-edge generic or medicine-specific LLMs. Specifically, Panacea showed great potential to collaborate with human experts in crafting the design of eligibility criteria, study arms, and outcome measures, in multi-round conversations. In addition, Panacea achieved 14.42% improvement in patient-trial matching, 41.78% to 52.02% improvement in trial search, and consistently ranked at the top for five aspects of trial summarization. Our approach demonstrates the effectiveness of Panacea in clinical trials and establishes a comprehensive resource, including training data, model, and benchmark, for developing clinical trial foundation models, paving the path for AI-based clinical trial development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stanley Cao, Kevin Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Figures are essential channels for densely communicating complex ideas in scientific papers. Previous work in automatically generating figure captions has been largely unsuccessful and has defaulted to using single-layer LSTMs, which no longer achieve state-of-the-art performance. In our work, we use the SciCap datasets curated by Hsu et al. and use a variant of a CLIP+GPT-2 encoder-decoder model with cross-attention to generate captions conditioned on the image. Furthermore, we augment our training pipeline by creating a new dataset MetaSciCap that incorporates textual metadata from the original paper relevant to the figure, such as the title, abstract, and in-text references. We use SciBERT to encode the textual metadata and use this encoding alongside the figure embedding. In our experimentation with different models, we found that the CLIP+GPT-2 model performs better when it receives all textual metadata from the SciBERT encoder in addition to the figure, but employing a SciBERT+GPT2 model that uses only the textual metadata achieved optimal performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kevin Gu, Eva Tuecke, Dmitriy Katz, Raya Horesh, David Alvarez-Melis, Mikhail Yurochkin</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable potential for problem solving, with open source models achieving increasingly impressive performance on benchmarks measuring areas from logical reasoning to mathematical ability. Ensembling models can further improve capabilities across a variety of domains. However, conventional methods of combining models at inference time such as shallow fusion necessitate a shared vocabulary and tokenization, and alternatives like fine-tuning for domain-specific performance are both time consuming and computationally expensive. We therefore present an inference-time ensembling algorithm aimed at "averaging" outputs from multiple LLMs and illustrate its improved performance across multiple domains compared to its constituent models alone. Character-wise ensemble decoding, CharED, finds the marginal distribution of each character for an individual model and performs a weighted average to generate an output, character by character. In coding, math, and toxicity benchmarks, we find our proposed model able to combine complimentary strengths of multiple LLMs, regardless of vocabulary, tokenization, or model size.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rastislav Rabatin, Frank Seide, Ernie Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: We adapt the well-known beam-search algorithm for machine translation to operate in a cascaded real-time speech translation system. This proved to be more complex than initially anticipated, due to four key challenges: (1) real-time processing of intermediate and final transcriptions with incomplete words from ASR, (2) emitting intermediate and final translations with minimal user perceived latency, (3) handling beam search hypotheses that have unequal length and different model state, and (4) handling sentence boundaries. Previous work in the field of simultaneous machine translation only implemented greedy decoding. We present a beam-search realization that handles all of the above, providing guidance through the minefield of challenges. Our approach increases the BLEU score by 1 point compared to greedy search, reduces the CPU time by up to 40% and character flicker rate by 20+% compared to a baseline heuristic that just retranslates input repeatedly.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maurice Gerczuk, Shahin Amiriparian, Justina Lutz, Wolfgang Strube, Irina Papazova, Alkomiet Hasan, Bj\"orn W. Schuller</p>
<p>Abstract: In emergency medicine, timely intervention for patients at risk of suicide is often hindered by delayed access to specialised psychiatric care. To bridge this gap, we introduce a speech-based approach for automatic suicide risk assessment. Our study involves a novel dataset comprising speech recordings of 20 patients who read neutral texts. We extract four speech representations encompassing interpretable and deep features. Further, we explore the impact of gender-based modelling and phrase-level normalisation. By applying gender-exclusive modelling, features extracted from an emotion fine-tuned wav2vec2.0 model can be utilised to discriminate high- from low- suicide risk with a balanced accuracy of 81%. Finally, our analysis reveals a discrepancy in the relationship of speech characteristics and suicide risk between female and male subjects. For men in our dataset, suicide risk increases together with agitation while voice characteristics of female subjects point the other way.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Devashish Vikas Gupta, Azeez Syed Ali Ishaqui, Divya Kiran Kadiyala</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising results in learning and contextualizing information from different forms of data. Recent advancements in foundational models, particularly those employing self-attention mechanisms, have significantly enhanced our ability to comprehend the semantics of diverse data types. One such area that could highly benefit from multi-modality is in understanding geospatial data, which inherently has multiple modalities. However, current Natural Language Processing (NLP) mechanisms struggle to effectively address geospatial queries. Existing pre-trained LLMs are inadequately equipped to meet the unique demands of geospatial data, lacking the ability to retrieve precise spatio-temporal data in real-time, thus leading to significantly reduced accuracy in answering complex geospatial queries. To address these limitations, we introduce Geode--a pioneering system designed to tackle zero-shot geospatial question-answering tasks with high precision using spatio-temporal data retrieval. Our approach represents a significant improvement in addressing the limitations of current LLM models, demonstrating remarkable improvement in geospatial question-answering abilities compared to existing state-of-the-art pre-trained models.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11015">Does ChatGPT Have a Mind?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Simon Goldstein, Benjamin A. Levinstein</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper examines the question of whether Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT possess minds, focusing specifically on whether they have a genuine folk psychology encompassing beliefs, desires, and intentions. We approach this question by investigating two key aspects: internal representations and dispositions to act. First, we survey various philosophical theories of representation, including informational, causal, structural, and teleosemantic accounts, arguing that LLMs satisfy key conditions proposed by each. We draw on recent interpretability research in machine learning to support these claims. Second, we explore whether LLMs exhibit robust dispositions to perform actions, a necessary component of folk psychology. We consider two prominent philosophical traditions, interpretationism and representationalism, to assess LLM action dispositions. While we find evidence suggesting LLMs may satisfy some criteria for having a mind, particularly in game-theoretic environments, we conclude that the data remains inconclusive. Additionally, we reply to several skeptical challenges to LLM folk psychology, including issues of sensory grounding, the "stochastic parrots" argument, and concerns about memorization. Our paper has three main upshots. First, LLMs do have robust internal representations. Second, there is an open question to answer about whether LLMs have robust action dispositions. Third, existing skeptical challenges to LLM representation do not survive philosophical scrutiny.</p>

<p>Abstract: Long-text generation is seemingly ubiquitous in real-world applications of large language models such as generating an email or writing a review. Despite the fundamental importance and prevalence of long-text generation in many practical applications, existing work on personalized generation has focused on the generation of very short text. To overcome these limitations, we study the problem of personalized long-text generation, that is, generating long-text that is personalized for a specific user while being practically useful for the vast majority of real-world applications that naturally require the generation of longer text. In this work, we demonstrate the importance of user-specific personalization for long-text generation tasks and develop the Long-text Language Model Personalization (LongLaMP) Benchmark. LongLaMP provides a comprehensive and diverse evaluation framework for personalized long-text generation. Extensive experiments on LongLaMP for zero-shot and fine-tuned language tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed benchmark and its utility for developing and evaluating techniques for personalized long-text generation across a wide variety of long-text generation tasks. The results highlight the importance of personalization across a wide variety of long-text generation tasks. Finally, we release the benchmark for others to use for this important problem.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jihyun Janice Ahn, Ryo Kamoi, Lu Cheng, Rui Zhang, Wenpeng Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Mainstream LLM research has primarily focused on enhancing their generative capabilities. However, even the most advanced LLMs experience uncertainty in their outputs, often producing varied results on different runs or when faced with minor changes in input, despite no substantial change in content. Given multiple responses from the same LLM to the same input, we advocate leveraging the LLMs' discriminative capability to reduce this generative uncertainty, aiding in identifying the correct answers. Specifically, we propose and analyze three discriminative prompts: direct, inverse, and hybrid, to explore the potential of both closed-source and open-source LLMs in self-improving their generative performance on two benchmark datasets. Our insights reveal which discriminative prompt is most promising and when to use it. To our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically analyze LLMs' discriminative capacity to address generative uncertainty.</p>

<p>Abstract: Even for better-studied sign languages like American Sign Language (ASL), data is the bottleneck for machine learning research. The situation is worse yet for the many other sign languages used by Deaf/Hard of Hearing communities around the world. In this paper, we present YouTube-SL-25, a large-scale, open-domain multilingual corpus of sign language videos with seemingly well-aligned captions drawn from YouTube. With >3000 hours of videos across >25 sign languages, YouTube-SL-25 is a) >3x the size of YouTube-ASL, b) the largest parallel sign language dataset to date, and c) the first or largest parallel dataset for many of its component languages. We provide baselines for sign-to-text tasks using a unified multilingual multitask model based on T5 and report scores on benchmarks across 4 sign languages. The results demonstrate that multilingual transfer benefits both higher- and lower-resource sign languages within YouTube-SL-25.</p>

<p>Abstract: Instruction-tuned large language models, such as T0, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in following instructions across various domains. However, their proficiency remains notably deficient in many low-resource languages. To address this challenge, we introduce FarsInstruct: a comprehensive instruction dataset designed to enhance the instruction-following ability of large language models specifically for the Persian language, a significant yet underrepresented language globally. FarsInstruct encompasses a wide range of task types and datasets, each containing a mix of straightforward to complex manual written instructions, as well as translations from Public Pool of Prompts, ensuring a rich linguistic and cultural representation. Furthermore, we introduce Co-CoLA, a framework designed to enhance the multi-task adaptability of LoRA-tuned models. Through extensive experimental analyses, our study showcases the effectiveness of FarsInstruct dataset coupled with training by Co-CoLA framework, in improving the performance of large language models within the Persian context. As of the current writing, FarsInstruct comprises more than 200 templates across 21 distinct datasets, and we intend to update it consistently, thus augmenting its applicability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> James Kirby, Morgan Sonderegger</p>
<p>Abstract: Phonetic production bias is the external force most commonly invoked in computational models of sound change, despite the fact that it is not responsible for all, or even most, sound changes. Furthermore, the existence of production bias alone cannot account for how changes do or do not propagate throughout a speech community. While many other factors have been invoked by (socio)phoneticians, including but not limited to contact (between subpopulations) and differences in social evaluation (of variants, groups, or individuals), these are not typically modeled in computational simulations of sound change. In this paper, we consider whether production biases have a unique dynamics in terms of how they impact the population-level spread of change in a setting where agents learn from multiple teachers. We show that, while the dynamics conditioned by production bias are not unique, it is not the case that all perturbing forces have the same dynamics: in particular, if social weight is a function of individual teachers and the correlation between a teacher's social weight and the extent to which they realize a production bias is weak, change is unlikely to propagate. Nevertheless, it remains the case that changes initiated from different sources may display a similar dynamics. A more nuanced understanding of how population structure interacts with individual biases can thus provide a (partial) solution to the `non-phonologization problem'.</p>

<p>Abstract: Automated Essay Scoring (AES) holds significant promise in the field of education, helping educators to mark larger volumes of essays and provide timely feedback. However, Arabic AES research has been limited by the lack of publicly available essay data. This study introduces AR-AES, an Arabic AES benchmark dataset comprising 2046 undergraduate essays, including gender information, scores, and transparent rubric-based evaluation guidelines, providing comprehensive insights into the scoring process. These essays come from four diverse courses, covering both traditional and online exams. Additionally, we pioneer the use of AraBERT for AES, exploring its performance on different question types. We find encouraging results, particularly for Environmental Chemistry and source-dependent essay questions. For the first time, we examine the scale of errors made by a BERT-based AES system, observing that 96.15 percent of the errors are within one point of the first human marker's prediction, on a scale of one to five, with 79.49 percent of predictions matching exactly. In contrast, additional human markers did not exceed 30 percent exact matches with the first marker, with 62.9 percent within one mark. These findings highlight the subjectivity inherent in essay grading, and underscore the potential for current AES technology to assist human markers to grade consistently across large classes.</p>

We investigate two key aspects: 1) the models' ability to handle varying levels of chart and question complexity, and 2) their robustness across different visual representations of the same underlying data. Our analysis reveals significant performance variations based on question and chart types, highlighting both strengths and weaknesses of current models. Additionally, we identify areas for improvement and propose future research directions to build more robust and reliable CQA systems.

<p>Abstract: Extracting the speech of participants in a conversation amidst interfering speakers and noise presents a challenging problem. In this paper, we introduce the novel task of target conversation extraction, where the goal is to extract the audio of a target conversation based on the speaker embedding of one of its participants. To accomplish this, we propose leveraging temporal patterns inherent in human conversations, particularly turn-taking dynamics, which uniquely characterize speakers engaged in conversation and distinguish them from interfering speakers and noise. Using neural networks, we show the feasibility of our approach on English and Mandarin conversation datasets. In the presence of interfering speakers, our results show an 8.19 dB improvement in signal-to-noise ratio for 2-speaker conversations and a 7.92 dB improvement for 2-4-speaker conversations.

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are employed across various high-stakes domains, where the reliability of their outputs is crucial. One commonly used method to assess the reliability of LLMs' responses is uncertainty estimation, which gauges the likelihood of their answers being correct. While many studies focus on improving the accuracy of uncertainty estimations for LLMs, our research investigates the fragility of uncertainty estimation and explores potential attacks. We demonstrate that an attacker can embed a backdoor in LLMs, which, when activated by a specific trigger in the input, manipulates the model's uncertainty without affecting the final output. Specifically, the proposed backdoor attack method can alter an LLM's output probability distribution, causing the probability distribution to converge towards an attacker-predefined distribution while ensuring that the top-1 prediction remains unchanged. Our experimental results demonstrate that this attack effectively undermines the model's self-evaluation reliability in multiple-choice questions. For instance, we achieved a 100 attack success rate (ASR) across three different triggering strategies in four models. Further, we investigate whether this manipulation generalizes across different prompts and domains. This work highlights a significant threat to the reliability of LLMs and underscores the need for future defenses against such attacks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matthew Perez, Aneesha Sampath, Minxue Niu, Emily Mower Provost</p>
<p>Abstract: Aphasia is a language disorder that can lead to speech errors known as paraphasias, which involve the misuse, substitution, or invention of words. Automatic paraphasia detection can help those with Aphasia by facilitating clinical assessment and treatment planning options. However, most automatic paraphasia detection works have focused solely on binary detection, which involves recognizing only the presence or absence of a paraphasia. Multiclass paraphasia detection represents an unexplored area of research that focuses on identifying multiple types of paraphasias and where they occur in a given speech segment. We present novel approaches that use a generative pretrained transformer (GPT) to identify paraphasias from transcripts as well as two end-to-end approaches that focus on modeling both automatic speech recognition (ASR) and paraphasia classification as multiple sequences vs. a single sequence. We demonstrate that a single sequence model outperforms GPT baselines for multiclass paraphasia detection.</p>

However, there is a notable dearth of research focusing on chance correction for assessing the reliability of sequence annotation tasks, despite their widespread prevalence in the field. To address this gap, this paper introduces a novel model for generating random annotations, which serves as the foundation for estimating chance agreement in sequence annotation tasks. Utilizing the proposed randomization model and a related comparison approach, we successfully derive the analytical form of the distribution, enabling the computation of the probable location of each annotated text segment and subsequent chance agreement estimation. Through a combination simulation and corpus-based evaluation, we successfully assess its applicability and validate its accuracy and efficacy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite their linguistic competence, Large Language models (LLMs) often exhibit limitations in their ability to reason reliably and flexibly. To address this, we propose a neurosymbolic approach that prompts LLMs to extract and encode all relevant information from a problem statement as logical code statements, and then use a logic programming language (Prolog) to conduct the iterative computations of explicit deductive reasoning. Our approach significantly enhances the performance of LLMs on the standard mathematical reasoning benchmark, GSM8k, and the Navigate dataset from the BIG-bench dataset. Additionally, we introduce a novel dataset, the Non-Linear Reasoning (NLR) dataset, consisting of 55 unique word problems that target the shortcomings of the next token prediction paradigm of LLMs and require complex non-linear reasoning but only basic arithmetic skills to solve. Our findings demonstrate that the integration of Prolog enables LLMs to achieve high performance on the NLR dataset, which even the most advanced language models (including GPT4) fail to solve using text only.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yinzhu Quan, Zefang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Supply chain management (SCM) involves coordinating the flow of goods, information, and finances across various entities to deliver products efficiently. Effective inventory management is crucial in today's volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous (VUCA) world. Previous research has demonstrated the superiority of heuristic methods and reinforcement learning applications in inventory management. However, the application of large language models (LLMs) as autonomous agents in multi-agent systems for inventory management remains underexplored. This study introduces a novel approach using LLMs to manage multi-agent inventory systems. Leveraging their zero-shot learning capabilities, our model, InvAgent, enhances resilience and improves efficiency across the supply chain network. Our contributions include utilizing LLMs for zero-shot learning to enable adaptive and informed decision-making without prior training, providing significant explainability and clarity through Chain-of-Thought (CoT), and demonstrating dynamic adaptability to varying demand scenarios while minimizing costs and avoiding stockouts. Extensive evaluations across different scenarios highlight the efficiency of our model in SCM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Deokyeong Kang, Ki Jung Seo, Taeuk Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Modular programming, which aims to construct the final program by integrating smaller, independent building blocks, has been regarded as a desirable practice in software development. However, with the rise of recent code generation agents built upon large language models (LLMs), a question emerges: is this traditional practice equally effective for these new tools? In this work, we assess the impact of modularity in code generation by introducing a novel metric for its quantitative measurement. Surprisingly, unlike conventional wisdom on the topic, we find that modularity is not a core factor for improving the performance of code generation models. We also explore potential explanations for why LLMs do not exhibit a preference for modular code compared to non-modular code.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weihong Qi, Hanjia Lyu, Jiebo Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: This study seeks to identify and quantify biases in simulating political samples with Large Language Models, specifically focusing on vote choice and public opinion. Using the GPT-3.5-Turbo model, we leverage data from the American National Election Studies, German Longitudinal Election Study, Zuobiao Dataset, and China Family Panel Studies to simulate voting behaviors and public opinions. This methodology enables us to examine three types of representation bias: disparities based on the the country's language, demographic groups, and political regime types. The findings reveal that simulation performance is generally better for vote choice than for public opinions, more accurate in English-speaking countries, more effective in bipartisan systems than in multi-partisan systems, and stronger in democratic settings than in authoritarian regimes. These results contribute to enhancing our understanding and developing strategies to mitigate biases in AI applications within the field of computational social science.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shicheng Liu, Sina J. Semnani, Harold Triedman, Jialiang Xu, Isaac Dan Zhao, Monica S. Lam</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent work integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to significant improvements in the Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) task. However, we posit that existing KBQA datasets that either have simple questions, use synthetically generated logical forms, or are based on small knowledge base (KB) schemas, do not capture the true complexity of KBQA tasks.
  To address this, we introduce the SPINACH dataset, an expert-annotated KBQA dataset collected from forum discussions on Wikidata's "Request a Query" forum with 320 decontextualized question-SPARQL pairs. Much more complex than existing datasets, SPINACH calls for strong KBQA systems that do not rely on training data to learn the KB schema, but can dynamically explore large and often incomplete schemas and reason about them.
  Along with the dataset, we introduce the SPINACH agent, a new KBQA approach that mimics how a human expert would write SPARQLs for such challenging questions. Experiments on existing datasets show SPINACH's capability in KBQA, achieving a new state of the art on the QALD-7, QALD-9 Plus and QALD-10 datasets by 30.1%, 27.0%, and 10.0% in F1, respectively, and coming within 1.6% of the fine-tuned LLaMA SOTA model on WikiWebQuestions. On our new SPINACH dataset, SPINACH agent outperforms all baselines, including the best GPT-4-based KBQA agent, by 38.1% in F1.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junhao Chen, Shengding Hu, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit various emergent abilities. Among these abilities, some might reveal the internal working mechanisms of models. In this paper, we uncover a novel emergent capability in models: the intrinsic ability to perform extended sequences of calculations without relying on chain-of-thought step-by-step solutions. Remarkably, the most advanced models can directly output the results of two-digit number additions with lengths extending up to 15 addends. We hypothesize that the model emerges Implicit Discrete State Representations (IDSRs) within its hidden states and performs symbolic calculations internally. To test this hypothesis, we design a sequence of experiments that look into the hidden states. Specifically, we first confirm that IDSRs exist. Then, we provide interesting observations about the formation of IDSRs from layer, digit, and sequence perspectives. Finally, we confirm that models indeed use IDSRs to produce the final answers. However, we also discover that these state representations are far from lossless in current open-sourced models, leading to inaccuracies in their final performance. Our work presents a novel exploration of LLMs' symbolic calculation abilities and the underlying mechanisms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Niloofar Mireshghallah, Maria Antoniak, Yash More, Yejin Choi, Golnoosh Farnadi</p>
<p>Abstract: Measuring personal disclosures made in human-chatbot interactions can provide a better understanding of users' AI literacy and facilitate privacy research for large language models (LLMs). We run an extensive, fine-grained analysis on the personal disclosures made by real users to commercial GPT models, investigating the leakage of personally identifiable and sensitive information. To understand the contexts in which users disclose to chatbots, we develop a taxonomy of tasks and sensitive topics, based on qualitative and quantitative analysis of naturally occurring conversations. We discuss these potential privacy harms and observe that: (1) personally identifiable information (PII) appears in unexpected contexts such as in translation or code editing (48% and 16% of the time, respectively) and (2) PII detection alone is insufficient to capture the sensitive topics that are common in human-chatbot interactions, such as detailed sexual preferences or specific drug use habits. We believe that these high disclosure rates are of significant importance for researchers and data curators, and we call for the design of appropriate nudging mechanisms to help users moderate their interactions.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the VerifAI project, a pioneering open-source scientific question-answering system, designed to provide answers that are not only referenced but also automatically vetted and verifiable. The components of the system are (1) an Information Retrieval system combining semantic and lexical search techniques over scientific papers (PubMed), (2) a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module using fine-tuned generative model (Mistral 7B) and retrieved articles to generate claims with references to the articles from which it was derived, and (3) a Verification engine, based on a fine-tuned DeBERTa and XLM-RoBERTa models on Natural Language Inference task using SciFACT dataset. The verification engine cross-checks the generated claim and the article from which the claim was derived, verifying whether there may have been any hallucinations in generating the claim. By leveraging the Information Retrieval and RAG modules, Verif.ai excels in generating factual information from a vast array of scientific sources. At the same time, the Verification engine rigorously double-checks this output, ensuring its accuracy and reliability. This dual-stage process plays a crucial role in acquiring and confirming factual information, significantly enhancing the information landscape. Our methodology could significantly enhance scientists' productivity, concurrently fostering trust in applying generative language models within scientific domains, where hallucinations and misinformation are unacceptable.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qimin Yang, Rongsheng Wang, Jiexin Chen, Runqi Su, Tao Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely applied in various professional fields. By fine-tuning the models using domain specific question and answer datasets, the professional domain knowledge and Q\&A abilities of these models have significantly improved, for example, medical professional LLMs that use fine-tuning of doctor-patient Q\&A data exhibit extraordinary disease diagnostic abilities. However, we observed that despite improvements in specific domain knowledge, the performance of medical LLM in long-context understanding has significantly declined, especially compared to general language models with similar parameters. The purpose of this study is to investigate the phenomenon of reduced performance in understanding long-context in medical LLM. We designed a series of experiments to conduct open-book professional knowledge exams on all models to evaluate their ability to read long-context. By adjusting the proportion and quantity of general data and medical data in the process of fine-tuning, we can determine the best data composition to optimize the professional model and achieve a balance between long-context performance and specific domain knowledge.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yin Jou Huang, Rafik Hadfi</p>
<p>Abstract: Psychological evidence reveals the influence of personality traits on decision-making. For instance, agreeableness is generally associated with positive outcomes in negotiations, whereas neuroticism is often linked to less favorable outcomes. This paper introduces a simulation framework centered on Large Language Model (LLM) agents endowed with synthesized personality traits. The agents negotiate within bargaining domains and possess customizable personalities and objectives. The experimental results show that the behavioral tendencies of LLM-based simulations could reproduce behavioral patterns observed in human negotiations. The contribution is twofold. First, we propose a simulation methodology that investigates the alignment between the linguistic and economic capabilities of LLM agents. Secondly, we offer empirical insights into the strategic impact of Big-Five personality traits on the outcomes of bilateral negotiations. We also provide a case study based on synthesized bargaining dialogues to reveal intriguing behaviors, including deceitful and compromising behaviors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuan Feng, Junlin Lv, Yukun Cao, Xike Xie, S. Kevin Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models have excelled in various fields but encounter efficiency limitations due to the extensive KV cache required for long sequences inference. Many efforts try to evict non-critical cache elements during runtime, thereby reducing cache size within a given memory budget while preserving generation quality. Our reexamination of their underlying principles discerns that prevailing strategies essentially aim to minimize an upper bound of eviction loss within a specific budget allocation. However, we observe that the current practice of uniformly allocating budgets across different attention heads during the eviction procedure tends to degrade the quality of generation posten-eviction. In light of these findings, we propose a simple yet effective adaptive allocation algorithm that not only theoretically ensures its loss upper bound does not exceed that of previous uniform allocation methods, but also effectively aligns with the characteristics of the self-attention mechanism, thus practically reducing the upper bound. Further, integrating this algorithm with two of the most advanced methods yields Ada-SnapKV and Ada-Pyramid. Extensive experimental validation across 16 datasets and the Needle-in-a-Haystack test confirm that Ada-SnapKV and Ada-Pyramid achieve further enhancements, establishing new benchmarks in state-of-the-art performance.</p>

We evaluate the domain adaptation abilities of a wide range of LLMs on the summarization task across various domains in both fine-tuning and in-context learning settings. We also present AdaptEval, the first domain adaptation evaluation suite. AdaptEval includes a domain benchmark and a set of metrics to facilitate the analysis of domain adaptation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juan Luis Gastaldi, John Terilla, Luca Malagutti, Brian DuSell, Tim Vieira, Ryan Cotterell</p>
<p>Abstract: Tokenization - the practice of converting strings of characters over an alphabet into sequences of tokens over a vocabulary - is a critical yet under-theorized step in the NLP pipeline. Notably, it remains the only major step not fully integrated into widely used end-to-end neural models. This paper aims to address this theoretical gap by laying the foundations of tokenization from a formal perspective. By articulating and extending basic properties about the category of stochastic maps, we propose a unified framework for representing and analyzing tokenizer models. This framework allows us to establish general conditions for the use of tokenizers. In particular, we formally establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for a tokenizer model to preserve the consistency of statistical estimators. Additionally, we discuss statistical and computational concerns crucial for the design and implementation of tokenizer models. The framework and results advanced in this paper represent a step toward a robust theoretical foundation for neural language modeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> He Chang, Chenchen Ye, Zhulin Tao, Jie Wu, Zhengmao Yang, Yunshan Ma, Xianglin Huang, Tat-Seng Chua</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential in various data mining tasks, such as knowledge question answering, mathematical reasoning, and commonsense reasoning. However, the reasoning capability of LLMs on temporal event forecasting has been under-explored. To systematically investigate their abilities in temporal event forecasting, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of LLM-based methods for temporal event forecasting. Due to the lack of a high-quality dataset that involves both graph and textual data, we first construct a benchmark dataset, named MidEast-TE-mini. Based on this dataset, we design a series of baseline methods, characterized by various input formats and retrieval augmented generation(RAG) modules. From extensive experiments, we find that directly integrating raw texts into the input of LLMs does not enhance zero-shot extrapolation performance. In contrast, incorporating raw texts in specific complex events and fine-tuning LLMs significantly improves performance. Moreover, enhanced with retrieval modules, LLM can effectively capture temporal relational patterns hidden in historical events. Meanwhile, issues such as popularity bias and the long-tail problem still persist in LLMs, particularly in the RAG-based method. These findings not only deepen our understanding of LLM-based event forecasting methods but also highlight several promising research directions.We consider that this comprehensive evaluation, along with the identified research opportunities, will significantly contribute to future research on temporal event forecasting through LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite being heralded as the new standard for dialogue evaluation, the closed-source nature of GPT-4 poses challenges for the community. Motivated by the need for lightweight, open source, and multilingual dialogue evaluators, this paper introduces GenResCoh (Generated Responses targeting Coherence). GenResCoh is a novel LLM generated dataset comprising over 130k negative and positive responses and accompanying explanations seeded from XDailyDialog and XPersona covering English, French, German, Italian, and Chinese. Leveraging GenResCoh, we propose ECoh (Evaluation of Coherence), a family of evaluators trained to assess response coherence across multiple languages. Experimental results demonstrate that ECoh achieves multilingual detection capabilities superior to the teacher model (GPT-3.5-Turbo) on GenResCoh, despite being based on a much smaller architecture. Furthermore, the explanations provided by ECoh closely align in terms of quality with those generated by the teacher model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongrong Cheng, Miao Zhang, Javen Qinfeng Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) grow dramatically in size, there is an increasing trend in compressing and speeding up these models. Previous studies have highlighted the usefulness of gradients for importance scoring in neural network compressing, especially in pruning medium-size networks. However, the substantial memory requirements involved in calculating gradients with backpropagation impede the utilization of gradients in guiding LLM pruning. As a result, most pruning strategies for LLMs rely on gradient-free criteria, such as weight magnitudes or a mix of magnitudes and activations. In this paper, we devise a hybrid pruning criterion, which appropriately integrates magnitude, activation, and gradient to capitalize on feature map sensitivity for pruning LLMs. To overcome memory requirement barriers, we estimate gradients using only forward passes. Based on this, we propose a Memory-effIcieNt structured prunIng procedure for LLMs (MINI-LLM) to remove no-critical channels and multi-attention heads. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of MINI-LLM over existing gradient-free methods on three LLMs: LLaMA, BLOOM, and OPT across various downstream tasks (classification, multiple-choice, and generation), while MINI-LLM maintains a GPU memory footprint akin to gradient-free methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the domain of Large Language Model (LLM), LLMs demonstrate significant capabilities in natural language understanding and generation. With the growing needs of applying LLMs on various domains, it is a research question that how to efficiently train and build a model that has expertise in different domains but with a low training cost. We propose CCoE architecture, a framework of easily coupling multiple strong domain experts together to fuse into a big LLM, provides a collective way of utilizing the different domain expert LLMs. Besides, training a large collaborative of multiple expert LLMs requires a high requirements on training sources. CCoE bypasses this problem through isolating other experts and train each expert separately. The design of CCoE assembles multiple expert LLMs through the CoE (Collaboration of Experts) layer. Each CoE layer could have one or more expert LLMs. Expert LLMs have different number of layers and have been well-trained for different domain tasks. Each expert is fine-tuned to be able to achieve the comparable results with SOTA domain LLMs. We start from 5 experts in the domain of Code, Math, Law, text-to-SQL and Medical. The results indicate that our CCoE framework can easily and efficiently boost nearly 10%-20% performance on original base model in different domains but using less resources on training, as well as inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alina Leidinger, Richard Rogers</p>
<p>Abstract: With the widespread availability of LLMs since the release of ChatGPT and increased public scrutiny, commercial model development appears to have focused their efforts on 'safety' training concerning legal liabilities at the expense of social impact evaluation. This mimics a similar trend which we could observe for search engine autocompletion some years prior. We draw on scholarship from NLP and search engine auditing and present a novel evaluation task in the style of autocompletion prompts to assess stereotyping in LLMs. We assess LLMs by using four metrics, namely refusal rates, toxicity, sentiment and regard, with and without safety system prompts. Our findings indicate an improvement to stereotyping outputs with the system prompt, but overall a lack of attention by LLMs under study to certain harms classified as toxic, particularly for prompts about peoples/ethnicities and sexual orientation. Mentions of intersectional identities trigger a disproportionate amount of stereotyping. Finally, we discuss the implications of these findings about stereotyping harms in light of the coming intermingling of LLMs and search and the choice of stereotyping mitigation policy to adopt. We address model builders, academics, NLP practitioners and policy makers, calling for accountability and awareness concerning stereotyping harms, be it for training data curation, leader board design and usage, or social impact measurement.</p>

Philosophers and psychologists have also been researching the structure of language for decades, but they are having a hard time finding a theory that directly benefits from the breakthroughs of LLMs. In this article, we propose a novel structure of language that reflects well on the mechanisms behind language models and go on to show that this structure is also better at capturing the diverse nature of language compared to previous methods. An analogy of linear algebra is adapted to strengthen the basis of this perspective. We further argue about the difference between this perspective and the design philosophy for current language models. Lastly, we discuss how this perspective can lead us to research directions that may accelerate the improvements of science fastest.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyu Yang, Xiaodan Zhu, Iryna Gurevych</p>
<p>Abstract: Text anonymization is crucial for sharing sensitive data while maintaining privacy. Existing techniques face the emerging challenges of re-identification attack ability of Large Language Models (LLMs), which have shown advanced capability in memorizing detailed information and patterns as well as connecting disparate pieces of information. In defending against LLM-based re-identification attacks, anonymization could jeopardize the utility of the resulting anonymized data in downstream tasks -- the trade-off between privacy and data utility requires deeper understanding within the context of LLMs. This paper proposes a framework composed of three LLM-based components -- a privacy evaluator, a utility evaluator, and an optimization component, which work collaboratively to perform anonymization. To provide a practical model for large-scale and real-time environments, we distill the anonymization capabilities into a lightweight model using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed models outperform baseline models, showing robustness in reducing the risk of re-identification while preserving greater data utility in downstream tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chee Ng, Yuen Fung</p>
<p>Abstract: Educational Personalized Learning Path Planning (PLPP) aims to tailor learning experiences to individual learners' needs, enhancing learning efficiency and engagement. Despite its potential, traditional PLPP systems often lack adaptability, interactivity, and transparency. This paper proposes a novel approach integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with prompt engineering to address these challenges. By designing prompts that incorporate learner-specific information, our method guides LLMs like LLama-2-70B and GPT-4 to generate personalized, coherent, and pedagogically sound learning paths. We conducted experiments comparing our method with a baseline approach across various metrics, including accuracy, user satisfaction, and the quality of learning paths. The results show significant improvements in all areas, particularly with GPT-4, demonstrating the effectiveness of prompt engineering in enhancing PLPP. Additional long-term impact analysis further validates our method's potential to improve learner performance and retention. This research highlights the promise of LLMs and prompt engineering in advancing personalized education.</p>

<p>Abstract: Detecting Machine-Generated Text (MGT) has emerged as a significant area of study within Natural Language Processing. While language models generate text, they often leave discernible traces, which can be scrutinized using either traditional feature-based methods or more advanced neural language models. In this research, we explore the effectiveness of fine-tuning a RoBERTa-base transformer, a powerful neural architecture, to address MGT detection as a binary classification task. Focusing specifically on Subtask A (Monolingual-English) within the SemEval-2024 competition framework, our proposed system achieves an accuracy of 78.9% on the test dataset, positioning us at 57th among participants. Our study addresses this challenge while considering the limited hardware resources, resulting in a system that excels at identifying human-written texts but encounters challenges in accurately discerning MGTs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinbo Wu, Max Hartman, Vidhata Arjun Jayaraman, Lav R. Varshney</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities in various domains, particularly in general language understanding. However these models, trained on massive text data, may not be finely optimized for specific tasks triggered by instructions. Continual instruction tuning is crucial to adapt LLMs to evolving tasks and domains, ensuring their effectiveness and relevance across a wide range of applications. In the context of continual instruction tuning, where models are sequentially trained on different tasks, catastrophic forgetting can occur, leading to performance degradation on previously learned tasks. This work addresses the catastrophic forgetting in continual instruction learning for LLMs through a switching mechanism for routing computations to parameter-efficient tuned models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through experiments on continual instruction tuning of different natural language generation tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Betty Li Hou, Kejian Shi, Jason Phang, James Aung, Steven Adler, Rosie Campbell</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are able to provide assistance on a wide range of information-seeking tasks. However, model outputs may be misleading, whether unintentionally or in cases of intentional deception. We investigate the ability of LLMs to be deceptive in the context of providing assistance on a reading comprehension task, using LLMs as proxies for human users. We compare outcomes of (1) when the model is prompted to provide truthful assistance, (2) when it is prompted to be subtly misleading, and (3) when it is prompted to argue for an incorrect answer. Our experiments show that GPT-4 can effectively mislead both GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4, with deceptive assistants resulting in up to a 23% drop in accuracy on the task compared to when a truthful assistant is used. We also find that providing the user model with additional context from the passage partially mitigates the influence of the deceptive model. This work highlights the ability of LLMs to produce misleading information and the effects this may have in real-world situations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Branden Butler, Sixing Yu, Arya Mazaheri, Ali Jannesari</p>
<p>Abstract: Inference of Large Language Models (LLMs) across computer clusters has become a focal point of research in recent times, with many acceleration techniques taking inspiration from CPU speculative execution. These techniques reduce bottlenecks associated with memory bandwidth, but also increase end-to-end latency per inference run, requiring high speculation acceptance rates to improve performance. Combined with a variable rate of acceptance across tasks, speculative inference techniques can result in reduced performance. Additionally, pipeline-parallel designs require many user requests to maintain maximum utilization. As a remedy, we propose PipeInfer, a pipelined speculative acceleration technique to reduce inter-token latency and improve system utilization for single-request scenarios while also improving tolerance to low speculation acceptance rates and low-bandwidth interconnects. PipeInfer exhibits up to a 2.15$\times$ improvement in generation speed over standard speculative inference. PipeInfer achieves its improvement through Continuous Asynchronous Speculation and Early Inference Cancellation, the former improving latency and generation speed by running single-token inference simultaneously with several speculative runs, while the latter improves speed and latency by skipping the computation of invalidated runs, even in the middle of inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kyle Hamilton, Luca Longo, Bojan Bozic</p>
<p>Abstract: While the use of machine learning for the detection of propaganda techniques in text has garnered considerable attention, most approaches focus on "black-box" solutions with opaque inner workings. Interpretable approaches provide a solution, however, they depend on careful feature engineering and costly expert annotated data. Additionally, language features specific to propagandistic text are generally the focus of rhetoricians or linguists, and there is no data set labeled with such features suitable for machine learning. This study codifies 22 rhetorical and linguistic features identified in literature related to the language of persuasion for the purpose of annotating an existing data set labeled with propaganda techniques. To help human experts annotate natural language sentences with these features, RhetAnn, a web application, was specifically designed to minimize an otherwise considerable mental effort. Finally, a small set of annotated data was used to fine-tune GPT-3.5, a generative large language model (LLM), to annotate the remaining data while optimizing for financial cost and classification accuracy. This study demonstrates how combining a small number of human annotated examples with GPT can be an effective strategy for scaling the annotation process at a fraction of the cost of traditional annotation relying solely on human experts. The results are on par with the best performing model at the time of writing, namely GPT-4, at 10x less the cost. Our contribution is a set of features, their properties, definitions, and examples in a machine-readable format, along with the code for RhetAnn and the GPT prompts and fine-tuning procedures for advancing state-of-the-art interpretable propaganda technique detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sona Elza Simon (Indian Institute of Technology Bombay), Soumen Kumar Mondal (Indian Institute of Technology Bombay), Abhishek Singhania (Amazon Alexa), Sayambhu Sen (Amazon Alexa), Preethi Jyothi (Indian Institute of Technology Bombay)</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) encode vast amounts of world knowledge acquired via training on large web-scale datasets crawled from the internet. However, these datasets typically exhibit a geographical bias towards English-speaking Western countries. This results in LLMs producing biased or hallucinated responses to queries that require answers localized to other geographical regions. In this work, we introduce a new benchmark named LoFTI (Localization and Factuality Transfer to Indian Locales) that can be used to evaluate an LLM's localization and factual text transfer capabilities. LoFTI consists of factual statements about entities in source and target locations; the source locations are spread across the globe and the target locations are all within India with varying degrees of hyperlocality (country, states, cities). The entities span a wide variety of categories. We use LoFTI to evaluate Mixtral, GPT-4 and two other Mixtral-based approaches well-suited to the task of localized factual transfer. We demonstrate that LoFTI is a high-quality evaluation benchmark and all the models, including GPT-4, produce skewed results across varying levels of hyperlocality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haishuo Fang, Xiaodan Zhu, Iryna Gurevych</p>
<p>Abstract: A crucial requirement for deploying LLM-based agents in real-life applications is robustness against risky or irreversible mistakes. However, existing research lacks a focus on the preemptive evaluation of reasoning trajectories performed by LLM agents, leading to a gap in ensuring safe and reliable operations. To explore better solutions, this paper introduces InferAct, a novel approach that leverages the Theory-of-Mind capability of LLMs to proactively detect potential errors before critical actions are executed (e.g., "buy-now" in automatic online trading or web shopping). InferAct is also capable of integrating human feedback to prevent irreversible risks and enhance the actor agent's decision-making process. Experiments on three widely used tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of InferAct. The proposed solution presents a novel approach and concrete contributions toward developing LLM agents that can be safely deployed in different environments involving critical decision-making.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gaetan Lopez Latouche, Marc-Andr\'e Carbonneau, Ben Swanson</p>
<p>Abstract: Grammatical Error Detection (GED) methods rely heavily on human annotated error corpora. However, these annotations are unavailable in many low-resource languages. In this paper, we investigate GED in this context. Leveraging the zero-shot cross-lingual transfer capabilities of multilingual pre-trained language models, we train a model using data from a diverse set of languages to generate synthetic errors in other languages. These synthetic error corpora are then used to train a GED model. Specifically we propose a two-stage fine-tuning pipeline where the GED model is first fine-tuned on multilingual synthetic data from target languages followed by fine-tuning on human-annotated GED corpora from source languages. This approach outperforms current state-of-the-art annotation-free GED methods. We also analyse the errors produced by our method and other strong baselines, finding that our approach produces errors that are more diverse and more similar to human errors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Biao Zhang, Garrett Tanzer, Orhan Firat</p>
<p>Abstract: Sign language translation (SLT) addresses the problem of translating information from a sign language in video to a spoken language in text. Existing studies, while showing progress, are often limited to narrow domains and/or few sign languages and struggle with open-domain tasks. In this paper, we push forward the frontier of SLT by scaling pretraining data, model size, and number of translation directions. We perform large-scale SLT pretraining on different data including 1) noisy multilingual YouTube SLT data, 2) parallel text corpora, and 3) SLT data augmented by translating video captions to other languages with off-the-shelf machine translation models. We unify different pretraining tasks with task-specific prompts under the encoder-decoder architecture, and initialize the SLT model with pretrained (m/By)T5 models across model sizes. SLT pretraining results on How2Sign and FLEURS-ASL#0 (ASL to 42 spoken languages) demonstrate the significance of data/model scaling and cross-lingual cross-modal transfer, as well as the feasibility of zero-shot SLT. We finetune the pretrained SLT models on 5 downstream open-domain SLT benchmarks covering 5 sign languages. Experiments show substantial quality improvements over the vanilla baselines, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) by wide margins.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tiziano Labruna, Bernardo Magnini</p>
<p>Abstract: Task-oriented dialogues must maintain consistency both within the dialogue itself, ensuring logical coherence across turns, and with the conversational domain, accurately reflecting external knowledge. We propose to conceptualize dialogue consistency as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP), wherein variables represent segments of the dialogue referencing the conversational domain, and constraints among variables reflect dialogue properties, including linguistic, conversational, and domain-based aspects. To demonstrate the feasibility of the approach, we utilize a CSP solver to detect inconsistencies in dialogues re-lexicalized by an LLM. Our findings indicate that: (i) CSP is effective to detect dialogue inconsistencies; and (ii) consistent dialogue re-lexicalization is challenging for state-of-the-art LLMs, achieving only a 0.15 accuracy rate when compared to a CSP solver. Furthermore, through an ablation study, we reveal that constraints derived from domain knowledge pose the greatest difficulty in being respected. We argue that CSP captures core properties of dialogue consistency that have been poorly considered by approaches based on component pipelines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Oscar Araque, Lorenzo Gatti, Sergio Consoli, Kyriaki Kalimeri</p>
<p>Abstract: The moral value of liberty is a central concept in our inference system when it comes to taking a stance towards controversial social issues such as vaccine hesitancy, climate change, or the right to abortion. Here, we propose a novel Liberty lexicon evaluated on more than 3,000 manually annotated data both in in- and out-of-domain scenarios. As a result of this evaluation, we produce a combined lexicon that constitutes the main outcome of this work. This final lexicon incorporates information from an ensemble of lexicons that have been generated using word embedding similarity (WE) and compositional semantics (CS). Our key contributions include enriching the liberty annotations, developing a robust liberty lexicon for broader application, and revealing the complexity of expressions related to liberty across different platforms. Through the evaluation, we show that the difficulty of the task calls for designing approaches that combine knowledge, in an effort of improving the representations of learning systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Frederic Kirstein, Terry Ruas, Bela Gipp</p>
<p>Abstract: Meeting summarization has become a critical task since digital encounters have become a common practice. Large language models (LLMs) show great potential in summarization, offering enhanced coherence and context understanding compared to traditional methods. However, they still struggle to maintain relevance and avoid hallucination. We introduce a multi-LLM correction approach for meeting summarization using a two-phase process that mimics the human review process: mistake identification and summary refinement. We release QMSum Mistake, a dataset of 200 automatically generated meeting summaries annotated by humans on nine error types, including structural, omission, and irrelevance errors. Our experiments show that these errors can be identified with high accuracy by an LLM. We transform identified mistakes into actionable feedback to improve the quality of a given summary measured by relevance, informativeness, conciseness, and coherence. This post-hoc refinement effectively improves summary quality by leveraging multiple LLMs to validate output quality. Our multi-LLM approach for meeting summarization shows potential for similar complex text generation tasks requiring robustness, action planning, and discussion towards a goal.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rachneet Sachdeva, Yixiao Song, Mohit Iyyer, Iryna Gurevych</p>
<p>Abstract: Long-form question answering (LFQA) aims to provide thorough and in-depth answers to complex questions, enhancing comprehension. However, such detailed responses are prone to hallucinations and factual inconsistencies, challenging their faithful evaluation. This work introduces HaluQuestQA, the first hallucination dataset with localized error annotations for human-written and model-generated LFQA answers. HaluQuestQA comprises 698 QA pairs with 4.7k span-level error annotations for five different error types by expert annotators, along with preference judgments. Using our collected data, we thoroughly analyze the shortcomings of long-form answers and find that they lack comprehensiveness and provide unhelpful references. We train an automatic feedback model on this dataset that predicts error spans with incomplete information and provides associated explanations. Finally, we propose a prompt-based approach, Error-informed refinement, that uses signals from the learned feedback model to refine generated answers, which we show reduces hallucination and improves answer quality. Furthermore, humans find answers generated by our approach comprehensive and highly prefer them (84%) over the baseline answers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Congbo Ma, Wei Emma Zhang, Dileepa Pitawela, Haojie Zhuang, Yanfeng Shu</p>
<p>Abstract: The utilization of Transformer-based models prospers the growth of multi-document summarization (MDS). Given the huge impact and widespread adoption of Transformer-based models in various natural language processing tasks, investigating their performance and behaviors in the context of MDS becomes crucial for advancing the field and enhancing the quality of summary. To thoroughly examine the behaviours of Transformer-based MDS models, this paper presents five empirical studies on (1) measuring the impact of document boundary separators quantitatively; (2) exploring the effectiveness of different mainstream Transformer structures; (3) examining the sensitivity of the encoder and decoder; (4) discussing different training strategies; and (5) discovering the repetition in a summary generation. The experimental results on prevalent MDS datasets and eleven evaluation metrics show the influence of document boundary separators, the granularity of different level features and different model training strategies. The results also reveal that the decoder exhibits greater sensitivity to noises compared to the encoder. This underscores the important role played by the decoder, suggesting a potential direction for future research in MDS. Furthermore, the experimental results indicate that the repetition problem in the generated summaries has correlations with the high uncertainty scores.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mo Li, Songyang Zhang, Yunxin Liu, Kai Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: In evaluating the long-context capabilities of large language models (LLMs), identifying content relevant to a user's query from original long documents is a crucial prerequisite for any LLM to answer questions based on long text. We present NeedleBench, a framework consisting of a series of progressively more challenging tasks for assessing bilingual long-context capabilities, spanning multiple length intervals (4k, 8k, 32k, 128k, 200k, 1000k, and beyond) and different depth ranges, allowing the strategic insertion of critical data points in different text depth zones to rigorously test the retrieval and reasoning capabilities of models in diverse contexts. We use the NeedleBench framework to assess how well the leading open-source models can identify key information relevant to the question and apply that information to reasoning in bilingual long texts. Furthermore, we propose the Ancestral Trace Challenge (ATC) to mimic the complexity of logical reasoning challenges that are likely to be present in real-world long-context tasks, providing a simple method for evaluating LLMs in dealing with complex long-context situations. Our results suggest that current LLMs have significant room for improvement in practical long-context applications, as they struggle with the complexity of logical reasoning challenges that are likely to be present in real-world long-context tasks.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11969">Does Refusal Training in LLMs Generalize to the Past Tense?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Maksym Andriushchenko, Nicolas Flammarion</p>
<p>Abstract: Refusal training is widely used to prevent LLMs from generating harmful, undesirable, or illegal outputs. We reveal a curious generalization gap in the current refusal training approaches: simply reformulating a harmful request in the past tense (e.g., "How to make a Molotov cocktail?" to "How did people make a Molotov cocktail?") is often sufficient to jailbreak many state-of-the-art LLMs. We systematically evaluate this method on Llama-3 8B, GPT-3.5 Turbo, Gemma-2 9B, Phi-3-Mini, GPT-4o, and R2D2 models using GPT-3.5 Turbo as a reformulation model. For example, the success rate of this simple attack on GPT-4o increases from 1% using direct requests to 88% using 20 past tense reformulation attempts on harmful requests from JailbreakBench with GPT-4 as a jailbreak judge. Interestingly, we also find that reformulations in the future tense are less effective, suggesting that refusal guardrails tend to consider past historical questions more benign than hypothetical future questions. Moreover, our experiments on fine-tuning GPT-3.5 Turbo show that defending against past reformulations is feasible when past tense examples are explicitly included in the fine-tuning data. Overall, our findings highlight that the widely used alignment techniques -- such as SFT, RLHF, and adversarial training -- employed to align the studied models can be brittle and do not always generalize as intended.

<p>Abstract: In this paper, a novel approach to sign language recognition based on state tying in each of data streams is presented. In this framework, it is assumed that hand gesture signal is represented in terms of six synchronous data streams, i.e., the left/right hand position, left/right hand orientation and left/right handshape. This approach offers a very accurate representation of the sign space and keeps the number of parameters reasonably small in favor of a fast decoding. Experiments were carried out for 5177 Chinese signs. The real time isolated recognition rate is 94.8%. For continuous sign recognition, the word correct rate is 91.4%.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhen Tan, Daize Dong, Xinyu Zhao, Jie Peng, Yu Cheng, Tianlong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Dynamic Layer Operations (DLO), a novel approach for vertically scaling transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) by dynamically expanding, activating, or skipping layers using a sophisticated routing policy based on layerwise feature similarity. Unlike traditional Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) methods that focus on extending the model width, our approach targets model depth, addressing the redundancy observed across layer representations for various input samples. Our framework is integrated with the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) stage, eliminating the need for resource-intensive Continual Pre-Training (CPT). Experimental results demonstrate that DLO not only outperforms the original unscaled models but also achieves comparable results to densely expanded models with significantly improved efficiency. Our work offers a promising direction for building efficient yet powerful LLMs. We will release our implementation and model weights upon acceptance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent years, Pre-trained Language models (PLMs) have swept into various fields of artificial intelligence and achieved great success. However, most PLMs, such as T5 and GPT3, have a huge amount of parameters, fine-tuning them is often expensive and time consuming, and storing them takes up a lot of space. Therefore, it is necessary to adopt a parameter-efficient approach to reduce parameters of PLMs in fine-tuning without compromising their performance in downstream tasks. In this paper, we design a novel adapter which only acts on self-attention outputs in PLMs. This adapter adopts element-wise linear transformation using Hadamard product, hence named as Hadamard adapter, requires the fewest parameters compared to previous parameter-efficient adapters. In addition, we also summarize some tuning patterns for Hadamard adapter shared by various downstream tasks, expecting to provide some guidance for further parameter reduction with shared adapters in future studies. The experiments conducted on the widely-used GLUE benchmark with several SOTA PLMs prove that the Hadamard adapter achieves competitive performance with only 0.033\% parameters compared with full fine-tuning, and it has the fewest parameters compared with other adapters. Moreover, we further find that there is also some redundant layers in the Hadamard adapter which can be removed to achieve more parameter efficiency with only 0.022\% parameters.</p>

To get a good return on investment, the developers spend considerable effort ensuring that the model never produces harmful and offensive outputs. However, bad-faith actors may still try to slander the reputation of an LLM by publicly reporting a forged output. In this paper, we show that defending against such slander attacks requires reconstructing the input of the forged output or proving that it does not exist. To do so, we propose and evaluate a search based approach for targeted adversarial attacks for LLMs. Our experiments show that we are rarely able to reconstruct the exact input of an arbitrary output, thus demonstrating that LLMs are still vulnerable to slander attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengzhao Chen, Wenqi Shao, Peng Xu, Jiahao Wang, Peng Gao, Kaipeng Zhang, Yu Qiao, Ping Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are integral to modern natural language processing and artificial intelligence. However, they face challenges in managing their significant memory requirements. Although quantization-aware training (QAT) offers a solution by reducing memory consumption through low-bit representations with minimal accuracy loss, it demands substantial training resources to optimize model weights and quantization parameters. To address this, we propose Efficient Quantization-Aware Training (EfficientQAT), a novel quantization technique for compressing LLMs. EfficientQAT involves two consecutive phases: Block-wise training of all parameters (Block-AP) and end-to-end training of quantization parameters (E2E-QP). Block-AP sequentially conducts quantization-aware training for all parameters in each transformer block with block-wise reconstruction, maintaining efficiency by avoiding training the entire LLM. Initialized with quantized model, E2E-QP then trains only quantization parameters (step sizes) end-to-end, enhancing efficiency with a fixed quantized backbone and reduced trainable parameter count. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EfficientQAT outperforms previous quantization methods across a range of models, including base LLMs, instruction-tuned LLMs, and multimodal LLMs, with scales from 7B to 70B parameters at various quantization bits. For instance, EfficientQAT obtains a 2-bit Llama-2-70B model on a single A100-80GB GPU in 41 hours, with less than 3\% accuracy degradation compared to the full precision (69.48 vs. 72.41). Notably, this INT2 quantized 70B model obtains a 1.67 accuracy gain over the Llama-2-13B model (69.48 vs. 67.81) while requiring less memory (19.2GB vs. 24.2GB).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gon\c{c}alo Hora de Carvalho, Robert Pollice, Oscar Knap</p>
<p>Abstract: We explore the hypothesis that LLMs, such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, possess broader cognitive functions, particularly in non-linguistic domains. Our approach extends beyond standard linguistic benchmarks by incorporating games like Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect Four, and Battleship, encoded via ASCII, to assess strategic thinking and decision-making. To evaluate the models' ability to generalize beyond their training data, we introduce two additional games. The first game, LEGO Connect Language (LCL), tests the models' capacity to understand spatial logic and follow assembly instructions. The second game, the game of shapes, challenges the models to identify shapes represented by 1s within a matrix of zeros, further testing their spatial reasoning skills. This "show, don't tell" strategy uses games instead of simply querying the models. Our results show that despite their proficiency on standard benchmarks, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4's abilities to play and reason about fully observable games without pre-training is mediocre. Both models fail to anticipate losing moves in Tic-Tac-Toe and Connect Four, and they are unable to play Battleship correctly. While GPT-4 shows some success in the game of shapes, both models fail at the assembly tasks presented in the LCL game. These results suggest that while GPT models can emulate conversational proficiency and basic rule comprehension, their performance in strategic gameplay and spatial reasoning tasks is very limited. Importantly, this reveals a blind spot in current LLM benchmarks that we highlight with our gameplay benchmark suite ChildPlay (https://github.com/child-play-neurips/child-play). Our findings provide a cautionary tale about claims of emergent intelligence and reasoning capabilities of LLMs that are roughly the size of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuhong Wang, Haoyu Jiang, Yi Yu, Jingru Yu, Yilun Lin, Ping Yi, Yingchun Wang, Qiao Yu, Li Li, Fei-Yue Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into diverse industries, posing substantial security risks due to unauthorized replication and misuse. To mitigate these concerns, robust identification mechanisms are widely acknowledged as an effective strategy. Identification systems for LLMs now rely heavily on watermarking technology to manage and protect intellectual property and ensure data security. However, previous studies have primarily concentrated on the basic principles of algorithms and lacked a comprehensive analysis of watermarking theory and practice from the perspective of intelligent identification. To bridge this gap, firstly, we explore how a robust identity recognition system can be effectively implemented and managed within LLMs by various participants using watermarking technology. Secondly, we propose a mathematical framework based on mutual information theory, which systematizes the identification process to achieve more precise and customized watermarking. Additionally, we present a comprehensive evaluation of performance metrics for LLM watermarking, reflecting participant preferences and advancing discussions on its identification applications. Lastly, we outline the existing challenges in current watermarking technologies and theoretical frameworks, and provide directional guidance to address these challenges. Our systematic classification and detailed exposition aim to enhance the comparison and evaluation of various methods, fostering further research and development toward a transparent, secure, and equitable LLM ecosystem.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Austin C. Kozlowski, Hyunku Kwon, James A. Evans</p>
<p>Abstract: By training deep neural networks on massive archives of digitized text, large language models (LLMs) learn the complex linguistic patterns that constitute historic and contemporary discourses. We argue that LLMs can serve as a valuable tool for sociological inquiry by enabling accurate simulation of respondents from specific social and cultural contexts. Applying LLMs in this capacity, we reconstruct the public opinion landscape of 2019 to examine the extent to which the future polarization over COVID-19 was prefigured in existing political discourse. Using an LLM trained on texts published through 2019, we simulate the responses of American liberals and conservatives to a battery of pandemic-related questions. We find that the simulated respondents reproduce observed partisan differences in COVID-19 attitudes in 84% of cases, significantly greater than chance. Prompting the simulated respondents to justify their responses, we find that much of the observed partisan gap corresponds to differing appeals to freedom, safety, and institutional trust. Our findings suggest that the politicization of COVID-19 was largely consistent with the prior ideological landscape, and this unprecedented event served to advance history along its track rather than change the rails.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present a comprehensive evaluation of proprietary and open-weights large language models using the first astronomy-specific benchmarking dataset. This dataset comprises 4,425 multiple-choice questions curated from the Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics, covering a broad range of astrophysical topics. Our analysis examines model performance across various astronomical subfields and assesses response calibration, crucial for potential deployment in research environments. Claude-3.5-Sonnet outperforms competitors by up to 4.6 percentage points, achieving 85.0% accuracy. For proprietary models, we observed a universal reduction in cost every 3-to-12 months to achieve similar score in this particular astronomy benchmark. Open-source models have rapidly improved, with LLaMA-3-70b (80.6%) and Qwen-2-72b (77.7%) now competing with some of the best proprietary models. We identify performance variations across topics, with non-English-focused models generally struggling more in exoplanet-related fields, stellar astrophysics, and instrumentation related questions. These challenges likely stem from less abundant training data, limited historical context, and rapid recent developments in these areas. This pattern is observed across both open-weights and proprietary models, with regional dependencies evident, highlighting the impact of training data diversity on model performance in specialized scientific domains. Top-performing models demonstrate well-calibrated confidence, with correlations above 0.9 between confidence and correctness, though they tend to be slightly underconfident. The development for fast, low-cost inference of open-weights models presents new opportunities for affordable deployment in astronomy. The rapid progress observed suggests that LLM-driven research in astronomy may become feasible in the near future.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinsook Lee, Yann Hicke, Renzhe Yu, Christopher Brooks, Ren\'e F. Kizilcec</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in educational contexts to provide personalized support to students and teachers. The unprecedented capacity of LLM-based applications to understand and generate natural language can potentially improve instructional effectiveness and learning outcomes, but the integration of LLMs in education technology has renewed concerns over algorithmic bias which may exacerbate educational inequities. In this review, building on prior work on mapping the traditional machine learning life cycle, we provide a holistic map of the LLM life cycle from the initial development of LLMs to customizing pre-trained models for various applications in educational settings. We explain each step in the LLM life cycle and identify potential sources of bias that may arise in the context of education. We discuss why current measures of bias from traditional machine learning fail to transfer to LLM-generated content in education, such as tutoring conversations because the text is high-dimensional, there can be multiple correct responses, and tailoring responses may be pedagogically desirable rather than unfair. This review aims to clarify the complex nature of bias in LLM applications and provide practical guidance for their evaluation to promote educational equity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Philipp Allgeuer, Kyra Ahrens, Stefan Wermter</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce NOVIC, an innovative uNconstrained Open Vocabulary Image Classifier that uses an autoregressive transformer to generatively output classification labels as language. Leveraging the extensive knowledge of CLIP models, NOVIC harnesses the embedding space to enable zero-shot transfer from pure text to images. Traditional CLIP models, despite their ability for open vocabulary classification, require an exhaustive prompt of potential class labels, restricting their application to images of known content or context. To address this, we propose an "object decoder" model that is trained on a large-scale 92M-target dataset of templated object noun sets and LLM-generated captions to always output the object noun in question. This effectively inverts the CLIP text encoder and allows textual object labels to be generated directly from image-derived embedding vectors, without requiring any a priori knowledge of the potential content of an image. The trained decoders are tested on a mix of manually and web-curated datasets, as well as standard image classification benchmarks, and achieve fine-grained prompt-free prediction scores of up to 87.5%, a strong result considering the model must work for any conceivable image and without any contextual clues.</p>

PutnamBench consists of 1697 hand-constructed formalizations of 640 theorems sourced from the William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition, the premier undergraduate-level mathematics competition in North America. All the theorems have formalizations in Lean 4 and Isabelle; a substantial subset also has Coq formalizations. Proving the theorems requires significant problem-solving ability and proficiency in a broad range of topics taught in undergraduate mathematics courses. We use PutnamBench to evaluate several established neural and symbolic theorem-provers. These approaches can only solve a handful of the PutnamBench problems, establishing the benchmark as a difficult open challenge for research on neural theorem-proving.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ashkan Golgoon, Khashayar Filom, Arjun Ravi Kannan</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models such as GPTs (Generative Pre-trained Transformers) exhibit remarkable capabilities across a broad spectrum of applications. Nevertheless, due to their intrinsic complexity, these models present substantial challenges in interpreting their internal decision-making processes. This lack of transparency poses critical challenges when it comes to their adaptation by financial institutions, where concerns and accountability regarding bias, fairness, and reliability are of paramount importance. Mechanistic interpretability aims at reverse engineering complex AI models such as transformers. In this paper, we are pioneering the use of mechanistic interpretability to shed some light on the inner workings of large language models for use in financial services applications. We offer several examples of how algorithmic tasks can be designed for compliance monitoring purposes. In particular, we investigate GPT-2 Small's attention pattern when prompted to identify potential violation of Fair Lending laws. Using direct logit attribution, we study the contributions of each layer and its corresponding attention heads to the logit difference in the residual stream. Finally, we design clean and corrupted prompts and use activation patching as a causal intervention method to localize our task completion components further. We observe that the (positive) heads $10.2$ (head $2$, layer $10$), $10.7$, and $11.3$, as well as the (negative) heads $9.6$ and $10.6$ play a significant role in the task completion.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tim Merino, Sam Earle, Ryan Sudhakaran, Shyam Sudhakaran, Julian Togelius</p>
<p>Abstract: The Connections puzzle is a word association game published daily by The New York Times (NYT). In this game, players are asked to find groups of four words that are connected by a common theme. While solving a given Connections puzzle requires both semantic knowledge and abstract reasoning, generating novel puzzles additionally requires a form of metacognition: generators must be able to accurately model the downstream reasoning of potential solvers. In this paper, we investigate the ability of the GPT family of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate challenging and creative word games for human players. We start with an analysis of the word game Connections and the unique challenges it poses as a Procedural Content Generation (PCG) domain. We then propose a method for generating Connections puzzles using LLMs by adapting a Tree of Thoughts (ToT) prompting approach. We evaluate this method by conducting a user study, asking human players to compare AI-generated puzzles against published Connections puzzles. Our findings show that LLMs are capable puzzle creators, and can generate diverse sets of enjoyable, challenging, and creative Connections puzzles as judged by human users.</p>

<p>Abstract: The structures of RNA sequences play a vital role in various cellular processes, while existing genomic foundation models (FMs) have struggled with precise sequence-structure alignment, due to the complexity of exponential combinations of nucleotide bases. In this study, we introduce OmniGenome, a foundation model that addresses this critical challenge of sequence-structure alignment in RNA FMs. OmniGenome bridges the sequences with secondary structures using structure-contextualized modeling, enabling hard in-silico genomic tasks that existing FMs cannot handle, e.g., RNA design tasks. The results on two comprehensive genomic benchmarks show that OmniGenome achieves state-of-the-art performance on complex RNA subtasks. For example, OmniGenome solved 74% of complex puzzles, compared to SpliceBERT which solved only 3% of the puzzles. Besides, OmniGenome solves most of the puzzles within $1$ hour, while the existing methods usually allocate $24$ hours for each puzzle. Overall, OmniGenome establishes wide genomic application cases and offers profound insights into biological mechanisms from the perspective of sequence-structure alignment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kentaro Onda, Joonyong Park, Nobuaki Minematsu, Daisuke Saito</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a method of simulating the human process of foreign accentuation using Generative Spoken Language Model (GSLM) only with native speech corpora. When one listens to spoken words of a foreign language and repeats them, the repeated speech is often with the accent of that listener's L1. This is said to be because the spoken words are mentally represented as a sequence of phonological units of the L1, and those units are used for oral reproduction. We simulate this process by inputting speech of language A into GSLM of language B to add B's accent onto the input speech. The process of running ASR of the L1 for foreign input speech and giving the ASR result to TTS of the L1 can be viewed as a naive implementation of this approach. The results of our experiments show that the synthesized accent of the output speech is highly natural, compared to real samples of A generated by speakers whose L1 is B, and that the degree of accentuation is controllable.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kalliopi Basioti, Mohamed A. Abdelsalam, Federico Fancellu, Vladimir Pavlovic, Afsaneh Fazly</p>
<p>Abstract: Controllable Image Captioning (CIC) aims at generating natural language descriptions for an image, conditioned on information provided by end users, e.g., regions, entities or events of interest. However, available image--language datasets mainly contain captions that describe the entirety of an image, making them ineffective for training CIC models that can potentially attend to any subset of regions or relationships. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel, fully automatic method to sample additional focused and visually grounded captions using a unified structured semantic representation built on top of the existing set of captions associated with an image. We leverage Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR), a cross-lingual graph-based semantic formalism, to encode all possible spatio-semantic relations between entities, beyond the typical spatial-relations-only focus of current methods. We use this Structured Semantic Augmentation (SSA) framework to augment existing image--caption datasets with the grounded controlled captions, increasing their spatial and semantic diversity and focal coverage. We then develop a new model, CIC-BART-SSA, specifically tailored for the CIC task, that sources its control signals from SSA-diversified datasets. We empirically show that, compared to SOTA CIC models, CIC-BART-SSA generates captions that are superior in diversity and text quality, are competitive in controllability, and, importantly, minimize the gap between broad and highly focused controlled captioning performance by efficiently generalizing to the challenging highly focused scenarios.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liana Patel, Siddharth Jha, Carlos Guestrin, Matei Zaharia</p>
<p>Abstract: The semantic capabilities of language models (LMs) have the potential to enable rich analytics and reasoning over vast knowledge corpora. Unfortunately, existing systems lack high-level abstractions to perform semantic queries at scale. We introduce semantic operators, a declarative programming interface that extends the relational model with composable AI-based operations for semantic queries over datasets (e.g., sorting or aggregating records using natural language criteria). Each operator can be implemented and optimized in multiple ways, opening a rich space for execution plans similar to relational operators. We implement our operators and several optimizations for them in LOTUS, an open-source query engine with a Pandas-like API.
  We demonstrate LOTUS' effectiveness across a series of real applications, including fact-checking, extreme multi-label classification, and search. We find that LOTUS' programming model is highly expressive, capturing state-of-the-art query pipelines with low development overhead. Specifically, on the FEVER dataset, LOTUS' programs can reproduce FacTool, a recent state-of-the-art fact-checking pipeline, in few lines of code, and implement a new pipeline that improves accuracy by $9.5\%$, while offering $7-34\times$ lower execution time. In the extreme multi-label classification task on the BioDEX dataset, LOTUS reproduces state-of-the art result quality with its join operator, while providing an efficient algorithm that runs $800\times$ faster than a naive join. In the search and ranking application, LOTUS allows a simple composition of operators to achieve $5.9 - 49.4\%$ higher nDCG@10 than the vanilla retriever and re-ranker, while also providing query efficiency, with $1.67 - 10\times$ lower execution time than LM-based ranking methods used by prior works.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiasheng Zheng, Boxi Cao, Zhengzhao Ma, Ruotong Pan, Hongyu Lin, Yaojie Lu, Xianpei Han, Le Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, researchers have proposed numerous benchmarks to evaluate the impressive coding capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on assessing the correctness of code generated by LLMs, while neglecting other critical dimensions that also significantly impact code quality. Therefore, this paper proposes the RACE benchmark, which comprehensively evaluates the quality of code generated by LLMs across 4 dimensions: Readability, mAintainability, Correctness, and Efficiency. Specifically, considering the demand-dependent nature of dimensions beyond correctness, we design various types of user requirements for each dimension to assess the model's ability to generate correct code that also meets user demands. We evaluate 18 representative LLMs on RACE and find that: 1) the current LLMs' ability to generate high-quality code on demand does not yet meet the requirements of software development; 2) readability serves as a critical indicator of the overall quality of generated code; 3) most LLMs exhibit an inherent preference for specific coding style. These findings can help researchers gain a deeper understanding of the coding capabilities of current LLMs and shed light on future directions for model improvement.</p>

<p>Abstract: Stuttering is a common speech impediment that is caused by irregular disruptions in speech production, affecting over 70 million people across the world. Standard automatic speech processing tools do not take speech ailments into account and are thereby not able to generate meaningful results when presented with stuttered speech as input. The automatic detection of stuttering is an integral step towards building efficient, context-aware speech processing systems. While previous approaches explore both statistical and neural approaches for stuttering detection, all of these methods are uni-modal in nature. This paper presents MMSD-Net, the first multi-modal neural framework for stuttering detection. Experiments and results demonstrate that incorporating the visual signal significantly aids stuttering detection, and our model yields an improvement of 2-17% in the F1-score over existing state-of-the-art uni-modal approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aske Plaat, Annie Wong, Suzan Verberne, Joost Broekens, Niki van Stein, Thomas Back</p>
<p>Abstract: Scaling up language models to billions of parameters has opened up possibilities for in-context learning, allowing instruction tuning and few-shot learning on tasks that the model was not specifically trained for. This has achieved breakthrough performance on language tasks such as translation, summarization, and question-answering. Furthermore, in addition to these associative "System 1" tasks, recent advances in Chain-of-thought prompt learning have demonstrated strong "System 2" reasoning abilities, answering a question in the field of artificial general intelligence whether LLMs can reason. The field started with the question whether LLMs can solve grade school math word problems. This paper reviews the rapidly expanding field of prompt-based reasoning with LLMs. Our taxonomy identifies different ways to generate, evaluate, and control multi-step reasoning. We provide an in-depth coverage of core approaches and open problems, and we propose a research agenda for the near future. Finally, we highlight the relation between reasoning and prompt-based learning, and we discuss the relation between reasoning, sequential decision processes, and reinforcement learning. We find that self-improvement, self-reflection, and some metacognitive abilities of the reasoning processes are possible through the judicious use of prompts. True self-improvement and self-reasoning, to go from reasoning with LLMs to reasoning by LLMs, remains future work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zichen Chen, Jianda Chen, Yuanyuan Chen, Han Yu, Ambuj K Singh, Misha Sra</p>
<p>Abstract: Language models (LMs) like GPT-4 are important in AI applications, but their opaque decision-making process reduces user trust, especially in safety-critical areas. We introduce LMExplainer, a novel knowledge-grounded explainer that clarifies the reasoning process of LMs through intuitive, human-understandable explanations. By leveraging a graph attention network (GAT) with a large-scale knowledge graph (KG), LMExplainer not only precisely narrows the reasoning space to focus on the most relevant knowledge but also grounds its reasoning in structured, verifiable knowledge to reduce hallucinations and enhance interpretability. LMExplainer effectively generates human-understandable explanations to enhance transparency and streamline the decision-making process. Additionally, by incorporating debugging into the explanation, it offers expertise suggestions that improve LMs from a developmental perspective. Thus, LMExplainer stands as an enhancement in making LMs more accessible and understandable to users. We evaluate LMExplainer on benchmark datasets such as CommonsenseQA and OpenBookQA, demonstrating that it outperforms most existing methods. By comparing the explanations generated by LMExplainer with those of other models, we show that our approach offers more comprehensive and clearer explanations of the reasoning process. LMExplainer provides a deeper understanding of the inner workings of LMs, advancing towards more reliable, transparent, and equitable AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qinghua Lu, Liming Zhu, Xiwei Xu, Zhenchang Xing, Jon Whittle</p>
<p>Abstract: The release of ChatGPT, Gemini, and other large language model has drawn huge interests on foundations models. There is a broad consensus that foundations models will be the fundamental building blocks for future AI systems. However, there is a lack of systematic guidance on the architecture design. Particularly, the the rapidly growing capabilities of foundations models can eventually absorb other components of AI systems, posing challenges of moving boundary and interface evolution in architecture design. Furthermore, incorporating foundations models into AI systems raises significant concerns about responsible and safe AI due to their opaque nature and rapidly advancing intelligence. To address these challenges, the paper first presents an architecture evolution of AI systems in the era of foundation models, transitioning from "foundation-model-as-a-connector" to "foundation-model-as-a-monolithic architecture". The paper then identifies key design decisions and proposes a pattern-oriented reference architecture for designing responsible foundation-model-based systems. The patterns can enable the potential of foundation models while ensuring associated risks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning methods for natural language processing (NLP) have created new business opportunities and made NLP research critical for industry development. As one of the big players in the field of NLP, together with governments and universities, it is important to track the influence of industry on research. In this study, we seek to quantify and characterize industry presence in the NLP community over time. Using a corpus with comprehensive metadata of 78,187 NLP publications and 701 resumes of NLP publication authors, we explore the industry presence in the field since the early 90s. We find that industry presence among NLP authors has been steady before a steep increase over the past five years (180% growth from 2017 to 2022). A few companies account for most of the publications and provide funding to academic researchers through grants and internships. Our study shows that the presence and impact of the industry on natural language processing research are significant and fast-growing. This work calls for increased transparency of industry influence in the field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Somin Wadhwa, Silvio Amir, Byron C. Wallace</p>
<p>Abstract: Relation extraction (RE) is the core NLP task of inferring semantic relationships between entities from text. Standard supervised RE techniques entail training modules to tag tokens comprising entity spans and then predict the relationship between them. Recent work has instead treated the problem as a \emph{sequence-to-sequence} task, linearizing relations between entities as target strings to be generated conditioned on the input. Here we push the limits of this approach, using larger language models (GPT-3 and Flan-T5 large) than considered in prior work and evaluating their performance on standard RE tasks under varying levels of supervision. We address issues inherent to evaluating generative approaches to RE by doing human evaluations, in lieu of relying on exact matching. Under this refined evaluation, we find that: (1) Few-shot prompting with GPT-3 achieves near SOTA performance, i.e., roughly equivalent to existing fully supervised models; (2) Flan-T5 is not as capable in the few-shot setting, but supervising and fine-tuning it with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) style explanations (generated via GPT-3) yields SOTA results. We release this model as a new baseline for RE tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sunkyoung Kim, Dayeon Ki, Yireun Kim, Jinsik Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Multilingual large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant cross-lingual capabilities through in-context learning. Existing approaches typically construct monolingual in-context examples, either in the source or target language. However, translating entire in-context examples into the target language might compromise contextual integrity and be costly in the case of long-context passages. To address this, we introduce Cross-lingual QA, a cross-lingual prompting method that translates only the question and answer parts, thus reducing translation costs. Experiments on four typologically diverse multilingual benchmarks show that Cross-lingual QA prompting effectively stimulates models to elicit their cross-lingual knowledge, outperforming prior monolingual prompting approaches. Furthermore, we show that prompting open-source MLLMs with cross-lingual in-context examples enhances performance as the model scale increases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaijie Zhu, Jindong Wang, Jiaheng Zhou, Zichen Wang, Hao Chen, Yidong Wang, Linyi Yang, Wei Ye, Yue Zhang, Neil Zhenqiang Gong, Xing Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing reliance on Large Language Models (LLMs) across academia and industry necessitates a comprehensive understanding of their robustness to prompts. In response to this vital need, we introduce PromptRobust, a robustness benchmark designed to measure LLMs' resilience to adversarial prompts. This study uses a plethora of adversarial textual attacks targeting prompts across multiple levels: character, word, sentence, and semantic. The adversarial prompts, crafted to mimic plausible user errors like typos or synonyms, aim to evaluate how slight deviations can affect LLM outcomes while maintaining semantic integrity. These prompts are then employed in diverse tasks including sentiment analysis, natural language inference, reading comprehension, machine translation, and math problem-solving. Our study generates 4,788 adversarial prompts, meticulously evaluated over 8 tasks and 13 datasets. Our findings demonstrate that contemporary LLMs are not robust to adversarial prompts. Furthermore, we present a comprehensive analysis to understand the mystery behind prompt robustness and its transferability. We then offer insightful robustness analysis and pragmatic recommendations for prompt composition, beneficial to both researchers and everyday users.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrei C. Coman, Christos Theodoropoulos, Marie-Francine Moens, James Henderson</p>
<p>Abstract: Document-level relation extraction typically relies on text-based encoders and hand-coded pooling heuristics to aggregate information learned by the encoder. In this paper, we leverage the intrinsic graph processing capabilities of the Transformer model and propose replacing hand-coded pooling methods with new tokens in the input, which are designed to aggregate information via explicit graph relations in the computation of attention weights. We introduce a joint text-graph Transformer model and a graph-assisted declarative pooling (GADePo) specification of the input, which provides explicit and high-level instructions for information aggregation. GADePo allows the pooling process to be guided by domain-specific knowledge or desired outcomes but still learned by the Transformer, leading to more flexible and customisable pooling strategies. We evaluate our method across diverse datasets and models and show that our approach yields promising results that are consistently better than those achieved by the hand-coded pooling functions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyuan Allen-Zhu, Yuanzhi Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can store a vast amount of world knowledge, often extractable via question-answering (e.g., "What is Abraham Lincoln's birthday?"). However, do they answer such questions based on exposure to similar questions during training (i.e., cheating), or by genuinely learning to extract knowledge from sources like Wikipedia?
  In this paper, we investigate this issue using a controlled biography dataset. We find a strong correlation between the model's ability to extract knowledge and various diversity measures of the training data. $\textbf{Essentially}$, for knowledge to be reliably extracted, it must be sufficiently augmented (e.g., through paraphrasing, sentence shuffling, translations) $\textit{during pretraining}$. Without such augmentation, knowledge may be memorized but not extractable, leading to 0% accuracy, regardless of subsequent instruction fine-tuning.
  To understand why this occurs, we employ (nearly) linear probing to demonstrate a strong connection between the observed correlation and how the model internally encodes knowledge -- whether it is linearly encoded in the hidden embeddings of entity names or distributed across other token embeddings in the training text.
  This paper provides $\textbf{several key recommendations for LLM pretraining in the industry}$: (1) rewrite the pretraining data -- using small, auxiliary models -- to provide knowledge augmentation, and (2) incorporate more instruction-finetuning data into the pretraining stage before it becomes too late.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyuan Allen-Zhu, Yuanzhi Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Language models can store vast factual knowledge, yet their ability to flexibly use this knowledge for downstream tasks (e.g., via instruction finetuning) remains questionable. This paper investigates four fundamental knowledge manipulation tasks: retrieval (e.g., "What is person A's attribute X?"), classification (e.g., "Is A's attribute X even or odd?"), comparison (e.g., "Is A greater than B in attribute X?"), and inverse search (e.g., "Which person's attribute X equals T?").
  We show that language models excel in knowledge retrieval but struggle even in the simplest classification or comparison tasks unless Chain of Thoughts (CoTs) are employed during both training and inference. Moreover, their performance in inverse knowledge search is virtually 0%, regardless of the prompts. Our primary contribution is a controlled, synthetic experiment that confirms these weaknesses are inherent to language models: they cannot efficiently manipulate knowledge from pre-training data, even when such knowledge is perfectly stored in the models, despite adequate training and sufficient model size. Our findings also apply to modern pretrained language models such as GPT-4, thus giving rise to many Turing tests to distinguish Humans from contemporary AIs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Learning from human feedback has become a pivot technique in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, acquiring vast and premium human feedback is bottlenecked by time, labor, and human capability, resulting in small sizes or limited topics of current datasets. This further hinders feedback learning as well as alignment research within the open-source community. To address this issue, we explore how to go beyond human feedback and collect high-quality \textit{AI feedback} automatically for a scalable alternative. Specifically, we identify \textbf{scale and diversity} as the key factors for feedback data to take effect. Accordingly, we first broaden instructions and responses in both amount and breadth to encompass a wider range of user-assistant interactions. Then, we meticulously apply a series of techniques to mitigate annotation biases for more reliable AI feedback. We finally present \textsc{UltraFeedback}, a large-scale, high-quality, and diversified AI feedback dataset, which contains over 1 million GPT-4 feedback for 250k user-assistant conversations from various aspects. Built upon \textsc{UltraFeedback}, we align a LLaMA-based model by best-of-$n$ sampling and reinforcement learning, demonstrating its exceptional performance on chat benchmarks. Our work validates the effectiveness of scaled AI feedback data in constructing strong open-source chat language models, serving as a solid foundation for future feedback learning research.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jan Philip Wahle, Bela Gipp, Terry Ruas</p>
<p>Abstract: Current approaches in paraphrase generation and detection heavily rely on a single general similarity score, ignoring the intricate linguistic properties of language. This paper introduces two new tasks to address this shortcoming by considering paraphrase types - specific linguistic perturbations at particular text positions. We name these tasks Paraphrase Type Generation and Paraphrase Type Detection. Our results suggest that while current techniques perform well in a binary classification scenario, i.e., paraphrased or not, the inclusion of fine-grained paraphrase types poses a significant challenge. While most approaches are good at generating and detecting general semantic similar content, they fail to understand the intrinsic linguistic variables they manipulate. Models trained in generating and identifying paraphrase types also show improvements in tasks without them. In addition, scaling these models further improves their ability to understand paraphrase types. We believe paraphrase types can unlock a new paradigm for developing paraphrase models and solving tasks in the future.</p>

<p>Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) is poised to substantially influence the world. However, significant progress comes hand-in-hand with substantial risks. Addressing them requires broad engagement with various fields of study. Yet, little empirical work examines the state of such engagement (past or current). In this paper, we quantify the degree of influence between 23 fields of study and NLP (on each other). We analyzed ~77k NLP papers, ~3.1m citations from NLP papers to other papers, and ~1.8m citations from other papers to NLP papers. We show that, unlike most fields, the cross-field engagement of NLP, measured by our proposed Citation Field Diversity Index (CFDI), has declined from 0.58 in 1980 to 0.31 in 2022 (an all-time low). In addition, we find that NLP has grown more insular -- citing increasingly more NLP papers and having fewer papers that act as bridges between fields. NLP citations are dominated by computer science; Less than 8% of NLP citations are to linguistics, and less than 3% are to math and psychology. These findings underscore NLP's urgent need to reflect on its engagement with various fields.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matthieu Meeus, Shubham Jain, Marek Rei, Yves-Alexandre de Montjoye</p>
<p>Abstract: With large language models (LLMs) poised to become embedded in our daily lives, questions are starting to be raised about the data they learned from. These questions range from potential bias or misinformation LLMs could retain from their training data to questions of copyright and fair use of human-generated text. However, while these questions emerge, developers of the recent state-of-the-art LLMs become increasingly reluctant to disclose details on their training corpus. We here introduce the task of document-level membership inference for real-world LLMs, i.e. inferring whether the LLM has seen a given document during training or not. First, we propose a procedure for the development and evaluation of document-level membership inference for LLMs by leveraging commonly used data sources for training and the model release date. We then propose a practical, black-box method to predict document-level membership and instantiate it on OpenLLaMA-7B with both books and academic papers. We show our methodology to perform very well, reaching an AUC of 0.856 for books and 0.678 for papers. We then show our approach to outperform the sentence-level membership inference attacks used in the privacy literature for the document-level membership task. We further evaluate whether smaller models might be less sensitive to document-level inference and show OpenLLaMA-3B to be approximately as sensitive as OpenLLaMA-7B to our approach. Finally, we consider two mitigation strategies and find the AUC to slowly decrease when only partial documents are considered but to remain fairly high when the model precision is reduced. Taken together, our results show that accurate document-level membership can be inferred for LLMs, increasing the transparency of technology poised to change our lives.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive reasoning and data augmentation capabilities in various NLP tasks. However, what about small models? In this work, we propose TeacherLM-7.1B, capable of annotating relevant fundamentals, chain of thought, and common mistakes for most NLP samples, which makes annotation more than just an answer, thus allowing other models to learn "why" instead of just "what". The TeacherLM-7.1B model achieved a zero-shot score of 52.3 on MMLU, surpassing most models with over 100B parameters. Even more remarkable is its data augmentation ability. Based on TeacherLM-7.1B, we augmented 58 NLP datasets and taught various student models with different parameters from OPT and BLOOM series in a multi-task setting. The experimental results indicate that the data augmentation provided by TeacherLM has brought significant benefits.

<p>Abstract: Recently, the increasing demand for superior medical services has highlighted the discrepancies in the medical infrastructure. With big data, especially texts, forming the foundation of medical services, there is an exigent need for effective natural language processing (NLP) solutions tailored to the healthcare domain. Conventional approaches leveraging pre-trained models present promising results in this domain and current large language models (LLMs) offer advanced foundation for medical text processing. However, most medical LLMs are trained only with supervised fine-tuning (SFT), even though it efficiently empowers LLMs to understand and respond to medical instructions but is ineffective in learning domain knowledge and aligning with human preference. In this work, we propose ChiMed-GPT, a new benchmark LLM designed explicitly for Chinese medical domain, and undergoes a comprehensive training regime with pre-training, SFT, and RLHF. Evaluations on tasks including information extraction, question answering, and dialogue generation demonstrate ChiMed-GPT's superior performance over general domain LLMs. Furthermore, we analyze possible biases through prompting ChiMed-GPT to perform attitude scales regarding discrimination of patients, so as to contribute to further responsible development of LLMs in the medical domain.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen Zhang, Dawei Song, Zheyu Ye, Yan Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Language model (LM) distillation is a trending area that aims to distil the knowledge residing in a large teacher LM to a small student one. While various methods have been proposed to maximize the effectiveness of the distillation, significant challenges persist, particularly when there is a substantial capacity gap between the teacher and student LMs. This issue, often referred to as the \textit{curse} of capacity gap, suggests that a larger teacher does not necessarily result in a superior student compared to one distilled from a smaller teacher. In other words, there is likely an optimal teacher yielding the best student along the scaling course of the teacher. Even worse, the curse of capacity gap can not be lifted without additional compute, as indicated in previous studies. In the context of large LMs (LLMs), previously viable approaches become much less meaningful, as it is impossible to distill a large teacher to a good student without notably additional compute.
  However, the tale is not ever one-sided. It is always not late to acquire that using a large teacher is resource-demanding. Consequently, instead of sticking to lifting the curse, leaving the curse as is and using a small yet adequate teacher should be arguably fine. Even better, in this paper, we take the spirits of scaling law and reveal that the optimal teacher scale is almost consistently and linearly correlated to the student scale across different model architectures and data scales, fortunately turning the curse into a \textit{law} of capacity gap. The law later guides us to distil a 3B student LM (termed \textsc{MiniMA}) from LLaMA2-7B. \textsc{MiniMA} is demonstrated to outperform a wide range of 3B competitors and could even compete with several 7B models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Language models, characterized by their black-box nature, often hallucinate and display sensitivity to input perturbations, causing concerns about trust. To enhance trust, it is imperative to gain a comprehensive understanding of the model's failure modes and develop effective strategies to improve their performance. In this study, we introduce a methodology designed to examine how input perturbations affect language models across various scales, including pre-trained models and large language models (LLMs). Utilizing fine-tuning, we enhance the model's robustness to input perturbations. Additionally, we investigate whether exposure to one perturbation enhances or diminishes the model's performance with respect to other perturbations. To address robustness against multiple perturbations, we present three distinct fine-tuning strategies. Furthermore, we broaden the scope of our methodology to encompass large language models (LLMs) by leveraging a chain of thought (CoT) prompting approach augmented with exemplars. We employ the Tabular-NLI task to showcase how our proposed strategies adeptly train a robust model, enabling it to address diverse perturbations while maintaining accuracy on the original dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ghadi Alyahya, Abeer Aldayel</p>
<p>Abstract: Examining the factors that the counterspeech uses are at the core of understanding the optimal methods for confronting hate speech online. Various studies have assessed the emotional base factors used in counter speech, such as emotional empathy, offensiveness, and hostility. To better understand the counterspeech used in conversations, this study distills persuasion modes into reason, emotion, and credibility and evaluates their use in two types of conversation interactions: closed (multi-turn) and open (single-turn) concerning racism, sexism, and religious bigotry. The evaluation covers the distinct behaviors seen with human-sourced as opposed to machine-generated counterspeech. It also assesses the interplay between the stance taken and the mode of persuasion seen in the counterspeech.
  Notably, we observe nuanced differences in the counterspeech persuasion modes used in open and closed interactions, especially in terms of the topic, with a general tendency to use reason as a persuasion mode to express the counterpoint to hate comments. The machine-generated counterspeech tends to exhibit an emotional persuasion mode, while human counters lean toward reason. Furthermore, our study shows that reason tends to obtain more supportive replies than other persuasion modes. The findings highlight the potential for incorporating persuasion modes into studies about countering hate speech, as they can serve as an optimal means of explainability and pave the way for the further adoption of the reply's stance and the role it plays in assessing what comprises the optimal counterspeech.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bowen Jin, Chulin Xie, Jiawei Zhang, Kashob Kumar Roy, Yu Zhang, Zheng Li, Ruirui Li, Xianfeng Tang, Suhang Wang, Yu Meng, Jiawei Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), while exhibiting exceptional performance, suffer from hallucinations, especially on knowledge-intensive tasks. Existing works propose to augment LLMs with individual text units retrieved from external knowledge corpora to alleviate the issue. However, in many domains, texts are interconnected (e.g., academic papers in a bibliographic graph are linked by citations and co-authorships) which form a (text-attributed) graph. The knowledge in such graphs is encoded not only in single texts/nodes but also in their associated connections. To facilitate the research of augmenting LLMs with graphs, we manually construct a Graph Reasoning Benchmark dataset called GRBench, containing 1,740 questions that can be answered with the knowledge from 10 domain graphs. Then, we propose a simple and effective framework called Graph Chain-of-thought (Graph-CoT) to augment LLMs with graphs by encouraging LLMs to reason on the graph iteratively. Each Graph-CoT iteration consists of three sub-steps: LLM reasoning, LLM-graph interaction, and graph execution. We conduct systematic experiments with three LLM backbones on GRBench, where Graph-CoT outperforms the baselines consistently.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zijin Hong, Zheng Yuan, Qinggang Zhang, Hao Chen, Junnan Dong, Feiran Huang, Xiao Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating accurate SQL from natural language questions (text-to-SQL) is a long-standing challenge due to the complexities in user question understanding, database schema comprehension, and SQL generation. Conventional text-to-SQL systems, comprising human engineering and deep neural networks, have made substantial progress. Subsequently, pre-trained language models (PLMs) have been developed and utilized for text-to-SQL tasks, achieving promising performance. As modern databases become more complex, the corresponding user questions also grow more challenging, causing PLMs with parameter constraints to produce incorrect SQL. This necessitates more sophisticated and tailored optimization methods, which, in turn, restricts the applications of PLM-based systems. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in natural language understanding as the model scale increases. Therefore, integrating LLM-based implementation can bring unique opportunities, improvements, and solutions to text-to-SQL research. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review of LLM-based text-to-SQL. Specifically, we propose a brief overview of the technical challenges and the evolutionary process of text-to-SQL. Then, we provide a detailed introduction to the datasets and metrics designed to evaluate text-to-SQL systems. After that, we present a systematic analysis of recent advances in LLM-based text-to-SQL. Finally, we discuss the remaining challenges in this field and propose expectations for future research directions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matteo Esposito, Francesco Palagiano, Valentina Lenarduzzi</p>
<p>Abstract: Context. Risk analysis assesses potential risks in specific scenarios. Risk analysis principles are context-less; the same methodology can be applied to a risk connected to health and information technology security. Risk analysis requires a vast knowledge of national and international regulations and standards and is time and effort-intensive. A large language model can quickly summarize information in less time than a human and can be fine-tuned to specific tasks. Aim. Our empirical study aims to investigate the effectiveness of Retrieval-Augmented Generation and fine-tuned LLM in Risk analysis. To our knowledge, no prior study has explored its capabilities in risk analysis. Method. We manually curated \totalscenarios unique scenarios leading to \totalsamples representative samples from over 50 mission-critical analyses archived by the industrial context team in the last five years. We compared the base GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models versus their Retrieval-Augmented Generation and fine-tuned counterparts. We employ two human experts as competitors of the models and three other three human experts to review the models and the former human expert's analysis. The reviewers analyzed 5,000 scenario analyses. Results and Conclusions. HEs demonstrated higher accuracy, but LLMs are quicker and more actionable. Moreover, our findings show that RAG-assisted LLMs have the lowest hallucination rates, effectively uncovering hidden risks and complementing human expertise. Thus, the choice of model depends on specific needs, with FTMs for accuracy, RAG for hidden risks discovery, and base models for comprehensiveness and actionability. Therefore, experts can leverage LLMs for an effective complementing companion in risk analysis within a condensed timeframe. They can also save costs by averting unnecessary expenses associated with implementing unwarranted countermeasures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yichen Pan, Dehan Kong, Sida Zhou, Cheng Cui, Yifei Leng, Bing Jiang, Hangyu Liu, Yanyi Shang, Shuyan Zhou, Tongshuang Wu, Zhengyang Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: For web agents to be practically useful, they must adapt to the continuously evolving web environment characterized by frequent updates to user interfaces and content. However, most existing benchmarks only capture the static aspects of the web. To bridge this gap, we introduce WebCanvas, an innovative online evaluation framework for web agents that effectively addresses the dynamic nature of web interactions. WebCanvas contains three main components to facilitate realistic assessments: (1) A novel evaluation metric which reliably capture critical intermediate actions or states necessary for task completions while disregarding noise caused by insignificant events or changed web-elements. (2) A benchmark dataset called Mind2Web-Live, a refined version of original Mind2Web static dataset containing 542 tasks with 2439 intermediate evaluation states; (3) Lightweight and generalizable annotation tools and testing pipelines that enables the community to collect and maintain the high-quality, up-to-date dataset. Building on WebCanvas, we open-source an agent framework with extensible modules for reasoning, providing a foundation for the community to conduct online inference and evaluations. Our best-performing agent achieves a task success rate of 23.1% and a task completion rate of 48.8% on the Mind2Web-Live test set. Additionally, we analyze the performance discrepancies across various websites, domains, and experimental environments. We encourage the community to contribute further insights on online agent evaluation, thereby advancing this field of research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sundesh Donthi, Maximilian Spencer, Om Patel, Joon Doh, Eid Rodan</p>
<p>Abstract: For large language models (LLMs) like NLLB and GPT, translating idioms remains a challenge. Our goal is to enhance translation fidelity by improving LLM processing of idiomatic language while preserving the original linguistic style. This has a significant social impact, as it preserves cultural nuances and ensures translated texts retain their intent and emotional resonance, fostering better cross-cultural communication. Previous work has utilized knowledge bases like IdiomKB by providing the LLM with the meaning of an idiom to use in translation. Although this method yielded better results than a direct translation, it is still limited in its ability to preserve idiomatic writing style across languages. In this research, we expand upon the knowledge base to find corresponding idioms in the target language. Our research performs translations using two methods: The first method employs the SentenceTransformers model to semantically generate cosine similarity scores between the meanings of the original and target language idioms, selecting the best idiom (Cosine Similarity method). The second method uses an LLM to find a corresponding idiom in the target language for use in the translation (LLM-generated idiom method). As a baseline, we performed a direct translation without providing additional information. Human evaluations on the English -> Chinese, and Chinese -> English show the Cosine Similarity Lookup method out-performed others in all GPT4o translations. To further build upon IdiomKB, we developed a low-resource Urdu dataset containing Urdu idioms and their translations. Despite dataset limitations, the Cosine Similarity Lookup method shows promise, potentially overcoming language barriers and enabling the exploration of diverse literary works in Chinese and Urdu.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of LLMs in English, there is a significant gap in performance in non-English languages. In order to address this, we introduce a novel recipe for creating a multilingual synthetic instruction tuning dataset, sPhinX, which is created by selectively translating instruction response pairs from English into 50 languages. We test the effectiveness of sPhinX by using it to fine-tune two state-of-the-art models, Phi-3-small and Mistral-7B and then evaluating them across a comprehensive suite of multilingual benchmarks that test reasoning, question answering, and reading comprehension. Our results show that Phi-3-small and Mistral-7B fine-tuned with sPhinX perform better on an average by 4.2%pt and 5%pt respectively as compared to the baselines. We also devise a strategy to incorporate N-shot examples in each fine-tuning sample which further boosts the performance of these models by 3%pt and 10%pt respectively. Additionally, sPhinX also outperforms other multilingual instruction tuning datasets on the same benchmarks along with being sample efficient and diverse, thereby reducing dataset creation costs. Additionally, instruction tuning with sPhinX does not lead to regression on most standard LLM benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: psifx is a plug-and-play multi-modal feature extraction toolkit, aiming to facilitate and democratize the use of state-of-the-art machine learning techniques for human sciences research. It is motivated by a need (a) to automate and standardize data annotation processes, otherwise involving expensive, lengthy, and inconsistent human labor, such as the transcription or coding of behavior changes from audio and video sources; (b) to develop and distribute open-source community-driven psychology research software; and (c) to enable large-scale access and ease of use to non-expert users. The framework contains an array of tools for tasks, such as speaker diarization, closed-caption transcription and translation from audio, as well as body, hand, and facial pose estimation and gaze tracking from video. The package has been designed with a modular and task-oriented approach, enabling the community to add or update new tools easily. We strongly hope that this package will provide psychologists a simple and practical solution for efficiently a range of audio, linguistic, and visual features from audio and video, thereby creating new opportunities for in-depth study of real-time behavioral phenomena.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Asaf Achi Mordechai, Yoav Goldberg, Reut Tsarfaty</p>
<p>Abstract: Current Text-to-Code models demonstrate impressive capabilities in generating executable code from natural language snippets. However, current studies focus on technical instructions and programmer-oriented language, and it is an open question whether these models can effectively translate natural language descriptions given by non-technical users and express complex goals, to an executable program that contains an intricate flow - composed of API access and control structures as loops, conditions, and sequences. To unlock the challenge of generating a complete program from a plain non-technical description we present NoviCode, a novel NL Programming task, which takes as input an API and a natural language description by a novice non-programmer and provides an executable program as output. To assess the efficacy of models on this task, we provide a novel benchmark accompanied by test suites wherein the generated program code is assessed not according to their form, but according to their functional execution. Our experiments show that, first, NoviCode is indeed a challenging task in the code synthesis domain, and that generating complex code from non-technical instructions goes beyond the current Text-to-Code paradigm. Second, we show that a novel approach wherein we align the NL utterances with the compositional hierarchical structure of the code, greatly enhances the performance of LLMs on this task, compared with the end-to-end Text-to-Code counterparts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ozan Unal, Christos Sakaridis, Suman Saha, Luc Van Gool</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D visual grounding is the task of localizing the object in a 3D scene which is referred by a description in natural language. With a wide range of applications ranging from autonomous indoor robotics to AR/VR, the task has recently risen in popularity. A common formulation to tackle 3D visual grounding is grounding-by-detection, where localization is done via bounding boxes. However, for real-life applications that require physical interactions, a bounding box insufficiently describes the geometry of an object. We therefore tackle the problem of dense 3D visual grounding, i.e. referral-based 3D instance segmentation. We propose a dense 3D grounding network ConcreteNet, featuring four novel stand-alone modules that aim to improve grounding performance for challenging repetitive instances, i.e. instances with distractors of the same semantic class. First, we introduce a bottom-up attentive fusion module that aims to disambiguate inter-instance relational cues, next, we construct a contrastive training scheme to induce separation in the latent space, we then resolve view-dependent utterances via a learned global camera token, and finally we employ multi-view ensembling to improve referred mask quality. ConcreteNet ranks 1st on the challenging ScanRefer online benchmark and has won the ICCV 3rd Workshop on Language for 3D Scenes "3D Object Localization" challenge.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Blake Castleman, Mehmet Kerem Turkcan</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have facilitated the development of chatbots with sophisticated conversational capabilities. However, LLMs exhibit frequent inaccurate responses to queries, hindering applications in educational settings. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of integrating a knowledge base (KB) with LLM intelligent tutors to increase response reliability. To achieve this, we design a scaleable KB that affords educational supervisors seamless integration of lesson curricula, which is automatically processed by the intelligent tutoring system. We then detail an evaluation, where student participants were presented with questions about the artificial intelligence curriculum to respond to. GPT-4 intelligent tutors with varying hierarchies of KB access and human domain experts then assessed these responses. Lastly, students cross-examined the intelligent tutors' responses to the domain experts' and ranked their various pedagogical abilities. Results suggest that, although these intelligent tutors still demonstrate a lower accuracy compared to domain experts, the accuracy of the intelligent tutors increases when access to a KB is granted. We also observe that the intelligent tutors with KB access exhibit better pedagogical abilities to speak like a teacher and understand students than those of domain experts, while their ability to help students remains lagging behind domain experts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Zhang, Rui Wu, Sergiu M. Dascalu, Frederick C. Harris Jr</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers have achieved remarkable performance in multivariate time series(MTS) forecasting due to their capability to capture long-term dependencies. However, the canonical attention mechanism has two key limitations: (1) its quadratic time complexity limits the sequence length, and (2) it generates future values from the entire historical sequence. To address this, we propose a Dozer Attention mechanism consisting of three sparse components: (1) Local, each query exclusively attends to keys within a localized window of neighboring time steps. (2) Stride, enables each query to attend to keys at predefined intervals. (3) Vary, allows queries to selectively attend to keys from a subset of the historical sequence. Notably, the size of this subset dynamically expands as forecasting horizons extend. Those three components are designed to capture essential attributes of MTS data, including locality, seasonality, and global temporal dependencies. Additionally, we present the Dozerformer Framework, incorporating the Dozer Attention mechanism for the MTS forecasting task. We evaluated the proposed Dozerformer framework with recent state-of-the-art methods on nine benchmark datasets and confirmed its superior performance. The experimental results indicate that excluding a subset of historical time steps from the time series forecasting process does not compromise accuracy while significantly improving efficiency.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benjamin Bergner, Andrii Skliar, Amelie Royer, Tijmen Blankevoort, Yuki Asano, Babak Ehteshami Bejnordi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become ubiquitous in practice and are widely used for generation tasks such as translation, summarization and instruction following. However, their enormous size and reliance on autoregressive decoding increase deployment costs and complicate their use in latency-critical applications. In this work, we propose a hybrid approach that combines language models of different sizes to increase the efficiency of autoregressive decoding while maintaining high performance. Our method utilizes a pretrained frozen LLM that encodes all prompt tokens once in parallel, and uses the resulting representations to condition and guide a small language model (SLM), which then generates the response more efficiently. We investigate the combination of encoder-decoder LLMs with both encoder-decoder and decoder-only SLMs from different model families and only require fine-tuning of the SLM. Experiments with various benchmarks show substantial speedups of up to $4\times$, with minor performance penalties of $1-2\%$ for translation and summarization tasks compared to the LLM.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Llama have revolutionized natural language processing and search engine dynamics. However, these models incur exceptionally high computational costs. For instance, GPT-3 consists of 175 billion parameters, where inference demands billions of floating-point operations. Caching is a natural solution to reduce LLM inference costs on repeated queries, which constitute about 31% of the total queries. However, existing caching methods are incapable of finding semantic similarities among LLM queries nor do they operate on contextual queries, leading to unacceptable false hit-and-miss rates. This paper introduces MeanCache, a user-centric semantic cache for LLM-based services that identifies semantically similar queries to determine cache hit or miss. Using MeanCache, the response to a user's semantically similar query can be retrieved from a local cache rather than re-querying the LLM, thus reducing costs, service provider load, and environmental impact. MeanCache leverages Federated Learning (FL) to collaboratively train a query similarity model without violating user privacy. By placing a local cache in each user's device and using FL, MeanCache reduces the latency and costs and enhances model performance, resulting in lower false hit rates. MeanCache also encodes context chains for every cached query, offering a simple yet highly effective mechanism to discern contextual query responses from standalone. Our experiments benchmarked against the state-of-the-art caching method, reveal that MeanCache attains an approximately 17% higher F-score and a 20% increase in precision during semantic cache hit-and-miss decisions while performing even better on contextual queries. It also reduces the storage requirement by 83% and accelerates semantic cache hit-and-miss decisions by 11%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuda Song, Gokul Swamy, Aarti Singh, J. Andrew Bagnell, Wen Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning from human preference data has emerged as the dominant paradigm for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). The two most common families of techniques -- online reinforcement learning (RL) such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and offline contrastive methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) -- were positioned as equivalent in prior work due to the fact that both have to start from the same offline preference dataset. To further expand our theoretical understanding of the similarities and differences between online and offline techniques for preference fine-tuning, we conduct a rigorous analysis through the lens of dataset coverage, a concept that captures how the training data covers the test distribution and is widely used in RL. We prove that a global coverage condition is both necessary and sufficient for offline contrastive methods to converge to the optimal policy, but a weaker partial coverage condition suffices for online RL methods. This separation provides one explanation of why online RL methods can perform better than offline methods, especially when the offline preference data is not diverse enough. Finally, motivated by our preceding theoretical observations, we derive a hybrid preference optimization (HyPO) algorithm that uses offline data for contrastive-based preference optimization and online data for KL regularization. Theoretically and empirically, we demonstrate that HyPO is more performant than its pure offline counterpart DPO, while still preserving its computation and memory efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hejie Cui, Lingjun Mao, Xin Liang, Jieyu Zhang, Hui Ren, Quanzheng Li, Xiang Li, Carl Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal foundation models have showcased impressive capabilities in understanding and reasoning with visual and textual information. Adapting these foundation models trained for general usage to specialized domains like biomedicine requires large-scale domain-specific instruction datasets. While existing works have explored curating such datasets automatically, the resultant datasets are not explicitly aligned with domain expertise. In this work, we propose a data-centric framework, Biomedical Visual Instruction Tuning with Clinician Preference Alignment (BioMed-VITAL), that incorporates clinician preferences into both stages of generating and selecting instruction data for tuning biomedical multimodal foundation models. First, during the generation stage, we prompt the GPT-4V generator with a diverse set of clinician-selected demonstrations for preference-aligned data candidate generation. Then, during the selection phase, we train a separate selection model, which explicitly distills clinician and policy-guided model preferences into a rating function to select high-quality data for medical instruction tuning. Results show that the model tuned with the instruction-following data from our method demonstrates a significant improvement in open visual chat (18.5% relatively) and medical VQA (win rate up to 81.73%). Our instruction-following data and models are available at BioMed-VITAL.github.io.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minhwa Lee, Zae Myung Kim, Vivek Khetan, Dongyeop Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have assisted humans in several writing tasks, including text revision and story generation. However, their effectiveness in supporting domain-specific writing, particularly in business contexts, is relatively less explored. Our formative study with industry professionals revealed the limitations in current LLMs' understanding of the nuances in such domain-specific writing. To address this gap, we propose an approach of human-AI collaborative taxonomy development to perform as a guideline for domain-specific writing assistants. This method integrates iterative feedback from domain experts and multiple interactions between these experts and LLMs to refine the taxonomy. Through larger-scale experiments, we aim to validate this methodology and thus improve LLM-powered writing assistance, tailoring it to meet the unique requirements of different stakeholder needs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nathan Herr, Fernando Acero, Roberta Raileanu, Mar\'ia P\'erez-Ortiz, Zhibin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been increasingly used in real-world settings, yet their strategic abilities remain largely unexplored. Game theory provides a good framework for assessing the decision-making abilities of LLMs in interactions with other agents. Although prior studies have shown that LLMs can solve these tasks with carefully curated prompts, they fail when the problem setting or prompt changes. In this work we investigate LLMs' behaviour in strategic games, Stag Hunt and Prisoner Dilemma, analyzing performance variations under different settings and prompts. Our results show that the tested state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit at least one of the following systematic biases: (1) positional bias, (2) payoff bias, or (3) behavioural bias. Subsequently, we observed that the LLMs' performance drops when the game configuration is misaligned with the affecting biases. Performance is assessed based on the selection of the correct action, one which agrees with the prompted preferred behaviours of both players. Alignment refers to whether the LLM's bias aligns with the correct action. For example, GPT-4o's average performance drops by 34% when misaligned. Additionally, the current trend of "bigger and newer is better" does not hold for the above, where GPT-4o (the current best-performing LLM) suffers the most substantial performance drop. Lastly, we note that while chain-of-thought prompting does reduce the effect of the biases on most models, it is far from solving the problem at the fundamental level.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaowen Wang, Linxi Yu, Jian Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning large-scale pretrained models is prohibitively expensive in terms of computational and memory costs. LoRA, as one of the most popular Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, offers a cost-effective alternative by fine-tuning an auxiliary low-rank model that has significantly fewer parameters. Although LoRA reduces the computational and memory requirements significantly at each iteration, extensive empirical evidence indicates that it converges at a considerably slower rate compared to full fine-tuning, ultimately leading to increased overall compute and often worse test performance. In our paper, we perform an in-depth investigation of the initialization method of LoRA and show that careful initialization (without any change of the architecture and the training algorithm) can significantly enhance both efficiency and performance. In particular, we introduce a novel initialization method, LoRA-GA (Low Rank Adaptation with Gradient Approximation), which aligns the gradients of low-rank matrix product with those of full fine-tuning at the first step. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that LoRA-GA achieves a convergence rate comparable to that of full fine-tuning (hence being significantly faster than vanilla LoRA as well as various recent improvements) while simultaneously attaining comparable or even better performance. For example, on the subset of the GLUE dataset with T5-Base, LoRA-GA outperforms LoRA by 5.69% on average. On larger models such as Llama 2-7B, LoRA-GA shows performance improvements of 0.34, 11.52%, and 5.05% on MT-bench, GSM8K, and Human-eval, respectively. Additionally, we observe up to 2-4 times convergence speed improvement compared to vanilla LoRA, validating its effectiveness in accelerating convergence and enhancing model performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Morris Alper, Hadar Averbuch-Elor</p>
<p>Abstract: While recent vision-and-language models (VLMs) like CLIP are a powerful tool for analyzing text and images in a shared semantic space, they do not explicitly model the hierarchical nature of the set of texts which may describe an image. Conversely, existing multimodal hierarchical representation learning methods require costly training from scratch, failing to leverage the knowledge encoded by state-of-the-art multimodal foundation models. In this work, we study the knowledge of existing foundation models, finding that they exhibit emergent understanding of visual-semantic hierarchies despite not being directly trained for this purpose. We propose the Radial Embedding (RE) framework for probing and optimizing hierarchical understanding, and contribute the HierarCaps dataset, a benchmark facilitating the study of hierarchical knowledge in image--text representations, constructed automatically via large language models. Our results show that foundation VLMs exhibit zero-shot hierarchical understanding, surpassing the performance of prior models explicitly designed for this purpose. Furthermore, we show that foundation models may be better aligned to hierarchical reasoning via a text-only fine-tuning phase, while retaining pretraining knowledge.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10718">Sibyl: Simple yet Effective Agent Framework for Complex Real-world Reasoning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yulong Wang, Tianhao Shen, Lifeng Liu, Jian Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing agents based on large language models (LLMs) demonstrate robust problem-solving capabilities by integrating LLMs' inherent knowledge, strong in-context learning and zero-shot capabilities, and the use of tools combined with intricately designed LLM invocation workflows by humans. However, these agents still exhibit shortcomings in long-term reasoning and under-use the potential of existing tools, leading to noticeable deficiencies in complex real-world reasoning scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce Sibyl, a simple yet powerful LLM-based agent framework designed to tackle complex reasoning tasks by efficiently leveraging a minimal set of tools. Drawing inspiration from Global Workspace Theory, Sibyl incorporates a global workspace to enhance the management and sharing of knowledge and conversation history throughout the system. Furthermore, guided by Society of Mind Theory, Sibyl implements a multi-agent debate-based jury to self-refine the final answers, ensuring a comprehensive and balanced approach. This approach aims to reduce system complexity while expanding the scope of problems solvable-from matters typically resolved by humans in minutes to those requiring hours or even days, thus facilitating a shift from System-1 to System-2 thinking. Sibyl has been designed with a focus on scalability and ease of debugging by incorporating the concept of reentrancy from functional programming from its inception, with the aim of seamless and low effort integration in other LLM applications to improve capabilities. Our experimental results on the GAIA benchmark test set reveal that the Sibyl agent instantiated with GPT-4 achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average score of 34.55%, compared to other agents based on GPT-4. We hope that Sibyl can inspire more reliable and reusable LLM-based agent solutions to address complex real-world reasoning tasks.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10735">Transforming Agency. On the mode of existence of Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xabier E. Barandiaran, Lola S. Almendros</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates the ontological characterization of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. Between inflationary and deflationary accounts, we pay special attention to their status as agents. This requires explaining in detail the architecture, processing, and training procedures that enable LLMs to display their capacities, and the extensions used to turn LLMs into agent-like systems. After a systematic analysis we conclude that a LLM fails to meet necessary and sufficient conditions for autonomous agency in the light of embodied theories of mind: the individuality condition (it is not the product of its own activity, it is not even directly affected by it), the normativity condition (it does not generate its own norms or goals), and, partially the interactional asymmetry condition (it is not the origin and sustained source of its interaction with the environment). If not agents, then ... what are LLMs? We argue that ChatGPT should be characterized as an interlocutor or linguistic automaton, a library-that-talks, devoid of (autonomous) agency, but capable to engage performatively on non-purposeful yet purpose-structured and purpose-bounded tasks. When interacting with humans, a "ghostly" component of the human-machine interaction makes it possible to enact genuine conversational experiences with LLMs. Despite their lack of sensorimotor and biological embodiment, LLMs textual embodiment (the training corpus) and resource-hungry computational embodiment, significantly transform existing forms of human agency. Beyond assisted and extended agency, the LLM-human coupling can produce midtended forms of agency, closer to the production of intentional agency than to the extended instrumentality of any previous technologies.</p>
