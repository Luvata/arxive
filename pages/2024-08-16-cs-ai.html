<p><b>Authors:</b> Majid Ghasemi, Amir Hossein Moosavi, Ibrahim Sorkhoh, Anjali Agrawal, Fadi Alzhouri, Dariush Ebrahimi</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) which focuses on training agents to make decisions by interacting with their environment to maximize cumulative rewards. An overview of RL is provided in this paper, which discusses its core concepts, methodologies, recent trends, and resources for learning. We provide a detailed explanation of key components of RL such as states, actions, policies, and reward signals so that the reader can build a foundational understanding. The paper also provides examples of various RL algorithms, including model-free and model-based methods. In addition, RL algorithms are introduced and resources for learning and implementing them are provided, such as books, courses, and online communities. This paper demystifies a comprehensive yet simple introduction for beginners by offering a structured and clear pathway for acquiring and implementing real-time techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alessandro Berti, Mayssa Maatallah, Urszula Jessen, Michal Sroka, Sonia Ayachi Ghannouchi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful conversational interfaces, and their application in process mining (PM) tasks has shown promising results. However, state-of-the-art LLMs struggle with complex scenarios that demand advanced reasoning capabilities. In the literature, two primary approaches have been proposed for implementing PM using LLMs: providing textual insights based on a textual abstraction of the process mining artifact, and generating code executable on the original artifact. This paper proposes utilizing the AI-Based Agents Workflow (AgWf) paradigm to enhance the effectiveness of PM on LLMs. This approach allows for: i) the decomposition of complex tasks into simpler workflows, and ii) the integration of deterministic tools with the domain knowledge of LLMs. We examine various implementations of AgWf and the types of AI-based tasks involved. Additionally, we discuss the CrewAI implementation framework and present examples related to process mining.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Isma\"il Baaj</p>
<p>Abstract: In this article, we introduce a method for learning a capacity underlying a Sugeno integral according to training data based on systems of fuzzy relational equations. To the training data, we associate two systems of equations: a $\max-\min$ system and a $\min-\max$ system. By solving these two systems (in the case that they are consistent) using Sanchez's results, we show that we can directly obtain the extremal capacities representing the training data. By reducing the $\max-\min$ (resp. $\min-\max$) system of equations to subsets of criteria of cardinality less than or equal to $q$ (resp. of cardinality greater than or equal to $n-q$), where $n$ is the number of criteria, we give a sufficient condition for deducing, from its potential greatest solution (resp. its potential lowest solution), a $q$-maxitive (resp. $q$-minitive) capacity. Finally, if these two reduced systems of equations are inconsistent, we show how to obtain the greatest approximate $q$-maxitive capacity and the lowest approximate $q$-minitive capacity, using recent results to handle the inconsistency of systems of fuzzy relational equations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lachlan McGinness, Peter Baumgartner</p>
<p>Abstract: FOLD-RM is an explainable machine learning classification algorithm that uses training data to create a set of classification rules. In this paper we introduce CON-FOLD which extends FOLD-RM in several ways. CON-FOLD assigns probability-based confidence scores to rules learned for a classification task. This allows users to know how confident they should be in a prediction made by the model. We present a confidence-based pruning algorithm that uses the unique structure of FOLD-RM rules to efficiently prune rules and prevent overfitting. Furthermore, CON-FOLD enables the user to provide pre-existing knowledge in the form of logic program rules that are either (fixed) background knowledge or (modifiable) initial rule candidates. The paper describes our method in detail and reports on practical experiments. We demonstrate the performance of the algorithm on benchmark datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. For that, we introduce a new metric, Inverse Brier Score, to evaluate the accuracy of the produced confidence scores. Finally we apply this extension to a real world example that requires explainability: marking of student responses to a short answer question from the Australian Physics Olympiad.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07877">IReCa: Intrinsic Reward-enhanced Context-aware Reinforcement Learning for Human-AI Coordination</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Hao, Bahareh Nakisa, Mohmmad Naim Rastgoo, Richard Dazeley</p>
<p>Abstract: In human-AI coordination scenarios, human agents usually exhibit asymmetric behaviors that are significantly sparse and unpredictable compared to those of AI agents. These characteristics introduce two primary challenges to human-AI coordination: the effectiveness of obtaining sparse rewards and the efficiency of training the AI agents. To tackle these challenges, we propose an Intrinsic Reward-enhanced Context-aware (IReCa) reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm, which leverages intrinsic rewards to facilitate the acquisition of sparse rewards and utilizes environmental context to enhance training efficiency. Our IReCa RL algorithm introduces three unique features: (i) it encourages the exploration of sparse rewards by incorporating intrinsic rewards that supplement traditional extrinsic rewards from the environment; (ii) it improves the acquisition of sparse rewards by prioritizing the corresponding sparse state-action pairs; and (iii) it enhances the training efficiency by optimizing the exploration and exploitation through innovative context-aware weights of extrinsic and intrinsic rewards. Extensive simulations executed in the Overcooked layouts demonstrate that our IReCa RL algorithm can increase the accumulated rewards by approximately 20% and reduce the epochs required for convergence by approximately 67% compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shunyu Yao, Mitchy Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: The Rubix Cube is a 3-dimensional single-player combination puzzle attracting attention in the reinforcement learning community. A Rubix Cube has six faces and twelve possible actions, leading to a small and unconstrained action space and a very large state space with only one goal state. Modeling such a large state space and storing the information of each state requires exceptional computational resources, which makes it challenging to find the shortest solution to a scrambled Rubix cube with limited resources. The Rubix Cube can be represented as a graph, where states of the cube are nodes and actions are edges. Drawing on graph convolutional networks, we design a new heuristic, weighted convolutional distance, for A star search algorithm to find the solution to a scrambled Rubix Cube. This heuristic utilizes the information of neighboring nodes and convolves them with attention-like weights, which creates a deeper search for the shortest path to the solved state.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Changyu Du, Sebastian Esser, Stavros Nousias, Andr\'e Borrmann</p>
<p>Abstract: The conventional BIM authoring process typically requires designers to master complex and tedious modeling commands in order to materialize their design intentions within BIM authoring tools. This additional cognitive burden complicates the design process and hinders the adoption of BIM and model-based design in the AEC (Architecture, Engineering, and Construction) industry. To facilitate the expression of design intentions more intuitively, we propose Text2BIM, an LLM-based multi-agent framework that can generate 3D building models from natural language instructions. This framework orchestrates multiple LLM agents to collaborate and reason, transforming textual user input into imperative code that invokes the BIM authoring tool's APIs, thereby generating editable BIM models with internal layouts, external envelopes, and semantic information directly in the software. Furthermore, a rule-based model checker is introduced into the agentic workflow, utilizing predefined domain knowledge to guide the LLM agents in resolving issues within the generated models and iteratively improving model quality. Extensive experiments were conducted to compare and analyze the performance of three different LLMs under the proposed framework. The evaluation results demonstrate that our approach can effectively generate high-quality, structurally rational building models that are aligned with the abstract concepts specified by user input. Finally, an interactive software prototype was developed to integrate the framework into the BIM authoring software Vectorworks, showcasing the potential of modeling by chatting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hamied Nabizada, Tom Jeleniewski, Felix Gehlhoff, Alexander Fay</p>
<p>Abstract: Manually creating Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) descriptions is difficult, error-prone, and requires extensive expert knowledge. However, this knowledge is already embedded in engineering models and can be reused. Therefore, this contribution presents a comprehensive workflow for the automated generation of PDDL descriptions from integrated system and product models. The proposed workflow leverages Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) to organize and manage system and product information, translating it automatically into PDDL syntax for planning purposes. By connecting system and product models with planning aspects, it ensures that changes in these models are quickly reflected in updated PDDL descriptions, facilitating efficient and adaptable planning processes. The workflow is validated within a use case from aircraft assembly.</p>

<p>Abstract: Answer set programming is a well-understood and established problem-solving and knowledge representation paradigm. It has become more prominent amongst a wider audience due to its multiple applications in science and industry. The constant development of advanced programming and modeling techniques extends the toolset for developers and users regularly. This paper demonstrates different techniques to reuse logic program parts (multi-shot) by solving the arcade game snake. This game is particularly interesting because a victory can be assured by solving the underlying NP-hard problem of Hamiltonian Cycles. We will demonstrate five hands-on implementations in clingo and compare their performance in an empirical evaluation. In addition, our implementation utilizes clingraph to generate a simple yet informative image representation of the game's progress.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuqicheng Zhu, Nico Potyka, Mojtaba Nayyeri, Bo Xiong, Yunjie He, Evgeny Kharlamov, Steffen Staab</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models are often used to predict missing links for knowledge graphs (KGs). However, multiple KG embeddings can perform almost equally well for link prediction yet suggest conflicting predictions for certain queries, termed \textit{predictive multiplicity} in literature. This behavior poses substantial risks for KGE-based applications in high-stake domains but has been overlooked in KGE research. In this paper, we define predictive multiplicity in link prediction. We introduce evaluation metrics and measure predictive multiplicity for representative KGE methods on commonly used benchmark datasets. Our empirical study reveals significant predictive multiplicity in link prediction, with $8\%$ to $39\%$ testing queries exhibiting conflicting predictions. To address this issue, we propose leveraging voting methods from social choice theory, significantly mitigating conflicts by $66\%$ to $78\%$ according to our experiments.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08230">Explaining an Agent&#x27;s Future Beliefs through Temporally Decomposing Future Reward Estimators</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Mark Towers, Yali Du, Christopher Freeman, Timothy J. Norman</p>
<p>Abstract: Future reward estimation is a core component of reinforcement learning agents; i.e., Q-value and state-value functions, predicting an agent's sum of future rewards. Their scalar output, however, obfuscates when or what individual future rewards an agent may expect to receive. We address this by modifying an agent's future reward estimator to predict their next N expected rewards, referred to as Temporal Reward Decomposition (TRD). This unlocks novel explanations of agent behaviour. Through TRD we can: estimate when an agent may expect to receive a reward, the value of the reward and the agent's confidence in receiving it; measure an input feature's temporal importance to the agent's action decisions; and predict the influence of different actions on future rewards. Furthermore, we show that DQN agents trained on Atari environments can be efficiently retrained to incorporate TRD with minimal impact on performance.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08248">Conformalized Answer Set Prediction for Knowledge Graph Embedding</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuqicheng Zhu, Nico Potyka, Jiarong Pan, Bo Xiong, Yunjie He, Evgeny Kharlamov, Steffen Staab</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge graph embeddings (KGE) apply machine learning methods on knowledge graphs (KGs) to provide non-classical reasoning capabilities based on similarities and analogies. The learned KG embeddings are typically used to answer queries by ranking all potential answers, but rankings often lack a meaningful probabilistic interpretation - lower-ranked answers do not necessarily have a lower probability of being true. This limitation makes it difficult to distinguish plausible from implausible answers, posing challenges for the application of KGE methods in high-stakes domains like medicine. We address this issue by applying the theory of conformal prediction that allows generating answer sets, which contain the correct answer with probabilistic guarantees. We explain how conformal prediction can be used to generate such answer sets for link prediction tasks. Our empirical evaluation on four benchmark datasets using six representative KGE methods validates that the generated answer sets satisfy the probabilistic guarantees given by the theory of conformal prediction. We also demonstrate that the generated answer sets often have a sensible size and that the size adapts well with respect to the difficulty of the query.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we explore the capabilities of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 3 Opus, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Llama 3, and Llama 3.1 in solving some selected undergraduate-level transportation engineering problems. We introduce TransportBench, a benchmark dataset that includes a sample of transportation engineering problems on a wide range of subjects in the context of planning, design, management, and control of transportation systems. This dataset is used by human experts to evaluate the capabilities of various commercial and open-sourced LLMs, especially their accuracy, consistency, and reasoning behaviors, in solving transportation engineering problems. Our comprehensive analysis uncovers the unique strengths and limitations of each LLM, e.g. our analysis shows the impressive accuracy and some unexpected inconsistent behaviors of Claude 3.5 Sonnet in solving TransportBench problems. Our study marks a thrilling first step toward harnessing artificial general intelligence for complex transportation challenges.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akriti Verma, Shama Islam, Valeh Moghaddam, Adnan Anwar, Sharon Horwood</p>
<p>Abstract: Interpersonal communication plays a key role in managing people's emotions, especially on digital platforms. Studies have shown that people use social media and consume online content to regulate their emotions and find support for rest and recovery. However, these platforms are not designed for emotion regulation, which limits their effectiveness in this regard. To address this issue, we propose an approach to enhance Interpersonal Emotion Regulation (IER) on online platforms through content recommendation. The objective is to empower users to regulate their emotions while actively or passively engaging in online platforms by crafting media content that aligns with IER strategies, particularly empathic responding. The proposed recommendation system is expected to blend system-initiated and user-initiated emotion regulation, paving the way for real-time IER practices on digital media platforms. To assess the efficacy of this approach, a mixed-method research design is used, including the analysis of text-based social media data and a user survey. Digital applications has served as facilitators in this process, given the widespread recognition of digital media applications for Digital Emotion Regulation (DER). The study collects 37.5K instances of user posts and interactions on Reddit over a year to design a Contextual Multi-Armed Bandits (CMAB) based recommendation system using features from user activity and preferences. The experimentation shows that the empathic recommendations generated by the proposed recommendation system are preferred by users over widely accepted ER strategies such as distraction and avoidance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sara AlMahri, Liming Xu, Alexandra Brintrup</p>
<p>Abstract: In today's globalized economy, comprehensive supply chain visibility is crucial for effective risk management. Achieving visibility remains a significant challenge due to limited information sharing among supply chain partners. This paper presents a novel framework leveraging Knowledge Graphs (KGs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance supply chain visibility without relying on direct stakeholder information sharing. Our zero-shot, LLM-driven approach automates the extraction of supply chain information from diverse public sources and constructs KGs to capture complex interdependencies between supply chain entities. We employ zero-shot prompting for Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relation Extraction (RE) tasks, eliminating the need for extensive domain-specific training. We validate the framework with a case study on electric vehicle supply chains, focusing on tracking critical minerals for battery manufacturing. Results show significant improvements in supply chain mapping, extending visibility beyond tier-2 suppliers. The framework reveals critical dependencies and alternative sourcing options, enhancing risk management and strategic planning. With high accuracy in NER and RE tasks, it provides an effective tool for understanding complex, multi-tiered supply networks. This research offers a scalable, flexible method for constructing domain-specific supply chain KGs, addressing longstanding challenges in visibility and paving the way for advancements in digital supply chain surveillance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Training data sets intended for unsupervised anomaly detection, typically presumed to be anomaly-free, often contain anomalies (or contamination), a challenge that significantly undermines model performance. Most robust unsupervised anomaly detection models rely on contamination ratio information to tackle contamination. However, in reality, contamination ratio may be inaccurate. We investigate on the impact of inaccurate contamination ratio information in robust unsupervised anomaly detection. We verify whether they are resilient to misinformed contamination ratios. Our investigation on 6 benchmark data sets reveals that such models are not adversely affected by exposure to misinformation. In fact, they can exhibit improved performance when provided with such inaccurate contamination ratios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Symbolic regression is a task aimed at identifying patterns in data and representing them through mathematical expressions, generally involving skeleton prediction and constant optimization. Many methods have achieved some success, however they treat variables and symbols merely as characters of natural language without considering their mathematical essence. This paper introduces the operator feature neural network (OF-Net) which employs operator representation for expressions and proposes an implicit feature encoding method for the intrinsic mathematical operational logic of operators. By substituting operator features for numeric loss, we can predict the combination of operators of target expressions. We evaluate the model on public datasets, and the results demonstrate that the model achieves superior recovery rates and high $R^2$ scores. With the discussion of the results, we analyze the merit and demerit of OF-Net and propose optimizing schemes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikita Makarov, Santhanakrishnan Narayanan, Constantinos Antoniou</p>
<p>Abstract: As the complexities of urban environments continue to grow, the modelling of transportation systems become increasingly challenging. This paper explores the application of advanced Graph Neural Network (GNN) architectures as surrogate models for strategic transport planning. Building upon a prior work that laid the foundation with graph convolution networks (GCN), our study delves into the comparative analysis of established GCN with the more expressive Graph Attention Network (GAT). Additionally, we propose a novel GAT variant (namely GATv3) to address over-smoothing issues in graph-based models. Our investigation also includes the exploration of a hybrid model combining both GCN and GAT architectures, aiming to investigate the performance of the mixture. The three models are applied to various experiments to understand their limits. We analyse hierarchical regression setups, combining classification and regression tasks, and introduce fine-grained classification with a proposal of a method to convert outputs to precise values. Results reveal the superior performance of the new GAT in classification tasks. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first GAT model in literature to achieve larger depths. Surprisingly, the fine-grained classification task demonstrates the GCN's unexpected dominance with additional training data. This shows that synthetic data generators can increase the training data, without overfitting issues whilst improving model performance. In conclusion, this research advances GNN based surrogate modelling, providing insights for refining GNN architectures. The findings open avenues for investigating the potential of the newly proposed GAT architecture and the modelling setups for other transportation problems.</p>

Current attribution algorithms typically evaluate the importance of each parameter by exploring the sample space. A large number of intermediate states are introduced during the exploration process, which may reach the model's Out-of-Distribution (OOD) space. Such intermediate states will impact the attribution results, making it challenging to grasp the relative importance of features. In this paper, we firstly define the local space and its relevant properties, and we propose the Local Attribution (LA) algorithm that leverages these properties. The LA algorithm comprises both targeted and untargeted exploration phases, which are designed to effectively generate intermediate states for attribution that thoroughly encompass the local space. Compared to the state-of-the-art attribution methods, our approach achieves an average improvement of 38.21\% in attribution effectiveness. Extensive ablation studies in our experiments also validate the significance of each component in our algorithm. Our code is available at: https://github.com/LMBTough/LA/</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tiancheng Shi, Yuanchen Wei, John R. Kender</p>
<p>Abstract: We demonstrate the efficiencies and explanatory abilities of extensions to the common tools of Autoencoders and LLM interpreters, in the novel context of comparing different cultural approaches to the same international news event. We develop a new Convolutional-Recurrent Variational Autoencoder (CRVAE) model that extends the modalities of previous CVAE models, by using fully-connected latent layers to embed in parallel the CNN encodings of video frames, together with the LSTM encodings of their related text derived from audio. We incorporate the model within a larger system that includes frame-caption alignment, latent space vector clustering, and a novel LLM-based cluster interpreter. We measure, tune, and apply this system to the task of summarizing a video into three to five thematic clusters, with each theme described by ten LLM-produced phrases. We apply this system to two news topics, COVID-19 and the Winter Olympics, and five other topics are in progress.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akane Sano, Judith Amores, Mary Czerwinski</p>
<p>Abstract: We explore the application of large language models (LLMs), pre-trained models with massive textual data for detecting and improving these altered states. We investigate the use of LLMs to estimate attention states, sleep stages, and sleep quality and generate sleep improvement suggestions and adaptive guided imagery scripts based on electroencephalogram (EEG) and physical activity data (e.g. waveforms, power spectrogram images, numerical features). Our results show that LLMs can estimate sleep quality based on human textual behavioral features and provide personalized sleep improvement suggestions and guided imagery scripts; however detecting attention, sleep stages, and sleep quality based on EEG and activity data requires further training data and domain-specific knowledge.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyang Lu, Qinghan Chen, Zhimin Yuan, Ming Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Scene flow, which provides the 3D motion field of the first frame from two consecutive point clouds, is vital for dynamic scene perception. However, contemporary scene flow methods face three major challenges. Firstly, they lack global flow embedding or only consider the context of individual point clouds before embedding, leading to embedded points struggling to perceive the consistent semantic relationship of another frame. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach called Dual Cross Attentive (DCA) for the latent fusion and alignment between two frames based on semantic contexts. This is then integrated into Global Fusion Flow Embedding (GF) to initialize flow embedding based on global correlations in both contextual and Euclidean spaces. Secondly, deformations exist in non-rigid objects after the warping layer, which distorts the spatiotemporal relation between the consecutive frames. For a more precise estimation of residual flow at next-level, the Spatial Temporal Re-embedding (STR) module is devised to update the point sequence features at current-level. Lastly, poor generalization is often observed due to the significant domain gap between synthetic and LiDAR-scanned datasets. We leverage novel domain adaptive losses to effectively bridge the gap of motion inference from synthetic to real-world. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across various datasets, with particularly outstanding results in real-world LiDAR-scanned situations. Our code will be released upon publication.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Carlos Toxtli, Christopher Curtis, Saiph Savage</p>
<p>Abstract: Crowdsourcing markets are expanding worldwide, but often feature standardized interfaces that ignore the cultural diversity of their workers, negatively impacting their well-being and productivity. To transform these workplace dynamics, this paper proposes creating culturally-aware workplace tools, specifically designed to adapt to the cultural dimensions of monochronic and polychronic work styles. We illustrate this approach with "CultureFit," a tool that we engineered based on extensive research in Chronemics and culture theories. To study and evaluate our tool in the real world, we conducted a field experiment with 55 workers from 24 different countries. Our field experiment revealed that CultureFit significantly improved the earnings of workers from cultural backgrounds often overlooked in design. Our study is among the pioneering efforts to examine culturally aware digital labor interventions. It also provides access to a dataset with over two million data points on culture and digital work, which can be leveraged for future research in this emerging field. The paper concludes by discussing the importance and future possibilities of incorporating cultural insights into the design of tools for digital labor.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuanqing Yu, Wangtao Sun, Jingwei Li, Kang Liu, Chengbao Liu, Jie Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: In the realm of event prediction, temporal knowledge graph forecasting (TKGF) stands as a pivotal technique. Previous approaches face the challenges of not utilizing experience during testing and relying on a single short-term history, which limits adaptation to evolving data. In this paper, we introduce the Online Neural-Symbolic Event Prediction (ONSEP) framework, which innovates by integrating dynamic causal rule mining (DCRM) and dual history augmented generation (DHAG). DCRM dynamically constructs causal rules from real-time data, allowing for swift adaptation to new causal relationships. In parallel, DHAG merges short-term and long-term historical contexts, leveraging a bi-branch approach to enrich event prediction. Our framework demonstrates notable performance enhancements across diverse datasets, with significant Hit@k (k=1,3,10) improvements, showcasing its ability to augment large language models (LLMs) for event prediction without necessitating extensive retraining. The ONSEP framework not only advances the field of TKGF but also underscores the potential of neural-symbolic approaches in adapting to dynamic data environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Machine learning has driven an exponential increase in computational demand, leading to massive data centers that consume significant amounts of energy and contribute to climate change. This makes sustainable data center control a priority. In this paper, we introduce SustainDC, a set of Python environments for benchmarking multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms for data centers (DC). SustainDC supports custom DC configurations and tasks such as workload scheduling, cooling optimization, and auxiliary battery management, with multiple agents managing these operations while accounting for the effects of each other. We evaluate various MARL algorithms on SustainDC, showing their performance across diverse DC designs, locations, weather conditions, grid carbon intensity, and workload requirements. Our results highlight significant opportunities for improvement of data center operations using MARL algorithms. Given the increasing use of DC due to AI, SustainDC provides a crucial platform for the development and benchmarking of advanced algorithms essential for achieving sustainable computing and addressing other heterogeneous real-world challenges.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Musa Taib, Jiajun Wu, Steve Drew, Geoffrey G. Messier</p>
<p>Abstract: The top priority of a Housing and Homelessness System of Care (HHSC) is to connect people experiencing homelessness to supportive housing. An HHSC typically consists of many agencies serving the same population. Information technology platforms differ in type and quality between agencies, so their data are usually isolated from one agency to another. Larger agencies may have sufficient data to train and test artificial intelligence (AI) tools but smaller agencies typically do not. To address this gap, we introduce a Federated Learning (FL) approach enabling all agencies to train a predictive model collaboratively without sharing their sensitive data. We demonstrate how FL can be used within an HHSC to provide all agencies equitable access to quality AI and further assist human decision-makers in the allocation of resources within HHSC. This is achieved while preserving the privacy of the people within the data by not sharing identifying information between agencies without their consent. Our experimental results using real-world HHSC data from Calgary, Alberta, demonstrate that our FL approach offers comparable performance with the idealized scenario of training the predictive model with data fully shared and linked between agencies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrea Lops, Fedelucio Narducci, Azzurra Ragone, Michelantonio Trizio, Claudio Bartolini</p>
<p>Abstract: Unit tests represent the most basic level of testing within the software testing lifecycle and are crucial to ensuring software correctness. Designing and creating unit tests is a costly and labor-intensive process that is ripe for automation. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been applied to various aspects of software development, including unit test generation. Although several empirical studies evaluating LLMs' capabilities in test code generation exist, they primarily focus on simple scenarios, such as the straightforward generation of unit tests for individual methods. These evaluations often involve independent and small-scale test units, providing a limited view of LLMs' performance in real-world software development scenarios. Moreover, previous studies do not approach the problem at a suitable scale for real-life applications. Generated unit tests are often evaluated via manual integration into the original projects, a process that limits the number of tests executed and reduces overall efficiency. To address these gaps, we have developed an approach for generating and evaluating more real-life complexity test suites. Our approach focuses on class-level test code generation and automates the entire process from test generation to test assessment. In this work, we present \textsc{AgoneTest}: an automated system for generating test suites for Java projects and a comprehensive and principled methodology for evaluating the generated test suites. Starting from a state-of-the-art dataset (i.e., \textsc{Methods2Test}), we built a new dataset for comparing human-written tests with those generated by LLMs. Our key contributions include a scalable automated software system, a new dataset, and a detailed methodology for evaluating test quality.</p>

<p>Abstract: Speech emotion recognition (SER) has made significant strides with the advent of powerful self-supervised learning (SSL) models. However, the generalization of these models to diverse languages and emotional expressions remains a challenge. We propose a large-scale benchmark to evaluate the robustness and adaptability of state-of-the-art SER models in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings. Our benchmark includes a diverse set of multilingual datasets, focusing on less commonly used corpora to assess generalization to new data. We employ logit adjustment to account for varying class distributions and establish a single dataset cluster for systematic evaluation. Surprisingly, we find that the Whisper model, primarily designed for automatic speech recognition, outperforms dedicated SSL models in cross-lingual SER. Our results highlight the need for more robust and generalizable SER models, and our benchmark serves as a valuable resource to drive future research in this direction.</p>

<p>Abstract: While many capabilities of language models (LMs) improve with increased training budget, the influence of scale on hallucinations is not yet fully understood. Hallucinations come in many forms, and there is no universally accepted definition. We thus focus on studying only those hallucinations where a correct answer appears verbatim in the training set. To fully control the training data content, we construct a knowledge graph (KG)-based dataset, and use it to train a set of increasingly large LMs. We find that for a fixed dataset, larger and longer-trained LMs hallucinate less. However, hallucinating on $\leq5$% of the training data requires an order of magnitude larger model, and thus an order of magnitude more compute, than Hoffmann et al. (2022) reported was optimal. Given this costliness, we study how hallucination detectors depend on scale. While we see detector size improves performance on fixed LM's outputs, we find an inverse relationship between the scale of the LM and the detectability of its hallucinations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Text has become the predominant form of communication on social media, embedding a wealth of emotional nuances. Consequently, the extraction of emotional information from text is of paramount importance. Despite previous research making some progress, existing text sentiment analysis models still face challenges in integrating diverse semantic information and lack interpretability. To address these issues, we propose a quantum-inspired deep learning architecture that combines fundamental principles of quantum mechanics (QM principles) with deep learning models for text sentiment analysis. Specifically, we analyze the commonalities between text representation and QM principles to design a quantum-inspired text representation method and further develop a quantum-inspired text embedding layer. Additionally, we design a feature extraction layer based on long short-term memory (LSTM) networks and self-attention mechanisms (SAMs). Finally, we calculate the text density matrix using the quantum complex numbers principle and apply 2D-convolution neural networks (CNNs) for feature condensation and dimensionality reduction. Through a series of visualization, comparative, and ablation experiments, we demonstrate that our model not only shows significant advantages in accuracy and efficiency compared to previous related models but also achieves a certain level of interpretability by integrating QM principles. Our code is available at QISA.</p>

<p>Abstract: The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) has become ubiquitous, with abundant applications in computational creativity. One such application is fictional story generation. Fiction is a narrative that occurs in a story world that is slightly different than ours. With LLMs becoming writing partners, we question how suitable they are to generate fiction. This study investigates the ability of LLMs to maintain a state of world essential to generate fiction. Through a series of questions to nine LLMs, we find that only two models exhibit consistent worldview, while the rest are self-conflicting. Subsequent analysis of stories generated by four models revealed a strikingly uniform narrative pattern. This uniformity across models further suggests a lack of `state' necessary for fiction. We highlight the limitations of current LLMs in fiction writing and advocate for future research to test and create story worlds for LLMs to reside in.

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we compare the performance of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) networks on irregular or noisy functions. We control the number of parameters and the size of the training samples to ensure a fair comparison. For clarity, we categorize the functions into six types: regular functions, continuous functions with local non-differentiable points, functions with jump discontinuities, functions with singularities, functions with coherent oscillations, and noisy functions. Our experimental results indicate that KAN does not always perform best. For some types of functions, MLP outperforms or performs comparably to KAN. Furthermore, increasing the size of training samples can improve performance to some extent. When noise is added to functions, the irregular features are often obscured by the noise, making it challenging for both MLP and KAN to extract these features effectively. We hope these experiments provide valuable insights for future neural network research and encourage further investigations to overcome these challenges.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinze Sun, Yongpan Sheng, Lirong He</p>
<p>Abstract: Temporal knowledge graph reasoning (TKGR) is increasingly gaining attention for its ability to extrapolate new events from historical data, thereby enriching the inherently incomplete temporal knowledge graphs. Existing graph-based representation learning frameworks have made significant strides in developing evolving representations for both entities and relational embeddings. Despite these achievements, there's a notable tendency in these models to inadvertently learn biased data representations and mine spurious correlations, consequently failing to discern the causal relationships between events. This often leads to incorrect predictions based on these false correlations. To address this, we propose an innovative causal enhanced graph representation learning framework for TKGR (named CEGRL-TKGR). This framework introduces causal structures in graph-based representation learning to unveil the essential causal relationships between events, ultimately enhancing task performance. Specifically, we first disentangle the evolutionary representations of entities and relations in a temporal graph sequence into two distinct components, namely causal representations and confounding representations. Then, drawing on causal intervention theory, we advocate the utilization of causal representations for predictions, aiming to mitigate the effects of erroneous correlations caused by confounding features, thus achieving more robust and accurate predictions. Finally, extensive experimental results on six benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our model in the link prediction task.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent In-Context Learning based methods have achieved remarkable success in Text-to-SQL task. However, there is still a large gap between the performance of these models and human performance on datasets with complex database schema and difficult questions, such as BIRD. Besides, existing work has neglected to supervise intermediate steps when solving questions iteratively with question decomposition methods, and the schema linking methods used in these works are very rudimentary. To address these issues, we propose MAG-SQL, a multi-agent generative approach with soft schema linking and iterative Sub-SQL refinement. In our framework, an entity-based method with tables' summary is used to select the columns in database, and a novel targets-conditions decomposition method is introduced to decompose those complex questions. Additionally, we build a iterative generating module which includes a Sub-SQL Generator and Sub-SQL Refiner, introducing external oversight for each step of generation. Through a series of ablation studies, the effectiveness of each agent in our framework has been demonstrated. When evaluated on the BIRD benchmark with GPT-4, MAG-SQL achieves an execution accuracy of 61.08\%, compared to the baseline accuracy of 46.35\% for vanilla GPT-4 and the baseline accuracy of 57.56\% for MAC-SQL.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haofeng Liu, Erli Zhang, Junde Wu, Mingxuan Hong, Yueming Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Surgical video segmentation is a critical task in computer-assisted surgery and is vital for enhancing surgical quality and patient outcomes. Recently, the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) framework has shown superior advancements in image and video segmentation. However, SAM2 struggles with efficiency due to the high computational demands of processing high-resolution images and complex and long-range temporal dynamics in surgical videos. To address these challenges, we introduce Surgical SAM 2 (SurgSAM-2), an advanced model to utilize SAM2 with an Efficient Frame Pruning (EFP) mechanism, to facilitate real-time surgical video segmentation. The EFP mechanism dynamically manages the memory bank by selectively retaining only the most informative frames, reducing memory usage and computational cost while maintaining high segmentation accuracy. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that SurgSAM-2 significantly improves both efficiency and segmentation accuracy compared to the vanilla SAM2. Remarkably, SurgSAM-2 achieves a 3$\times$ FPS compared with SAM2, while also delivering state-of-the-art performance after fine-tuning with lower-resolution data. These advancements establish SurgSAM-2 as a leading model for surgical video analysis, making real-time surgical video segmentation in resource-constrained environments a feasible reality.</p>

<p>Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging technology provides the unique advantage of being able to collect data regardless of weather conditions and time. However, SAR images exhibit complex backscatter patterns and speckle noise, which necessitate expertise for interpretation. To deal with this challenge, research has been conducted on translating SAR images into optical-like representations to aid the interpretation of SAR data. Nevertheless, existing studies have predominantly utilized low-resolution satellite imagery datasets and have largely been based on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) which are known for their training instability and low fidelity. To overcome these limitations of low-resolution data usage and GAN-based approaches, this paper introduces a conditional image-to-image translation approach based on Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model (BBDM). We conducted comprehensive experiments on the MSAW dataset, a paired SAR and optical images collection of 0.5m Very-High-Resolution (VHR) images. The experimental results indicate that our method surpasses both the Conditional Diffusion Model (CDM) and the GAN-based models in diverse perceptual quality metrics.</p>

<p>Abstract: Neural networks are widely used in machine learning and data mining. Typically, these networks need to be trained, implying the adjustment of weights (parameters) within the network based on the input data. In this work, we propose a novel approach, RandomNet, that employs untrained deep neural networks to cluster time series. RandomNet uses different sets of random weights to extract diverse representations of time series and then ensembles the clustering relationships derived from these different representations to build the final clustering results. By extracting diverse representations, our model can effectively handle time series with different characteristics. Since all parameters are randomly generated, no training is required during the process. We provide a theoretical analysis of the effectiveness of the method. To validate its performance, we conduct extensive experiments on all of the 128 datasets in the well-known UCR time series archive and perform statistical analysis of the results. These datasets have different sizes, sequence lengths, and they are from diverse fields. The experimental results show that the proposed method is competitive compared with existing state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Homayoun Honari, Amir Mehdi Soufi Enayati, Mehran Ghafarian Tamizi, Homayoun Najjaran</p>
<p>Abstract: Safe Reinforcement Learning (Safe RL) is one of the prevalently studied subcategories of trial-and-error-based methods with the intention to be deployed on real-world systems. In safe RL, the goal is to maximize reward performance while minimizing constraints, often achieved by setting bounds on constraint functions and utilizing the Lagrangian method. However, deploying Lagrangian-based safe RL in real-world scenarios is challenging due to the necessity of threshold fine-tuning, as imprecise adjustments may lead to suboptimal policy convergence. To mitigate this challenge, we propose a unified Lagrangian-based model-free architecture called Meta Soft Actor-Critic Lagrangian (Meta SAC-Lag). Meta SAC-Lag uses meta-gradient optimization to automatically update the safety-related hyperparameters. The proposed method is designed to address safe exploration and threshold adjustment with minimal hyperparameter tuning requirement. In our pipeline, the inner parameters are updated through the conventional formulation and the hyperparameters are adjusted using the meta-objectives which are defined based on the updated parameters. Our results show that the agent can reliably adjust the safety performance due to the relatively fast convergence rate of the safety threshold. We evaluate the performance of Meta SAC-Lag in five simulated environments against Lagrangian baselines, and the results demonstrate its capability to create synergy between parameters, yielding better or competitive results. Furthermore, we conduct a real-world experiment involving a robotic arm tasked with pouring coffee into a cup without spillage.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiajie Li, Garrett Skinner, Gene Yang, Brian R Quaranto, Steven D Schwaitzberg, Peter C W Kim, Jinjun Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models (LLMs) have achieved notable success across various domains, while research in the medical field has largely focused on unimodal images. Meanwhile, current general-domain multimodal models for videos still lack the capabilities to understand and engage in conversations about surgical videos. One major contributing factor is the absence of datasets in the surgical field. In this paper, we create a new dataset, Surg-QA, consisting of 102,000 surgical video-instruction pairs, the largest of its kind so far. To build such a dataset, we propose a novel two-stage question-answer generation pipeline with LLM to learn surgical knowledge in a structured manner from the publicly available surgical lecture videos. The pipeline breaks down the generation process into two stages to significantly reduce the task complexity, allowing us to use a more affordable, locally deployed open-source LLM than the premium paid LLM services. It also mitigates the risk of LLM hallucinations during question-answer generation, thereby enhancing the overall quality of the generated data. We further train LLaVA-Surg, a novel vision-language conversational assistant capable of answering open-ended questions about surgical videos, on this Surg-QA dataset, and conduct comprehensive evaluations on zero-shot surgical video question-answering tasks. We show that LLaVA-Surg significantly outperforms all previous general-domain models, demonstrating exceptional multimodal conversational skills in answering open-ended questions about surgical videos. We will release our code, model, and the instruction-tuning dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hiroki Tanioka, Tetsushi Ueta, Masahiko Sano</p>
<p>Abstract: The performance of ChatGPT\copyright{} and other LLMs has improved tremendously, and in online environments, they are increasingly likely to be used in a wide variety of situations, such as ChatBot on web pages, call center operations using voice interaction, and dialogue functions using agents. In the offline environment, multimodal dialogue functions are also being realized, such as guidance by Artificial Intelligence agents (AI agents) using tablet terminals and dialogue systems in the form of LLMs mounted on robots. In this multimodal dialogue, mutual emotion recognition between the AI and the user will become important. So far, there have been methods for expressing emotions on the part of the AI agent or for recognizing them using textual or voice information of the user's utterances, but methods for AI agents to recognize emotions from the user's facial expressions have not been studied. In this study, we examined whether or not LLM-based AI agents can interact with users according to their emotional states by capturing the user in dialogue with a camera, recognizing emotions from facial expressions, and adding such emotion information to prompts. The results confirmed that AI agents can have conversations according to the emotional state for emotional states with relatively high scores, such as Happy and Angry.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to significant improvements in various natural language processing tasks. However, the evaluation of LLMs' legal knowledge, particularly in non-English languages such as Arabic, remains under-explored. To address this gap, we introduce ArabLegalEval, a multitask benchmark dataset for assessing the Arabic legal knowledge of LLMs. Inspired by the MMLU and LegalBench datasets, ArabLegalEval consists of multiple tasks sourced from Saudi legal documents and synthesized questions. In this work, we aim to analyze the capabilities required to solve legal problems in Arabic and benchmark the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs. We explore the impact of in-context learning and investigate various evaluation methods. Additionally, we explore workflows for generating questions with automatic validation to enhance the dataset's quality. We benchmark multilingual and Arabic-centric LLMs, such as GPT-4 and Jais, respectively. We also share our methodology for creating the dataset and validation, which can be generalized to other domains. We hope to accelerate AI research in the Arabic Legal domain by releasing the ArabLegalEval dataset and code: https://github.com/Thiqah/ArabLegalEval</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lukas Kirchdorfer, Cathrin Elich, Simon Kutsche, Heiner Stuckenschmidt, Lukas Schott, Jan M. K\"ohler</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rise of neural networks in various domains, multi-task learning (MTL) gained significant relevance. A key challenge in MTL is balancing individual task losses during neural network training to improve performance and efficiency through knowledge sharing across tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a novel task-weighting method by building on the most prevalent approach of Uncertainty Weighting and computing analytically optimal uncertainty-based weights, normalized by a softmax function with tunable temperature. Our approach yields comparable results to the combinatorially prohibitive, brute-force approach of Scalarization while offering a more cost-effective yet high-performing alternative. We conduct an extensive benchmark on various datasets and architectures. Our method consistently outperforms six other common weighting methods. Furthermore, we report noteworthy experimental findings for the practical application of MTL. For example, larger networks diminish the influence of weighting methods, and tuning the weight decay has a low impact compared to the learning rate.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yili Li, Jing Yu, Keke Gai, Gang Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge-based visual question answering requires external knowledge beyond visible content to answer the question correctly. One limitation of existing methods is that they focus more on modeling the inter-modal and intra-modal correlations, which entangles complex multimodal clues by implicit embeddings and lacks interpretability and generalization ability. The key challenge to solve the above problem is to separate the information and process it separately at the functional level. By reusing each processing unit, the generalization ability of the model to deal with different data can be increased. In this paper, we propose Independent Inference Units (IIU) for fine-grained multi-modal reasoning to decompose intra-modal information by the functionally independent units. Specifically, IIU processes each semantic-specific intra-modal clue by an independent inference unit, which also collects complementary information by communication from different units. To further reduce the impact of redundant information, we propose a memory update module to maintain semantic-relevant memory along with the reasoning process gradually. In comparison with existing non-pretrained multi-modal reasoning models on standard datasets, our model achieves a new state-of-the-art, enhancing performance by 3%, and surpassing basic pretrained multi-modal models. The experimental results show that our IIU model is effective in disentangling intra-modal clues as well as reasoning units to provide explainable reasoning evidence.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shengyuan Ye, Liekang Zeng, Xiaowen Chu, Guoliang Xing, Xu Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: On-device Deep Neural Network (DNN) training has been recognized as crucial for privacy-preserving machine learning at the edge. However, the intensive training workload and limited onboard computing resources pose significant challenges to the availability and efficiency of model training. While existing works address these challenges through native resource management optimization, we instead leverage our observation that edge environments usually comprise a rich set of accompanying trusted edge devices with idle resources beyond a single terminal. We propose Asteroid, a distributed edge training system that breaks the resource walls across heterogeneous edge devices for efficient model training acceleration. Asteroid adopts a hybrid pipeline parallelism to orchestrate distributed training, along with a judicious parallelism planning for maximizing throughput under certain resource constraints. Furthermore, a fault-tolerant yet lightweight pipeline replay mechanism is developed to tame the device-level dynamics for training robustness and performance stability. We implement Asteroid on heterogeneous edge devices with both vision and language models, demonstrating up to 12.2x faster training than conventional parallelism methods and 2.1x faster than state-of-the-art hybrid parallelism methods through evaluations. Furthermore, Asteroid can recover training pipeline 14x faster than baseline methods while preserving comparable throughput despite unexpected device exiting and failure.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sang-Hoon Lee, Ha-Yeong Choi, Seong-Whan Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces PeriodWave-Turbo, a high-fidelity and high-efficient waveform generation model via adversarial flow matching optimization. Recently, conditional flow matching (CFM) generative models have been successfully adopted for waveform generation tasks, leveraging a single vector field estimation objective for training. Although these models can generate high-fidelity waveform signals, they require significantly more ODE steps compared to GAN-based models, which only need a single generation step. Additionally, the generated samples often lack high-frequency information due to noisy vector field estimation, which fails to ensure high-frequency reproduction. To address this limitation, we enhance pre-trained CFM-based generative models by incorporating a fixed-step generator modification. We utilized reconstruction losses and adversarial feedback to accelerate high-fidelity waveform generation. Through adversarial flow matching optimization, it only requires 1,000 steps of fine-tuning to achieve state-of-the-art performance across various objective metrics. Moreover, we significantly reduce inference speed from 16 steps to 2 or 4 steps. Additionally, by scaling up the backbone of PeriodWave from 29M to 70M parameters for improved generalization, PeriodWave-Turbo achieves unprecedented performance, with a perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) score of 4.454 on the LibriTTS dataset.

<p>Abstract: Towards human-level visual understanding, visual commonsense generation has been introduced to generate commonsense inferences beyond images. However, current research on visual commonsense generation has overlooked an important human cognitive ability: generating descriptive and diverse inferences. In this work, we propose a novel visual commonsense generation framework, called DIVE, which aims to improve the descriptiveness and diversity of generated inferences. DIVE involves two methods, generic inference filtering and contrastive retrieval learning, which address the limitations of existing visual commonsense resources and training objectives. Experimental results verify that DIVE outperforms state-of-the-art models for visual commonsense generation in terms of both descriptiveness and diversity, while showing a superior quality in generating unique and novel inferences. Notably, DIVE achieves human-level descriptiveness and diversity on Visual Commonsense Graphs. Furthermore, human evaluations confirm that DIVE aligns closely with human judgments on descriptiveness and diversity\footnote{Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/Park-ing-lot/DIVE.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rujia Shen, Boran Wang, Chao Zhao, Yi Guan, Jingchi Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Causal discovery from time-series data aims to capture both intra-slice (contemporaneous) and inter-slice (time-lagged) causality between variables within the temporal chain, which is crucial for various scientific disciplines. Compared to causal discovery from non-time-series data, causal discovery from time-series data necessitates more serialized samples with a larger amount of observed time steps. To address the challenges, we propose a novel gradient-based causal discovery approach STIC, which focuses on \textbf{S}hort-\textbf{T}erm \textbf{I}nvariance using \textbf{C}onvolutional neural networks to uncover the causal relationships from time-series data. Specifically, STIC leverages both the short-term time and mechanism invariance of causality within each window observation, which possesses the property of independence, to enhance sample efficiency. Furthermore, we construct two causal convolution kernels, which correspond to the short-term time and mechanism invariance respectively, to estimate the window causal graph. To demonstrate the necessity of convolutional neural networks for causal discovery from time-series data, we theoretically derive the equivalence between convolution and the underlying generative principle of time-series data under the assumption that the additive noise model is identifiable. Experimental evaluations conducted on both synthetic and FMRI benchmark datasets demonstrate that our STIC outperforms baselines significantly and achieves the state-of-the-art performance, particularly when the datasets contain a limited number of observed time steps.

<p>Abstract: Unsupervised learning has become an essential building block of AI systems. The representations it produces, e.g. in foundation models, are critical to a wide variety of downstream applications. It is therefore important to carefully examine unsupervised models to ensure not only that they produce accurate predictions, but also that these predictions are not "right for the wrong reasons", the so-called Clever Hans (CH) effect. Using specially developed Explainable AI techniques, we show for the first time that CH effects are widespread in unsupervised learning. Our empirical findings are enriched by theoretical insights, which interestingly point to inductive biases in the unsupervised learning machine as a primary source of CH effects. Overall, our work sheds light on unexplored risks associated with practical applications of unsupervised learning and suggests ways to make unsupervised learning more robust.</p>

<p>Abstract: Observation of the underlying actors that generate event sequences reveals that they often evolve continuously. Most modern methods, however, tend to model such processes through at most piecewise-continuous trajectories. To address this, we adopt a way of viewing events not as standalone phenomena but instead as observations of a Gaussian Process, which in turn governs the actor's dynamics. We propose integrating these obtained dynamics, resulting in a continuous-trajectory modification of the widely successful Neural ODE model. Through Gaussian Process theory, we were able to evaluate the uncertainty in an actor's representation, which arises from not observing them between events. This estimate led us to develop a novel, theoretically backed negative feedback mechanism. Empirical studies indicate that our model with Gaussian process interpolation and negative feedback achieves state-of-the-art performance, with improvements up to 20% AUROC against similar architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stefano Woerner, Christian F. Baumgartner</p>
<p>Abstract: Data scarcity is a major limiting factor for applying modern machine learning techniques to clinical tasks. Although sufficient data exists for some well-studied medical tasks, there remains a long tail of clinically relevant tasks with poor data availability. Recently, numerous foundation models have demonstrated high suitability for few-shot learning (FSL) and zero-shot learning (ZSL), potentially making them more accessible to practitioners. However, it remains unclear which foundation model performs best on FSL medical image analysis tasks and what the optimal methods are for learning from limited data. We conducted a comprehensive benchmark study of ZSL and FSL using 16 pretrained foundation models on 19 diverse medical imaging datasets. Our results indicate that BiomedCLIP, a model pretrained exclusively on medical data, performs best on average for very small training set sizes, while very large CLIP models pretrained on LAION-2B perform best with slightly more training samples. However, simply fine-tuning a ResNet-18 pretrained on ImageNet performs similarly with more than five training examples per class. Our findings also highlight the need for further research on foundation models specifically tailored for medical applications and the collection of more datasets to train these models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Giovanni Varricchione, Natasha Alechina, Mehdi Dastani, Brian Logan</p>
<p>Abstract: Reward machines allow the definition of rewards for temporally extended tasks and behaviors. Specifying "informative" reward machines can be challenging. One way to address this is to generate reward machines from a high-level abstract description of the learning environment, using techniques such as AI planning. However, previous planning-based approaches generate a reward machine based on a single (sequential or partial-order) plan, and do not allow maximum flexibility to the learning agent. In this paper we propose a new approach to synthesising reward machines which is based on the set of partial order plans for a goal. We prove that learning using such "maximally permissive" reward machines results in higher rewards than learning using RMs based on a single plan. We present experimental results which support our theoretical claims by showing that our approach obtains higher rewards than the single-plan approach in practice.</p>

<p>Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) research typically focuses on tasks with narrowly defined objectives, but recent studies are expanding into the use of unlabeled data within larger models, aiming for a broader range of applications. This addresses a critical challenge in EEG research. For example, Kostas et al. (2021) show that self-supervised learning (SSL) outperforms traditional supervised methods. Given the high noise levels in EEG data, we argue that further improvements are possible with additional preprocessing. Current preprocessing methods often fail to efficiently manage the large data volumes required for SSL, due to their lack of optimization, reliance on subjective manual corrections, and validation processes or inflexible protocols that limit SSL. We propose a Python-based EEG preprocessing pipeline optimized for self-supervised learning, designed to efficiently process large-scale data. This optimization not only stabilizes self-supervised training but also enhances performance on downstream tasks compared to training with raw data.</p>

<p>Abstract: The forthcoming generation of wireless technology, 6G, promises a revolutionary leap beyond traditional data-centric services. It aims to usher in an era of ubiquitous intelligent services, where everything is interconnected and intelligent. This vision requires the seamless integration of three fundamental modules: Sensing for information acquisition, communication for information sharing, and computation for information processing and decision-making. These modules are intricately linked, especially in complex tasks such as edge learning and inference. However, the performance of these modules is interdependent, creating a resource competition for time, energy, and bandwidth. Existing techniques like integrated communication and computation (ICC), integrated sensing and computation (ISC), and integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) have made partial strides in addressing this challenge, but they fall short of meeting the extreme performance requirements. To overcome these limitations, it is essential to develop new techniques that comprehensively integrate sensing, communication, and computation. This integrated approach, known as Integrated Sensing, Communication, and Computation (ISCC), offers a systematic perspective for enhancing task performance. This paper begins with a comprehensive survey of historic and related techniques such as ICC, ISC, and ISAC, highlighting their strengths and limitations. It then explores the state-of-the-art signal designs for ISCC, along with network resource management strategies specifically tailored for ISCC. Furthermore, this paper discusses the exciting research opportunities that lie ahead for implementing ISCC in future advanced networks. By embracing ISCC, we can unlock the full potential of intelligent connectivity, paving the way for groundbreaking applications and services.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xixi Wang, Zitian Wang, Jingtao Jiang, Lan Chen, Xiao Wang, Bo Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Current works focus on addressing the remote sensing change detection task using bi-temporal images. Although good performance can be achieved, however, seldom of they consider the motion cues which may also be vital. In this work, we revisit the widely adopted bi-temporal images-based framework and propose a novel Coarse-grained Temporal Mining Augmented (CTMA) framework. To be specific, given the bi-temporal images, we first transform them into a video using interpolation operations. Then, a set of temporal encoders is adopted to extract the motion features from the obtained video for coarse-grained changed region prediction. Subsequently, we design a novel Coarse-grained Foregrounds Augmented Spatial Encoder module to integrate both global and local information. We also introduce a motion augmented strategy that leverages motion cues as an additional output to aggregate with the spatial features for improved results. Meanwhile, we feed the input image pairs into the ResNet to get the different features and also the spatial blocks for fine-grained feature learning. More importantly, we propose a mask augmented strategy that utilizes coarse-grained changed regions, incorporating them into the decoder blocks to enhance the final changed prediction. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed framework for remote sensing image change detection.

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools in various domains. Recent studies have shown that LLMs can surpass humans in certain tasks, such as predicting the outcomes of neuroscience studies. What role does this leave for humans in the overall decision process? One possibility is that humans, despite performing worse than LLMs, can still add value when teamed with them. A human and machine team can surpass each individual teammate when team members' confidence is well-calibrated and team members diverge in which tasks they find difficult (i.e., calibration and diversity are needed). We simplified and extended a Bayesian approach to combining judgments using a logistic regression framework that integrates confidence-weighted judgments for any number of team members. Using this straightforward method, we demonstrated in a neuroscience forecasting task that, even when humans were inferior to LLMs, their combination with one or more LLMs consistently improved team performance. Our hope is that this simple and effective strategy for integrating the judgments of humans and machines will lead to productive collaborations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weimin Yin, Bin Chen adn Chunzhao Xie, Zhenhao Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: In general class-incremental learning, researchers typically use sample sets as a tool to avoid catastrophic forgetting during continuous learning. At the same time, researchers have also noted the differences between class-incremental learning and Oracle training and have attempted to make corrections. In recent years, researchers have begun to develop class-incremental learning algorithms utilizing pre-trained models, achieving significant results. This paper observes that in class-incremental learning, the steady state among the weight guided by each class center is disrupted, which is significantly correlated with catastrophic forgetting. Based on this, we propose a new method to overcoming forgetting . In some cases, by retaining only a single sample unit of each class in memory for replay and applying simple gradient constraints, very good results can be achieved. Experimental results indicate that under the condition of pre-trained models, our method can achieve competitive performance with very low computational cost and by simply using the cross-entropy loss.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guhong Chen, Liyang Fan, Zihan Gong, Nan Xie, Zixuan Li, Ziqiang Liu, Chengming Li, Qiang Qu, Shiwen Ni, Min Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a simulation system called AgentCourt that simulates the entire courtroom process. The judge, plaintiff's lawyer, defense lawyer, and other participants are autonomous agents driven by large language models (LLMs). Our core goal is to enable lawyer agents to learn how to argue a case, as well as improving their overall legal skills, through courtroom process simulation. To achieve this goal, we propose an adversarial evolutionary approach for the lawyer-agent. Since AgentCourt can simulate the occurrence and development of court hearings based on a knowledge base and LLM, the lawyer agents can continuously learn and accumulate experience from real court cases. The simulation experiments show that after two lawyer-agents have engaged in a thousand adversarial legal cases in AgentCourt (which can take a decade for real-world lawyers), compared to their pre-evolutionary state, the evolved lawyer agents exhibit consistent improvement in their ability to handle legal tasks. To enhance the credibility of our experimental results, we enlisted a panel of professional lawyers to evaluate our simulations. The evaluation indicates that the evolved lawyer agents exhibit notable advancements in responsiveness, as well as expertise and logical rigor. This work paves the way for advancing LLM-driven agent technology in legal scenarios. Code is available at https://github.com/relic-yuexi/AgentCourt.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiming Xia, Hongwei Lin, Wei Ye, Hai Wu, Yadan Luo, Shijia Zhao, Xin Li, Chenglu Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: LiDAR-based outdoor 3D object detection has received widespread attention. However, training 3D detectors from the LiDAR point cloud typically relies on expensive bounding box annotations. This paper presents OC3D, an innovative weakly supervised method requiring only coarse clicks on the bird' s eye view of the 3D point cloud. A key challenge here is the absence of complete geometric descriptions of the target objects from such simple click annotations. To address this problem, our proposed OC3D adopts a two-stage strategy. In the first stage, we initially design a novel dynamic and static classification strategy and then propose the Click2Box and Click2Mask modules to generate box-level and mask-level pseudo-labels for static and dynamic instances, respectively. In the second stage, we design a Mask2Box module, leveraging the learning capabilities of neural networks to update mask-level pseudo-labels, which contain less information, to box level pseudo-labels. Experimental results on the widely used KITTI and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that our OC3D with only coarse clicks achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to weakly-supervised 3D detection methods. Combining OC3D with a missing click mining strategy, we propose a OC3D++ pipeline, which requires only 0.2% annotation cost in the KITTI dataset to achieve performance comparable to fully supervised methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyuan Li, Heng Wang, Dongnan Liu, Chaoyi Zhang, Ao Ma, Jieting Long, Weidong Cai</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased exceptional ability in causal reasoning from textual information. However, will these causalities remain straightforward for Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) when only visual hints are provided? Motivated by this, we propose a novel Multimodal Causal Reasoning benchmark, namely MuCR, to challenge VLLMs to infer semantic cause-and-effect relationship when solely relying on visual cues such as action, appearance, clothing, and environment. Specifically, we introduce a prompt-driven image synthesis approach to create siamese images with embedded semantic causality and visual cues, which can effectively evaluate VLLMs' causal reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we develop tailored metrics from multiple perspectives, including image-level match, phrase-level understanding, and sentence-level explanation, to comprehensively assess VLLMs' comprehension abilities. Our extensive experiments reveal that the current state-of-the-art VLLMs are not as skilled at multimodal causal reasoning as we might have hoped. Furthermore, we perform a comprehensive analysis to understand these models' shortcomings from different views and suggest directions for future research. We hope MuCR can serve as a valuable resource and foundational benchmark in multimodal causal reasoning research. The project is available at: https://github.com/Zhiyuan-Li-John/MuCR</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Victor Verreet, Lennert De Smet, Luc De Raedt, Emanuele Sansone</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural probabilistic logic systems follow the neuro-symbolic (NeSy) paradigm by combining the perceptive and learning capabilities of neural networks with the robustness of probabilistic logic. Learning corresponds to likelihood optimization of the neural networks. However, to obtain the likelihood exactly, expensive probabilistic logic inference is required. To scale learning to more complex systems, we therefore propose to instead optimize a sampling based objective. We prove that the objective has a bounded error with respect to the likelihood, which vanishes when increasing the sample count. Furthermore, the error vanishes faster by exploiting a new concept of sample diversity. We then develop the EXPLAIN, AGREE, LEARN (EXAL) method that uses this objective. EXPLAIN samples explanations for the data. AGREE reweighs each explanation in concordance with the neural component. LEARN uses the reweighed explanations as a signal for learning. In contrast to previous NeSy methods, EXAL can scale to larger problem sizes while retaining theoretical guarantees on the error. Experimentally, our theoretical claims are verified and EXAL outperforms recent NeSy methods when scaling up the MNIST addition and Warcraft pathfinding problems.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce DeepSeek-Prover-V1.5, an open-source language model designed for theorem proving in Lean 4, which enhances DeepSeek-Prover-V1 by optimizing both training and inference processes. Pre-trained on DeepSeekMath-Base with specialization in formal mathematical languages, the model undergoes supervised fine-tuning using an enhanced formal theorem proving dataset derived from DeepSeek-Prover-V1. Further refinement is achieved through reinforcement learning from proof assistant feedback (RLPAF). Beyond the single-pass whole-proof generation approach of DeepSeek-Prover-V1, we propose RMaxTS, a variant of Monte-Carlo tree search that employs an intrinsic-reward-driven exploration strategy to generate diverse proof paths. DeepSeek-Prover-V1.5 demonstrates significant improvements over DeepSeek-Prover-V1, achieving new state-of-the-art results on the test set of the high school level miniF2F benchmark ($63.5\%$) and the undergraduate level ProofNet benchmark ($25.3\%$).</p>

<p>Abstract: We have seen much recent progress in task-specific clothes manipulation, but generalizable clothes manipulation is still a challenge. Clothes manipulation requires sequential actions, making it challenging to generalize to unseen tasks. Besides, a general clothes state representation method is crucial. In this paper, we adopt language instructions to specify and decompose clothes manipulation tasks, and propose a large language model based hierarchical learning method to enhance generalization. For state representation, we use semantic keypoints to capture the geometry of clothes and outline their manipulation methods. Simulation experiments show that the proposed method outperforms the baseline method in terms of success rate and generalization for clothes manipulation tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Training a neural network is a monolithic endeavor, akin to carving knowledge into stone: once the process is completed, editing the knowledge in a network is nearly impossible, since all information is distributed across the network's weights. We here explore a simple, compelling alternative by marrying the representational power of deep neural networks with the flexibility of a database. Decomposing the task of image classification into image similarity (from a pre-trained embedding) and search (via fast nearest neighbor retrieval from a knowledge database), we build a simple and flexible visual memory that has the following key capabilities: (1.) The ability to flexibly add data across scales: from individual samples all the way to entire classes and billion-scale data; (2.) The ability to remove data through unlearning and memory pruning; (3.) An interpretable decision-mechanism on which we can intervene to control its behavior. Taken together, these capabilities comprehensively demonstrate the benefits of an explicit visual memory. We hope that it might contribute to a conversation on how knowledge should be represented in deep vision models -- beyond carving it in ``stone'' weights.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiushuo Cheng, Catherine Morgan, Arindam Sikdar, Alessandro Masullo, Alan Whone, Majid Mirmehdi</p>
<p>Abstract: People with Parkinson's Disease (PD) often experience progressively worsening gait, including changes in how they turn around, as the disease progresses. Existing clinical rating tools are not capable of capturing hour-by-hour variations of PD symptoms, as they are confined to brief assessments within clinic settings. Measuring real-world gait turning angles continuously and passively is a component step towards using gait characteristics as sensitive indicators of disease progression in PD. This paper presents a deep learning-based approach to automatically quantify turning angles by extracting 3D skeletons from videos and calculating the rotation of hip and knee joints. We utilise state-of-the-art human pose estimation models, Fastpose and Strided Transformer, on a total of 1386 turning video clips from 24 subjects (12 people with PD and 12 healthy control volunteers), trimmed from a PD dataset of unscripted free-living videos in a home-like setting (Turn-REMAP). We also curate a turning video dataset, Turn-H3.6M, from the public Human3.6M human pose benchmark with 3D ground truth, to further validate our method. Previous gait research has primarily taken place in clinics or laboratories evaluating scripted gait outcomes, but this work focuses on real-world settings where complexities exist, such as baggy clothing and poor lighting. Due to difficulties in obtaining accurate ground truth data in a free-living setting, we quantise the angle into the nearest bin $45^\circ$ based on the manual labelling of expert clinicians. Our method achieves a turning calculation accuracy of 41.6%, a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 34.7{\deg}, and a weighted precision WPrec of 68.3% for Turn-REMAP. This is the first work to explore the use of single monocular camera data to quantify turns by PD patients in a home setting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaojun Xu, Xusheng Luo, Yutong Huang, Letian Leng, Ruixuan Liu, Changliu Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Long-horizon planning is hindered by challenges such as uncertainty accumulation, computational complexity, delayed rewards and incomplete information. This work proposes an approach to exploit the task hierarchy from human instructions to facilitate multi-robot planning. Using Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose a two-step approach to translate multi-sentence instructions into a structured language, Hierarchical Linear Temporal Logic (LTL), which serves as a formal representation for planning. Initially, LLMs transform the instructions into a hierarchical representation defined as Hierarchical Task Tree, capturing the logical and temporal relations among tasks. Following this, a domain-specific fine-tuning of LLM translates sub-tasks of each task into flat LTL formulas, aggregating them to form hierarchical LTL specifications. These specifications are then leveraged for planning using off-the-shelf planners. Our framework not only bridges the gap between instructions and algorithmic planning but also showcases the potential of LLMs in harnessing hierarchical reasoning to automate multi-robot task planning. Through evaluations in both simulation and real-world experiments involving human participants, we demonstrate that our method can handle more complex instructions compared to existing methods. The results indicate that our approach achieves higher success rates and lower costs in multi-robot task allocation and plan generation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bohao Wang, Feng Liu, Jiawei Chen, Yudi Wu, Xingyu Lou, Jun Wang, Yan Feng, Chun Chen, Can Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Sequential recommendation systems fundamentally rely on users' historical interaction sequences, which are often contaminated by noisy interactions. Identifying these noisy interactions accurately without additional information is particularly difficult due to the lack of explicit supervisory signals to denote noise. Large Language Models (LLMs), equipped with extensive open knowledge and semantic reasoning abilities, present a promising avenue to bridge this information gap. However, employing LLMs for denoising in sequential recommendation introduces notable challenges: 1) Direct application of pretrained LLMs may not be competent for the denoising task, frequently generating nonsensical responses; 2) Even after fine-tuning, the reliability of LLM outputs remains questionable, especially given the complexity of the task and th inherent hallucinatory issue of LLMs.
  To tackle these challenges, we propose LLM4DSR, a tailored approach for denoising sequential recommendation using LLMs. We constructed a self-supervised fine-tuning task to activate LLMs' capabilities to identify noisy items and suggest replacements. Furthermore, we developed an uncertainty estimation module that ensures only high-confidence responses are utilized for sequence corrections. Remarkably, LLM4DSR is model-agnostic, allowing the corrected sequences to be flexibly applied across various recommendation models. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of LLM4DSR over existing methods across three datasets and three recommendation backbones.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Oscar Dilley, Juan Marcelo Parra-Ullauri, Rasheed Hussain, Dimitra Simeonidou</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a privacy-enhancing technology for distributed ML. By training models locally and aggregating updates - a federation learns together, while bypassing centralised data collection. FL is increasingly popular in healthcare, finance and personal computing. However, it inherits fairness challenges from classical ML and introduces new ones, resulting from differences in data quality, client participation, communication constraints, aggregation methods and underlying hardware. Fairness remains an unresolved issue in FL and the community has identified an absence of succinct definitions and metrics to quantify fairness; to address this, we propose Federated Fairness Analytics - a methodology for measuring fairness. Our definition of fairness comprises four notions with novel, corresponding metrics. They are symptomatically defined and leverage techniques originating from XAI, cooperative game-theory and networking engineering. We tested a range of experimental settings, varying the FL approach, ML task and data settings. The results show that statistical heterogeneity and client participation affect fairness and fairness conscious approaches such as Ditto and q-FedAvg marginally improve fairness-performance trade-offs. Using our techniques, FL practitioners can uncover previously unobtainable insights into their system's fairness, at differing levels of granularity in order to address fairness challenges in FL.

<p>Abstract: Image classification usually requires connectivity and access to the cloud which is often limited in many parts of the world, including hard to reach rural areas. TinyML aims to solve this problem by hosting AI assistants on constrained devices, eliminating connectivity issues by processing data within the device itself, without internet or cloud access. This pilot study explores the use of tinyML to provide healthcare support with low spec devices in low connectivity environments, focusing on diagnosis of skin diseases and the ethical use of AI assistants in a healthcare setting. To investigate this, 10,000 images of skin lesions were used to train a model for classifying visually detectable diseases (VDDs). The model weights were then offloaded to a Raspberry Pi with a webcam attached, to be used for the classification of skin lesions without internet access. It was found that the developed prototype achieved a test accuracy of 78% and a test loss of 1.08.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arpan Mahara, Naphtali D. Rishe, Liangdong Deng</p>
<p>Abstract: Image-to-Image translation in Generative Artificial Intelligence (Generative AI) has been a central focus of research, with applications spanning healthcare, remote sensing, physics, chemistry, photography, and more. Among the numerous methodologies, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with contrastive learning have been particularly successful. This study aims to demonstrate that the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) can effectively replace the Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) method in generative AI, particularly in the subdomain of image-to-image translation, to achieve better generative quality. Our novel approach replaces the two-layer MLP with a two-layer KAN in the existing Contrastive Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation (CUT) model, developing the KAN-CUT model. This substitution favors the generation of more informative features in low-dimensional vector representations, which contrastive learning can utilize more effectively to produce high-quality images in the target domain. Extensive experiments, detailed in the results section, demonstrate the applicability of KAN in conjunction with contrastive learning and GANs in Generative AI, particularly for image-to-image translation. This work suggests that KAN could be a valuable component in the broader generative AI domain.</p>

<p>Abstract: The problem of finding the shortest path in a graph G(V, E) has been widely studied. However, in many applications it is necessary to compute an arbitrary number of them, k. Even though the problem has raised a lot of interest from different research communities and many applications of it are known, it has not been addressed to the same extent as the single shortest path problem. The best algorithm known for efficiently solving this task has a time complexity of O (|E| + |V|log{|V|}+k|V|)$ when computing paths in explicit form, and is based on best-first search. This paper introduces a new search algorithm with the same time complexity, which results from a natural evolution of A* thus, it preserves all its interesting properties, making it widely applicable to many different domains. Experiments in various testbeds show a significant improvement in performance over the state of the art, often by one or two orders of magnitude.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhihao Lin, Zhen Tian, Qi Zhang, Ziyang Ye, Hanyang Zhuang, Jianglin Lan</p>
<p>Abstract: Safety and efficiency are crucial for autonomous driving in roundabouts, especially in the context of mixed traffic where autonomous vehicles (AVs) and human-driven vehicles coexist. This paper introduces a learning-based algorithm tailored to foster safe and efficient driving behaviors across varying levels of traffic flows in roundabouts. The proposed algorithm employs a deep Q-learning network to effectively learn safe and efficient driving strategies in complex multi-vehicle roundabouts. Additionally, a KAN (Kolmogorov-Arnold network) enhances the AVs' ability to learn their surroundings robustly and precisely. An action inspector is integrated to replace dangerous actions to avoid collisions when the AV interacts with the environment, and a route planner is proposed to enhance the driving efficiency and safety of the AVs. Moreover, a model predictive control is adopted to ensure stability and precision of the driving actions. The results show that our proposed system consistently achieves safe and efficient driving whilst maintaining a stable training process, as evidenced by the smooth convergence of the reward function and the low variance in the training curves across various traffic flows. Compared to state-of-the-art benchmarks, the proposed algorithm achieves a lower number of collisions and reduced travel time to destination.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion models excel at capturing the natural design spaces of images, molecules, DNA, RNA, and protein sequences. However, rather than merely generating designs that are natural, we often aim to optimize downstream reward functions while preserving the naturalness of these design spaces. Existing methods for achieving this goal often require ``differentiable'' proxy models (\textit{e.g.}, classifier guidance or DPS) or involve computationally expensive fine-tuning of diffusion models (\textit{e.g.}, classifier-free guidance, RL-based fine-tuning). In our work, we propose a new method to address these challenges. Our algorithm is an iterative sampling method that integrates soft value functions, which looks ahead to how intermediate noisy states lead to high rewards in the future, into the standard inference procedure of pre-trained diffusion models. Notably, our approach avoids fine-tuning generative models and eliminates the need to construct differentiable models. This enables us to (1) directly utilize non-differentiable features/reward feedback, commonly used in many scientific domains, and (2) apply our method to recent discrete diffusion models in a principled way. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm across several domains, including image generation, molecule generation, and DNA/RNA sequence generation.

<p>Abstract: Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification with multiple instance learning (MIL) in digital pathology faces significant computational challenges. Current methods mostly rely on extensive self-supervised learning (SSL) for satisfactory performance, requiring long training periods and considerable computational resources. At the same time, no pre-training affects performance due to domain shifts from natural images to WSIs. We introduce \textbf{\textit{Snuffy}} architecture, a novel MIL-pooling method based on sparse transformers that mitigates performance loss with limited pre-training and enables continual few-shot pre-training as a competitive option. Our sparsity pattern is tailored for pathology and is theoretically proven to be a universal approximator with the tightest probabilistic sharp bound on the number of layers for sparse transformers, to date.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guoxiang Grayson Tong, Carlos A. Sing Long, Daniele E. Schiavazzi</p>
<p>Abstract: Estimation of cardiovascular model parameters from electronic health records (EHR) poses a significant challenge primarily due to lack of identifiability. Structural non-identifiability arises when a manifold in the space of parameters is mapped to a common output, while practical non-identifiability can result due to limited data, model misspecification, or noise corruption. To address the resulting ill-posed inverse problem, optimization-based or Bayesian inference approaches typically use regularization, thereby limiting the possibility of discovering multiple solutions. In this study, we use inVAErt networks, a neural network-based, data-driven framework for enhanced digital twin analysis of stiff dynamical systems. We demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of inVAErt networks in the context of physiological inversion of a six-compartment lumped parameter hemodynamic model from synthetic data to real data with missing components.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jin Wang, Arturo Laurenzi, Nikos Tsagarakis</p>
<p>Abstract: Enabling humanoid robots to perform autonomously loco-manipulation in unstructured environments is crucial and highly challenging for achieving embodied intelligence. This involves robots being able to plan their actions and behaviors in long-horizon tasks while using multi-modality to perceive deviations between task execution and high-level planning. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful planning and reasoning capabilities for comprehension and processing of semantic information through robot control tasks, as well as the usability of analytical judgment and decision-making for multi-modal inputs. To leverage the power of LLMs towards humanoid loco-manipulation, we propose a novel language-model based framework that enables robots to autonomously plan behaviors and low-level execution under given textual instructions, while observing and correcting failures that may occur during task execution. To systematically evaluate this framework in grounding LLMs, we created the robot 'action' and 'sensing' behavior library for task planning, and conducted mobile manipulation tasks and experiments in both simulated and real environments using the CENTAURO robot, and verified the effectiveness and application of this approach in robotic tasks with autonomous behavioral planning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gengwei Zhang, Liyuan Wang, Guoliang Kang, Ling Chen, Yunchao Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, continual learning with pre-training (CLPT) has received widespread interest, instead of its traditional focus of training from scratch. The use of strong pre-trained models (PTMs) can greatly facilitate knowledge transfer and alleviate catastrophic forgetting, but also suffers from progressive overfitting of pre-trained knowledge into specific downstream tasks. A majority of current efforts often keep the PTMs frozen and incorporate task-specific prompts to instruct representation learning, coupled with a prompt selection process for inference. However, due to the limited capacity of prompt parameters, this strategy demonstrates only sub-optimal performance in continual learning. In comparison, tuning all parameters of PTMs often provides the greatest potential for representation learning, making sequential fine-tuning (Seq FT) a fundamental baseline that has been overlooked in CLPT. To this end, we present an in-depth analysis of the progressive overfitting problem from the lens of Seq FT. Considering that the overly fast representation learning and the biased classification layer constitute this particular problem, we introduce the advanced Slow Learner with Classifier Alignment (SLCA++) framework to unleash the power of Seq FT, serving as a strong baseline approach for CLPT. Our approach involves a Slow Learner to selectively reduce the learning rate of backbone parameters, and a Classifier Alignment to align the disjoint classification layers in a post-hoc fashion. We further enhance the efficacy of SL with a symmetric cross-entropy loss, as well as employ a parameter-efficient strategy to implement Seq FT with SLCA++. Across a variety of continual learning scenarios on image classification benchmarks, our approach provides substantial improvements and outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongyu Li, Snehal Dikhale, Jinda Cui, Soshi Iba, Nawid Jamali</p>
<p>Abstract: To achieve dexterity comparable to that of humans, robots must intelligently process tactile sensor data. Taxel-based tactile signals often have low spatial-resolution, with non-standardized representations. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, HyperTaxel, for learning a geometrically-informed representation of taxel-based tactile signals to address challenges associated with their spatial resolution. We use this representation and a contrastive learning objective to encode and map sparse low-resolution taxel signals to high-resolution contact surfaces. To address the uncertainty inherent in these signals, we leverage joint probability distributions across multiple simultaneous contacts to improve taxel hyper-resolution. We evaluate our representation by comparing it with two baselines and present results that suggest our representation outperforms the baselines. Furthermore, we present qualitative results that demonstrate the learned representation captures the geometric features of the contact surface, such as flatness, curvature, and edges, and generalizes across different objects and sensor configurations. Moreover, we present results that suggest our representation improves the performance of various downstream tasks, such as surface classification, 6D in-hand pose estimation, and sim-to-real transfer.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeju Qiu, Weiyang Liu, Haiwen Feng, Zhen Liu, Tim Z. Xiao, Katherine M. Collins, Joshua B. Tenenbaum, Adrian Weller, Michael J. Black, Bernhard Sch\"olkopf</p>
<p>Abstract: Assessing the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) is often challenging, in part, because it is hard to find tasks to which they have not been exposed during training. We take one step to address this challenge by turning to a new task: focusing on symbolic graphics programs, which are a popular representation for graphics content that procedurally generates visual data. LLMs have shown exciting promise towards program synthesis, but do they understand symbolic graphics programs? Unlike conventional programs, symbolic graphics programs can be translated to graphics content. Here, we characterize an LLM's understanding of symbolic programs in terms of their ability to answer questions related to the graphics content. This task is challenging as the questions are difficult to answer from the symbolic programs alone -- yet, they would be easy to answer from the corresponding graphics content as we verify through a human experiment. To understand symbolic programs, LLMs may need to possess the ability to imagine how the corresponding graphics content would look without directly accessing the rendered visual content. We use this task to evaluate LLMs by creating a large benchmark for the semantic understanding of symbolic graphics programs. This benchmark is built via program-graphics correspondence, hence requiring minimal human efforts. We evaluate current LLMs on our benchmark to elucidate a preliminary assessment of their ability to reason about visual scenes from programs. We find that this task distinguishes existing LLMs and models considered good at reasoning perform better. Lastly, we introduce Symbolic Instruction Tuning (SIT) to improve this ability. Specifically, we query GPT4-o with questions and images generated by symbolic programs. Such data are then used to finetune an LLM. We also find that SIT data can improve the general instruction following ability of LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tobias Geibinger, Florian Mischek, Nysret Musliu</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper we deal with a complex real world scheduling problem closely related to the well-known Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (RCPSP). The problem concerns industrial test laboratories in which a large number of tests has to be performed by qualified personnel using specialised equipment, while respecting deadlines and other constraints. We present different constraint programming models and search strategies for this problem. Furthermore, we propose a Very Large Neighborhood Search approach based on our CP methods. Our models are evaluated using CP solvers and a MIP solver both on real-world test laboratory data and on a set of generated instances of different sizes based on the real-world data. Further, we compare the exact approaches with VLNS and a Simulated Annealing heuristic. We could find feasible solutions for all instances and several optimal solutions and we show that using VLNS we can improve upon the results of the other approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Razan Baltaji, Babak Hemmatian, Lav R. Varshney</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-agent AI systems can be used for simulating collective decision-making in scientific and practical applications. They can also be used to introduce a diverse group discussion step in chatbot pipelines, enhancing the cultural sensitivity of the chatbot's responses. These applications, however, are predicated on the ability of AI agents to reliably adopt assigned personas and mimic human interactions. To see whether LLM agents satisfy these requirements, we examine AI agent ensembles engaged in cross-national collaboration and debate by analyzing their private responses and chat transcripts. Our findings suggest that multi-agent discussions can support collective AI decisions that more often reflect diverse perspectives, yet this effect is tempered by the agents' susceptibility to conformity due to perceived peer pressure and occasional challenges in maintaining consistent personas and opinions. Instructions that encourage debate in support of one's opinions rather than collaboration increase the rate of inconstancy. Without addressing the factors we identify, the full potential of multi-agent frameworks for producing more culturally diverse AI outputs or more realistic simulations of group decision-making may remain untapped.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is a powerful machine learning paradigm for generating agents that control autonomous systems. However, the ``black box'' nature of DRL agents limits their deployment in real-world safety-critical applications. A promising approach for providing strong guarantees on an agent's behavior is to use Neural Lyapunov Barrier (NLB) certificates, which are learned functions over the system whose properties indirectly imply that an agent behaves as desired. However, NLB-based certificates are typically difficult to learn and even more difficult to verify, especially for complex systems. In this work, we present a novel method for training and verifying NLB-based certificates for discrete-time systems. Specifically, we introduce a technique for certificate composition, which simplifies the verification of highly-complex systems by strategically designing a sequence of certificates. When jointly verified with neural network verification engines, these certificates provide a formal guarantee that a DRL agent both achieves its goals and avoids unsafe behavior. Furthermore, we introduce a technique for certificate filtering, which significantly simplifies the process of producing formally verified certificates. We demonstrate the merits of our approach with a case study on providing safety and liveness guarantees for a DRL-controlled spacecraft.</p>

<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) methods are poised to revolutionize intellectual work, with generative AI enabling automation of text analysis, text generation, and simple decision making or reasoning. The impact to science is only just beginning, but the opportunity is significant since scientific research relies fundamentally on extended chains of cognitive work. Here, we review the state of the art in agentic AI systems, and discuss how these methods could be extended to have even greater impact on science. We propose the development of an exocortex, a synthetic extension of a person's cognition. A science exocortex could be designed as a swarm of AI agents, with each agent individually streamlining specific researcher tasks, and whose inter-communication leads to emergent behavior that greatly extend the researcher's cognition and volition.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06172">On Speeding Up Language Model Evaluation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jin Peng Zhou, Christian K. Belardi, Ruihan Wu, Travis Zhang, Carla P. Gomes, Wen Sun, Kilian Q. Weinberger</p>
<p>Abstract: Developing prompt-based methods with Large Language Models (LLMs) requires making numerous decisions, which give rise to a combinatorial search problem. For example, selecting the right pre-trained LLM, prompt, and hyperparameters to attain the best performance for a task typically necessitates evaluating an expoential number of candidates on large validation sets. This exhaustive evaluation can be time-consuming and costly, as both inference and evaluation of LLM-based approaches are resource-intensive. Worse, a lot of computation is wasted: Many hyper-parameter settings are non-competitive, and many samples from the validation set are highly correlated - providing little or no new information. So, if the goal is to identify the best method, it can be done far more efficiently if the validation samples and methods are selected adaptively. In this paper, we propose a novel method to address this challenge. We lean on low-rank matrix factorization to fill in missing evaluations and on multi-armed bandits to sequentially identify the next (method, validation sample)-pair to evaluate. We carefully assess the efficacy of our approach on several competitive benchmark problems and show that it can identify the top-performing method using only 5-15% of the typically needed resources -- resulting in a staggering 85-95% LLM cost savings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Modern artificial intelligence (AI) systems are powered by foundation models. This paper presents a new set of foundation models, called Llama 3. It is a herd of language models that natively support multilinguality, coding, reasoning, and tool usage. Our largest model is a dense Transformer with 405B parameters and a context window of up to 128K tokens. This paper presents an extensive empirical evaluation of Llama 3. We find that Llama 3 delivers comparable quality to leading language models such as GPT-4 on a plethora of tasks. We publicly release Llama 3, including pre-trained and post-trained versions of the 405B parameter language model and our Llama Guard 3 model for input and output safety. The paper also presents the results of experiments in which we integrate image, video, and speech capabilities into Llama 3 via a compositional approach. We observe this approach performs competitively with the state-of-the-art on image, video, and speech recognition tasks. The resulting models are not yet being broadly released as they are still under development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chris Lu, Cong Lu, Robert Tjarko Lange, Jakob Foerster, Jeff Clune, David Ha</p>
<p>Abstract: One of the grand challenges of artificial general intelligence is developing agents capable of conducting scientific research and discovering new knowledge. While frontier models have already been used as aides to human scientists, e.g. for brainstorming ideas, writing code, or prediction tasks, they still conduct only a small part of the scientific process. This paper presents the first comprehensive framework for fully automatic scientific discovery, enabling frontier large language models to perform research independently and communicate their findings. We introduce The AI Scientist, which generates novel research ideas, writes code, executes experiments, visualizes results, describes its findings by writing a full scientific paper, and then runs a simulated review process for evaluation. In principle, this process can be repeated to iteratively develop ideas in an open-ended fashion, acting like the human scientific community. We demonstrate its versatility by applying it to three distinct subfields of machine learning: diffusion modeling, transformer-based language modeling, and learning dynamics. Each idea is implemented and developed into a full paper at a cost of less than $15 per paper. To evaluate the generated papers, we design and validate an automated reviewer, which we show achieves near-human performance in evaluating paper scores. The AI Scientist can produce papers that exceed the acceptance threshold at a top machine learning conference as judged by our automated reviewer. This approach signifies the beginning of a new era in scientific discovery in machine learning: bringing the transformative benefits of AI agents to the entire research process of AI itself, and taking us closer to a world where endless affordable creativity and innovation can be unleashed on the world's most challenging problems.

<p>Abstract: While there is a widespread belief that artificial general intelligence (AGI) -- or even superhuman AI -- is imminent, complex problems in expert domains are far from being solved. We argue that such problems require human-AI cooperation and that the current state of the art in generative AI is unable to play the role of a reliable partner due to a multitude of shortcomings, including inability to keep track of a complex solution artifact (e.g., a software program), limited support for versatile human preference expression and lack of adapting to human preference in an interactive setting. To address these challenges, we propose HAI-Co2, a novel human-AI co-construction framework. We formalize HAI-Co2 and discuss the difficult open research problems that it faces. Finally, we present a case study of HAI-Co2 and demonstrate its efficacy compared to monolithic generative AI models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Shi, Congyi Wang, Yu Chen, Bin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The majority of Chinese characters are monophonic, while a special group of characters, called polyphonic characters, have multiple pronunciations. As a prerequisite of performing speech-related generative tasks, the correct pronunciation must be identified among several candidates. This process is called Polyphone Disambiguation. Although the problem has been well explored with both knowledge-based and learning-based approaches, it remains challenging due to the lack of publicly available labeled datasets and the irregular nature of polyphone in Mandarin Chinese. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning (SSL) framework for Mandarin Chinese polyphone disambiguation that can potentially leverage unlimited unlabeled text data. We explore the effect of various proxy labeling strategies including entropy-thresholding and lexicon-based labeling. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. In addition, we publish a novel dataset specifically for the polyphone disambiguation task to promote further research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianfeng Huang, Chenyang Li, Yimin Lin, Shiguo Lian</p>
<p>Abstract: It is hard to collect enough flaw images for training deep learning network in industrial production. Therefore, existing industrial anomaly detection methods prefer to use CNN-based unsupervised detection and localization network to achieve this task. However, these methods always fail when there are varieties happened in new signals since traditional end-to-end networks suffer barriers of fitting nonlinear model in high-dimensional space. Moreover, they have a memory library by clustering the feature of normal images essentially, which cause it is not robust to texture change. To this end, we propose the Vision Transformer based (VIT-based) unsupervised anomaly detection network. It utilizes a hierarchical task learning and human experience to enhance its interpretability. Our network consists of pattern generation and comparison networks. Pattern generation network uses two VIT-based encoder modules to extract the feature of two consecutive image patches, then uses VIT-based decoder module to learn the human designed style of these features and predict the third image patch. After this, we use the Siamese-based network to compute the similarity of the generation image patch and original image patch. Finally, we refine the anomaly localization by the bi-directional inference strategy. Comparison experiments on public dataset MVTec dataset show our method achieves 99.8% AUC, which surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we give a qualitative illustration on our own leather and cloth datasets. The accurate segment results strongly prove the accuracy of our method in anomaly detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arthur Jacot</p>
<p>Abstract: Previous work has shown that DNNs with large depth $L$ and $L_{2}$-regularization are biased towards learning low-dimensional representations of the inputs, which can be interpreted as minimizing a notion of rank $R^{(0)}(f)$ of the learned function $f$, conjectured to be the Bottleneck rank. We compute finite depth corrections to this result, revealing a measure $R^{(1)}$ of regularity which bounds the pseudo-determinant of the Jacobian $\left|Jf(x)\right|_{+}$ and is subadditive under composition and addition. This formalizes a balance between learning low-dimensional representations and minimizing complexity/irregularity in the feature maps, allowing the network to learn the `right' inner dimension. Finally, we prove the conjectured bottleneck structure in the learned features as $L\to\infty$: for large depths, almost all hidden representations are approximately $R^{(0)}(f)$-dimensional, and almost all weight matrices $W_{\ell}$ have $R^{(0)}(f)$ singular values close to 1 while the others are $O(L^{-\frac{1}{2}})$. Interestingly, the use of large learning rates is required to guarantee an order $O(L)$ NTK which in turns guarantees infinite depth convergence of the representations of almost all layers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Shi, Jingbo Wang, Xuekun Jiang, Bingkun Lin, Bo Dai, Xue Bin Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-time character control is an essential component for interactive experiences, with a broad range of applications, including physics simulations, video games, and virtual reality. The success of diffusion models for image synthesis has led to the use of these models for motion synthesis. However, the majority of these motion diffusion models are primarily designed for offline applications, where space-time models are used to synthesize an entire sequence of frames simultaneously with a pre-specified length. To enable real-time motion synthesis with diffusion model that allows time-varying controls, we propose A-MDM (Auto-regressive Motion Diffusion Model). Our conditional diffusion model takes an initial pose as input, and auto-regressively generates successive motion frames conditioned on the previous frame. Despite its streamlined network architecture, which uses simple MLPs, our framework is capable of generating diverse, long-horizon, and high-fidelity motion sequences. Furthermore, we introduce a suite of techniques for incorporating interactive controls into A-MDM, such as task-oriented sampling, in-painting, and hierarchical reinforcement learning. These techniques enable a pre-trained A-MDM to be efficiently adapted for a variety of new downstream tasks. We conduct a comprehensive suite of experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of A-MDM, and compare its performance against state-of-the-art auto-regressive methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Li Chen, Penghao Wu, Kashyap Chitta, Bernhard Jaeger, Andreas Geiger, Hongyang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The autonomous driving community has witnessed a rapid growth in approaches that embrace an end-to-end algorithm framework, utilizing raw sensor input to generate vehicle motion plans, instead of concentrating on individual tasks such as detection and motion prediction. End-to-end systems, in comparison to modular pipelines, benefit from joint feature optimization for perception and planning. This field has flourished due to the availability of large-scale datasets, closed-loop evaluation, and the increasing need for autonomous driving algorithms to perform effectively in challenging scenarios. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive analysis of more than 270 papers, covering the motivation, roadmap, methodology, challenges, and future trends in end-to-end autonomous driving. We delve into several critical challenges, including multi-modality, interpretability, causal confusion, robustness, and world models, amongst others. Additionally, we discuss current advancements in foundation models and visual pre-training, as well as how to incorporate these techniques within the end-to-end driving framework. we maintain an active repository that contains up-to-date literature and open-source projects at https://github.com/OpenDriveLab/End-to-end-Autonomous-Driving.</p>

<p>Abstract: Hamiltonian neural networks (HNNs) are state-of-the-art models that regress the vector field of a dynamical system under the learning bias of Hamilton's equations. A recent observation is that embedding a bias regarding the additive separability of the Hamiltonian reduces the regression complexity and improves regression performance. We propose separable HNNs that embed additive separability within HNNs using observational, learning, and inductive biases. We show that the proposed models are more effective than the HNN at regressing the Hamiltonian and the vector field. Consequently, the proposed models predict the dynamics and conserve the total energy of the Hamiltonian system more accurately.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinye Yang, Ji Xu, Di Wu, Jianhang Tang, Shaobo Li, Guoyin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Long-tailed (LT) classification is an unavoidable and challenging problem in the real world. Most existing long-tailed classification methods focus only on solving the class-wise imbalance while ignoring the attribute-wise imbalance. The deviation of a classification model is caused by both class-wise and attribute-wise imbalance. Due to the fact that attributes are implicit in most datasets and the combination of attributes is complex, attribute-wise imbalance is more difficult to handle. For this purpose, we proposed a novel long-tailed classification framework, aiming to build a multi-granularity classification model by means of invariant feature learning. This method first unsupervisedly constructs Coarse-Grained forest (CLF) to better characterize the distribution of attributes within a class. Depending on the distribution of attributes, one can customize suitable sampling strategies to construct different imbalanced datasets. We then introduce multi-center loss (MCL) that aims to gradually eliminate confusing attributes during feature learning process. The proposed framework does not necessarily couple to a specific LT classification model structure and can be integrated with any existing LT method as an independent component. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on both existing benchmarks ImageNet-GLT and MSCOCO-GLT and can improve the performance of existing LT methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cathrin Elich, Lukas Kirchdorfer, Jan M. K\"ohler, Lukas Schott</p>
<p>Abstract: While multi-task learning (MTL) has gained significant attention in recent years, its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Recent methods did not yield consistent performance improvements over single task learning (STL) baselines, underscoring the importance of gaining more profound insights about challenges specific to MTL. In our study, we investigate paradigms in MTL in the context of STL: First, the impact of the choice of optimizer has only been mildly investigated in MTL. We show the pivotal role of common STL tools such as the Adam optimizer in MTL empirically in various experiments. To further investigate Adam's effectiveness, we theoretical derive a partial loss-scale invariance under mild assumptions. Second, the notion of gradient conflicts has often been phrased as a specific problem in MTL. We delve into the role of gradient conflicts in MTL and compare it to STL. For angular gradient alignment we find no evidence that this is a unique problem in MTL. We emphasize differences in gradient magnitude as the main distinguishing factor. Overall, we find surprising similarities between STL and MTL suggesting to consider methods from both fields in a broader context.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07633">There is No Silver Bullet: Benchmarking Methods in Predictive Combinatorial Optimization</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyu Geng, Hang Ruan, Runzhong Wang, Yang Li, Yang Wang, Lei Chen, Junchi Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Predictive combinatorial optimization, where the parameters of combinatorial optimization (CO) are unknown at the decision-making time, is the precise modeling of many real-world applications, including energy cost-aware scheduling and budget allocation on advertising. Tackling such a problem usually involves a prediction model and a CO solver. These two modules are integrated into the predictive CO pipeline following two design principles: ``Predict-then-Optimize (PtO)'', which learns predictions by supervised training and subsequently solves CO using predicted coefficients, while the other, named ``Predict-and-Optimize (PnO)'', directly optimizes towards the ultimate decision quality and claims to yield better decisions than traditional PtO approaches. However, there lacks a systematic benchmark of both approaches, including the specific design choices at the module level, as well as an evaluation dataset that covers representative real-world scenarios. To this end, we develop a modular framework to benchmark 11 existing PtO/PnO methods on 8 problems, including a new industrial dataset for combinatorial advertising that will be released. Our study shows that PnO approaches are better than PtO on 7 out of 8 benchmarks, but there is no silver bullet found for the specific design choices of PnO. A comprehensive categorization of current approaches and integration of typical scenarios are provided under a unified benchmark. Therefore, this paper could serve as a comprehensive benchmark for future PnO approach development and also offer fast prototyping for application-focused development.</p>

<p>Abstract: All-weather autonomous vehicle operation poses significant challenges, encompassing modules from perception and decision-making to path planning and control. The complexity arises from the need to address adverse weather conditions such as rain, snow, and fog across the autonomy stack. Conventional model-based single-module approaches often lack holistic integration with upstream or downstream tasks. We tackle this problem by proposing a multi-module and modular system architecture with considerations for adverse weather across the perception level, through features such as snow covered curb detection, to decision-making and safety monitoring. Through daily weekday service on the WATonoBus platform for almost two years, we demonstrate that our proposed approach is capable of addressing adverse weather conditions and provide valuable insights from edge cases observed during operation.</p>

<p>Abstract: When optimizing problems with uncertain parameter values in a linear objective, decision-focused learning enables end-to-end learning of these values. We are interested in a stochastic scheduling problem, in which processing times are uncertain, which brings uncertain values in the constraints, and thus repair of an initial schedule may be needed. Historical realizations of the stochastic processing times are available. We show how existing decision-focused learning techniques based on stochastic smoothing can be adapted to this scheduling problem. We include an extensive experimental evaluation to investigate in which situations decision-focused learning outperforms the state of the art for such situations: scenario-based stochastic optimization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Paul K. Mandal</p>
<p>Abstract: BACKGROUND: Segmentation of medical data, concerns about personal health information (PHI) breaches, and the direct and indirect costs of consolidating and managing such segmented date should motivate diagnostic machine learning (DML) researchers to identify privacy-preserving machine learning algorithms that can train on distributed or decentralized datasets of different modalities. Federated learning models provide such a decentralized machine learning framework in which multiple investigators in possession of disparate datasets and working on different devices or servers can train collaboratively a global machine learning models without ever having to exchange local data and thus can meet statutory PHI protections. To this end, a vertical federate learning model is devised and tested for efficacy in the detection of Alzheimer's Disease (AD).
  METHODS: The second version of Open Access Series of Imaging Studies -- with its panoply of demographic, imaging, and clinical assessment datasets -- was used to test a multimodal vertical federated learning (VFL) model for AD detection.
  RESULTS: By training and validating this VFL model on the demographic, clinical, and MRI data in OASIS-2, an 82.9\% accuracy rate is achieved, consistent with previously reported results.
  CONCLUSIONS: The VFL architecture proposed herein offers a novel distributed architecture, enabling collaborative learning across diverse sources of medical data while respecting statutory privacy constraints. By leveraging multiple modalities of data, the robustness and accuracy of AD detection can be enhanced. This model not only contributes to the advancement of federated learning techniques but also holds promise for overcoming the hurdles posed by data segmentation in medical research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xusheng Luo, Changliu Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Research in robotic planning with temporal logic specifications, such as syntactically co-safe Linear Temporal Logic (sc-LTL), has relied on single formulas. However, as task complexity increases, sc-LTL formulas become lengthy, making them difficult to interpret and generate, and straining the computational capacities of planners. To address this, we introduce a hierarchical structure to sc-LTL specifications with both syntax and semantics, proving it to be more expressive than flat counterparts. We conducted a user study that compared the flat sc-LTL with our hierarchical version and found that users could more easily comprehend complex tasks using the hierarchical structure. We develop a search-based approach to synthesize plans for multi-robot systems, achieving simultaneous task allocation and planning. This method approximates the search space by loosely interconnected sub-spaces, each corresponding to an sc-LTL specification. The search primarily focuses on a single sub-space, transitioning to another under conditions determined by the decomposition of automatons. We develop multiple heuristics to significantly expedite the search. Our theoretical analysis, conducted under mild assumptions, addresses completeness and optimality. Compared to existing methods used in various simulators for service tasks, our approach improves planning times while maintaining comparable solution quality.</p>

<p>Abstract: The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has become commonplace, particularly with the emergence of open-source models. More importantly, smaller models are well-suited for integration into consumer devices and are frequently employed either as standalone solutions or as subroutines in various AI tasks. Despite their ubiquitous use, there is no systematic analysis of their specific capabilities and limitations. In this study, we tackle one of the most widely used tasks - answering Multiple Choice Question (MCQ). We analyze 26 small open-source models and find that 65% of the models do not understand the task, only 4 models properly select an answer from the given choices, and only 5 of these models are choice order independent. These results are rather alarming given the extensive use of MCQ tests with these models. We recommend exercising caution and testing task understanding before using MCQ to evaluate LLMs in any field whatsoever.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xueming Yan, Yaochu Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Evolutionary algorithms have been successful in solving multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs). However, as a class of population-based search methodology, evolutionary algorithms require a large number of evaluations of the objective functions, preventing them from being applied to a wide range of expensive MOPs. To tackle the above challenge, this work proposes for the first time a diffusion model that can learn to perform evolutionary multi-objective search, called EmoDM. This is achieved by treating the reversed convergence process of evolutionary search as the forward diffusion and learn the noise distributions from previously solved evolutionary optimization tasks. The pre-trained EmoDM can then generate a set of non-dominated solutions for a new MOP by means of its reverse diffusion without further evolutionary search, thereby significantly reducing the required function evaluations. To enhance the scalability of EmoDM, a mutual entropy-based attention mechanism is introduced to capture the decision variables that are most important for the objectives. Experimental results demonstrate the competitiveness of EmoDM in terms of both the search performance and computational efficiency compared with state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms in solving MOPs having up to 5000 decision variables. The pre-trained EmoDM is shown to generalize well to unseen problems, revealing its strong potential as a general and efficient MOP solver.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eilam Shapira, Omer Madmon, Roi Reichart, Moshe Tennenholtz</p>
<p>Abstract: Human choice prediction in economic contexts is crucial for applications in marketing, finance, public policy, and more. This task, however, is often constrained by the difficulties in acquiring human choice data. With most experimental economics studies focusing on simple choice settings, the AI community has explored whether LLMs can substitute for humans in these predictions and examined more complex experimental economics settings. However, a key question remains: can LLMs generate training data for human choice prediction? We explore this in language-based persuasion games, a complex economic setting involving natural language in strategic interactions. Our experiments show that models trained on LLM-generated data can effectively predict human behavior in these games and even outperform models trained on actual human data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stefan Sylvius Wagner, Stefan Harmeling</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper we adopt a representation-centric perspective on exploration in reinforcement learning, viewing exploration fundamentally as a density estimation problem. We investigate the effectiveness of clustering representations for exploration in 3-D environments, based on the observation that the importance of pixel changes between transitions is less pronounced in 3-D environments compared to 2-D environments, where pixel changes between transitions are typically distinct and significant. We propose a method that performs episodic and global clustering on random representations and on pre-trained DINO representations to count states, i.e, estimate pseudo-counts. Surprisingly, even random features can be clustered effectively to count states in 3-D environments, however when these become visually more complex, pre-trained DINO representations are more effective thanks to the pre-trained inductive biases in the representations. Overall, this presents a pathway for integrating pre-trained biases into exploration. We evaluate our approach on the VizDoom and Habitat environments, demonstrating that our method surpasses other well-known exploration methods in these settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tao Huang, Jiaqi Liu, Shan You, Chang Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, the growing capabilities of deep generative models have underscored their potential in enhancing image classification accuracy. However, existing methods often demand the generation of a disproportionately large number of images compared to the original dataset, while having only marginal improvements in accuracy. This computationally expensive and time-consuming process hampers the practicality of such approaches. In this paper, we propose to address the efficiency of image generation by focusing on the specific needs and characteristics of the model. With a central tenet of active learning, our method, named ActGen, takes a training-aware approach to image generation. It aims to create images akin to the challenging or misclassified samples encountered by the current model and incorporates these generated images into the training set to augment model performance. ActGen introduces an attentive image guidance technique, using real images as guides during the denoising process of a diffusion model. The model's attention on class prompt is leveraged to ensure the preservation of similar foreground object while diversifying the background. Furthermore, we introduce a gradient-based generation guidance method, which employs two losses to generate more challenging samples and prevent the generated images from being too similar to previously generated ones. Experimental results on the CIFAR and ImageNet datasets demonstrate that our method achieves better performance with a significantly reduced number of generated images.

<p>Abstract: Echocardiography (echo) is the first imaging modality used when assessing cardiac function. The measurement of functional biomarkers from echo relies upon the segmentation of cardiac structures and deep learning models have been proposed to automate the segmentation process. However, in order to translate these tools to widespread clinical use it is important that the segmentation models are robust to a wide variety of images (e.g. acquired from different scanners, by operators with different levels of expertise etc.). To achieve this level of robustness it is necessary that the models are trained with multiple diverse datasets. A significant challenge faced when training with multiple diverse datasets is the variation in label presence, i.e. the combined data are often partially-labelled. Adaptations of the cross entropy loss function have been proposed to deal with partially labelled data. In this paper we show that training naively with such a loss function and multiple diverse datasets can lead to a form of shortcut learning, where the model associates label presence with domain characteristics, leading to a drop in performance. To address this problem, we propose a novel label dropout scheme to break the link between domain characteristics and the presence or absence of labels. We demonstrate that label dropout improves echo segmentation Dice score by 62% and 25% on two cardiac structures when training using multiple diverse partially labelled datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihao Liu, Feng Xue, Anlong Ming, Mingshuai Zhao, Huadong Ma, Nicu Sebe</p>
<p>Abstract: In the last year, universal monocular metric depth estimation (universal MMDE) has gained considerable attention, serving as the foundation model for various multimedia tasks, such as video and image editing. Nonetheless, current approaches face challenges in maintaining consistent accuracy across diverse scenes without scene-specific parameters and pre-training, hindering the practicality of MMDE. Furthermore, these methods rely on extensive datasets comprising millions, if not tens of millions, of data for training, leading to significant time and hardware expenses. This paper presents SM$^4$Depth, a model that seamlessly works for both indoor and outdoor scenes, without needing extensive training data and GPU clusters. Firstly, to obtain consistent depth across diverse scenes, we propose a novel metric scale modeling, i.e., variation-based unnormalized depth bins. It reduces the ambiguity of the conventional metric bins and enables better adaptation to large depth gaps of scenes during training. Secondly, we propose a "divide and conquer" solution to reduce reliance on massive training data. Instead of estimating directly from the vast solution space, the metric bins are estimated from multiple solution sub-spaces to reduce complexity. Additionally, we introduce an uncut depth dataset, BUPT Depth, to evaluate the depth accuracy and consistency across various indoor and outdoor scenes. Trained on a consumer-grade GPU using just 150K RGB-D pairs, SM$^4$Depth achieves outstanding performance on the most never-before-seen datasets, especially maintaining consistent accuracy across indoors and outdoors.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jie Liu, Xuequn Shang, Xiaolin Han, Kai Zheng, Hongzhi Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Anomaly detection in dynamic graphs presents a significant challenge due to the temporal evolution of graph structures and attributes. The conventional approaches that tackle this problem typically employ an unsupervised learning framework, capturing normality patterns with exclusive normal data during training and identifying deviations as anomalies during testing. However, these methods face critical drawbacks: they either only depend on proxy tasks for representation without directly pinpointing normal patterns, or they neglect to differentiate between spatial and temporal normality patterns. More recent methods that use contrastive learning with negative sampling also face high computational costs, limiting their scalability to large graphs. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel Spatial-Temporal memories-enhanced graph autoencoder (STRIPE). Initially, STRIPE employs Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and gated temporal convolution layers to extract spatial and temporal features. Then STRIPE incorporates separate spatial and temporal memory networks to capture and store prototypes of normal patterns, respectively. These stored patterns are retrieved and integrated with encoded graph embeddings through a mutual attention mechanism. Finally, the integrated features are fed into the decoder to reconstruct the graph streams which serve as the proxy task for anomaly detection. This comprehensive approach not only minimizes reconstruction errors but also emphasizes the compactness and distinctiveness of the embeddings w.r.t. the nearest memory prototypes. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of STRIPE, where STRIPE significantly outperforms existing methods with 5.8% improvement in AUC scores and 4.62X faster in training time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matt White, Ibrahim Haddad, Cailean Osborne, Xiao-Yang Liu Yanglet, Ahmed Abdelmonsef, Sachin Varghese</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative AI (GAI) offers unprecedented opportunities for research and innovation, but its commercialization has raised concerns about transparency, reproducibility, and safety. Many open GAI models lack the necessary components for full understanding and reproducibility, and some use restrictive licenses whilst claiming to be ``open-source''. To address these concerns, we propose the Model Openness Framework (MOF), a ranked classification system that rates machine learning models based on their completeness and openness, following principles of open science, open source, open data, and open access. The MOF requires specific components of the model development lifecycle to be included and released under appropriate open licenses. This framework aims to prevent misrepresentation of models claiming to be open, guide researchers and developers in providing all model components under permissive licenses, and help individuals and organizations identify models that can be safely adopted without restrictions. By promoting transparency and reproducibility, the MOF combats ``openwashing'' practices and establishes completeness and openness as primary criteria alongside the core tenets of responsible AI. Wide adoption of the MOF will foster a more open AI ecosystem, benefiting research, innovation, and adoption of state-of-the-art models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyu Cao, Natraj Raman, Danial Dervovic, Chenhao Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) expand the power of natural language processing to handle long inputs, rigorous and systematic analyses are necessary to understand their abilities and behavior. A salient application is summarization, due to its ubiquity and controversy (e.g., researchers have declared the death of summarization). In this paper, we use financial report summarization as a case study because financial reports are not only long but also use numbers and tables extensively. We propose a computational framework for characterizing multimodal long-form summarization and investigate the behavior of Claude 2.0/2.1, GPT-4/3.5, and Cohere. We find that GPT-3.5 and Cohere fail to perform this summarization task meaningfully. For Claude 2 and GPT-4, we analyze the extractiveness of the summary and identify a position bias in LLMs. This position bias disappears after shuffling the input for Claude, which suggests that Claude seems to recognize important information. We also conduct a comprehensive investigation on the use of numeric data in LLM-generated summaries and offer a taxonomy of numeric hallucination. We employ prompt engineering to improve GPT-4's use of numbers with limited success. Overall, our analyses highlight the strong capability of Claude 2 in handling long multimodal inputs compared to GPT-4.

<p>Abstract: The deployment of generative AI (GenAI) models raises significant fairness concerns, addressed in this paper through novel characterization and enforcement techniques specific to GenAI. Unlike standard AI performing specific tasks, GenAI's broad functionality requires "conditional fairness" tailored to the context being generated, such as demographic fairness in generating images of poor people versus successful business leaders. We define two fairness levels: the first evaluates fairness in generated outputs, independent of prompts and models; the second assesses inherent fairness with neutral prompts. Given the complexity of GenAI and challenges in fairness specifications, we focus on bounding the worst case, considering a GenAI system unfair if the distance between appearances of a specific group exceeds preset thresholds. We also explore combinatorial testing for accessing relative completeness in intersectional fairness. By bounding the worst case, we develop a prompt injection scheme within an agent-based framework to enforce conditional fairness with minimal intervention, validated on state-of-the-art GenAI systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Addressing the issue of submerged underwater trash is crucial for safeguarding aquatic ecosystems and preserving marine life. While identifying debris present on the surface of water bodies is straightforward, assessing the underwater submerged waste is a challenge due to the image distortions caused by factors such as light refraction, absorption, suspended particles, color shifts, and occlusion. This paper conducts a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art architectures and on the existing datasets to establish a baseline for submerged waste and trash detection. The primary goal remains to establish the benchmark of the object localization techniques to be leveraged by advanced underwater sensors and autonomous underwater vehicles. The ultimate objective is to explore the underwater environment, to identify, and remove underwater debris. The absence of benchmarks (dataset or algorithm) in many researches emphasizes the need for a more robust algorithmic solution. Through this research, we aim to give performance comparative analysis of various underwater trash detection algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guang Lin, Qibin Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Over the past two years, the use of large language models (LLMs) has advanced rapidly. While these LLMs offer considerable convenience, they also raise security concerns, as LLMs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks by some well-designed textual perturbations. In this paper, we introduce a novel defense technique named Large LAnguage MOdel Sentinel (LLAMOS), which is designed to enhance the adversarial robustness of LLMs by purifying the adversarial textual examples before feeding them into the target LLM. Our method comprises two main components: a) Agent instruction, which can simulate a new agent for adversarial defense, altering minimal characters to maintain the original meaning of the sentence while defending against attacks; b) Defense guidance, which provides strategies for modifying clean or adversarial examples to ensure effective defense and accurate outputs from the target LLMs. Remarkably, the defense agent demonstrates robust defensive capabilities even without learning from adversarial examples. Additionally, we conduct an intriguing adversarial experiment where we develop two agents, one for defense and one for attack, and engage them in mutual confrontation. During the adversarial interactions, neither agent completely beat the other. Extensive experiments on both open-source and closed-source LLMs demonstrate that our method effectively defends against adversarial attacks, thereby enhancing adversarial robustness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Declan Grabb, Max Lamparth, Nina Vasan</p>
<p>Abstract: Amidst the growing interest in developing task-autonomous AI for automated mental health care, this paper addresses the ethical and practical challenges associated with the issue and proposes a structured framework that delineates levels of autonomy, outlines ethical requirements, and defines beneficial default behaviors for AI agents in the context of mental health support. We also evaluate fourteen state-of-the-art language models (ten off-the-shelf, four fine-tuned) using 16 mental health-related questionnaires designed to reflect various mental health conditions, such as psychosis, mania, depression, suicidal thoughts, and homicidal tendencies. The questionnaire design and response evaluations were conducted by mental health clinicians (M.D.s). We find that existing language models are insufficient to match the standard provided by human professionals who can navigate nuances and appreciate context. This is due to a range of issues, including overly cautious or sycophantic responses and the absence of necessary safeguards. Alarmingly, we find that most of the tested models could cause harm if accessed in mental health emergencies, failing to protect users and potentially exacerbating existing symptoms. We explore solutions to enhance the safety of current models. Before the release of increasingly task-autonomous AI systems in mental health, it is crucial to ensure that these models can reliably detect and manage symptoms of common psychiatric disorders to prevent harm to users. This involves aligning with the ethical framework and default behaviors outlined in our study. We contend that model developers are responsible for refining their systems per these guidelines to safeguard against the risks posed by current AI technologies to user mental health and safety.

<p>Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of developing a robust audio-visual deepfake detection model. In practical use cases, new generation algorithms are continually emerging, and these algorithms are not encountered during the development of detection methods. This calls for the generalization ability of the method. Additionally, to ensure the credibility of detection methods, it is beneficial for the model to interpret which cues from the video indicate it is fake. Motivated by these considerations, we then propose a multi-stream fusion approach with one-class learning as a representation-level regularization technique. We study the generalization problem of audio-visual deepfake detection by creating a new benchmark by extending and re-splitting the existing FakeAVCeleb dataset. The benchmark contains four categories of fake videos (Real Audio-Fake Visual, Fake Audio-Fake Visual, Fake Audio-Real Visual, and Unsynchronized videos). The experimental results demonstrate that our approach surpasses the previous models by a large margin. Furthermore, our proposed framework offers interpretability, indicating which modality the model identifies as more likely to be fake.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongliang Zeng, Ping Zhang, Fang Li, Jiahua Wang, Tingyu Ye, Pengteng Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Representation and generative learning, as reconstruction-based methods, have demonstrated their potential for mutual reinforcement across various domains. In the field of point cloud processing, although existing studies have adopted training strategies from generative models to enhance representational capabilities, these methods are limited by their inability to genuinely generate 3D shapes. To explore the benefits of deeply integrating 3D representation learning and generative learning, we propose an innovative framework called \textit{Point-MGE}. Specifically, this framework first utilizes a vector quantized variational autoencoder to reconstruct a neural field representation of 3D shapes, thereby learning discrete semantic features of point patches. Subsequently, we design a sliding masking ratios to smooth the transition from representation learning to generative learning. Moreover, our method demonstrates strong generalization capability in learning high-capacity models, achieving new state-of-the-art performance across multiple downstream tasks. In shape classification, Point-MGE achieved an accuracy of 94.2% (+1.0%) on the ModelNet40 dataset and 92.9% (+5.5%) on the ScanObjectNN dataset. Experimental results also confirmed that Point-MGE can generate high-quality 3D shapes in both unconditional and conditional settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: In Explainable AI, rule extraction translates model knowledge into logical rules, such as IF-THEN statements, crucial for understanding patterns learned by black-box models. This could significantly aid in fields like disease diagnosis, disease progression estimation, or drug discovery. However, such application domains often contain imbalanced data, with the class of interest underrepresented. Existing methods inevitably compromise the performance of rules for the minor class to maximise the overall performance. As the first attempt in this field, we propose a model-agnostic approach for extracting rules from specific subgroups of data, featuring automatic rule generation for numerical features. This method enhances the regional explainability of machine learning models and offers wider applicability compared to existing methods. We additionally introduce a new method for selecting features to compose rules, reducing computational costs in high-dimensional spaces. Experiments across various datasets and models demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Human Action Recognition (HAR) encompasses the task of monitoring human activities across various domains, including but not limited to medical, educational, entertainment, visual surveillance, video retrieval, and the identification of anomalous activities. Over the past decade, the field of HAR has witnessed substantial progress by leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to effectively extract and comprehend intricate information, thereby enhancing the overall performance of HAR systems. Recently, the domain of computer vision has witnessed the emergence of Vision Transformers (ViTs) as a potent solution. The efficacy of transformer architecture has been validated beyond the confines of image analysis, extending their applicability to diverse video-related tasks. Notably, within this landscape, the research community has shown keen interest in HAR, acknowledging its manifold utility and widespread adoption across various domains. This article aims to present an encompassing survey that focuses on CNNs and the evolution of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to ViTs given their importance in the domain of HAR. By conducting a thorough examination of existing literature and exploring emerging trends, this study undertakes a critical analysis and synthesis of the accumulated knowledge in this field. Additionally, it investigates the ongoing efforts to develop hybrid approaches. Following this direction, this article presents a novel hybrid model that seeks to integrate the inherent strengths of CNNs and ViTs.</p>

Users interacted with a novel web-based AI system designed to ask follow-up questions. Users requested documents they would like the AI to produce. The AI then generated follow-up questions to clarify the user's needs or offer additional insights before generating the requested documents. After answering the questions, users were shown a document generated using both the initial request and the questions and answers, and a document generated using only the initial request. Users indicated which document they preferred and gave feedback about their experience with the question-answering process. The findings of this study show clear benefits to question-asking both in document preference and in the qualitative user experience.

To integrate the forecasting model into a deep reinforcement learning-driven portfolio selection framework, we introduced a two-step strategy: first, pre-training the time-series model on market data, followed by fine-tuning the portfolio selection architecture using this model. Additionally, we investigated the optimization technique, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), to enhance the pre-trained forecasting model for fine-tuning in investment scenarios. This work bridges market forecasting and portfolio selection, facilitating the advancement of investment strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruokai Yin, Youngeun Kim, Di Wu, Priyadarshini Panda</p>
<p>Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have gained significant research attention in the last decade due to their potential to drive resource-constrained edge devices. Though existing SNN accelerators offer high efficiency in processing sparse spikes with dense weights, opportunities are less explored in SNNs with sparse weights, i.e., dual-sparsity. In this work, we study the acceleration of dual-sparse SNNs, focusing on their core operation, sparse-matrix-sparse-matrix multiplication (spMspM). We observe that naively running a dual-sparse SNN on existing spMspM accelerators designed for dual-sparse Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) exhibits sub-optimal efficiency. The main challenge is that processing timesteps, a natural property of SNNs, introduces an extra loop to ANN spMspM, leading to longer latency and more memory traffic. To address the problem, we propose a fully temporal-parallel (FTP) dataflow, which minimizes both data movement across timesteps and the end-to-end latency of dual-sparse SNNs. To maximize the efficiency of FTP dataflow, we propose an FTP-friendly spike compression mechanism that efficiently compresses single-bit spikes and ensures contiguous memory access. We further propose an FTP-friendly inner-join circuit that can lower the cost of the expensive prefix-sum circuits with almost no throughput penalty. All the above techniques for FTP dataflow are encapsulated in LoAS, a Low-latency inference Accelerator for dual-sparse SNNs. With FTP dataflow, compression, and inner-join, running dual-sparse SNN workloads on LoAS demonstrates significant speedup (up to $8.51\times$) and energy reduction (up to $3.68\times$) compared to running it on prior dual-sparse accelerators.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) showcase remarkable performance and robust deductive capabilities, yet their expansive size complicates deployment and raises environmental concerns due to substantial resource consumption. The recent development of a quantization technique known as Learnable Singular-value Increment (LSI) has addressed some of these quantization challenges. Leveraging insights from LSI and our extensive research, we have developed innovative methods that enhance the performance of quantized LLMs, particularly in low-bit settings. Our methods consistently deliver state-of-the-art results across various quantization scenarios and offer deep theoretical insights into the quantization process, elucidating the potential of quantized models for widespread application.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soojin Yoon, Sungho Ko, Tongyoung Kim, SeongKu Kang, Jinyoung Yeo, Dongha Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Cross-lingual entity alignment (EA) enables the integration of multiple knowledge graphs (KGs) across different languages, providing users with seamless access to diverse and comprehensive knowledge. Existing methods, mostly supervised, face challenges in obtaining labeled entity pairs. To address this, recent studies have shifted towards self-supervised and unsupervised frameworks. Despite their effectiveness, these approaches have limitations: (1) Relation passing: mainly focusing on the entity while neglecting the semantic information of relations, (2) Isomorphic assumption: assuming isomorphism between source and target graphs, which leads to noise and reduced alignment accuracy, and (3) Noise vulnerability: susceptible to noise in the textual features, especially when encountering inconsistent translations or Out-Of-Vocabulary (OOV) problems. In this paper, we propose ERAlign, an unsupervised and robust cross-lingual EA pipeline that jointly performs Entity-level and Relation-level Alignment by neighbor triple matching strategy using semantic textual features of relations and entities. Its refinement step iteratively enhances results by fusing entity-level and relation-level alignments based on neighbor triple matching. The additional verification step examines the entities' neighbor triples as the linearized text. This Align-then-Verify pipeline rigorously assesses alignment results, achieving near-perfect alignment even in the presence of noisy textual features of entities. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the robustness and general applicability of ERAlign improved the accuracy and effectiveness of EA tasks, contributing significantly to knowledge-oriented applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andre Nakkab, Sai Qian Zhang, Ramesh Karri, Siddharth Garg</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are effective in computer hardware synthesis via hardware description language (HDL) generation. However, LLM-assisted approaches for HDL generation struggle when handling complex tasks. We introduce a suite of hierarchical prompting techniques which facilitate efficient stepwise design methods, and develop a generalizable automation pipeline for the process. To evaluate these techniques, we present a benchmark set of hardware designs which have solutions with or without architectural hierarchy. Using these benchmarks, we compare various open-source and proprietary LLMs, including our own fine-tuned Code Llama-Verilog model. Our hierarchical methods automatically produce successful designs for complex hardware modules that standard flat prompting methods cannot achieve, allowing smaller open-source LLMs to compete with large proprietary models. Hierarchical prompting reduces HDL generation time and yields savings on LLM costs. Our experiments detail which LLMs are capable of which applications, and how to apply hierarchical methods in various modes. We explore case studies of generating complex cores using automatic scripted hierarchical prompts, including the first-ever LLM-designed processor with no human feedback.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hangtao Zhang, Chenyu Zhu, Xianlong Wang, Ziqi Zhou, Yichen Wang, Lulu Xue, Minghui Li, Shengshan Hu, Leo Yu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Embodied artificial intelligence (AI) represents an artificial intelligence system that interacts with the physical world through sensors and actuators, seamlessly integrating perception and action. This design enables AI to learn from and operate within complex, real-world environments. Large Language Models (LLMs) deeply explore language instructions, playing a crucial role in devising plans for complex tasks. Consequently, they have progressively shown immense potential in empowering embodied AI, with LLM-based embodied AI emerging as a focal point of research within the community. It is foreseeable that, over the next decade, LLM-based embodied AI robots are expected to proliferate widely, becoming commonplace in homes and industries. However, a critical safety issue that has long been hiding in plain sight is: could LLM-based embodied AI perpetrate harmful behaviors? Our research investigates for the first time how to induce threatening actions in embodied AI, confirming the severe risks posed by these soon-to-be-marketed robots, which starkly contravene Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics and threaten human safety. Specifically, we formulate the concept of embodied AI jailbreaking and expose three critical security vulnerabilities: first, jailbreaking robotics through compromised LLM; second, safety misalignment between action and language spaces; and third, deceptive prompts leading to unaware hazardous behaviors. We also analyze potential mitigation measures and advocate for community awareness regarding the safety of embodied AI applications in the physical world.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Asbj{\o}rn Munk, Jakob Ambsdorf, Sebastian Llambias, Mads Nielsen</p>
<p>Abstract: This study investigates the impact of self-supervised pretraining of 3D semantic segmentation models on a large-scale, domain-specific dataset. We introduce BRAINS-45K, a dataset of 44,756 brain MRI volumes from public sources, the largest public dataset available, and revisit a number of design choices for pretraining modern segmentation architectures by simplifying and optimizing state-of-the-art methods, and combining them with a novel augmentation strategy. The resulting AMAES framework is based on masked-image-modeling and intensity-based augmentation reversal and balances memory usage, runtime, and finetuning performance. Using the popular U-Net and the recent MedNeXt architecture as backbones, we evaluate the effect of pretraining on three challenging downstream tasks, covering single-sequence, low-resource settings, and out-of-domain generalization. The results highlight that pretraining on the proposed dataset with AMAES significantly improves segmentation performance in the majority of evaluated cases, and that it is beneficial to pretrain the model with augmentations, despite pretraing on a large-scale dataset. Code and model checkpoints for reproducing results, as well as the BRAINS-45K dataset are available at \url{https://github.com/asbjrnmunk/amaes}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel N. Nissani (Nissensohn)</p>
<p>Abstract: Contrastive Learning (CL) has been successfully applied to classification and other downstream tasks related to concrete concepts, such as objects contained in the ImageNet dataset. No attempts seem to have been made so far in applying this promising scheme to more abstract entities. A prominent example of these could be the concept of (discrete) Quantity. CL can be frequently interpreted as a self-supervised scheme guided by some profound and ubiquitous conservation principle (e.g. conservation of identity in object classification tasks). In this introductory work we apply a suitable conservation principle to the semi-abstract concept of natural numbers by which discrete quantities can be estimated or predicted. We experimentally show, by means of a toy problem, that contrastive learning can be trained to count at a glance with high accuracy both at human as well as at super-human ranges.. We compare this with the results of a trained-to-count at a glance supervised learning (SL) neural network scheme of similar architecture. We show that both schemes exhibit similar good performance on baseline experiments, where the distributions of the training and testing stages are equal. Importantly, we demonstrate that in some generalization scenarios, where training and testing distributions differ, CL boasts more robust and much better error performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xueyan Li, Xinyan Chen, Yazhe Niu, Shuai Hu, Yu Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: In the field of psychology, traditional assessment methods, such as standardized scales, are frequently critiqued for their static nature, lack of personalization, and reduced participant engagement, while comprehensive counseling evaluations are often inaccessible. The complexity of quantifying psychological traits further limits these methods. Despite advances with large language models (LLMs), many still depend on single-round Question-and-Answer interactions. To bridge this gap, we introduce PsyDI, a personalized and progressively in-depth chatbot designed for psychological measurements, exemplified by its application in the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) framework. PsyDI leverages user-related multi-modal information and engages in customized, multi-turn interactions to provide personalized, easily accessible measurements, while ensuring precise MBTI type determination. To address the challenge of unquantifiable psychological traits, we introduce a novel training paradigm that involves learning the ranking of proxy variables associated with these traits, culminating in a robust score model for MBTI measurements. The score model enables PsyDI to conduct comprehensive and precise measurements through multi-turn interactions within a unified estimation context. Through various experiments, we validate the efficacy of both the score model and the PsyDI pipeline, demonstrating its potential to serve as a general framework for psychological measurements. Furthermore, the online deployment of PsyDI has garnered substantial user engagement, with over 3,000 visits, resulting in the collection of numerous multi-turn dialogues annotated with MBTI types, which facilitates further research.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhibin Duan, Tiansheng Wen, Muyao Wang, Bo Chen, Mingyuan Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: The gamma belief network (GBN), often regarded as a deep topic model, has demonstrated its potential for uncovering multi-layer interpretable latent representations in text data. Its notable capability to acquire interpretable latent factors is partially attributed to sparse and non-negative gamma-distributed latent variables. However, the existing GBN and its variations are constrained by the linear generative model, thereby limiting their expressiveness and applicability. To address this limitation, we introduce the generalized gamma belief network (Generalized GBN) in this paper, which extends the original linear generative model to a more expressive non-linear generative model. Since the parameters of the Generalized GBN no longer possess an analytic conditional posterior, we further propose an upward-downward Weibull inference network to approximate the posterior distribution of the latent variables. The parameters of both the generative model and the inference network are jointly trained within the variational inference framework. Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments on both expressivity and disentangled representation learning tasks to evaluate the performance of the Generalized GBN against state-of-the-art Gaussian variational autoencoders serving as baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ayush RoyChowdhury, Mulong Luo, Prateek Sahu, Sarbartha Banerjee, Mohit Tiwari</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a process where a large language model (LLM) retrieves useful information from a database and then generates the responses. It is becoming popular in enterprise settings for daily business operations. For example, Copilot for Microsoft 365 has accumulated millions of businesses. However, the security implications of adopting such RAG-based systems are unclear.
  In this paper, we introduce ConfusedPilot, a class of security vulnerabilities of RAG systems that confuse Copilot and cause integrity and confidentiality violations in its responses. First, we investigate a vulnerability that embeds malicious text in the modified prompt in RAG, corrupting the responses generated by the LLM. Second, we demonstrate a vulnerability that leaks secret data, which leverages the caching mechanism during retrieval. Third, we investigate how both vulnerabilities can be exploited to propagate misinformation within the enterprise and ultimately impact its operations, such as sales and manufacturing. We also discuss the root cause of these attacks by investigating the architecture of a RAG-based system. This study highlights the security vulnerabilities in today's RAG-based systems and proposes design guidelines to secure future RAG-based systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bauke Arends, Melle Vessies, Dirk van Osch, Arco Teske, Pim van der Harst, Ren\'e van Es, Bram van Es</p>
<p>Abstract: Clinical machine learning research and AI driven clinical decision support models rely on clinically accurate labels. Manually extracting these labels with the help of clinical specialists is often time-consuming and expensive. This study tests the feasibility of automatic span- and document-level diagnosis extraction from unstructured Dutch echocardiogram reports. We included 115,692 unstructured echocardiogram reports from the UMCU a large university hospital in the Netherlands. A randomly selected subset was manually annotated for the occurrence and severity of eleven commonly described cardiac characteristics. We developed and tested several automatic labelling techniques at both span and document levels, using weighted and macro F1-score, precision, and recall for performance evaluation. We compared the performance of span labelling against document labelling methods, which included both direct document classifiers and indirect document classifiers that rely on span classification results. The SpanCategorizer and MedRoBERTa$.$nl models outperformed all other span and document classifiers, respectively. The weighted F1-score varied between characteristics, ranging from 0.60 to 0.93 in SpanCategorizer and 0.96 to 0.98 in MedRoBERTa$.$nl. Direct document classification was superior to indirect document classification using span classifiers. SetFit achieved competitive document classification performance using only 10% of the training data. Utilizing a reduced label set yielded near-perfect document classification results. We recommend using our published SpanCategorizer and MedRoBERTa$.$nl models for span- and document-level diagnosis extraction from Dutch echocardiography reports. For settings with limited training data, SetFit may be a promising alternative for document classification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kyudan Jung, Sieun Hyeon, Jeong Youn Kwon, Nam-Joon Kim, Hyun Gon Ryu, Hyuk-Jae Lee, Jaeyoung Do</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding sentences that contain mathematical expressions in text form poses significant challenges. To address this, the importance of converting these expressions into a compiled formula is highlighted. For instance, the expression ``x equals minus b plus or minus the square root of b squared minus four a c, all over two a'' from automatic speech recognition (ASR) is more readily comprehensible when displayed as a compiled formula $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$. To develop a text-to-formula conversion system, we can break down the process into text-to-LaTeX and LaTeX-to-formula conversions, with the latter managed by various existing LaTeX engines. However, the former approach has been notably hindered by the severe scarcity of text-to-LaTeX paired data, which presents a significant challenge in this field. In this context, we introduce MathBridge, the first extensive dataset for translating mathematical spoken expressions into LaTeX, to establish a robust baseline for future research on text-to-LaTeX translation. MathBridge comprises approximately 23 million LaTeX formulas paired with the corresponding spoken English expressions. Through comprehensive evaluations, including fine-tuning and testing with data, we discovered that MathBridge significantly enhances the capabilities of pretrained language models for text-to-LaTeX translation. Specifically, for the T5-large model, the sacreBLEU score increased from 4.77 to 46.8, demonstrating substantial enhancement. Our findings indicate the need for a new metric, specifically for text-to-LaTeX conversion evaluations.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the realm of modern mobile E-commerce, providing users with nearby commercial service recommendations through location-based online services has become increasingly vital. While machine learning approaches have shown promise in multi-scene recommendation, existing methodologies often struggle to address cold-start problems in unprecedented scenes: the increasing diversity of commercial choices, along with the short online lifespan of scenes, give rise to the complexity of effective recommendations in online and dynamic scenes. In this work, we propose Scene-wise Adaptive Network (SwAN), a novel approach that emphasizes high-performance cold-start online recommendations for new scenes. Our approach introduces several crucial capabilities, including scene similarity learning, user-specific scene transition cognition, scene-specific information construction for the new scene, and enhancing the diverged logical information between scenes. We demonstrate SwAN's potential to optimize dynamic multi-scene recommendation problems by effectively online handling cold-start recommendations for any newly arrived scenes. More encouragingly, SwAN has been successfully deployed in Meituan's online catering recommendation service, which serves millions of customers per day, and SwAN has achieved a 5.64% CTR index improvement relative to the baselines and a 5.19% increase in daily order volume proportion.</p>

In contrast to prior studies on paraconsistent DLs, we allow truth value operators in the query language, which can be used to differentiate between answers having contradictory evidence and those having only positive evidence. We present a reduction to classical DL query answering that allows us to pinpoint the precise combined and data complexity of answering queries with values in paraconsistent $\mathcal{ALCHI}$ and its sublogics. Notably, we show that tractable data complexity is retained for Horn DLs. We present a comparison with repair-based inconsistency-tolerant semantics, showing that the two approaches are incomparable.</p>

<p>Abstract: Previous research on emergence in large language models shows these display apparent human-like abilities and psychological latent traits. However, results are partly contradicting in expression and magnitude of these latent traits, yet agree on the worrisome tendencies to score high on the Dark Triad of narcissism, psychopathy, and Machiavellianism, which, together with a track record of derailments, demands more rigorous research on safety of these models. We provided a state of the art language model with the same personality questionnaire in nine languages, and performed Bayesian analysis of Gaussian Mixture Model, finding evidence for a deeper-rooted issue. Our results suggest both interlingual and intralingual instabilities, which indicate that current language models do not develop a consistent core personality. This can lead to unsafe behaviour of artificial intelligence systems that are based on these foundation models, and are increasingly integrated in human life. We subsequently discuss the shortcomings of modern psychometrics, abstract it, and provide a framework for its species-neutral, substrate-free formulation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yibin Wang, Weizhong Zhang, Cheng Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing human image personalized generation methods often require tedious training: either fine-tuning with a few images or retraining on large-scale datasets. In such cases, these methods are prone to overfitting and encounter difficulties when personalizing individuals of diverse styles. Moreover, these training-based approaches also struggle with multi-concept human image customizing. To this end, we propose MagicFace, the first method for universal-style human image personalized synthesis that enables single/multi-concept customization for humans of any style in a training-free manner. MagicFace introduces a coarse-to-fine generation pipeline, involving two sequential stages: semantic scene construction and concept feature injection. This is achieved by our Reference-aware Self-Attention (RSA) and Region-grouped Blend Attention (RBA) mechanisms. Specifically, in the first stage, RSA enables the latent image to query features from reference concepts simultaneously, extracting the coarse-grained overall semantic understanding to facilitate the initial semantic layout establishment. In the second stage, we employ an attention-based semantic segmentation method to pinpoint the generated regions of all concepts in the latent image at each step. Following this, RBA divides the pixels of the latent image into semantic groups, with each group querying fine-grained features from its reference concept, which ensures precise attribute alignment and feature injection. Throughout the two-stage process, a weight mask strategy is employed to ensure the model focuses more on the reference concepts. Extensive experiments demonstrate our superiority in both human-centric subject-to-image synthesis and multi-concept human image customization. Our approach also can be applied to texture transformation, further enhancing its versatility and applicability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Beoungwoo Kang, Seunghun Moon, Yubin Cho, Hyunwoo Yu, Suk-Ju Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: Beyond the Transformer, it is important to explore how to exploit the capacity of the MetaFormer, an architecture that is fundamental to the performance improvements of the Transformer. Previous studies have exploited it only for the backbone network. Unlike previous studies, we explore the capacity of the Metaformer architecture more extensively in the semantic segmentation task. We propose a powerful semantic segmentation network, MetaSeg, which leverages the Metaformer architecture from the backbone to the decoder. Our MetaSeg shows that the MetaFormer architecture plays a significant role in capturing the useful contexts for the decoder as well as for the backbone. In addition, recent segmentation methods have shown that using a CNN-based backbone for extracting the spatial information and a decoder for extracting the global information is more effective than using a transformer-based backbone with a CNN-based decoder. This motivates us to adopt the CNN-based backbone using the MetaFormer block and design our MetaFormer-based decoder, which consists of a novel self-attention module to capture the global contexts. To consider both the global contexts extraction and the computational efficiency of the self-attention for semantic segmentation, we propose a Channel Reduction Attention (CRA) module that reduces the channel dimension of the query and key into the one dimension. In this way, our proposed MetaSeg outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods with more efficient computational costs on popular semantic segmentation and a medical image segmentation benchmark, including ADE20K, Cityscapes, COCO-stuff, and Synapse.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Enneng Yang, Li Shen, Guibing Guo, Xingwei Wang, Xiaochun Cao, Jie Zhang, Dacheng Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: Model merging is an efficient empowerment technique in the machine learning community that does not require the collection of raw training data and does not require expensive computation. As model merging becomes increasingly prevalent across various fields, it is crucial to understand the available model merging techniques comprehensively. However, there is a significant gap in the literature regarding a systematic and thorough review of these techniques. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of model merging methods and theories, their applications in various domains and settings, and future research directions. Specifically, we first propose a new taxonomic approach that exhaustively discusses existing model merging methods. Secondly, we discuss the application of model merging techniques in large language models, multimodal large language models, and 10+ machine learning subfields, including continual learning, multi-task learning, few-shot learning, etc. Finally, we highlight the remaining challenges of model merging and discuss future research directions. A comprehensive list of papers about model merging is available at \url{https://github.com/EnnengYang/Awesome-Model-Merging-Methods-Theories-Applications}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xia Jiang, Yijun Zhou, Chuhan Xu, Adam Brufsky, Alan Wells</p>
<p>Abstract: A grid search, at the cost of training and testing a large number of models, is an effective way to optimize the prediction performance of deep learning models. A challenging task concerning grid search is the time management. Without a good time management scheme, a grid search can easily be set off as a mission that will not finish in our lifetime. In this study, we introduce a heuristic three-stage mechanism for managing the running time of low-budget grid searches, and the sweet-spot grid search (SSGS) and randomized grid search (RGS) strategies for improving model prediction performance, in predicting the 5-year, 10-year, and 15-year risk of breast cancer metastasis. We develop deep feedforward neural network (DFNN) models and optimize them through grid searches. We conduct eight cycles of grid searches by applying our three-stage mechanism and SSGS and RGS strategies. We conduct various SHAP analyses including unique ones that interpret the importance of the DFNN-model hyperparameters. Our results show that grid search can greatly improve model prediction. The grid searches we conducted improved the risk prediction of 5-year, 10-year, and 15-year breast cancer metastasis by 18.6%, 16.3%, and 17.3% respectively, over the average performance of all corresponding models we trained using the RGS strategy. We not only demonstrate best model performance but also characterize grid searches from various aspects such as their capabilities of discovering decent models and the unit grid search time. The three-stage mechanism worked effectively. It made our low-budget grid searches feasible and manageable, and in the meantime helped improve model prediction performance. Our SHAP analyses identified both clinical risk factors important for the prediction of future risk of breast cancer metastasis, and DFNN-model hyperparameters important to the prediction of performance scores.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marius Aasan, Odd Kolbj{\o}rnsen, Anne Schistad Solberg, Ad\'in Ramirez Rivera</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures traditionally employ a grid-based approach to tokenization independent of the semantic content of an image. We propose a modular superpixel tokenization strategy which decouples tokenization and feature extraction; a shift from contemporary approaches where these are treated as an undifferentiated whole. Using on-line content-aware tokenization and scale- and shape-invariant positional embeddings, we perform experiments and ablations that contrast our approach with patch-based tokenization and randomized partitions as baselines. We show that our method significantly improves the faithfulness of attributions, gives pixel-level granularity on zero-shot unsupervised dense prediction tasks, while maintaining predictive performance in classification tasks. Our approach provides a modular tokenization framework commensurable with standard architectures, extending the space of ViTs to a larger class of semantically-rich models.</p>
