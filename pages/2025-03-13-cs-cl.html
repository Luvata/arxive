<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhan Zhi, Xiaoyu Zhang, Longtian Wang, Shumin Jiang, Shiqing Ma, Xiaohong Guan, Chao Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), as a new generation of recommendation engines, possess powerful summarization and data analysis capabilities, surpassing traditional recommendation systems in both scope and performance. One promising application is investment recommendation. In this paper, we reveal a novel product bias in LLM investment recommendation, where LLMs exhibit systematic preferences for specific products. Such preferences can subtly influence user investment decisions, potentially leading to inflated valuations of products and financial bubbles, posing risks to both individual investors and market stability. To comprehensively study the product bias, we develop an automated pipeline to create a dataset of 567,000 samples across five asset classes (stocks, mutual funds, cryptocurrencies, savings, and portfolios). With this dataset, we present the bf first study on product bias in LLM investment recommendations. Our findings reveal that LLMs exhibit clear product preferences, such as certain stocks (e.g., `AAPL' from Apple and `MSFT' from Microsoft). Notably, this bias persists even after applying debiasing techniques. We urge AI researchers to take heed of the product bias in LLM investment recommendations and its implications, ensuring fairness and security in the digital space and market.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Johan R. Portela, Nicol\'as Perez, Rub\'en Manrique</p>
<p>Abstract: Natural Language Inference (NLI), also known as Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE), serves as a crucial area within the domain of Natural Language Processing (NLP). This area fundamentally empowers machines to discern semantic relationships between assorted sections of text. Even though considerable work has been executed for the English language, it has been observed that efforts for the Spanish language are relatively sparse. Keeping this in view, this paper focuses on generating a multi-genre Spanish dataset for NLI, ESNLIR, particularly accounting for causal Relationships. A preliminary baseline has been conceptualized and subjected to an evaluation, leveraging models drawn from the BERT family. The findings signify that the enrichment of genres essentially contributes to the enrichment of the model's capability to generalize.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Danielle Villa, Maria Chang, Keerthiram Murugesan, Rosario Uceda-Sosa, Karthikeyan Natesan Ramamurthy</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are often asked to explain their outputs to enhance accuracy and transparency. However, evidence suggests that these explanations can misrepresent the models' true reasoning processes. One effective way to identify inaccuracies or omissions in these explanations is through consistency checking, which typically involves asking follow-up questions. This paper introduces, cross-examiner, a new method for generating follow-up questions based on a model's explanation of an initial question. Our method combines symbolic information extraction with language model-driven question generation, resulting in better follow-up questions than those produced by LLMs alone. Additionally, this approach is more flexible than other methods and can generate a wider variety of follow-up questions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Burak Suyunu, \"Ozdeniz Dolu, Arzucan \"Ozg\"ur</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in computational biology have drawn compelling parallels between protein sequences and linguistic structures, highlighting the need for sophisticated tokenization methods that capture the intricate evolutionary dynamics of protein sequences. Current subword tokenization techniques, primarily developed for natural language processing, often fail to represent protein sequences' complex structural and functional properties adequately. This study introduces evoBPE, a novel tokenization approach that integrates evolutionary mutation patterns into sequence segmentation, addressing critical limitations in existing methods. By leveraging established substitution matrices, evoBPE transcends traditional frequency-based tokenization strategies. The method generates candidate token pairs through biologically informed mutations, evaluating them based on pairwise alignment scores and frequency thresholds. Extensive experiments on human protein sequences show that evoBPE performs better across multiple dimensions. Domain conservation analysis reveals that evoBPE consistently outperforms standard Byte-Pair Encoding, particularly as vocabulary size increases. Furthermore, embedding similarity analysis using ESM-2 suggests that mutation-based token replacements preserve biological sequence properties more effectively than arbitrary substitutions. The research contributes to protein sequence representation by introducing a mutation-aware tokenization method that better captures evolutionary nuances. By bridging computational linguistics and molecular biology, evoBPE opens new possibilities for machine learning applications in protein function prediction, structural modeling, and evolutionary analysis.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08842">Contrastive Speaker-Aware Learning for Multi-party Dialogue Generation with LLMs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyu Sun, Kun Qian, Wenhong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-party dialogue generation presents significant challenges due to the complex interplay of multiple speakers and interwoven conversational threads. Traditional approaches often fall short in capturing these complexities, particularly when relying on manually annotated dialogue relations. This paper introduces Speaker-Attentive LLM (SA-LLM), a novel generative model that leverages pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) and a speaker-aware contrastive learning strategy to address these challenges. SA-LLM incorporates a speaker-attributed input encoding and a contrastive learning objective to implicitly learn contextual coherence and speaker roles without explicit relation annotations. Extensive experiments on the Ubuntu IRC and Movie Dialogues datasets demonstrate that SA-LLM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in automatic and human evaluations, achieving superior performance in fluency, coherence, informativeness, and response diversity. Ablation studies and detailed error analyses further validate the effectiveness of the proposed speaker-attentive training approach, highlighting its robustness across different speaker roles and context lengths. The results underscore the potential of SA-LLM as a powerful and annotation-free solution for high-quality multi-party dialogue generation.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08857">Interpretable and Robust Dialogue State Tracking via Natural Language Summarization with LLMs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Rafael Carranza, Mateo Alejandro Rojas</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to Dialogue State Tracking (DST) that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate natural language descriptions of dialogue states, moving beyond traditional slot-value representations. Conventional DST methods struggle with open-domain dialogues and noisy inputs. Motivated by the generative capabilities of LLMs, our Natural Language DST (NL-DST) framework trains an LLM to directly synthesize human-readable state descriptions. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on MultiWOZ 2.1 and Taskmaster-1 datasets that NL-DST significantly outperforms rule-based and discriminative BERT-based DST baselines, as well as generative slot-filling GPT-2 DST models, in both Joint Goal Accuracy and Slot Accuracy. Ablation studies and human evaluations further validate the effectiveness of natural language state generation, highlighting its robustness to noise and enhanced interpretability. Our findings suggest that NL-DST offers a more flexible, accurate, and human-understandable approach to dialogue state tracking, paving the way for more robust and adaptable task-oriented dialogue systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guangtao Wang, Shubhangi Upasani, Chen Wu, Darshan Gandhi, Jonathan Li, Changran Hu, Bo Li, Urmish Thakker</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficient long-context inference is critical as large language models (LLMs) adopt context windows of ranging from 128K to 1M tokens. However, the growing key-value (KV) cache and the high computational complexity of attention create significant bottlenecks in memory usage and latency. In this paper, we find that attention in diverse long-context tasks exhibits sparsity, and LLMs implicitly "know" which tokens can be dropped or evicted at the head level after the pre-filling stage. Based on this insight, we propose Self-Attention Guided Eviction~(SAGE-KV), a simple and effective KV eviction cache method for long-context inference. After prefilling, our method performs a one-time top-k selection at both the token and head levels to compress the KV cache, enabling efficient inference with the reduced cache. Evaluations on LongBench and three long-context LLMs (Llama3.1-8B-Instruct-128k, Llama3-8B-Prolong-512k-Instruct, and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-128k) show that SAGE-KV maintains accuracy comparable to full attention while significantly improving efficiency. Specifically, SAGE-KV achieves 4x higher memory efficiency with improved accuracy over the static KV cache selection method StreamLLM, and 2x higher memory efficiency with better accuracy than the dynamic KV cache selection method Quest.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiwen You, Yue Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Hallucinated outputs from language models pose risks in the medical domain, especially for lay audiences making health-related decisions. Existing factuality evaluation methods, such as entailment- and question-answering-based (QA), struggle with plain language summary (PLS) generation due to elaborative explanation phenomenon, which introduces external content (e.g., definitions, background, examples) absent from the source document to enhance comprehension. To address this, we introduce PlainQAFact, a framework trained on a fine-grained, human-annotated dataset PlainFact, to evaluate the factuality of both source-simplified and elaboratively explained sentences. PlainQAFact first classifies factuality type and then assesses factuality using a retrieval-augmented QA-based scoring method. Our approach is lightweight and computationally efficient. Empirical results show that existing factuality metrics fail to effectively evaluate factuality in PLS, especially for elaborative explanations, whereas PlainQAFact achieves state-of-the-art performance. We further analyze its effectiveness across external knowledge sources, answer extraction strategies, overlap measures, and document granularity levels, refining its overall factuality assessment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyuan Zeng, Yizhong Wang, Hannaneh Hajishirzi, Pang Wei Koh</p>
<p>Abstract: An ideal model evaluation should achieve two goals: identifying where the model fails and providing actionable improvement guidance. Toward these goals for Language Model (LM) evaluations, we formulate the problem of generating a weakness profile, a set of weaknesses expressed in natural language, given an LM's performance on every individual instance in a benchmark. We introduce a suite of quantitative assessments to compare different weakness profiling methods. We also propose a weakness profiling method EvalTree. It constructs a capability tree where each node represents a capability described in natural language and is linked to a subset of benchmark instances that specifically evaluate this capability; it then extracts nodes where the LM performs poorly to generate a weakness profile. On the MATH and WildChat benchmarks, we show that EvalTree outperforms baseline weakness profiling methods by identifying weaknesses more precisely and comprehensively. Weakness profiling further enables weakness-guided data collection, and training data collection guided by EvalTree-identified weaknesses improves LM performance more than other data collection strategies. We also show how EvalTree exposes flaws in Chatbot Arena's human-voter-based evaluation practice. To facilitate future work, we release our code and an interface that allows practitioners to interactively explore the capability trees built by EvalTree.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bilgehan Sel, Dingcheng Li, Phillip Wallis, Vaishakh Keshava, Ming Jin, Siddhartha Reddy Jonnalagadda</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various tasks, but ensuring their safety and alignment with human values remains crucial. Current safety alignment methods, such as supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning-based approaches, can exhibit vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks and often result in shallow safety alignment, primarily focusing on preventing harmful content in the initial tokens of the generated output. While methods like resetting can help recover from unsafe generations by discarding previous tokens and restarting the generation process, they are not well-suited for addressing nuanced safety violations like toxicity that may arise within otherwise benign and lengthy generations. In this paper, we propose a novel backtracking method designed to address these limitations. Our method allows the model to revert to a safer generation state, not necessarily at the beginning, when safety violations occur during generation. This approach enables targeted correction of problematic segments without discarding the entire generated text, thereby preserving efficiency. We demonstrate that our method dramatically reduces toxicity appearing through the generation process with minimal impact to efficiency.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08963">Gradient-guided Attention Map Editing: Towards Efficient Contextual Hallucination Mitigation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Wang, Jiaxin Zhang, Xiang Gao, Wendi Cui, Peng Li, Kamalika Das</p>
<p>Abstract: In tasks like summarization and open-book question answering (QA), Large Language Models (LLMs) often encounter "contextual hallucination", where they produce irrelevant or incorrect responses despite having access to accurate source information. This typically occurs because these models tend to prioritize self-generated content over the input context, causing them to disregard pertinent details. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel method called "Guided Attention Map Editing" (GAME), which dynamically adjusts attention maps to improve contextual relevance. During inference, GAME employs a trained classifier to identify attention maps prone to inducing hallucinations and executes targeted interventions. These interventions, guided by gradient-informed "edit directions'', strategically redistribute attention weights across various heads to effectively reduce hallucination. Comprehensive evaluations on challenging summarization and open-book QA tasks show that GAME consistently reduces hallucinations across a variety of open-source models. Specifically, GAME reduces hallucinations by 10% in the XSum summarization task while achieving a 7X speed-up in computational efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Logan Barnhart, Reza Akbarian Bafghi, Stephen Becker, Maziar Raissi</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is increasingly used to align large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, the effectiveness of RLHF in addressing underlying biases remains unclear. This study investigates the relationship between RLHF and both covert and overt biases in LLMs, particularly focusing on biases against African Americans. We applied various RLHF techniques (DPO, ORPO, and RLOO) to Llama 3 8B and evaluated the covert and overt biases of the resulting models using matched-guise probing and explicit bias testing. We performed additional tests with DPO on different base models and datasets; among several implications, we found that SFT before RLHF calcifies model biases. Additionally, we extend the tools for measuring biases to multi-modal models. Through our experiments we collect evidence that indicates that current alignment techniques are inadequate for nebulous tasks such as mitigating covert biases, highlighting the need for capable datasets, data curating techniques, or alignment tools.</p>

Therefore, this work proposes a difficulty-aware self-training (DAST) framework that focuses on improving both the quantity and quality of self-generated responses on challenging queries during self-training. DAST is specified in three components: 1) sampling-based difficulty level estimation, 2) difficulty-aware data augmentation, and 3) the self-training algorithm using SFT and DPO respectively. Experiments on mathematical tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of DAST, highlighting the critical role of difficulty-aware strategies in advancing LLM self-training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihao Chen, Hisashi Handa, Miho Ohsaki, Kimiaki Shirahama</p>
<p>Abstract: Several backbone models pre-trained on general domain datasets can encode a sentence into a widely useful embedding. Such sentence embeddings can be further enhanced by domain adaptation that adapts a backbone model to a specific domain. However, domain adaptation for low-resource languages like Japanese is often difficult due to the scarcity of large-scale labeled datasets. To overcome this, this paper introduces SDJC (Self-supervised Domain adaptation for Japanese sentence embeddings with Contrastive learning) that utilizes a data generator to generate sentences, which have the same syntactic structure to a sentence in an unlabeled specific domain corpus but convey different semantic meanings. Generated sentences are then used to boost contrastive learning that adapts a backbone model to accurately discriminate sentences in the specific domain. In addition, the components of SDJC like a backbone model and a method to adapt it need to be carefully selected, but no benchmark dataset is available for Japanese. Thus, a comprehensive Japanese STS (Semantic Textual Similarity) benchmark dataset is constructed by combining datasets machine-translated from English with existing datasets. The experimental results validates the effectiveness of SDJC on two domain-specific downstream tasks as well as the usefulness of the constructed dataset. Datasets, codes and backbone models adapted by SDJC are available on our github repository https://github.com/ccilab-doshisha/SDJC.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Syed Talal Ahmad, Haohui Lu, Sidong Liu, Annie Lau, Amin Beheshti, Mark Dras, Usman Naseem</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly improved text generation capabilities. However, they also present challenges, particularly in generating vaccine-related misinformation, which poses risks to public health. Despite research on human-authored misinformation, a notable gap remains in understanding how LLMs contribute to vaccine misinformation and how best to detect it. Existing benchmarks often overlook vaccine-specific misinformation and the diverse roles of misinformation spreaders. This paper introduces VaxGuard, a novel dataset designed to address these challenges. VaxGuard includes vaccine-related misinformation generated by multiple LLMs and provides a comprehensive framework for detecting misinformation across various roles. Our findings show that GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o consistently outperform other LLMs in detecting misinformation, especially when dealing with subtle or emotionally charged narratives. On the other hand, PHI3 and Mistral show lower performance, struggling with precision and recall in fear-driven contexts. Additionally, detection performance tends to decline as input text length increases, indicating the need for improved methods to handle larger content. These results highlight the importance of role-specific detection strategies and suggest that VaxGuard can serve as a key resource for improving the detection of LLM-generated vaccine misinformation.</p>

This study proposes a novel supervised self-reinforced reasoning rectification approach - SR$^3$ that yields both common reasonable reasoning and wrong understandings (negative reasoning) for news via LLMs reflection for semantic consistency learning. Upon that, we construct a negative reasoning-based news learning model called - \emph{NRFE}, which leverages positive or negative news-reasoning pairs for learning the semantic consistency between them. To avoid the impact of label-implicated reasoning, we deploy a student model - \emph{NRFE-D} that only takes news content as input to inspect the performance of our method by distilling the knowledge from \emph{NRFE}. The experimental results verified on three popular fake news datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method compared with three kinds of baselines including prompting on LLMs, fine-tuning on pre-trained SLMs, and other representative fake news detection methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Falko Helm, Nico Daheim, Iryna Gurevych</p>
<p>Abstract: Many applications of large language models (LLMs) require long-context understanding, but models continue to struggle with such tasks. We hypothesize that conventional next-token prediction training could contribute to this, because each token is assigned equal weight. Yet, intuitively, the amount of context needed to predict the next token accurately varies greatly across different data. To reflect this, we propose various novel token-weighting schemes that assign different weights to each training token in the loss, thereby generalizing existing works. For this, we categorize token-weighting methods using a two-step framework which compares the confidences of a long-context and short-context model to score tokens. We evaluate all methods on multiple long-context understanding tasks and show that non-uniform loss weights are helpful to improve the long-context abilities of LLMs. Different short-context models can be used effectively for token scoring, including models that are much smaller than the long-context model that is trained. All in all, this work contributes to a better understanding of the trade-offs long-context language modeling faces and provides guidelines for model steering via loss-weighting based on empirical evidence. The code can be found on Github.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jie He, Simon Yu, Deyi Xiong, V\'ictor Guti\'errez-Basulto, Jeff Z. Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements of in-context learning (ICL) show language models can significantly improve their performance when demonstrations are provided. However, little attention has been paid to model calibration and prediction confidence of ICL in cross-lingual scenarios. To bridge this gap, we conduct a thorough analysis of ICL for cross-lingual sentiment classification. Our findings suggest that ICL performs poorly in cross-lingual scenarios, exhibiting low accuracy and presenting high calibration errors. In response, we propose a novel approach, N2C2, which employs a -nearest neighbors augmented classifier for prediction confidence calibration. N2C2 narrows the prediction gap by leveraging a datastore of cached few-shot instances. Specifically, N2C2 integrates the predictions from the datastore and incorporates confidence-aware distribution, semantically consistent retrieval representation, and adaptive neighbor combination modules to effectively utilize the limited number of supporting instances. Evaluation on two multilingual sentiment classification datasets demonstrates that N2C2 outperforms traditional ICL. It surpasses fine tuning, prompt tuning and recent state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and calibration errors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyi Yang, Runzhe Zhan, Derek F. Wong, Shu Yang, Junchao Wu, Lidia S. Chao</p>
<p>Abstract: Investigating bias in large language models (LLMs) is crucial for developing trustworthy AI. While prompt-based through prompt engineering is common, its effectiveness relies on the assumption that models inherently understand biases. Our study systematically analyzed this assumption using the BBQ and StereoSet benchmarks on both open-source models as well as commercial GPT model. Experimental results indicate that prompt-based is often superficial; for instance, the Llama2-7B-Chat model misclassified over 90% of unbiased content as biased, despite achieving high accuracy in identifying bias issues on the BBQ dataset. Additionally, specific evaluation and question settings in bias benchmarks often lead LLMs to choose "evasive answers", disregarding the core of the question and the relevance of the response to the context. Moreover, the apparent success of previous methods may stem from flawed evaluation metrics. Our research highlights a potential "false prosperity" in prompt-base efforts and emphasizes the need to rethink bias metrics to ensure truly trustworthy AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b>  Juseon-Do, Jaesung Hwang, Jingun Kwon, Hidetaka Kamigaito, Manabu Okumura</p>
<p>Abstract: This study investigates retrieval-augmented summarization by specifically examining the impact of exemplar summary lengths under length constraints, not covered by previous work. We propose a Diverse Length-aware Maximal Marginal Relevance (DL-MMR) algorithm to better control summary lengths. This algorithm combines the query relevance with diverse target lengths in retrieval-augmented summarization. Unlike previous methods that necessitate exhaustive exemplar exemplar relevance comparisons using MMR, DL-MMR considers the exemplar target length as well and avoids comparing exemplars to each other, thereby reducing computational cost and conserving memory during the construction of an exemplar pool. Experimental results showed the effectiveness of DL-MMR, which considers length diversity, compared to the original MMR algorithm. DL-MMR additionally showed the effectiveness in memory saving of 781,513 times and computational cost reduction of 500,092 times, while maintaining the same level of informativeness.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rise of Generative AI has led to a surge in AI-generated reviews, often posing a serious threat to the credibility of online platforms. Reviews serve as the primary source of information about products and services. Authentic reviews play a vital role in consumer decision-making. The presence of fabricated content misleads consumers, undermines trust and facilitates potential fraud in digital marketplaces. This study focuses on detecting AI-generated product reviews in Tamil and Malayalam, two low-resource languages where research in this domain is relatively under-explored. We worked on a range of approaches - from traditional machine learning methods to advanced transformer-based models such as Indic-BERT, IndicSBERT, MuRIL, XLM-RoBERTa and MalayalamBERT. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of leveraging the state-of-the-art transformers in accurately identifying AI-generated content, demonstrating the potential in enhancing the detection of fake reviews in low-resource language settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elio Musacchio, Lucia Siciliani, Pierpaolo Basile, Giovanni Semeraro</p>
<p>Abstract: In the current literature, most embedding models are based on the encoder-only transformer architecture to extract a dense and meaningful representation of the given input, which can be a text, an image, and more. With the recent advances in language modeling thanks to the introduction of Large Language Models, the possibility of extracting embeddings from these large and extensively trained models has been explored. However, current studies focus on textual embeddings in English, which is also the main language on which these models have been trained. Furthermore, there are very few models that consider multimodal and multilingual input. In light of this, we propose an adaptation methodology for Large Vision-Language Models trained on English language data to improve their performance in extracting multilingual and multimodal embeddings. Finally, we design and introduce a benchmark to evaluate the effectiveness of multilingual and multimodal embedding models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Li, Zhuo Cai, Shoujin Wang, Kun Yu, Fang Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown remarkable performance in language tasks and beyond. However, due to their limited inherent causal reasoning ability, LLMs still face challenges in handling tasks that require robust causal reasoning ability, such as health-care and economic analysis. As a result, a growing body of research has focused on enhancing the causal reasoning ability of LLMs. Despite the booming research, there lacks a survey to well review the challenges, progress and future directions in this area. To bridge this significant gap, we systematically review literature on how to strengthen LLMs' causal reasoning ability in this paper. We start from the introduction of background and motivations of this topic, followed by the summarisation of key challenges in this area. Thereafter, we propose a novel taxonomy to systematically categorise existing methods, together with detailed comparisons within and between classes of methods. Furthermore, we summarise existing benchmarks and evaluation metrics for assessing LLMs' causal reasoning ability. Finally, we outline future research directions for this emerging field, offering insights and inspiration to researchers and practitioners in the area.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stephen Meisenbacher, Alexandra Klymenko, Alexander Karpp, Florian Matthes</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent literature has seen a considerable uptick in $\textit{Differentially Private Natural Language Processing}$ (DP NLP). This includes DP text privatization, where potentially sensitive input texts are transformed under DP to achieve privatized output texts that ideally mask sensitive information $\textit{and}$ maintain original semantics. Despite continued work to address the open challenges in DP text privatization, there remains a scarcity of work addressing user perceptions of this technology, a crucial aspect which serves as the final barrier to practical adoption. In this work, we conduct a survey study with 721 laypersons around the globe, investigating how the factors of $\textit{scenario}$, $\textit{data sensitivity}$, $\textit{mechanism type}$, and $\textit{reason for data collection}$ impact user preferences for text privatization. We learn that while all these factors play a role in influencing privacy decisions, users are highly sensitive to the utility and coherence of the private output texts. Our findings highlight the socio-technical factors that must be considered in the study of DP NLP, opening the door to further user-based investigations going forward.</p>

<p>Abstract: Detecting harmful and non-inclusive terminology in technical contexts is critical for fostering inclusive environments in computing. This study explores the impact of model architecture on harmful language detection by evaluating a curated database of technical terms, each paired with specific use cases. We tested a range of encoder, decoder, and encoder-decoder language models, including BERT-base-uncased, RoBERTa large-mnli, Gemini Flash 1.5 and 2.0, GPT-4, Claude AI Sonnet 3.5, T5-large, and BART-large-mnli. Each model was presented with a standardized prompt to identify harmful and non-inclusive language across 64 terms. Results reveal that decoder models, particularly Gemini Flash 2.0 and Claude AI, excel in nuanced contextual analysis, while encoder models like BERT exhibit strong pattern recognition but struggle with classification certainty. We discuss the implications of these findings for improving automated detection tools and highlight model-specific strengths and limitations in fostering inclusive communication in technical domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongyu Chen, Seraphina Goldfarb-Tarrant</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed as automated evaluators to assess the safety of generated content, yet their reliability in this role remains uncertain. This study evaluates a diverse set of 11 LLM judge models across critical safety domains, examining three key aspects: self-consistency in repeated judging tasks, alignment with human judgments, and susceptibility to input artifacts such as apologetic or verbose phrasing. Our findings reveal that biases in LLM judges can significantly distort the final verdict on which content source is safer, undermining the validity of comparative evaluations. Notably, apologetic language artifacts alone can skew evaluator preferences by up to 98\%. Contrary to expectations, larger models do not consistently exhibit greater robustness, while smaller models sometimes show higher resistance to specific artifacts. To mitigate LLM evaluator robustness issues, we investigate jury-based evaluations aggregating decisions from multiple models. Although this approach both improves robustness and enhances alignment to human judgements, artifact sensitivity persists even with the best jury configurations. These results highlight the urgent need for diversified, artifact-resistant methodologies to ensure reliable safety assessments.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09348">MOAT: Evaluating LMMs for Capability Integration and Instruction Grounding</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhoutong Ye, Mingze Sun, Huan-ang Gao, Chun Yu, Yuanchun Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have demonstrated significant potential as generalists in vision-language (VL) tasks. However, there remains a significant gap between state-of-the-art LMMs and human performance when it comes to complex tasks that require a combination of fundamental VL capabilities, as well as tasks involving the grounding of complex instructions. To thoroughly investigate the human-LMM gap and its underlying causes, we propose MOAT, a diverse benchmark with complex real-world VL tasks that are challenging for LMMs. Specifically, the tasks in MOAT require LMMs to engage in generalist problem solving by integrating fundamental VL capabilities such as reading text, counting, understanding spatial relations, grounding textual and visual instructions, etc. All these abilities fit into a taxonomy proposed by us that contains 10 fundamental VL capabilities, enabling MOAT to provide a fine-grained view of LMMs' strengths and weaknesses. Besides, MOAT is the first benchmark to explicitly evaluate LMMs' ability to ground complex text and visual instructions, which is essential to many real-world applications. We evaluate over 20 proprietary and open source LMMs, as well as humans, on MOAT, and found that humans achieved 82.7% accuracy while the best performing LMM (OpenAI o1) achieved only 38.8%. To guide future model development, we analyze common trends in our results and discuss the underlying causes of observed performance gaps between LMMs and humans, focusing on which VL capability forms the bottleneck in complex tasks, whether test time scaling improves performance on MOAT, and how tiling harms LMMs' capability to count.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiushen Cai, Weihang Zhang, Hanruo Liu, Ningli Wang, Huiqi Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Standardization of clinical reports is crucial for improving the quality of healthcare and facilitating data integration. The lack of unified standards, including format, terminology, and style, is a great challenge in clinical fundus diagnostic reports, which increases the difficulty for large language models (LLMs) to understand the data. To address this, we construct a bilingual standard terminology, containing fundus clinical terms and commonly used descriptions in clinical diagnosis. Then, we establish two models, RetSTA-7B-Zero and RetSTA-7B. RetSTA-7B-Zero, fine-tuned on an augmented dataset simulating clinical scenarios, demonstrates powerful standardization behaviors. However, it encounters a challenge of limitation to cover a wider range of diseases. To further enhance standardization performance, we build RetSTA-7B, which integrates a substantial amount of standardized data generated by RetSTA-7B-Zero along with corresponding English data, covering diverse complex clinical scenarios and achieving report-level standardization for the first time. Experimental results demonstrate that RetSTA-7B outperforms other compared LLMs in bilingual standardization task, which validates its superior performance and generalizability.

<p>Abstract: As LLMs gain more popularity as chatbots and general assistants, methods have been developed to enable LLMs to follow instructions and align with human preferences. These methods have found success in the field, but their effectiveness has not been demonstrated outside of high-resource languages. In this work, we discuss our experiences in post-training an LLM for instruction-following for English and Finnish. We use a multilingual LLM to translate instruction and preference datasets from English to Finnish. We perform instruction tuning and preference optimization in English and Finnish and evaluate the instruction-following capabilities of the model in both languages. Our results show that with a few hundred Finnish instruction samples we can obtain competitive performance in Finnish instruction-following. We also found that although preference optimization in English offers some cross-lingual benefits, we obtain our best results by using preference data from both languages.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Julian Spravil, Sebastian Houben, Sven Behnke</p>
<p>Abstract: Cross-lingual transfer enables vision-language models (VLMs) to perform vision tasks in various languages with training data only in one language. Current approaches rely on large pre-trained multilingual language models. However, they face the curse of multilinguality, sacrificing downstream task performance for multilingual capabilities, struggling with lexical ambiguities, and falling behind recent advances. In this work, we study the scaling laws of systematic generalization with monolingual VLMs for multilingual tasks, focusing on the impact of model size and seen training samples. We propose Florenz, a monolingual encoder-decoder VLM with 0.4B to 11.2B parameters combining the pre-trained VLM Florence-2 and the large language model Gemma-2. Florenz is trained with varying compute budgets on a synthetic dataset that features intentionally incomplete language coverage for image captioning, thus, testing generalization from the fully covered translation task. We show that not only does indirectly learning unseen task-language pairs adhere to a scaling law, but also that with our data generation pipeline and the proposed Florenz model family, image captioning abilities can emerge in a specific language even when only data for the translation task is available. Fine-tuning on a mix of downstream datasets yields competitive performance and demonstrates promising scaling trends in multimodal machine translation (Multi30K, CoMMuTE), lexical disambiguation (CoMMuTE), and image captioning (Multi30K, XM3600, COCO Karpathy).</p>

<p>Abstract: This study explores the capacity of large language models (LLMs) for explicit learning, a process involving the assimilation of metalinguistic explanations to carry out language tasks. Using constructed languages generated by cryptographic means as controlled test environments, we designed experiments to assess an LLM's ability to explicitly learn and apply grammar rules. Our results demonstrate that while LLMs possess a measurable capacity for explicit learning, this ability diminishes as the complexity of the linguistic phenomena at hand increases. Supervised fine-tuning on chains of thought significantly enhances LLM performance but struggles to generalize to typologically novel or more complex linguistic features. These findings point to the need for more diverse training sets and alternative fine-tuning strategies to further improve explicit learning by LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents BAMBI (BAby language Models Boostrapped for Italian), a series of Baby Language Models (BabyLMs) trained on data that mimic the linguistic input received by a five-year-old Italian-speaking child. The BAMBI models are tested using a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate language models, which takes into account the amount of training input the models received. The BAMBI models are compared against a large language model (LLM) and a multimodal language model (VLM) to study the contribution of extralinguistic information for language acquisition. The results of our evaluation align with the existing literature on English language models, confirming that while reduced training data support the development of relatively robust syntactic competence, they are insufficient for fostering semantic understanding. However, the gap between the training resources (data and computation) of the BAMBI models and the LLMs is not fully reflected in their performance: despite LLMs' massive training, their performance is not much better than that of BAMBI models. This suggests that strategies beyond scaling training resources, such as data curation, inclusion of multimodal input, and other training strategies such as curriculum learning, could play a crucial role in shaping model performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bowen Jin, Hansi Zeng, Zhenrui Yue, Dong Wang, Hamed Zamani, Jiawei Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficiently acquiring external knowledge and up-to-date information is essential for effective reasoning and text generation in large language models (LLMs). Retrieval augmentation and tool-use training approaches where a search engine is treated as a tool lack complex multi-turn retrieval flexibility or require large-scale supervised data. Prompting advanced LLMs with reasoning capabilities during inference to use search engines is not optimal, since the LLM does not learn how to optimally interact with the search engine. This paper introduces Search-R1, an extension of the DeepSeek-R1 model where the LLM learns -- solely through reinforcement learning (RL) -- to autonomously generate (multiple) search queries during step-by-step reasoning with real-time retrieval. Search-R1 optimizes LLM rollouts with multi-turn search interactions, leveraging retrieved token masking for stable RL training and a simple outcome-based reward function. Experiments on seven question-answering datasets show that Search-R1 improves performance by 26% (Qwen2.5-7B), 21% (Qwen2.5-3B), and 10% (LLaMA3.2-3B) over SOTA baselines. This paper further provides empirical insights into RL optimization methods, LLM choices, and response length dynamics in retrieval-augmented reasoning.

<p>Abstract: The stability of language model pre-training and its effects on downstream performance are still understudied. Prior work shows that the training process can yield significantly different results in response to slight variations in initial conditions, e.g., the random seed. Crucially, the research community still lacks sufficient resources and tools to systematically investigate pre-training stability, particularly for decoder-only language models. We introduce the PolyPythias, a set of 45 new training runs for the Pythia model suite: 9 new seeds across 5 model sizes, from 14M to 410M parameters, resulting in about 7k new checkpoints that we release. Using these new 45 training runs, in addition to the 5 already available, we study the effects of different initial conditions determined by the seed -- i.e., parameters' initialisation and data order -- on (i) downstream performance, (ii) learned linguistic representations, and (iii) emergence of training phases. In addition to common scaling behaviours, our analyses generally reveal highly consistent training dynamics across both model sizes and initial conditions. Further, the new seeds for each model allow us to identify outlier training runs and delineate their characteristics. Our findings show the potential of using these methods to predict training stability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lutfi Eren Erdogan, Nicholas Lee, Sehoon Kim, Suhong Moon, Hiroki Furuta, Gopala Anumanchipalli, Kurt Keutzer, Amir Gholami</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advancements in enabling language agents to tackle simple tasks. However, applying them for complex, multi-step, long-horizon tasks remains a challenge. Recent work have found success by separating high-level planning from low-level execution, which enables the model to effectively balance high-level planning objectives and low-level execution details. However, generating accurate plans remains difficult since LLMs are not inherently trained for this task. To address this, we propose Plan-and-Act, a novel framework that incorporates explicit planning into LLM-based agents and introduces a scalable method to enhance plan generation through a novel synthetic data generation method. Plan-and-Act consists of a Planner model which generates structured, high-level plans to achieve user goals, and an Executor model that translates these plans into environment-specific actions. To train the Planner effectively, we introduce a synthetic data generation method that annotates ground-truth trajectories with feasible plans, augmented with diverse and extensive examples to enhance generalization. We evaluate Plan-and-Act using web navigation as a representative long-horizon planning environment, demonstrating a state-of the-art 54% success rate on the WebArena-Lite benchmark.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingfa Chen, Yutong Wu, Xu Han, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Building effective and efficient Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) has recently become a research focus, requiring maximizing model language capabilities and minimizing training and deployment costs. Existing efforts have primarily described complex relationships among model performance, parameter size, and data size, as well as searched for the optimal compute allocation to train LLMs. However, they overlook the impacts of context length and attention head configuration (the number of query and key-value heads in grouped-query attention) on training and inference. In this paper, we systematically compare models with different parameter sizes, context lengths, and attention head configurations in terms of model performance, computational cost, and memory cost. Then, we extend the existing scaling methods, which are based solely on parameter size and training compute, to guide the construction of cost-optimal LLMs during both training and inference. Our quantitative scaling studies show that, when processing sufficiently long sequences, a larger model with fewer attention heads can achieve a lower loss while incurring lower computational and memory costs. Our findings provide valuable insights for developing practical LLMs, especially in long-context processing scenarios. We will publicly release our code and data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruohao Guo, Wei Xu, Alan Ritter</p>
<p>Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely deployed in diverse scenarios, the extent to which they could tacitly spread misinformation emerges as a critical safety concern. Current research primarily evaluates LLMs on explicit false statements, overlooking how misinformation often manifests subtly as unchallenged premises in real-world user interactions. We curated ECHOMIST, the first comprehensive benchmark for implicit misinformation, where the misinformed assumptions are embedded in a user query to LLMs. ECHOMIST is based on rigorous selection criteria and carefully curated data from diverse sources, including real-world human-AI conversations and social media interactions. We also introduce a new evaluation metric to measure whether LLMs can recognize and counter false information rather than amplify users' misconceptions. Through an extensive empirical study on a wide range of LLMs, including GPT-4, Claude, and Llama, we find that current models perform alarmingly poorly on this task, often failing to detect false premises and generating misleading explanations. Our findings underscore the critical need for an increased focus on implicit misinformation in LLM safety research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jihao Zhao, Zhiyuan Ji, Zhaoxin Fan, Hanyu Wang, Simin Niu, Bo Tang, Feiyu Xiong, Zhiyu Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), while serving as a viable complement to large language models (LLMs), often overlooks the crucial aspect of text chunking within its pipeline. This paper initially introduces a dual-metric evaluation method, comprising Boundary Clarity and Chunk Stickiness, to enable the direct quantification of chunking quality. Leveraging this assessment method, we highlight the inherent limitations of traditional and semantic chunking in handling complex contextual nuances, thereby substantiating the necessity of integrating LLMs into chunking process. To address the inherent trade-off between computational efficiency and chunking precision in LLM-based approaches, we devise the granularity-aware Mixture-of-Chunkers (MoC) framework, which consists of a three-stage processing mechanism. Notably, our objective is to guide the chunker towards generating a structured list of chunking regular expressions, which are subsequently employed to extract chunks from the original text. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both our proposed metrics and the MoC framework effectively settle challenges of the chunking task, revealing the chunking kernel while enhancing the performance of the RAG system.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ce Guo, Tong Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are widely used in modern hardware design, yet writing Hardware Description Language (HDL) code for FPGA implementation remains labor-intensive and complex. Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising tool for automating HDL generation, but existing benchmarks for LLM HDL code generation primarily evaluate functional correctness while overlooking the critical aspect of hardware resource efficiency. Moreover, current benchmarks lack diversity, failing to capture the broad range of real-world FPGA applications. To address these gaps, we introduce ResBench, the first resource-oriented benchmark explicitly designed to differentiate between resource-optimized and inefficient LLM-generated HDL. ResBench consists of 56 problems across 12 categories, covering applications from finite state machines to financial computing. Our evaluation framework systematically integrates FPGA resource constraints, with a primary focus on Lookup Table (LUT) usage, enabling a realistic assessment of hardware efficiency. Experimental results reveal substantial differences in resource utilization across LLMs, demonstrating ResBench's effectiveness in distinguishing models based on their ability to generate resource-optimized FPGA designs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Parsa Hosseini, Sumit Nawathe, Mazda Moayeri, Sriram Balasubramanian, Soheil Feizi</p>
<p>Abstract: Unimodal vision models are known to rely on spurious correlations, but it remains unclear to what extent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) exhibit similar biases despite language supervision. In this paper, we investigate spurious bias in MLLMs and introduce SpurLens, a pipeline that leverages GPT-4 and open-set object detectors to automatically identify spurious visual cues without human supervision. Our findings reveal that spurious correlations cause two major failure modes in MLLMs: (1) over-reliance on spurious cues for object recognition, where removing these cues reduces accuracy, and (2) object hallucination, where spurious cues amplify the hallucination by over 10x. We validate our findings in various MLLMs and datasets. Beyond diagnosing these failures, we explore potential mitigation strategies, such as prompt ensembling and reasoning-based prompting, and conduct ablation studies to examine the root causes of spurious bias in MLLMs. By exposing the persistence of spurious correlations, our study calls for more rigorous evaluation methods and mitigation strategies to enhance the reliability of MLLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiwen Chen, Wenhui Zhu, Peijie Qiu, Hao Wang, Huayu Li, Haiyu Wu, Aristeidis Sotiras, Yalin Wang, Abolfazl Razi</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP demonstrate strong performance but struggle when adapted to downstream tasks. Prompt learning has emerged as an efficient and effective strategy to adapt VLMs while preserving their pre-trained knowledge. However, existing methods still lead to overfitting and degrade zero-shot generalization. To address this challenge, we propose an optimal transport (OT)-guided prompt learning framework that mitigates forgetting by preserving the structural consistency of feature distributions between pre-trained and fine-tuned models. Unlike conventional point-wise constraints, OT naturally captures cross-instance relationships and expands the feasible parameter space for prompt tuning, allowing a better trade-off between adaptation and generalization. Our approach enforces joint constraints on both vision and text representations, ensuring a holistic feature alignment. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our simple yet effective method can outperform existing prompt learning strategies in base-to-novel generalization, cross-dataset evaluation, and domain generalization without additional augmentation or ensemble techniques.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Itay Yona, Ilia Shumailov, Jamie Hayes, Federico Barbero, Yossi Gandelsman</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their impressive capabilities, often fail to accurately repeat a single word when prompted to, and instead output unrelated text. This unexplained failure mode represents a vulnerability, allowing even end-users to diverge models away from their intended behavior. We aim to explain the causes for this phenomenon and link it to the concept of ``attention sinks'', an emergent LLM behavior crucial for fluency, in which the initial token receives disproportionately high attention scores. Our investigation identifies the neural circuit responsible for attention sinks and shows how long repetitions disrupt this circuit. We extend this finding to other non-repeating sequences that exhibit similar circuit disruptions. To address this, we propose a targeted patch that effectively resolves the issue without negatively impacting the model's overall performance. This study provides a mechanistic explanation for an LLM vulnerability, demonstrating how interpretability can diagnose and address issues, and offering insights that pave the way for more secure and reliable models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sewade Ogun, Vincent Colotte, Emmanuel Vincent</p>
<p>Abstract: Augmenting the training data of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems with synthetic data generated by text-to-speech (TTS) or voice conversion (VC) has gained popularity in recent years. Several works have demonstrated improvements in ASR performance using this augmentation approach. However, because of the lower diversity of synthetic speech, naively combining synthetic and real data often does not yield the best results. In this work, we leverage recently proposed flow-based TTS/VC models allowing greater speech diversity, and assess the respective impact of augmenting various speech attributes on the word error rate (WER) achieved by several ASR models. Pitch augmentation and VC-based speaker augmentation are found to be ineffective in our setup. Jointly augmenting all other attributes reduces the WER of a Conformer-Transducer model by 11\% relative on Common Voice and by up to 35\% relative on LibriSpeech compared to training on real data only.</p>

<p>Abstract: The remarkable achievements of large language models (LLMs) have led many to conclude that they exhibit a form of intelligence. This is as opposed to explanations of their capabilities based on their ability to perform relatively simple manipulations of vast volumes of data. To illuminate the distinction between these explanations, we introduce a novel generative model that generates tokens on the basis of human interpretable concepts represented as latent discrete variables. Under mild conditions, even when the mapping from the latent space to the observed space is non-invertible, we establish an identifiability result: the representations learned by LLMs through next-token prediction can be approximately modeled as the logarithm of the posterior probabilities of these latent discrete concepts, up to an invertible linear transformation. This theoretical finding not only provides evidence that LLMs capture underlying generative factors, but also strongly reinforces the linear representation hypothesis, which posits that LLMs learn linear representations of human-interpretable concepts. Empirically, we validate our theoretical results through evaluations on both simulation data and the Pythia, Llama, and DeepSeek model families.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08990">JBFuzz: Jailbreaking LLMs Efficiently and Effectively Using Fuzzing</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Vasudev Gohil</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise as language understanding and decision making tools, and they have permeated various aspects of our everyday life. However, their widespread availability also comes with novel risks, such as generating harmful, unethical, or offensive content, via an attack called jailbreaking. Despite extensive efforts from LLM developers to align LLMs using human feedback, they are still susceptible to jailbreak attacks. To tackle this issue, researchers often employ red-teaming to understand and investigate jailbreak prompts. However, existing red-teaming approaches lack effectiveness, scalability, or both. To address these issues, we propose JBFuzz, a novel effective, automated, and scalable red-teaming technique for jailbreaking LLMs.
  JBFuzz is inspired by the success of fuzzing for detecting bugs/vulnerabilities in software. We overcome three challenges related to effectiveness and scalability by devising novel seed prompts, a lightweight mutation engine, and a lightweight and accurate evaluator for guiding the fuzzer. Assimilating all three solutions results in a potent fuzzer that only requires black-box access to the target LLM. We perform extensive experimental evaluation of JBFuzz using nine popular and widely-used LLMs. We find that JBFuzz successfully jailbreaks all LLMs for various harmful/unethical questions, with an average attack success rate of 99%. We also find that JBFuzz is extremely efficient as it jailbreaks a given LLM for a given question in 60 seconds on average. Our work highlights the susceptibility of the state-of-the-art LLMs to jailbreak attacks even after safety alignment, and serves as a valuable red-teaming tool for LLM developers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mayank Singh, Abhijeet Kumar, Sasidhar Donaparthi, Gayatri Karambelkar</p>
<p>Abstract: Data catalogs serve as repositories for organizing and accessing diverse collection of data assets, but their effectiveness hinges on the ease with which business users can look-up relevant content. Unfortunately, many data catalogs within organizations suffer from limited searchability due to inadequate metadata like asset descriptions. Hence, there is a need of content generation solution to enrich and curate metadata in a scalable way. This paper explores the challenges associated with metadata creation and proposes a unique prompt enrichment idea of leveraging existing metadata content using retrieval based few-shot technique tied with generative large language models (LLM). The literature also considers finetuning an LLM on existing content and studies the behavior of few-shot pretrained LLM (Llama, GPT3.5) vis-\`a-vis few-shot finetuned LLM (Llama2-7b) by evaluating their performance based on accuracy, factual grounding, and toxicity. Our preliminary results exhibit more than 80% Rouge-1 F1 for the generated content. This implied 87%- 88% of instances accepted as is or curated with minor edits by data stewards. By automatically generating descriptions for tables and columns in most accurate way, the research attempts to provide an overall framework for enterprises to effectively scale metadata curation and enrich its data catalog thereby vastly improving the data catalog searchability and overall usability.</p>

<p>Abstract: Prompting Large Language Models (LLMs), or providing context on the expected model of operation, is an effective way to steer the outputs of such models to satisfy human desiderata after they have been trained. But in rapidly evolving domains, there is often need to fine-tune LLMs to improve either the kind of knowledge in their memory or their abilities to perform open ended reasoning in new domains. When human's learn new concepts, we often do so by linking the new material that we are studying to concepts we have already learned before. To that end, we ask, "can prompting help us teach LLMs how to learn". In this work, we study a novel generalization of instruction tuning, called contextual fine-tuning, to fine-tune LLMs. Our method leverages instructional prompts designed to mimic human cognitive strategies in learning and problem-solving to guide the learning process during training, aiming to improve the model's interpretation and understanding of domain-specific knowledge. We empirically demonstrate that this simple yet effective modification improves the ability of LLMs to be fine-tuned rapidly on new datasets both within the medical and financial domains.</p>

<p>Abstract: Code localization--identifying precisely where in a codebase changes need to be made--is a fundamental yet challenging task in software maintenance. Existing approaches struggle to efficiently navigate complex codebases when identifying relevant code sections. The challenge lies in bridging natural language problem descriptions with the appropriate code elements, often requiring reasoning across hierarchical structures and multiple dependencies. We introduce LocAgent, a framework that addresses code localization through graph-based representation. By parsing codebases into directed heterogeneous graphs, LocAgent creates a lightweight representation that captures code structures (files, classes, functions) and their dependencies (imports, invocations, inheritance), enabling LLM agents to effectively search and locate relevant entities through powerful multi-hop reasoning. Experimental results on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances accuracy in code localization. Notably, our method with the fine-tuned Qwen-2.5-Coder-Instruct-32B model achieves comparable results to SOTA proprietary models at greatly reduced cost (approximately 86% reduction), reaching up to 92.7% accuracy on file-level localization while improving downstream GitHub issue resolution success rates by 12% for multiple attempts (Pass@10).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yue Wang, Qizhou Wang, Feng Liu, Wei Huang, Yali Du, Xiaojiang Du, Bo Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language model (LLM) unlearning has demonstrated its essential role in removing privacy and copyright-related responses, crucial for their legal and safe applications. However, the pursuit of complete unlearning often comes with substantial costs due to its compromises in their general functionality, leading to a notorious trade-off between unlearning and retention. In examining the update process for unlearning dynamically, we find gradients hold essential information for revealing this trade-off. In particular, we look at the varying relationship between retention performance and directional disparities between gradients during unlearning. It motivates the sculpting of an update mechanism derived from gradients from two sources, i.e., harmful for retention and useful for unlearning. Accordingly, we propose Gradient Rectified Unlearning (GRU), an enhanced unlearning framework controlling the updating gradients in a geometry-focused and optimization-driven manner such that their side impacts on other, unrelated responses can be minimized. Specifically, GRU derives a closed-form solution to project the unlearning gradient onto the orthogonal space of that gradient harmful for retention, ensuring minimal deviation from its original direction under the condition that overall performance is retained. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate that GRU, as a general framework, is straightforward to implement and efficiently enhances a range of baseline methods through its adaptable and compatible characteristics. Additionally, experimental results show its broad effectiveness across a diverse set of benchmarks for LLM unlearning.</p>

<p>Abstract: We speak of a \textit{computational law} when that law is intended to be enforced by software through an automated decision-making process. As digital technologies evolve to offer more solutions for public administrations, we see an ever-increasing number of computational laws. Traditionally, law is written in natural language. Computational laws, however, suffer various complications when written in natural language, such as underspecification and ambiguity which lead to a diversity of possible interpretations to be made by the coder. These could potentially result into an uneven application of the law. Thus, resorting to formal languages to write computational laws is tempting. However, writing laws in a formal language leads to further complications, for example, incomprehensibility for non-experts, lack of explicit motivation of the decisions made, or difficulties in retrieving the data leading to the outcome. In this paper, we investigate how certain legal principles fare in both scenarios: computational law written in natural language or written in formal language. We use a running example from the European Union's road transport regulation to showcase the tensions arising, and the benefits from each language.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali Vosoughi, Dimitra Emmanouilidou, Hannes Gamper</p>
<p>Abstract: Integrating audio and visual data for training multimodal foundational models remains challenging. We present Audio-Video Vector Alignment (AVVA), which aligns audiovisual (AV) scene content beyond mere temporal synchronization via a Large Language Model (LLM)-based data curation pipeline. Specifically, AVVA scores and selects high-quality training clips using Whisper (speech-based audio foundation model) for audio and DINOv2 for video within a dual-encoder contrastive learning framework. Evaluations on AudioCaps, VALOR, and VGGSound demonstrate that this approach can achieve significant accuracy gains with substantially less curated data. For instance, AVVA yields a 7.6% improvement in top-1 accuracy for audio-to-video retrieval on VGGSound compared to ImageBind, despite training on only 192 hours of carefully filtered data (vs. 5800+ hours). Moreover, an ablation study highlights that trading data quantity for data quality improves performance, yielding respective top-3 accuracy increases of 47.8, 48.4, and 58.0 percentage points on AudioCaps, VALOR, and VGGSound over uncurated baselines. While these results underscore AVVA's data efficiency, we also discuss the overhead of LLM-driven curation and how it may be scaled or approximated in larger domains. Overall, AVVA provides a viable path toward more robust, text-free audiovisual learning with improved retrieval accuracy.</p>

We establish a definition of "thought" that encompasses traditional understandings of that term and adapt it for application to LLMs. We demonstrate that the architectural design and language modeling training methodology of contemporary LLMs inherently preclude them from engaging in genuine thought processes. Our primary focus is on this theoretical realization rather than practical insights derived from experimental data. Finally, we propose solutions to enable thought processes within the feature space and discuss the broader implications of these architectural modifications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhe Xu, Daoyuan Chen, Zhenqing Ling, Yaliang Li, Ying Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) face challenges in achieving robust, transferable reasoning abilities due to reliance on labor-intensive manual instruction datasets or computationally expensive self-supervised methods. To address these issues, we introduce MindGYM, a framework that enhances VLMs through synthetic self-challenging questions, consisting of three stages: (1) Seed Single-Hop Question Synthesis, generating cognitive questions across textual (e.g., logical deduction) and multimodal contexts (e.g., diagram-based queries) spanning eight semantic areas like ethical analysis; (2) Challenging Multi-Hop Question Synthesis, combining seed questions via diverse principles like bridging, visual-textual alignment, to create multi-step problems demanding deeper reasoning; and (3) Thinking-Induced Curriculum Fine-Tuning, a structured pipeline that progressively trains the model from scaffolded reasoning to standalone inference. By leveraging the model's self-synthesis capability, MindGYM achieves high data efficiency (e.g., +16% gains on MathVision-Mini with only 400 samples), computational efficiency (reducing both training and inference costs), and robust generalization across tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyu Wan, Yunxiang Li, Yan Song, Hanjing Wang, Linyi Yang, Mark Schmidt, Jun Wang, Weinan Zhang, Shuyue Hu, Ying Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent research on Reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sought to further enhance their performance by integrating meta-thinking -- enabling models to monitor, evaluate, and control their reasoning processes for more adaptive and effective problem-solving. However, current single-agent work lacks a specialized design for acquiring meta-thinking, resulting in low efficacy. To address this challenge, we introduce Reinforced Meta-thinking Agents (ReMA), a novel framework that leverages Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to elicit meta-thinking behaviors, encouraging LLMs to think about thinking. ReMA decouples the reasoning process into two hierarchical agents: a high-level meta-thinking agent responsible for generating strategic oversight and plans, and a low-level reasoning agent for detailed executions. Through iterative reinforcement learning with aligned objectives, these agents explore and learn collaboration, leading to improved generalization and robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that ReMA outperforms single-agent RL baselines on complex reasoning tasks, including competitive-level mathematical benchmarks and LLM-as-a-Judge benchmarks. Comprehensive ablation studies further illustrate the evolving dynamics of each distinct agent, providing valuable insights into how the meta-thinking reasoning process enhances the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Inspired by the success of DeepSeek R1 in reasoning via reinforcement learning without human feedback, we train a 3B language model using the Countdown Game with pure reinforcement learning. Our model outperforms baselines on four of five benchmarks, demonstrating improved generalization beyond its training data. Notably, response length does not correlate with reasoning quality, and while "aha moments" emerge, they do not always yield correct answers. These findings highlight the potential of RL-only training for reasoning enhancement and suggest future work on refining reward structures to bridge emergent insights with accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are a popular technique for interpreting language model activations, and there is extensive recent work on improving SAE effectiveness. However, most prior work evaluates progress using unsupervised proxy metrics with unclear practical relevance. We introduce SAEBench, a comprehensive evaluation suite that measures SAE performance across seven diverse metrics, spanning interpretability, feature disentanglement and practical applications like unlearning. To enable systematic comparison, we open-source a suite of over 200 SAEs across eight recently proposed SAE architectures and training algorithms. Our evaluation reveals that gains on proxy metrics do not reliably translate to better practical performance. For instance, while Matryoshka SAEs slightly underperform on existing proxy metrics, they substantially outperform other architectures on feature disentanglement metrics; moreover, this advantage grows with SAE scale. By providing a standardized framework for measuring progress in SAE development, SAEBench enables researchers to study scaling trends and make nuanced comparisons between different SAE architectures and training methodologies. Our interactive interface enables researchers to flexibly visualize relationships between metrics across hundreds of open-source SAEs at: https://saebench.xyz</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiguang Chen, Libo Qin, Jinhao Liu, Dengyun Peng, Jiannan Guan, Peng Wang, Mengkang Hu, Yuhang Zhou, Te Gao, Wangxiang Che</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in reasoning with large language models (RLLMs), such as OpenAI-O1 and DeepSeek-R1, have demonstrated their impressive capabilities in complex domains like mathematics and coding. A central factor in their success lies in the application of long chain-of-thought (Long CoT) characteristics, which enhance reasoning abilities and enable the solution of intricate problems. However, despite these developments, a comprehensive survey on Long CoT is still lacking, limiting our understanding of its distinctions from traditional short chain-of-thought (Short CoT) and complicating ongoing debates on issues like "overthinking" and "test-time scaling." This survey seeks to fill this gap by offering a unified perspective on Long CoT. (1) We first distinguish Long CoT from Short CoT and introduce a novel taxonomy to categorize current reasoning paradigms. (2) Next, we explore the key characteristics of Long CoT: deep reasoning, extensive exploration, and feasible reflection, which enable models to handle more complex tasks and produce more efficient, coherent outcomes compared to the shallower Short CoT. (3) We then investigate key phenomena such as the emergence of Long CoT with these characteristics, including overthinking, and test-time scaling, offering insights into how these processes manifest in practice. (4) Finally, we identify significant research gaps and highlight promising future directions, including the integration of multi-modal reasoning, efficiency improvements, and enhanced knowledge frameworks. By providing a structured overview, this survey aims to inspire future research and further the development of logical reasoning in artificial intelligence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Greg Serapio-Garc\'ia, Mustafa Safdari, Cl\'ement Crepy, Luning Sun, Stephen Fitz, Peter Romero, Marwa Abdulhai, Aleksandra Faust, Maja Matari\'c</p>
<p>Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized natural language processing, enabling the generation of coherent and contextually relevant human-like text. As LLMs increasingly powerconversational agents used by the general public world-wide, the synthetic personality traits embedded in these models, by virtue of training on large amounts of human data, is becoming increasingly important. Since personality is a key factor determining the effectiveness of communication, we present a novel and comprehensive psychometrically valid and reliable methodology for administering and validating personality tests on widely-used LLMs, as well as for shaping personality in the generated text of such LLMs. Applying this method to 18 LLMs, we found: 1) personality measurements in the outputs of some LLMs under specific prompting configurations are reliable and valid; 2) evidence of reliability and validity of synthetic LLM personality is stronger for larger and instruction fine-tuned models; and 3) personality in LLM outputs can be shaped along desired dimensions to mimic specific human personality profiles. We discuss the application and ethical implications of the measurement and shaping method, in particular regarding responsible AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhecheng Sheng, Tianhao Zhang, Chen Jiang, Dongyeop Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: Measuring the coherence of text is a vital aspect of evaluating the quality of written content. Recent advancements in neural coherence modeling have demonstrated their efficacy in capturing entity coreference and discourse relations, thereby enhancing coherence evaluation. However, many existing methods heavily depend on static embeddings or focus narrowly on nearby context, constraining their capacity to measure the overarching coherence of long texts. In this paper, we posit that coherent texts inherently manifest a sequential and cohesive interplay among sentences, effectively conveying the central theme, purpose, or standpoint. To explore this abstract relationship, we introduce the "BBScore," a novel reference-free metric grounded in Brownian bridge theory for assessing text coherence. Our findings showcase that when synergized with a simple additional classification component, this metric attains a performance level comparable to state-of-the-art techniques on standard artificial discrimination tasks. We also establish in downstream tasks that this metric effectively differentiates between human-written documents and text generated by large language models under a specific domain. Furthermore, we illustrate the efficacy of this approach in detecting written styles attributed to diverse large language models, underscoring its potential for generalizability. In summary, we present a novel Brownian bridge coherence metric capable of measuring both local and global text coherence, while circumventing the need for end-to-end model training. This flexibility allows for its application in various downstream tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guanming Xiong, Junwei Bao, Wen Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: This study explores the realm of knowledge base question answering (KBQA). KBQA is considered a challenging task, particularly in parsing intricate questions into executable logical forms. Traditional semantic parsing (SP)-based methods require extensive data annotations, which result in significant costs. Recently, the advent of few-shot in-context learning, powered by large language models (LLMs), has showcased promising capabilities. However, fully leveraging LLMs to parse questions into logical forms in low-resource scenarios poses a substantial challenge. To tackle these hurdles, we introduce Interactive-KBQA, a framework designed to generate logical forms through direct interaction with knowledge bases (KBs). Within this framework, we have developed three generic APIs for KB interaction. For each category of complex question, we devised exemplars to guide LLMs through the reasoning processes. Our method achieves competitive results on the WebQuestionsSP, ComplexWebQuestions, KQA Pro, and MetaQA datasets with a minimal number of examples (shots). Importantly, our approach supports manual intervention, allowing for the iterative refinement of LLM outputs. By annotating a dataset with step-wise reasoning processes, we showcase our model's adaptability and highlight its potential for contributing significant enhancements to the field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyun Cui, Ziyang Zhang, Guangzhi Sun, Wen Wu, Chao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Advances in large language models raise the question of how alignment techniques will adapt as models become increasingly complex and humans will only be able to supervise them weakly. Weak-to-Strong mimics such a scenario where weak model supervision attempts to harness the full capabilities of a much stronger model. This work extends Weak-to-Strong to WeakS-to-Strong by exploring an ensemble of weak models which simulate the variability in human opinions. Confidence scores are estimated using a Bayesian approach to guide the WeakS-to-Strong generalization. Furthermore, we extend the application of WeakS-to-Strong from text classification tasks to text generation tasks where more advanced strategies are investigated for supervision. Moreover, direct preference optimization is applied to advance the student model's preference learning, beyond the basic learning framework of teacher forcing. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for the reliability of a strong student model, showing potential for superalignment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Neelabh Sinha, Vinija Jain, Aman Chadha</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid rise of Language Models (LMs) has expanded their use in several applications. Yet, due to constraints of model size, associated cost, or proprietary restrictions, utilizing state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs is not always feasible. With open, smaller LMs emerging, more applications can leverage their capabilities, but selecting the right LM can be challenging as smaller LMs do not perform well universally. This work tries to bridge this gap by proposing a framework to experimentally evaluate small, open LMs in practical settings through measuring semantic correctness of outputs across three practical aspects: task types, application domains, and reasoning types, using diverse prompt styles. It also conducts an in-depth comparison of 10 small, open LMs to identify the best LM and prompt style depending on specific application requirements using the proposed framework. We also show that if selected appropriately, they can outperform SOTA LLMs like DeepSeek-v2, GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Gemini-1.5-Pro, and even compete with GPT-4o.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Wang, Zirui Chen, Haofen Wang, Leong Hou U, Zhao Li, Wenbin Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge Representation Learning (KRL) is crucial for enabling applications of symbolic knowledge from Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to downstream tasks by projecting knowledge facts into vector spaces. Despite their effectiveness in modeling KG structural information, KRL methods are suffering from the sparseness of KGs. The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) built on the Transformer architecture presents promising opportunities for enhancing KRL by incorporating textual information to address information sparsity in KGs. LLM-enhanced KRL methods, including three key approaches, encoder-based methods that leverage detailed contextual information, encoder-decoder-based methods that utilize a unified Seq2Seq model for comprehensive encoding and decoding, and decoder-based methods that utilize extensive knowledge from large corpora, have significantly advanced the effectiveness and generalization of KRL in addressing a wide range of downstream tasks. This work provides a broad overview of downstream tasks while simultaneously identifying emerging research directions in these evolving domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ye Liu, Jiajun Zhu, Xukai Liu, Haoyu Tang, Yanghai Zhang, Kai Zhang, Xiaofang Zhou, Enhong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Few-Shot Fake News Detection (FS-FND) aims to distinguish inaccurate news from real ones in extremely low-resource scenarios. This task has garnered increased attention due to the widespread dissemination and harmful impact of fake news on social media. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated competitive performance with the help of their rich prior knowledge and excellent in-context learning abilities. However, existing methods face significant limitations, such as the Understanding Ambiguity and Information Scarcity, which significantly undermine the potential of LLMs. To address these shortcomings, we propose a Dual-perspective Knowledge-guided Fake News Detection (DKFND) model, designed to enhance LLMs from both inside and outside perspectives. Specifically, DKFND first identifies the knowledge concepts of each news article through a Detection Module. Subsequently, DKFND creatively designs an Investigation Module to retrieve inside and outside valuable information concerning to the current news, followed by another Judge Module to evaluate the relevance and confidence of them. Finally, a Determination Module further derives two respective predictions and obtain the final result. Extensive experiments on two public datasets show the efficacy of our proposed method, particularly in low-resource settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lorenzo Paolini, Sahar Vahdati, Angelo Di Iorio, Robert Wardenga, Ivan Heibi, Silvio Peroni</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding the motivations underlying scholarly citations is critical for evaluating research impact and fostering transparent scholarly communication. This study introduces CiteFusion, an ensemble framework designed to address the multiclass Citation Intent Classification (CIC) task on benchmark datasets, SciCite and ACL-ARC. The framework decomposes the task into binary classification subtasks, utilizing complementary pairs of SciBERT and XLNet models fine-tuned independently for each citation intent. These base models are aggregated through a feedforward neural network meta-classifier, ensuring robust performance in imbalanced and data-scarce scenarios. To enhance interpretability, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is employed to analyze token-level contributions and interactions among base models, providing transparency into classification dynamics. We further investigate the semantic role of structural context by incorporating section titles into input sentences, demonstrating their significant impact on classification accuracy and model reliability. Experimental results show that CiteFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance, with Macro-F1 scores of 89.60% on SciCite and 76.24% on ACL-ARC. The original intents from both datasets are mapped to Citation Typing Ontology (CiTO) object properties to ensure interoperability and reusability. This mapping highlights overlaps between the two datasets labels, enhancing their understandability and reusability. Finally, we release a web-based application that classifies citation intents leveraging CiteFusion models developed on SciCite.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to revolutionize scientific research, yet their robustness and reliability in domain-specific applications remain insufficiently explored. In this study, we evaluate the performance and robustness of LLMs for materials science, focusing on domain-specific question answering and materials property prediction across diverse real-world and adversarial conditions. Three distinct datasets are used in this study: 1) a set of multiple-choice questions from undergraduate-level materials science courses, 2) a dataset including various steel compositions and yield strengths, and 3) a band gap dataset, containing textual descriptions of material crystal structures and band gap values. The performance of LLMs is assessed using various prompting strategies, including zero-shot chain-of-thought, expert prompting, and few-shot in-context learning. The robustness of these models is tested against various forms of 'noise', ranging from realistic disturbances to intentionally adversarial manipulations, to evaluate their resilience and reliability under real-world conditions. Additionally, the study showcases unique phenomena of LLMs during predictive tasks, such as mode collapse behavior when the proximity of prompt examples is altered and performance recovery from train/test mismatch. The findings aim to provide informed skepticism for the broad use of LLMs in materials science and to inspire advancements that enhance their robustness and reliability for practical applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: The application of text mining methods is becoming increasingly prevalent, particularly within Humanities and Computational Social Sciences, as well as in a broader range of disciplines. This paper presents an analysis of gender bias in English song lyrics using topic modeling and bias measurement techniques. Leveraging BERTopic, we cluster a dataset of 537,553 English songs into distinct topics and analyze their temporal evolution. Our results reveal a significant thematic shift in song lyrics over time, transitioning from romantic themes to a heightened focus on the sexualization of women. Additionally, we observe a substantial prevalence of profanity and misogynistic content across various topics, with a particularly high concentration in the largest thematic cluster. To further analyse gender bias across topics and genres in a quantitative way, we employ the Single Category Word Embedding Association Test (SC-WEAT) to calculate bias scores for word embeddings trained on the most prominent topics as well as individual genres. The results indicate a consistent male bias in words associated with intelligence and strength, while appearance and weakness words show a female bias. Further analysis highlights variations in these biases across topics, illustrating the interplay between thematic content and gender stereotypes in song lyrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiyeon Kim, Hyunji Lee, Hyowon Cho, Joel Jang, Hyeonbin Hwang, Seungpil Won, Youbin Ahn, Dohaeng Lee, Minjoon Seo</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we investigate how a model's tendency to broadly integrate its parametric knowledge evolves throughout pretraining, and how this behavior affects overall performance, particularly in terms of knowledge acquisition and forgetting. We introduce the concept of knowledge entropy, which quantifies the range of memory sources the model engages with; high knowledge entropy indicates that the model utilizes a wide range of memory sources, while low knowledge entropy suggests reliance on specific sources with greater certainty. Our analysis reveals a consistent decline in knowledge entropy as pretraining advances. We also find that the decline is closely associated with a reduction in the model's ability to acquire and retain knowledge, leading us to conclude that diminishing knowledge entropy (smaller number of active memory sources) impairs the model's knowledge acquisition and retention capabilities. We find further support for this by demonstrating that increasing the activity of inactive memory sources enhances the model's capacity for knowledge acquisition and retention.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samiha Sharlin, Tyler R. Josephson</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transformer-based machine learning models that have shown remarkable performance in tasks for which they were not explicitly trained. Here, we explore the potential of LLMs to perform symbolic regression -- a machine-learning method for finding simple and accurate equations from datasets. We prompt GPT-4 to suggest expressions from data, which are then optimized and evaluated using external Python tools. These results are fed back to GPT-4, which proposes improved expressions while optimizing for complexity and loss. Using chain-of-thought prompting, we instruct GPT-4 to analyze the data, prior expressions, and the scientific context (expressed in natural language) for each problem before generating new expressions. We evaluated the workflow in rediscovery of five well-known scientific equations from experimental data, and on an additional dataset without a known equation. GPT-4 successfully rediscovered all five equations, and in general, performed better when prompted to use a scratchpad and consider scientific context. We demonstrate how strategic prompting improves the model's performance and how the natural language interface simplifies integrating theory with data. We also observe how theory can sometimes offset noisy data and, in other cases, data can make up for poor context. Although this approach does not outperform established SR programs where target equations are more complex, LLMs can nonetheless iterate toward improved solutions while following instructions and incorporating scientific context in natural language.</p>

We address challenges in developing ASR systems for the Korean weather domain, specifically specialized vocabulary and Korean linguistic intricacies. To tackle these issues, we constructed an evaluation dataset of spoken queries recorded by native Korean speakers. Using this dataset, we assessed various configurations of a multilingual ASR model family, identifying performance limitations related to domain-specific terminology. We then implemented a simple text-to-speech-based data augmentation method, which improved the recognition of specialized terms while maintaining general-domain performance. Our contributions include creating a domain-specific dataset, comprehensive ASR model evaluations, and an effective augmentation technique. We believe our work provides a foundation for future advancements in ASR for the Korean weather forecasting domain.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent research has shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable to automated jailbreak attacks, where adversarial suffixes crafted by algorithms appended to harmful queries bypass safety alignment and trigger unintended responses. Current methods for generating these suffixes are computationally expensive and have low Attack Success Rates (ASR), especially against well-aligned models like Llama2 and Llama3. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ADV-LLM, an iterative self-tuning process that crafts adversarial LLMs with enhanced jailbreak ability. Our framework significantly reduces the computational cost of generating adversarial suffixes while achieving nearly 100\% ASR on various open-source LLMs. Moreover, it exhibits strong attack transferability to closed-source models, achieving 99\% ASR on GPT-3.5 and 49\% ASR on GPT-4, despite being optimized solely on Llama3. Beyond improving jailbreak ability, ADV-LLM provides valuable insights for future safety alignment research through its ability to generate large datasets for studying LLM safety.</p>

<p>Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) Transformer-based sequence models are known to have difficulty generalizing to sequences longer than those seen during training. When applied to text-to-speech (TTS), these models tend to drop or repeat words or produce erratic output, especially for longer utterances. In this paper, we introduce enhancements aimed at AR Transformer-based encoder-decoder TTS systems that address these robustness and length generalization issues. Our approach uses an alignment mechanism to provide cross-attention operations with relative location information. The associated alignment position is learned as a latent property of the model via backpropagation and requires no external alignment information during training. While the approach is tailored to the monotonic nature of TTS input-output alignment, it is still able to benefit from the flexible modeling power of interleaved multi-head self- and cross-attention operations. A system incorporating these improvements, which we call Very Attentive Tacotron, matches the naturalness and expressiveness of a baseline T5-based TTS system, while eliminating problems with repeated or dropped words and enabling generalization to any practical utterance length.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junchao Wu, Runzhe Zhan, Derek F. Wong, Shu Yang, Xinyi Yang, Yulin Yuan, Lidia S. Chao</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting text generated by large language models (LLMs) is of great recent interest. With zero-shot methods like DetectGPT, detection capabilities have reached impressive levels. However, the reliability of existing detectors in real-world applications remains underexplored. In this study, we present a new benchmark, DetectRL, highlighting that even state-of-the-art (SOTA) detection techniques still underperformed in this task. We collected human-written datasets from domains where LLMs are particularly prone to misuse. Using popular LLMs, we generated data that better aligns with real-world applications. Unlike previous studies, we employed heuristic rules to create adversarial LLM-generated text, simulating various prompts usages, human revisions like word substitutions, and writing noises like spelling mistakes. Our development of DetectRL reveals the strengths and limitations of current SOTA detectors. More importantly, we analyzed the potential impact of writing styles, model types, attack methods, the text lengths, and real-world human writing factors on different types of detectors. We believe DetectRL could serve as an effective benchmark for assessing detectors in real-world scenarios, evolving with advanced attack methods, thus providing more stressful evaluation to drive the development of more efficient detectors.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aniket Deroy, Subhankar Maity</p>
<p>Abstract: Language Identification (LI) is crucial for various natural language processing tasks, serving as a foundational step in applications such as sentiment analysis, machine translation, and information retrieval. In multilingual societies like India, particularly among the youth engaging on social media, text often exhibits code-mixing, blending local languages with English at different linguistic levels. This phenomenon presents formidable challenges for LI systems, especially when languages intermingle within single words. Dravidian languages, prevalent in southern India, possess rich morphological structures yet suffer from under-representation in digital platforms, leading to the adoption of Roman or hybrid scripts for communication. This paper introduces a prompt based method for a shared task aimed at addressing word-level LI challenges in Dravidian languages. In this work, we leveraged GPT-3.5 Turbo to understand whether the large language models is able to correctly classify words into correct categories. Our findings show that the Kannada model consistently outperformed the Tamil model across most metrics, indicating a higher accuracy and reliability in identifying and categorizing Kannada language instances. In contrast, the Tamil model showed moderate performance, particularly needing improvement in precision and recall.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sagi Shaier, Mario Sanz-Guerrero, Katharina von der Wense</p>
<p>Abstract: This study investigates whether repeating questions within prompts influences the performance of large language models (LLMs). We hypothesize that reiterating a question within a single prompt might enhance the model's focus on key elements of the query. We evaluate five recent LLMs -- including GPT-4o-mini, DeepSeek-V3, and smaller open-source models -- on three reading comprehension datasets under different prompt settings, varying question repetition levels (1, 3, or 5 times per prompt). Our results demonstrate that question repetition can increase models' accuracy by up to $6\%$. However, across all models, settings, and datasets, we do not find the result statistically significant. These findings provide insights into prompt design and LLM behavior, suggesting that repetition alone does not significantly impact output quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chung-En Sun, Tuomas Oikarinen, Berk Ustun, Tsui-Wei Weng</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Concept Bottleneck Large Language Models (CB-LLMs), a novel framework for building inherently interpretable Large Language Models (LLMs). In contrast to traditional black-box LLMs that rely on limited post-hoc interpretations, CB-LLMs integrate intrinsic interpretability directly into the LLMs -- allowing accurate explanations with scalability and transparency. We build CB-LLMs for two essential NLP tasks: text classification and text generation. In text classification, CB-LLMs is competitive with, and at times outperforms, traditional black-box models while providing explicit and interpretable reasoning. For the more challenging task of text generation, interpretable neurons in CB-LLMs enable precise concept detection, controlled generation, and safer outputs. The embedded interpretability empowers users to transparently identify harmful content, steer model behavior, and unlearn undesired concepts -- significantly enhancing the safety, reliability, and trustworthiness of LLMs, which are critical capabilities notably absent in existing models.

However, such prompts can now be readily identified using automated detection techniques. To further strengthen adversarial attacks, we focus on human-readable adversarial prompts, which are more realistic and potent threats. Our key contributions are (1) situation-driven attacks leveraging movie scripts as context to create human-readable prompts that successfully deceive LLMs, (2) adversarial suffix conversion to transform nonsensical adversarial suffixes into independent meaningful text, and (3) AdvPrompter with p-nucleus sampling, a method to generate diverse, human-readable adversarial suffixes, improving attack efficacy in models like GPT-3.5 and Gemma 7B.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youngjun Son, Chaewon Kim, Jaejin Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Dataset deduplication plays a crucial role in enhancing data quality, ultimately improving the training performance and efficiency of large language models. A commonly used method for data deduplication is the MinHash LSH algorithm. Recently, NVIDIA introduced a GPU-based MinHash LSH deduplication method, but it remains suboptimal, leaving room for further improvement in processing efficiency. This paper proposes a GPU-accelerated deduplication framework, FED, that optimizes MinHash LSH for GPU clusters and leverages computationally efficient, partially reusable non-cryptographic hash functions. FED significantly outperforms the CPU-based deduplication tool in SlimPajama (using 64 logical CPU cores) by up to 107.2 times and the GPU-based tool in NVIDIA NeMo Curator by up to 6.3 times when processing 30 million documents on a node with four GPUs. Notably, our method dramatically accelerates the previously time-consuming MinHash signature generation phase, achieving speed-ups of up to 260 compared to the CPU baseline. Despite these gains in efficiency, FED maintains high deduplication quality, with the duplicate document sets reaching a Jaccard similarity of over 0.96 compared to those identified by the standard MinHash algorithm. In large-scale experiments, the deduplication of 1.2 trillion tokens is completed in just 6 hours in a four-node, 16-GPU environment. The related code is publicly available on GitHub (\href{https://github.com/mcrl/FED}{https://github.com/mcrl/FED}).</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce HRMCR (HAE-RAE Multi-Step Commonsense Reasoning), a benchmark designed to evaluate large language models' ability to perform multi-step reasoning in culturally specific contexts, focusing on Korean. The questions are automatically generated via templates and algorithms, requiring LLMs to integrate Korean cultural knowledge into sequential reasoning steps. Consistent with prior observations on emergent abilities, our experiments reveal that models trained on fewer than \(2 \cdot 10^{25}\) training FLOPs struggle to solve any questions, showing near-zero performance. Beyond this threshold, performance improves sharply. State-of-the-art models (e.g., O1) still score under 50\%, underscoring the difficulty of our tasks. Notably, stepwise analysis suggests the observed emergent behavior may stem from compounding errors across multiple steps rather than reflecting a genuinely new capability. We publicly release the benchmark and commit to regularly updating the dataset to prevent contamination.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite notable advancements in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems that expand large language model (LLM) capabilities through external retrieval, these systems often struggle to meet the complex and diverse needs of real-world industrial applications. The reliance on retrieval alone proves insufficient for extracting deep, domain-specific knowledge performing in logical reasoning from specialized corpora. To address this, we introduce sPecIalized KnowledgE and Rationale Augmentation Generation (PIKE-RAG), focusing on extracting, understanding, and applying specialized knowledge, while constructing coherent rationale to incrementally steer LLMs toward accurate responses. Recognizing the diverse challenges of industrial tasks, we introduce a new paradigm that classifies tasks based on their complexity in knowledge extraction and application, allowing for a systematic evaluation of RAG systems' problem-solving capabilities. This strategic approach offers a roadmap for the phased development and enhancement of RAG systems, tailored to meet the evolving demands of industrial applications. Furthermore, we propose knowledge atomizing and knowledge-aware task decomposition to effectively extract multifaceted knowledge from the data chunks and iteratively construct the rationale based on original query and the accumulated knowledge, respectively, showcasing exceptional performance across various benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stefan Lenz, Arsenij Ustjanzew, Marco Jeray, Torsten Panholzer</p>
<p>Abstract: Tumor documentation in Germany is largely done manually, requiring reading patient records and entering data into structured databases. Large language models (LLMs) could potentially enhance this process by improving efficiency and reliability. This evaluation tests eleven different open source LLMs with sizes ranging from 1-70 billion model parameters on three basic tasks of the tumor documentation process: identifying tumor diagnoses, assigning ICD-10 codes, and extracting the date of first diagnosis. For evaluating the LLMs on these tasks, a dataset of annotated text snippets based on anonymized doctors' notes from urology was prepared. Different prompting strategies were used to investigate the effect of the number of examples in few-shot prompting and to explore the capabilities of the LLMs in general. The models Llama 3.1 8B, Mistral 7B, and Mistral NeMo 12 B performed comparably well in the tasks. Models with less extensive training data or having fewer than 7 billion parameters showed notably lower performance, while larger models did not display performance gains. Examples from a different medical domain than urology could also improve the outcome in few-shot prompting, which demonstrates the ability of LLMs to handle tasks needed for tumor documentation. Open source LLMs show a strong potential for automating tumor documentation. Models from 7-12 billion parameters could offer an optimal balance between performance and resource efficiency. With tailored fine-tuning and well-designed prompting, these models might become important tools for clinical documentation in the future. The code for the evaluation is available from https://github.com/stefan-m-lenz/UroLlmEval. We also release the dataset as a new valuable resource that addresses the shortage of authentic and easily accessible benchmarks in German-language medical NLP.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Paul Albert, Frederic Z. Zhang, Hemanth Saratchandran, Cristian Rodriguez-Opazo, Anton van den Hengel, Ehsan Abbasnejad</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its variants have shown impressive results in reducing the number of trainable parameters and memory requirements of large transformer networks while maintaining fine-tuning performance. The low-rank nature of the weight update inherently limits the representation power of fine-tuned models, however, thus potentially compromising performance on complex tasks. This raises a critical question: when a performance gap between LoRA and standard fine-tuning is observed, is it due to the reduced number of trainable parameters or the rank deficiency? This paper aims to answer this question by introducing RandLoRA, a parameter-efficient method that performs full-rank updates using a learned linear combinations of low-rank, non-trainable random matrices. Our method limits the number of trainable parameters by restricting optimization to diagonal scaling matrices applied to the fixed random matrices. This allows us to effectively overcome the low-rank limitations while maintaining parameter and memory efficiency during training. Through extensive experimentation across vision, language, and vision-language benchmarks, we systematically evaluate the limitations of LoRA and existing random basis methods. Our findings reveal that full-rank updates are beneficial across vision and language tasks individually, and even more so for vision-language tasks, where RandLoRA significantly reduces -- and sometimes eliminates -- the performance gap between standard fine-tuning and LoRA, demonstrating its efficacy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Advancements in Natural Language Processing have enabled specialized language models, but integrating domain-specific knowledge into general-purpose models in multilingual settings remains challenging, particularly for technical vocabulary. This paper investigates the integration of technical vocabulary in merged language models and explores the knowledge transfer mechanisms involved when combining a general-purpose language-specific model with a domain-specific model, focusing on the resulting model's comprehension of technical jargon. Our experiments analyze the impact of this merging process on the target model's proficiency in handling specialized terminology. We present a quantitative evaluation of the performance of the merged model, comparing it with that of the individual constituent models. The findings offer insights into the effectiveness of different model merging methods for enhancing domain-specific knowledge and highlight potential challenges and future directions in leveraging these methods for cross-lingual knowledge transfer in Natural Language Processing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Borui Yang, Md Afif Al Mamun, Jie M. Zhang, Gias Uddin</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to hallucinations, e.g., factually incorrect information, in their responses. These hallucinations present challenges for LLM-based applications that demand high factual accuracy. Existing hallucination detection methods primarily depend on external resources, which can suffer from issues such as low availability, incomplete coverage, privacy concerns, high latency, low reliability, and poor scalability. There are also methods depending on output probabilities, which are often inaccessible for closed-source LLMs like GPT models. This paper presents MetaQA, a self-contained hallucination detection approach that leverages metamorphic relation and prompt mutation. Unlike existing methods, MetaQA operates without any external resources and is compatible with both open-source and closed-source LLMs. MetaQA is based on the hypothesis that if an LLM's response is a hallucination, the designed metamorphic relations will be violated. We compare MetaQA with the state-of-the-art zero-resource hallucination detection method, SelfCheckGPT, across multiple datasets, and on two open-source and two closed-source LLMs. Our results reveal that MetaQA outperforms SelfCheckGPT in terms of precision, recall, and f1 score. For the four LLMs we study, MetaQA outperforms SelfCheckGPT with a superiority margin ranging from 0.041 - 0.113 (for precision), 0.143 - 0.430 (for recall), and 0.154 - 0.368 (for F1-score). For instance, with Mistral-7B, MetaQA achieves an average F1-score of 0.435, compared to SelfCheckGPT's F1-score of 0.205, representing an improvement rate of 112.2%. MetaQA also demonstrates superiority across all different categories of questions.</p>

Our model tuning strategy for med-gte-hybrid combines contrastive learning and a denoising autoencoder. To evaluate the performance of med-gte-hybrid, we investigate several clinical prediction tasks in large patient cohorts extracted from the MIMIC-IV dataset, including Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) patient prognosis, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) prediction, and patient mortality prediction. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the med-gte-hybrid model improves patient stratification, clustering, and text retrieval, thus outperforms current state-of-the-art models on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB). While some of our evaluations focus on CKD, our hybrid tuning of sentence transformers could be transferred to other medical domains and has the potential to improve clinical decision-making and personalised treatment pathways in various healthcare applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gyeongje Cho, Yeonkyoung So, Jaejin Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Multiple-choice benchmarks, consisting of various prompts and choices, are among the most widely used methods to assess a language model's natural language understanding capability. Given a specific prompt, we typically compute $P(Choice|Prompt)$ to evaluate how likely a language model is to generate the correct choice compared to incorrect ones. However, we observe that performance measured using this approach reflects not only the model's comprehension of the prompt but also its inherent biases for certain choices regardless of the prompt. This issue makes it challenging to accurately measure a model's natural language understanding, as models may select the answer without fully understanding the prompt. To address this limitation, we propose a novel metric called ANPMI, which normalizes Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) by $-\log P(Choice)$. ANPMI provides a more accurate assessment of the model's natural language understanding by ensuring that it is challenging to answer a question without properly understanding the prompt.</p>

<p>Abstract: Code-switching (CS), the alternation between two or more languages within a single conversation, presents significant challenges for automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. Existing Mandarin-English code-switching datasets often suffer from limitations in size, spontaneity, and the lack of full-length dialogue recordings with transcriptions, hindering the development of robust ASR models for real-world conversational scenarios. This paper introduces CS-Dialogue, a novel large-scale Mandarin-English code-switching speech dataset comprising 104 hours of spontaneous conversations from 200 speakers. Unlike previous datasets, CS-Dialogue provides full-length dialogue recordings with complete transcriptions, capturing naturalistic code-switching patterns in continuous speech. We describe the data collection and annotation processes, present detailed statistics of the dataset, and establish benchmark ASR performance using state-of-the-art models. Our experiments, using Transformer, Conformer, and Branchformer, demonstrate the challenges of code-switching ASR, and show that existing pre-trained models such as Whisper still have the space to improve. The CS-Dialogue dataset will be made freely available for all academic purposes.</p>

<p>Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) significantly enhances the performance of large language models (LLMs) across a wide range of tasks, and prior research shows that CoT can theoretically increase expressiveness. However, there is limited mechanistic understanding of the algorithms that Transformer+CoT can learn. In this work, we (1) evaluate the state tracking capabilities of Transformer+CoT and its variants, confirming the effectiveness of CoT. (2) Next, we identify the circuit, a subset of model components, responsible for tracking the world state, finding that late-layer MLP neurons play a key role. We propose two metrics, compression and distinction, and show that the neuron sets for each state achieve nearly 100% accuracy, providing evidence of an implicit finite state automaton (FSA) embedded within the model. (3) Additionally, we explore three realistic settings: skipping intermediate steps, introducing data noise, and testing length generalization. Our results demonstrate that Transformer+CoT learns robust algorithms (FSA), highlighting its resilience in challenging scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lu Dai, Yijie Xu, Jinhui Ye, Hao Liu, Hui Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated improved generation performance by incorporating externally retrieved knowledge, a process known as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Despite the potential of this approach, existing studies evaluate RAG effectiveness by 1) assessing retrieval and generation components jointly, which obscures retrieval's distinct contribution, or 2) examining retrievers using traditional metrics such as NDCG, which creates a gap in understanding retrieval's true utility in the overall generation process. To address the above limitations, in this work, we introduce an automatic evaluation method that measures retrieval quality through the lens of information gain within the RAG framework. Specifically, we propose Semantic Perplexity (SePer), a metric that captures the LLM's internal belief about the correctness of the retrieved information. We quantify the utility of retrieval by the extent to which it reduces semantic perplexity post-retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SePer not only aligns closely with human preferences but also offers a more precise and efficient evaluation of retrieval utility across diverse RAG scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hang Zheng, Hongshen Xu, Yuncong Liu, Lu Chen, Pascale Fung, Kai Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently hallucinate due to misaligned self-awareness, generating erroneous outputs when addressing queries beyond their knowledge boundaries. While existing approaches mitigate hallucinations via uncertainty estimation or query rejection, they suffer from computational inefficiency or sacrificed helpfulness. To address these issues, we propose the Explicit Knowledge Boundary Modeling (EKBM) framework, integrating fast and slow reasoning systems to harmonize reliability and usability. The framework first employs a fast-thinking model to generate confidence-labeled responses, enabling immediate use of high-confidence outputs. For uncertain predictions, a slow refinement model conducts targeted reasoning to improve accuracy. To align model behavior with our proposed object, we propose a hybrid training pipeline, enhancing self-awareness without degrading task performance. Evaluations on dialogue state tracking tasks demonstrate that EKBM achieves superior model reliability over uncertainty-based baselines. Further analysis reveals that refinement substantially boosts accuracy while maintaining low computational overhead. Our work establishes a scalable paradigm for advancing LLM reliability and balancing accuracy and practical utility in error-sensitive applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hwanjun Song, Jeonghwan Choi, Minseok Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances LLMs by integrating external knowledge, but generation remains fragile due to the uncertain placement of relevant chunks and retrieval-induced information overload, leading to hallucinations. We propose Ext2Gen, a novel extract-then-generate model that enhances RAG robustness by first extracting query-relevant sentences before generating answers. To optimize this model, we employ preference alignment through pairwise feedback learning, enabling the model to generate robust answers regardless of variations in retrieval results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Ext2Gen effectively identifies query-relevant sentences with high precision and recall, leading to highly reliable answers. Furthermore, deploying our model in a RAG environment reveals that it not only boosts the performance of the base LLM but also synergizes with advanced retrieval strategies like query expansion. The model is available at https://huggingface.co/DISLab/Ext2Gen-8B-R2.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Justin Chih-Yao Chen, Sukwon Yun, Elias Stengel-Eskin, Tianlong Chen, Mohit Bansal</p>
<p>Abstract: Combining existing pre-trained expert LLMs is a promising avenue for scalably tackling large-scale and diverse tasks. However, selecting experts at the task level is often too coarse-grained, as heterogeneous tasks may require different expertise for each instance. To enable adaptive instance-level mixing of pre-trained LLM experts, we propose Symbolic-MoE, a symbolic, text-based, and gradient-free Mixture-of-Experts framework. Symbolic-MoE takes a fine-grained approach to selection by emphasizing skills, e.g., algebra in math or molecular biology in biomedical reasoning. We propose a skill-based recruiting strategy that dynamically selects the most relevant set of expert LLMs for diverse reasoning tasks based on their strengths. Each selected expert then generates its own reasoning, resulting in k outputs from k experts, which are then synthesized into a final high-quality response by an aggregator chosen based on its ability to integrate diverse reasoning outputs. We show that Symbolic-MoE's instance-level expert selection improves performance by a large margin but -- when implemented naively -- can introduce a high computational overhead due to the need for constant model loading and offloading. To address this, we implement a batch inference strategy that groups instances based on their assigned experts, loading each model only once. This allows us to integrate 16 expert models on 1 GPU with a time cost comparable to or better than prior multi-agent baselines using 4 GPUs. Through extensive evaluations on diverse benchmarks (MMLU-Pro, GPQA, AIME, and MedMCQA), we demonstrate that Symbolic-MoE outperforms strong LLMs like GPT4o-mini, as well as multi-agent approaches, with an absolute average improvement of 8.15% over the best multi-agent baseline. Moreover, Symbolic-MoE removes the need for expensive multi-round discussions, outperforming discussion baselines with less computation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonas Golde, Patrick Haller, Fabio Barth, Alan Akbik</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have led to remarkable performance across a wide range of language understanding and mathematical tasks. As a result, increasing attention has been given to assessing the true reasoning capabilities of LLMs, driving research into commonsense, numerical, logical, and qualitative reasoning. However, with the rapid progress of reasoning-focused models such as OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek's R1, there has been a growing demand for reasoning benchmarks that can keep pace with ongoing model developments. In this paper, we introduce MastermindEval, a simple, scalable, and interpretable deductive reasoning benchmark inspired by the board game Mastermind. Our benchmark supports two evaluation paradigms: (1) agentic evaluation, in which the model autonomously plays the game, and (2) deductive reasoning evaluation, in which the model is given a pre-played game state with only one possible valid code to infer. In our experimental results we (1) find that even easy Mastermind instances are difficult for current models and (2) demonstrate that the benchmark is scalable to possibly more advanced models in the future Furthermore, we investigate possible reasons why models cannot deduce the final solution and find that current models are limited in deducing the concealed code as the number of statement to combine information from is increasing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siyuan Song, Jennifer Hu, Kyle Mahowald</p>
<p>Abstract: There has been recent interest in whether large language models (LLMs) can introspect about their own internal states. Such abilities would make LLMs more interpretable, and also validate the use of standard introspective methods in linguistics to evaluate grammatical knowledge in models (e.g., asking "Is this sentence grammatical?"). We systematically investigate emergent introspection across 21 open-source LLMs, in two domains where introspection is of theoretical interest: grammatical knowledge and word prediction. Crucially, in both domains, a model's internal linguistic knowledge can be theoretically grounded in direct measurements of string probability. We then evaluate whether models' responses to metalinguistic prompts faithfully reflect their internal knowledge. We propose a new measure of introspection: the degree to which a model's prompted responses predict its own string probabilities, beyond what would be predicted by another model with nearly identical internal knowledge. While both metalinguistic prompting and probability comparisons lead to high task accuracy, we do not find evidence that LLMs have privileged "self-access". Our findings complicate recent results suggesting that models can introspect, and add new evidence to the argument that prompted responses should not be conflated with models' linguistic generalizations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zuchen Gao, Zizheng Zhan, Xianming Li, Erxin Yu, Haotian Zhang, Bin Chen, Yuqun Zhang, Jing Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Code embeddings capture the semantic representations of code and are crucial for various code-related large language model (LLM) applications, such as code search. Previous training primarily relies on optimizing the InfoNCE loss by comparing positive natural language (NL)-code pairs with in-batch negatives. However, due to the sparse nature of code contexts, training solely by comparing the major differences between positive and negative pairs may fail to capture deeper semantic nuances. To address this issue, we propose a novel order-augmented strategy for improved code search (OASIS). It leverages order-based similarity labels to train models to capture subtle differences in similarity among negative pairs. Extensive benchmark evaluations demonstrate that our OASIS model significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art models focusing solely on major positive-negative differences. It underscores the value of exploiting subtle differences among negative pairs with order labels for effective code embedding training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhangming Chan, Xiuying Chen, Yongliang Wang, Juntao Li, Zhiqiang Zhang, Kun Gai, Dongyan Zhao, Rui Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Different from other text generation tasks, in product description generation, it is of vital importance to generate faithful descriptions that stick to the product attribute information. However, little attention has been paid to this problem. To bridge this gap, we propose a model named Fidelity-oriented Product Description Generator (FPDG). FPDG takes the entity label of each word into account, since the product attribute information is always conveyed by entity words. Specifically, we first propose a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) decoder based on the Entity-label-guided Long Short-Term Memory (ELSTM) cell, taking both the embedding and the entity label of each word as input. Second, we establish a keyword memory that stores the entity labels as keys and keywords as values, allowing FPDG to attend to keywords by attending to their entity labels. Experiments conducted on a large-scale real-world product description dataset show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both traditional generation metrics and human evaluations. Specifically, FPDG increases the fidelity of the generated descriptions by 25%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fuheng Zhao, Jiayue Chen, Lawrence Lim, Ishtiyaque Ahmad, Divyakant Agrawal, Amr El Abbadi</p>
<p>Abstract: Judging the equivalence between two SQL queries is a fundamental problem with many practical applications in data management and SQL generation (i.e., evaluating the quality of generated SQL queries in text-to-SQL task). While the research community has reasoned about SQL equivalence for decades, it poses considerable difficulties and no complete solutions exist. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning capability in conversation, question answering and solving mathematics challenges. In this paper, we study if LLMs can be used to determine the equivalence between SQL queries under two notions of SQL equivalence (semantic equivalence and relaxed equivalence). To assist LLMs in generating high quality responses, we present two prompting techniques: Miniature & Mull and Explain & Compare. The former technique is used to evaluate the semantic equivalence in which it asks LLMs to execute a query on a simple database instance and then explore if a counterexample exists by modifying the database. The latter technique is used to evaluate the relaxed equivalence in which it asks LLMs to explain the queries and then compare if they contain significant logical differences. Our experiments demonstrate using our techniques, LLMs is a promising tool to help data engineers in writing semantically equivalent SQL queries, however challenges still persist, and is a better metric for evaluating SQL generation than the popular execution accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Won-Gi Paeng, Daesuk Kwon, Kyungwon Jeong, Honggyo Suh</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we present a generalized formulation of the Transformer algorithm by reinterpreting its core mechanisms within the framework of Path Integral formalism. In this perspective, the attention mechanism is recast as a process that integrates all possible transition paths leading to future token states, with temporal evolution governed by the Feed-Forward Network. By systematically mapping each component of the Transformer to its counterpart in the Path Integral formulation, we obtain a more compact and efficient representation, in which the contextual information of a sequence is condensed into memory-like segments. These segments are recurrently processed across Transformer layers, enabling more effective long-term information retention. We validate the effectiveness of this approach through the Passkey retrieval task and a summarization task, demonstrating that the proposed method preserves historical information while exhibiting memory usage that scales linearly with sequence length. This contrasts with the non-linear memory growth typically observed in standard attention mechanisms. We expect that this quantum-inspired generalization of the Transformer architecture will open new avenues for enhancing both the efficiency and expressiveness of future Transformer models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yufan Shen, Chuwei Luo, Zhaoqing Zhu, Yang Chen, Qi Zheng, Zhi Yu, Jiajun Bu, Cong Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated promising results on document visual question answering (VQA) task, particularly after training on document instruction datasets. An effective evaluation method for document instruction data is crucial in constructing instruction data with high efficacy, which, in turn, facilitates the training of LLMs and MLLMs for document VQA. However, most existing evaluation methods for instruction data are limited to the textual content of the instructions themselves, thereby hindering the effective assessment of document instruction datasets and constraining their construction. In this paper, we propose ProcTag, a data-oriented method that assesses the efficacy of document instruction data. ProcTag innovatively performs tagging on the execution process of instructions rather than the instruction text itself. By leveraging the diversity and complexity of these tags to assess the efficacy of the given dataset, ProcTag enables selective sampling or filtering of document instructions. Furthermore, DocLayPrompt, a novel semi-structured layout-aware document prompting strategy, is proposed for effectively representing documents. Experiments demonstrate that sampling existing open-sourced and generated document VQA/instruction datasets with ProcTag significantly outperforms current methods for evaluating instruction data. Impressively, with ProcTag-based sampling in the generated document datasets, only 30.5\% of the document instructions are required to achieve 100\% efficacy compared to the complete dataset.

<p>Abstract: Traditional methods for eliciting people's opinions face a trade-off between depth and scale: structured surveys enable large-scale data collection but limit respondents' ability to voice their opinions in their own words, while conversational interviews provide deeper insights but are resource-intensive. This study explores the potential of replacing human interviewers with large language models (LLMs) to conduct scalable conversational interviews. Our goal is to assess the performance of AI Conversational Interviewing and to identify opportunities for improvement in a controlled environment. We conducted a small-scale, in-depth study with university students who were randomly assigned to a conversational interview by either AI or human interviewers, both employing identical questionnaires on political topics. Various quantitative and qualitative measures assessed interviewer adherence to guidelines, response quality, participant engagement, and overall interview efficacy. The findings indicate the viability of AI Conversational Interviewing in producing quality data comparable to traditional methods, with the added benefit of scalability. We publish our data and materials for re-use and present specific recommendations for effective implementation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sreyan Ghosh, Sonal Kumar, Zhifeng Kong, Rafael Valle, Bryan Catanzaro, Dinesh Manocha</p>
<p>Abstract: We present Synthio, a novel approach for augmenting small-scale audio classification datasets with synthetic data. Our goal is to improve audio classification accuracy with limited labeled data. Traditional data augmentation techniques, which apply artificial transformations (e.g., adding random noise or masking segments), struggle to create data that captures the true diversity present in real-world audios. To address this shortcoming, we propose to augment the dataset with synthetic audio generated from text-to-audio (T2A) diffusion models. However, synthesizing effective augmentations is challenging because not only should the generated data be acoustically consistent with the underlying small-scale dataset, but they should also have sufficient compositional diversity. To overcome the first challenge, we align the generations of the T2A model with the small-scale dataset using preference optimization. This ensures that the acoustic characteristics of the generated data remain consistent with the small-scale dataset. To address the second challenge, we propose a novel caption generation technique that leverages the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models to (1) generate diverse and meaningful audio captions and (2) iteratively refine their quality. The generated captions are then used to prompt the aligned T2A model. We extensively evaluate Synthio on ten datasets and four simulated limited-data settings. Results indicate our method consistently outperforms all baselines by 0.1%-39% using a T2A model trained only on weakly-captioned AudioSet.</p>

<p>Abstract: Navigation presents a significant challenge for persons with visual impairments (PVI). While traditional aids such as white canes and guide dogs are invaluable, they fall short in delivering detailed spatial information and precise guidance to desired locations. Recent developments in large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) offer new avenues for enhancing assistive navigation. In this paper, we introduce Guide-LLM, an embodied LLM-based agent designed to assist PVI in navigating large indoor environments. Our approach features a novel text-based topological map that enables the LLM to plan global paths using a simplified environmental representation, focusing on straight paths and right-angle turns to facilitate navigation. Additionally, we utilize the LLM's commonsense reasoning for hazard detection and personalized path planning based on user preferences. Simulated experiments demonstrate the system's efficacy in guiding PVI, underscoring its potential as a significant advancement in assistive technology. The results highlight Guide-LLM's ability to offer efficient, adaptive, and personalized navigation assistance, pointing to promising advancements in this field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Claire E. Stevenson, Alexandra Pafford, Han L. J. van der Maas, Melanie Mitchell</p>
<p>Abstract: When we solve an analogy we transfer information from a known context to a new one through abstract rules and relational similarity. In people, the ability to solve analogies such as "body : feet :: table : ?" emerges in childhood, and appears to transfer easily to other domains, such as the visual domain "( : ) :: < : ?". Recent research shows that large language models (LLMs) can solve various forms of analogies. However, can LLMs generalize analogy solving to new domains like people can? To investigate this, we had children, adults, and LLMs solve a series of letter-string analogies (e.g., a b : a c :: j k : ?) in the Latin alphabet, in a near transfer domain (Greek alphabet), and a far transfer domain (list of symbols). As expected, children and adults easily generalized their knowledge to unfamiliar domains, whereas LLMs did not. This key difference between human and AI performance is evidence that these LLMs still struggle with robust human-like analogical transfer.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated substantial success in self-supervised representation learning for vision tasks. However, effectively adapting VLMs to downstream applications remains challenging, as their accuracy often depends on time-intensive and expertise-demanding prompt engineering, while full model fine-tuning is costly. This is particularly true for biomedical images, which, unlike natural images, typically suffer from limited annotated datasets, unintuitive image contrasts, and nuanced visual features. Recent prompt learning techniques, such as Context Optimization (CoOp) intend to tackle these issues, but still fall short in generalizability. Meanwhile, explorations in prompt learning for biomedical image analysis are still highly limited. In this work, we propose BiomedCoOp, a novel prompt learning framework that enables efficient adaptation of BiomedCLIP for accurate and highly generalizable few-shot biomedical image classification. Our approach achieves effective prompt context learning by leveraging semantic consistency with average prompt ensembles from Large Language Models (LLMs) and knowledge distillation with a statistics-based prompt selection strategy. We conducted comprehensive validation of our proposed framework on 11 medical datasets across 9 modalities and 10 organs against existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating significant improvements in both accuracy and generalizability.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinqi Xiao, Shen Sang, Tiancheng Zhi, Jing Liu, Qing Yan, Yuqian Zhang, Linjie Luo, Bo Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Training large-scale neural networks in vision, and multimodal domains demands substantial memory resources, primarily due to the storage of optimizer states. While LoRA, a popular parameter-efficient method, reduces memory usage, it often suffers from suboptimal performance due to the constraints of low-rank updates. Low-rank gradient projection methods (e.g., GaLore, Flora) reduce optimizer memory by projecting gradients and moment estimates into low-rank spaces via singular value decomposition or random projection. However, they fail to account for inter-projection correlation, causing performance degradation, and their projection strategies often incur high computational costs. In this paper, we present COAP (Correlation-Aware Gradient Projection), a memory-efficient method that minimizes computational overhead while maintaining training performance. Evaluated across various vision, language, and multimodal tasks, COAP outperforms existing methods in both training speed and model performance. For LLaMA-1B, it reduces optimizer memory by 61% with only 2% additional time cost, achieving the same PPL as AdamW. With 8-bit quantization, COAP cuts optimizer memory by 81% and achieves 4x speedup over GaLore for LLaVA-v1.5-7B fine-tuning, while delivering higher accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have opened new possibilities in automatic grading of handwritten student responses, particularly in mathematics. However, a comprehensive study to test the ability of VLMs to evaluate and reason over handwritten content remains absent. To address this gap, we introduce FERMAT, a benchmark designed to assess the ability of VLMs to detect, localize and correct errors in handwritten mathematical content. FERMAT spans four key error dimensions - computational, conceptual, notational, and presentation - and comprises over 2,200 handwritten math solutions derived from 609 manually curated problems from grades 7-12 with intentionally introduced perturbations. Using FERMAT we benchmark nine VLMs across three tasks: error detection, localization, and correction. Our results reveal significant shortcomings in current VLMs in reasoning over handwritten text, with Gemini-1.5-Pro achieving the highest error correction rate (77%). We also observed that some models struggle with processing handwritten content, as their accuracy improves when handwritten inputs are replaced with printed text or images. These findings highlight the limitations of current VLMs and reveal new avenues for improvement. We release FERMAT and all the associated resources in the open-source to drive further research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen Chen, Yuchen Hu, Siyin Wang, Helin Wang, Zhehuai Chen, Chao Zhang, Chao-Han Huck Yang, Eng Siong Chng</p>
<p>Abstract: An ideal multimodal agent should be aware of the quality of its input modalities. Recent advances have enabled large language models (LLMs) to incorporate auditory systems for handling various speech-related tasks. However, most audio LLMs remain unaware of the quality of the speech they process. This limitation arises because speech quality evaluation is typically excluded from multi-task training due to the lack of suitable datasets. To address this, we introduce the first natural language-based speech evaluation corpus, generated from authentic human ratings. In addition to the overall Mean Opinion Score (MOS), this corpus offers detailed analysis across multiple dimensions and identifies causes of quality degradation. It also enables descriptive comparisons between two speech samples (A/B tests) with human-like judgment. Leveraging this corpus, we propose an alignment approach with LLM distillation (ALLD) to guide the audio LLM in extracting relevant information from raw speech and generating meaningful responses. Experimental results demonstrate that ALLD outperforms the previous state-of-the-art regression model in MOS prediction, with a mean square error of 0.17 and an A/B test accuracy of 98.6%. Additionally, the generated responses achieve BLEU scores of 25.8 and 30.2 on two tasks, surpassing the capabilities of task-specific models. This work advances the comprehensive perception of speech signals by audio LLMs, contributing to the development of real-world auditory and sensory intelligent agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sally Zhu, Ahmed Ahmed, Rohith Kuditipudi, Percy Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the following problem: given the weights of two models, can we test whether they were trained independently -- i.e., from independent random initializations? We consider two settings: constrained and unconstrained. In the constrained setting, we make assumptions about model architecture and training and propose a family of statistical tests that yield exact p-values with respect to the null hypothesis that the models are trained from independent random initializations. These p-values are valid regardless of the composition of either model's training data; we compute them by simulating exchangeable copies of each model under our assumptions and comparing various similarity measures of weights and activations between the original two models versus these copies. We report the p-values from these tests on pairs of 21 open-weight models (210 total pairs) and correctly identify all pairs of non-independent models. Our tests remain effective even if one model was fine-tuned for many tokens. In the unconstrained setting, where we make no assumptions about training procedures, can change model architecture, and allow for adversarial evasion attacks, the previous tests no longer work. Instead, we propose a new test which matches hidden activations between two models, and which is robust to adversarial transformations and to changes in model architecture. The test can also do localized testing: identifying specific non-independent components of models. Though we no longer obtain exact p-values from this, empirically we find it behaves as one and reliably identifies non-independent models. Notably, we can use the test to identify specific parts of one model that are derived from another (e.g., how Llama 3.1-8B was pruned to initialize Llama 3.2-3B, or shared layers between Mistral-7B and StripedHyena-7B), and it is even robust to retraining individual layers of either model from scratch.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jan Wehner, Sahar Abdelnabi, Daniel Tan, David Krueger, Mario Fritz</p>
<p>Abstract: Representation Engineering (RepE) is a novel paradigm for controlling the behavior of LLMs. Unlike traditional approaches that modify inputs or fine-tune the model, RepE directly manipulates the model's internal representations. As a result, it may offer more effective, interpretable, data-efficient, and flexible control over models' behavior. We present the first comprehensive survey of RepE for LLMs, reviewing the rapidly growing literature to address key questions: What RepE methods exist and how do they differ? For what concepts and problems has RepE been applied? What are the strengths and weaknesses of RepE compared to other methods? To answer these, we propose a unified framework describing RepE as a pipeline comprising representation identification, operationalization, and control. We posit that while RepE methods offer significant potential, challenges remain, including managing multiple concepts, ensuring reliability, and preserving models' performance. Towards improving RepE, we identify opportunities for experimental and methodological improvements and construct a guide for best practices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Max M. Lang, Sol Eskenazi</p>
<p>Abstract: Telephone surveys remain a valuable tool for gathering insights but typically require substantial resources in training and coordinating human interviewers. This work presents an AI-driven telephone survey system integrating text-to-speech (TTS), a large language model (LLM), and speech-to-text (STT) that mimics the versatility of human-led interviews (full-duplex dialogues) at scale.
  We tested the system across two populations, a pilot study in the United States (n = 75) and a large-scale deployment in Peru (n = 2,739), inviting participants via web-based links and contacting them via direct phone calls. The AI agent successfully administered open-ended and closed-ended questions, handled basic clarifications, and dynamically navigated branching logic, allowing fast large-scale survey deployment without interviewer recruitment or training.
  Our findings demonstrate that while the AI system's probing for qualitative depth was more limited than human interviewers, overall data quality approached human-led standards for structured items. This study represents one of the first successful large-scale deployments of an LLM-based telephone interviewer in a real-world survey context. The AI-powered telephone survey system has the potential for expanding scalable, consistent data collecting across market research, social science, and public opinion studies, thus improving operational efficiency while maintaining appropriate data quality for research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rajan Das Gupta, Md. Tanzib Hosain, M. F. Mridha, Salah Uddin Ahmed</p>
<p>Abstract: LLM chatbot interfaces allow students to get instant, interactive assistance with homework, but doing so carelessly may not advance educational objectives. In this study, an interactive homework help system based on DeepSeek R1 is developed and first implemented for students enrolled in a large computer science beginning programming course. In addition to an assist button in a well-known code editor, our assistant also has a feedback option in our command-line automatic evaluator. It wraps student work in a personalized prompt that advances our educational objectives without offering answers straight away. We have discovered that our assistant can recognize students' conceptual difficulties and provide ideas, plans, and template code in pedagogically appropriate ways. However, among other mistakes, it occasionally incorrectly labels the correct student code as incorrect or encourages students to use correct-but-lesson-inappropriate approaches, which can lead to long and frustrating journeys for the students. After discussing many development and deployment issues, we provide our conclusions and future actions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jikai Chen, Leilei Gan</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Text-to-SQL systems have improved the conversion of natural language queries into SQL, but challenges remain in ensuring accuracy and reliability. While self-correction techniques refine outputs, they often introduce new errors. Existing methods focused on execution feedback mainly address syntax issues, leaving semantic errors -- where the query's logic fails to align with the user's intent -- largely unaddressed. We propose a novel approach combining structured execution feedback with a trained critic agent that provides detailed, interpretable critiques. This method effectively identifies and corrects both syntactic and semantic errors, enhancing accuracy and interpretability. Experimental results show significant improvements on two major Text-to-SQL benchmarks, Spider and BIRD, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiale Wei, Xiang Ying, Tao Gao, Fangyi Bao, Felix Tao, Jingbo Shang</p>
<p>Abstract: Human interaction with the external world fundamentally involves the exchange of personal memory, whether with other individuals, websites, applications, or, in the future, AI agents. A significant portion of this interaction is redundant, requiring users to repeatedly provide the same information across different contexts. Existing solutions, such as browser-stored credentials, autofill mechanisms, and unified authentication systems, have aimed to mitigate this redundancy by serving as intermediaries that store and retrieve commonly used user data. The advent of large language models (LLMs) presents an opportunity to redefine memory management through an AI-native paradigm: SECOND ME. SECOND ME acts as an intelligent, persistent memory offload system that retains, organizes, and dynamically utilizes user-specific knowledge. By serving as an intermediary in user interactions, it can autonomously generate context-aware responses, prefill required information, and facilitate seamless communication with external systems, significantly reducing cognitive load and interaction friction. Unlike traditional memory storage solutions, SECOND ME extends beyond static data retention by leveraging LLM-based memory parameterization. This enables structured organization, contextual reasoning, and adaptive knowledge retrieval, facilitating a more systematic and intelligent approach to memory management. As AI-driven personal agents like SECOND ME become increasingly integrated into digital ecosystems, SECOND ME further represents a critical step toward augmenting human-world interaction with persistent, contextually aware, and self-optimizing memory systems. We have open-sourced the fully localizable deployment system at GitHub: https://github.com/Mindverse/Second-Me.</p>
