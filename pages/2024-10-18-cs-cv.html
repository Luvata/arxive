<p><b>Authors:</b> Guangjing Wang, Juexing Wang, Ce Zhou, Weikang Ding, Huacheng Zeng, Tianxing Li, Qiben Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Expression recognition holds great promise for applications such as content recommendation and mental healthcare by accurately detecting users' emotional states. Traditional methods often rely on cameras or wearable sensors, which raise privacy concerns and add extra device burdens. In addition, existing acoustic-based methods struggle to maintain satisfactory performance when there is a distribution shift between the training dataset and the inference dataset. In this paper, we introduce FacER+, an active acoustic facial expression recognition system, which eliminates the requirement for external microphone arrays. FacER+ extracts facial expression features by analyzing the echoes of near-ultrasound signals emitted between the 3D facial contour and the earpiece speaker on a smartphone. This approach not only reduces background noise but also enables the identification of different expressions from various users with minimal training data. We develop a contrastive external attention-based model to consistently learn expression features across different users, reducing the distribution differences. Extensive experiments involving 20 volunteers, both with and without masks, demonstrate that FacER+ can accurately recognize six common facial expressions with over 90% accuracy in diverse, user-independent real-life scenarios, surpassing the performance of the leading acoustic sensing methods by 10%. FacER+ offers a robust and practical solution for facial expression recognition.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adrien Le Coz, St\'ephane Herbin, Faouzi Adjed</p>
<p>Abstract: We address in this work the question of identifying the failure conditions of a given image classifier. To do so, we exploit the capacity of producing controllable distributions of high quality image data made available by recent Generative Adversarial Networks (StyleGAN2): the failure conditions are expressed as directions of strong performance degradation in the generative model latent space. This strategy of analysis is used to discover corner cases that combine multiple sources of corruption, and to compare in more details the behavior of different classifiers. The directions of degradation can also be rendered visually by generating data for better interpretability. Some degradations such as image quality can affect all classes, whereas other ones such as shape are more class-specific. The approach is demonstrated on the MNIST dataset that has been completed by two sources of corruption: noise and blur, and shows a promising way to better understand and control the risks of exploiting Artificial Intelligence components for safety-critical applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanan Zhang, Jiangmeng Li, Lixiang Liu, Wenwen Qiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundational Vision-Language models such as CLIP have exhibited impressive generalization in downstream tasks. However, CLIP suffers from a two-level misalignment issue, i.e., task misalignment and data misalignment, when adapting to specific tasks. Soft prompt tuning has mitigated the task misalignment, yet the data misalignment remains a challenge. To analyze the impacts of the data misalignment, we revisit the pre-training and adaptation processes of CLIP and develop a structural causal model. We discover that while we expect to capture task-relevant information for downstream tasks accurately, the task-irrelevant knowledge impacts the prediction results and hampers the modeling of the true relationships between the images and the predicted classes. As task-irrelevant knowledge is unobservable, we leverage the front-door adjustment and propose Causality-Guided Semantic Decoupling and Classification (CDC) to mitigate the interference of task-irrelevant knowledge. Specifically, we decouple semantics contained in the data of downstream tasks and perform classification based on each semantic. Furthermore, we employ the Dempster-Shafer evidence theory to evaluate the uncertainty of each prediction generated by diverse semantics. Experiments conducted in multiple different settings have consistently demonstrated the effectiveness of CDC.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Gramelt, Timon H\"ofer, Ute Schmid</p>
<p>Abstract: Being able to recognise defects in industrial objects is a key element of quality assurance in production lines. Our research focuses on visual anomaly detection in RGB images. Although Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) achieve high accuracies in this task, end users in industrial environments receive the model's decisions without additional explanations. Therefore, it is of interest to enrich the model's outputs with further explanations to increase confidence in the model and speed up anomaly detection. In our work, we focus on (1) CNN-based classification models and (2) the further development of a model-agnostic explanation algorithm for black-box classifiers. Additionally, (3) we demonstrate how we can establish an interactive interface that allows users to further correct the model's output. We present our NearCAIPI Interaction Framework, which improves AI through user interaction, and show how this approach increases the system's trustworthiness. We also illustrate how NearCAIPI can integrate human feedback into an interactive process chain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marc Rigter, Tarun Gupta, Agrin Hilmkil, Chao Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Large-scale generative models have achieved remarkable success in a number of domains. However, for sequential decision-making problems, such as robotics, action-labelled data is often scarce and therefore scaling-up foundation models for decision-making remains a challenge. A potential solution lies in leveraging widely-available unlabelled videos to train world models that simulate the consequences of actions. If the world model is accurate, it can be used to optimize decision-making in downstream tasks. Image-to-video diffusion models are already capable of generating highly realistic synthetic videos. However, these models are not action-conditioned, and the most powerful models are closed-source which means they cannot be finetuned. In this work, we propose to adapt pretrained video diffusion models to action-conditioned world models, without access to the parameters of the pretrained model. Our approach, AVID, trains an adapter on a small domain-specific dataset of action-labelled videos. AVID uses a learned mask to modify the intermediate outputs of the pretrained model and generate accurate action-conditioned videos. We evaluate AVID on video game and real-world robotics data, and show that it outperforms existing baselines for diffusion model adaptation.1 Our results demonstrate that if utilized correctly, pretrained video models have the potential to be powerful tools for embodied AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Prasad Chaudhari, Aman Kumar, Chandravardhan Singh Raghaw, Mohammad Zia Ur Rehman, Nagendra Kumar</p>
<p>Abstract: Sentiment analysis and emotion recognition in videos are challenging tasks, given the diversity and complexity of the information conveyed in different modalities. Developing a highly competent framework that effectively addresses the distinct characteristics across various modalities is a primary concern in this domain. Previous studies on combined multimodal sentiment and emotion analysis often overlooked effective fusion for modality integration, intermodal contextual congruity, optimizing concatenated feature spaces, leading to suboptimal architecture. This paper presents a novel framework that leverages the multi-modal contextual information from utterances and applies metaheuristic algorithms to learn the contributing features for utterance-level sentiment and emotion prediction. Our Graph-enhanced Cross-Modal Infusion with a Metaheuristic-Driven Network (GCM-Net) integrates graph sampling and aggregation to recalibrate the modality features for video sentiment and emotion prediction. GCM-Net includes a cross-modal attention module determining intermodal interactions and utterance relevance. A harmonic optimization module employing a metaheuristic algorithm combines attended features, allowing for handling both single and multi-utterance inputs. To show the effectiveness of our approach, we have conducted extensive evaluations on three prominent multi-modal benchmark datasets, CMU MOSI, CMU MOSEI, and IEMOCAP. The experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach, showcasing accuracies of 91.56% and 86.95% for sentiment analysis on MOSI and MOSEI datasets. We have performed emotion analysis for the IEMOCAP dataset procuring an accuracy of 85.66% which signifies substantial performance enhancements over existing methods.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12926">DEeR: Deviation Eliminating and Noise Regulating for Privacy-preserving Federated Low-rank Adaptation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Meilu Zhu, Axiu Mao, Jun Liu, Yixuan Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Integrating low-rank adaptation (LoRA) with federated learning (FL) has received widespread attention recently, aiming to adapt pretrained foundation models (FMs) to downstream medical tasks via privacy-preserving decentralized training. However, owing to the direct combination of LoRA and FL, current methods generally undergo two problems, i.e., aggregation deviation, and differential privacy (DP) noise amplification effect. To address these problems, we propose a novel privacy-preserving federated finetuning framework called \underline{D}eviation \underline{E}liminating and Nois\underline{e} \underline{R}egulating (DEeR). Specifically, we firstly theoretically prove that the necessary condition to eliminate aggregation deviation is guaranteing the equivalence between LoRA parameters of clients. Based on the theoretical insight, a deviation eliminator is designed to utilize alternating minimization algorithm to iteratively optimize the zero-initialized and non-zero-initialized parameter matrices of LoRA, ensuring that aggregation deviation always be zeros during training. Furthermore, we also conduct an in-depth analysis of the noise amplification effect and find that this problem is mainly caused by the ``linear relationship'' between DP noise and LoRA parameters. To suppress the noise amplification effect, we propose a noise regulator that exploits two regulator factors to decouple relationship between DP and LoRA, thereby achieving robust privacy protection and excellent finetuning performance. Additionally, we perform comprehensive ablated experiments to verify the effectiveness of the deviation eliminator and noise regulator. DEeR shows better performance on public medical datasets in comparison with state-of-the-art approaches. The code is available at https://github.com/CUHK-AIM-Group/DEeR.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce DreamCraft3D++, an extension of DreamCraft3D that enables efficient high-quality generation of complex 3D assets. DreamCraft3D++ inherits the multi-stage generation process of DreamCraft3D, but replaces the time-consuming geometry sculpting optimization with a feed-forward multi-plane based reconstruction model, speeding up the process by 1000x. For texture refinement, we propose a training-free IP-Adapter module that is conditioned on the enhanced multi-view images to enhance texture and geometry consistency, providing a 4x faster alternative to DreamCraft3D's DreamBooth fine-tuning. Experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate DreamCraft3D++'s ability to generate creative 3D assets with intricate geometry and realistic 360{\deg} textures, outperforming state-of-the-art image-to-3D methods in quality and speed. The full implementation will be open-sourced to enable new possibilities in 3D content creation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jintao Ren, Kim Hochreuter, Jesper Folsted Kallehauge, Stine Sofia Korreman</p>
<p>Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays a crucial role in MRI-guided adaptive radiotherapy for head and neck cancer (HNC) due to its superior soft-tissue contrast. However, accurately segmenting the gross tumor volume (GTV), which includes both the primary tumor (GTVp) and lymph nodes (GTVn), remains challenging. Recently, two deep learning segmentation innovations have shown great promise: UMamba, which effectively captures long-range dependencies, and the nnU-Net Residual Encoder (ResEnc), which enhances feature extraction through multistage residual blocks. In this study, we integrate these strengths into a novel approach, termed 'UMambaAdj'. Our proposed method was evaluated on the HNTS-MRG 2024 challenge test set using pre-RT T2-weighted MRI images, achieving an aggregated Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSCagg) of 0.751 for GTVp and 0.842 for GTVn, with a mean DSCagg of 0.796. This approach demonstrates potential for more precise tumor delineation in MRI-guided adaptive radiotherapy, ultimately improving treatment outcomes for HNC patients. Team: DCPT-Stine's group.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jintao Ren, Kim Hochreuter, Mathis Ersted Rasmussen, Jesper Folsted Kallehauge, Stine Sofia Korreman</p>
<p>Abstract: Radiation therapy (RT) is a vital part of treatment for head and neck cancer, where accurate segmentation of gross tumor volume (GTV) is essential for effective treatment planning. This study investigates the use of pre-RT tumor regions and local gradient maps to enhance mid-RT tumor segmentation for head and neck cancer in MRI-guided adaptive radiotherapy. By leveraging pre-RT images and their segmentations as prior knowledge, we address the challenge of tumor localization in mid-RT segmentation. A gradient map of the tumor region from the pre-RT image is computed and applied to mid-RT images to improve tumor boundary delineation. Our approach demonstrated improved segmentation accuracy for both primary GTV (GTVp) and nodal GTV (GTVn), though performance was limited by data constraints. The final DSCagg scores from the challenge's test set evaluation were 0.534 for GTVp, 0.867 for GTVn, and a mean score of 0.70. This method shows potential for enhancing segmentation and treatment planning in adaptive radiotherapy. Team: DCPT-Stine's group.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Liu, Yaofang Liu, Jinshan Pan, Yuxiang Hui, Fan Jia, Raymond H. Chan, Tieyong Zeng</p>
<p>Abstract: Most existing super-resolution methods and datasets have been developed to improve the image quality in well-lighted conditions. However, these methods do not work well in real-world low-light conditions as the images captured in such conditions lose most important information and contain significant unknown noises. To solve this problem, we propose a SRRIIE dataset with an efficient conditional diffusion probabilistic models-based method. The proposed dataset contains 4800 paired low-high quality images. To ensure that the dataset are able to model the real-world image degradation in low-illumination environments, we capture images using an ILDC camera and an optical zoom lens with exposure levels ranging from -6 EV to 0 EV and ISO levels ranging from 50 to 12800. We comprehensively evaluate with various reconstruction and perceptual metrics and demonstrate the practicabilities of the SRRIIE dataset for deep learning-based methods. We show that most existing methods are less effective in preserving the structures and sharpness of restored images from complicated noises. To overcome this problem, we revise the condition for Raw sensor data and propose a novel time-melding condition for diffusion probabilistic model. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experimental results on the real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate the feasibility and effectivenesses of the proposed conditional diffusion probabilistic model on Raw sensor data.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zachary Grey, Nicholas Fisher, Andrew Glaws, Gunay Dogan</p>
<p>Abstract: Materials scientists utilize image segmentation of micrographs to create large curve ensembles representing grain boundaries of material microstructures. Observations of these collections of shapes can facilitate inferences about material properties and manufacturing processes. We seek to bolster this application, and related engineering/scientific tasks, using novel pattern recognition formalisms and inference over large ensembles of segmented curves -- i.e., facilitate principled assessments for quantifying differences in distributions of shapes. To this end, we apply a composite integral operator to motivate accurate and efficient numerical representations of discrete planar curves over matrix manifolds. The main result is a rigid-invariant orthonormal decomposition of curve component functions into separable forms of scale variations and complementary features of undulation. We demonstrate how these separable shape tensors -- given thousands of curves in an ensemble -- can inform explainable binary classification of segmented images by utilizing a product maximum mean discrepancy to distinguish the shape distributions; absent labelled data, building interpretable feature spaces in seconds without high performance computation, and detecting discrepancies below cursory visual inspections.</p>

<p>Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) performs zero-shot image classification by mapping images and textual class representation into a shared embedding space, then retrieving the class closest to the image. This work provides a new approach for interpreting CLIP models for image classification from the lens of mutual knowledge between the two modalities. Specifically, we ask: what concepts do both vision and language CLIP encoders learn in common that influence the joint embedding space, causing points to be closer or further apart? We answer this question via an approach of textual concept-based explanations, showing their effectiveness, and perform an analysis encompassing a pool of 13 CLIP models varying in architecture, size and pretraining datasets. We explore those different aspects in relation to mutual knowledge, and analyze zero-shot predictions. Our approach demonstrates an effective and human-friendly way of understanding zero-shot classification decisions with CLIP.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13027">Geometric Trajectory Diffusion Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaqi Han, Minkai Xu, Aaron Lou, Haotian Ye, Stefano Ermon</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative models have shown great promise in generating 3D geometric systems, which is a fundamental problem in many natural science domains such as molecule and protein design. However, existing approaches only operate on static structures, neglecting the fact that physical systems are always dynamic in nature. In this work, we propose geometric trajectory diffusion models (GeoTDM), the first diffusion model for modeling the temporal distribution of 3D geometric trajectories. Modeling such distribution is challenging as it requires capturing both the complex spatial interactions with physical symmetries and temporal correspondence encapsulated in the dynamics. We theoretically justify that diffusion models with equivariant temporal kernels can lead to density with desired symmetry, and develop a novel transition kernel leveraging SE(3)-equivariant spatial convolution and temporal attention. Furthermore, to induce an expressive trajectory distribution for conditional generation, we introduce a generalized learnable geometric prior into the forward diffusion process to enhance temporal conditioning. We conduct extensive experiments on both unconditional and conditional generation in various scenarios, including physical simulation, molecular dynamics, and pedestrian motion. Empirical results on a wide suite of metrics demonstrate that GeoTDM can generate realistic geometric trajectories with significantly higher quality.</p>

In this paper, we evaluate the ability of generative VLMs to understand lexical and semantic changes in text using the SugarCrepe++ dataset. We analyze the sensitivity of VLMs to lexical alterations in prompts without corresponding semantic changes. Our findings demonstrate that generative VLMs are highly sensitive to such alterations. Additionally, we show that this vulnerability affects the performance of techniques aimed at achieving consistency in their outputs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Walking as a form of active travel is essential in promoting sustainable transport. It is thus crucial to accurately predict pedestrian crossing intention and avoid collisions, especially with the advent of autonomous and advanced driver-assisted vehicles. Current research leverages computer vision and machine learning advances to predict near-misses; however, this often requires high computation power to yield reliable results. In contrast, this work proposes a low-complexity ensemble-learning approach that employs contextual data for predicting the pedestrian's intent for crossing. The pedestrian is first detected, and their image is then compressed using skeleton-ization, and contextual information is added into a stacked ensemble-learning approach. Our experiments on different datasets achieve similar pedestrian intent prediction performance as the state-of-the-art approaches with 99.7% reduction in computational complexity. Our source code and trained models will be released upon paper acceptance</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13094">Task Consistent Prototype Learning for Incremental Few-shot Semantic Segmentation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenbo Xu, Yanan Wu, Haoran Jiang, Yang Wang, Qiang Wu, Jian Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Incremental Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation (iFSS) tackles a task that requires a model to continually expand its segmentation capability on novel classes using only a few annotated examples. Typical incremental approaches encounter a challenge that the objective of the base training phase (fitting base classes with sufficient instances) does not align with the incremental learning phase (rapidly adapting to new classes with less forgetting). This disconnect can result in suboptimal performance in the incremental setting. This study introduces a meta-learning-based prototype approach that encourages the model to learn how to adapt quickly while preserving previous knowledge. Concretely, we mimic the incremental evaluation protocol during the base training session by sampling a sequence of pseudo-incremental tasks. Each task in the simulated sequence is trained using a meta-objective to enable rapid adaptation without forgetting. To enhance discrimination among class prototypes, we introduce prototype space redistribution learning, which dynamically updates class prototypes to establish optimal inter-prototype boundaries within the prototype space. Extensive experiments on iFSS datasets built upon PASCAL and COCO benchmarks show the advanced performance of the proposed approach, offering valuable insights for addressing iFSS challenges.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Viraj Prabhu, Senthil Purushwalkam, An Yan, Caiming Xiong, Ran Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often generate plausible but incorrect responses to visual queries. However, reliably quantifying the effect of such hallucinations in free-form responses to open-ended queries is challenging as it requires visually verifying each claim within the response. We propose Programmatic VLM Evaluation (PROVE), a new benchmarking paradigm for evaluating VLM responses to open-ended queries. To construct PROVE, we provide a large language model (LLM) with a high-fidelity scene-graph representation constructed from a hyper-detailed image caption, and prompt it to generate diverse question-answer (QA) pairs, as well as programs that can be executed over the scene graph object to verify each QA pair. We thus construct a benchmark of 10.5k challenging but visually grounded QA pairs. Next, to evaluate free-form model responses to queries in PROVE, we propose a programmatic evaluation strategy that measures both the helpfulness and truthfulness of a response within a unified scene graph-based framework. We benchmark the helpfulness-truthfulness trade-offs of a range of VLMs on PROVE, finding that very few are in-fact able to achieve a good balance between the two.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nashrah Haque, Xiang Li, Zhehui Chen, Yanzhao Wu, Lei Yu, Arun Iyengar, Wenqi Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a novel framework, Stable Diffusion-based Momentum Integrated Adversarial Examples (SD-MIAE), for generating adversarial examples that can effectively mislead neural network classifiers while maintaining visual imperceptibility and preserving the semantic similarity to the original class label. Our method leverages the text-to-image generation capabilities of the Stable Diffusion model by manipulating token embeddings corresponding to the specified class in its latent space. These token embeddings guide the generation of adversarial images that maintain high visual fidelity. The SD-MIAE framework consists of two phases: (1) an initial adversarial optimization phase that modifies token embeddings to produce misclassified yet natural-looking images and (2) a momentum-based optimization phase that refines the adversarial perturbations. By introducing momentum, our approach stabilizes the optimization of perturbations across iterations, enhancing both the misclassification rate and visual fidelity of the generated adversarial examples. Experimental results demonstrate that SD-MIAE achieves a high misclassification rate of 79%, improving by 35% over the state-of-the-art method while preserving the imperceptibility of adversarial perturbations and the semantic similarity to the original class label, making it a practical method for robust adversarial evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiwan Hur, Dong-Jae Lee, Gyojin Han, Jaehyun Choi, Yunho Jeon, Junmo Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Masked generative models (MGMs) have shown impressive generative ability while providing an order of magnitude efficient sampling steps compared to continuous diffusion models. However, MGMs still underperform in image synthesis compared to recent well-developed continuous diffusion models with similar size in terms of quality and diversity of generated samples. A key factor in the performance of continuous diffusion models stems from the guidance methods, which enhance the sample quality at the expense of diversity. In this paper, we extend these guidance methods to generalized guidance formulation for MGMs and propose a self-guidance sampling method, which leads to better generation quality. The proposed approach leverages an auxiliary task for semantic smoothing in vector-quantized token space, analogous to the Gaussian blur in continuous pixel space. Equipped with the parameter-efficient fine-tuning method and high-temperature sampling, MGMs with the proposed self-guidance achieve a superior quality-diversity trade-off, outperforming existing sampling methods in MGMs with more efficient training and sampling costs. Extensive experiments with the various sampling hyperparameters confirm the effectiveness of the proposed self-guidance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juncong Xu, Yang Yang, Han Fang, Honggu Liu, Weiming Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The explosive growth of generative AI has saturated the internet with AI-generated images, raising security concerns and increasing the need for reliable detection methods. The primary requirement for such detection is generalizability, typically achieved by training on numerous fake images from various models. However, practical limitations, such as closed-source models and restricted access, often result in limited training samples. Therefore, training a general detector with few-shot samples is essential for modern detection mechanisms. To address this challenge, we propose FAMSeC, a general AI-generated image detection method based on LoRA-based Forgery Awareness Module and Semantic feature-guided Contrastive learning strategy. To effectively learn from limited samples and prevent overfitting, we developed a Forgery Awareness Module (FAM) based on LoRA, maintaining the generalization of pre-trained features. Additionally, to cooperate with FAM, we designed a Semantic feature-guided Contrastive learning strategy (SeC), making the FAM focus more on the differences between real/fake image than on the features of the samples themselves. Experiments show that FAMSeC outperforms state-of-the-art method, enhancing classification accuracy by 14.55% with just 0.56% of the training samples.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiamin Wu, Kenkun Liu, Yukai Shi, Xiaoke Jiang, Yuan Yao, Lei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we present UniG, a view-consistent 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis model that generates a high-fidelity representation of 3D Gaussians from sparse images. Existing 3D Gaussians-based methods usually regress Gaussians per-pixel of each view, create 3D Gaussians per view separately, and merge them through point concatenation. Such a view-independent reconstruction approach often results in a view inconsistency issue, where the predicted positions of the same 3D point from different views may have discrepancies. To address this problem, we develop a DETR (DEtection TRansformer)-like framework, which treats 3D Gaussians as decoder queries and updates their parameters layer by layer by performing multi-view cross-attention (MVDFA) over multiple input images. In this way, multiple views naturally contribute to modeling a unitary representation of 3D Gaussians, thereby making 3D reconstruction more view-consistent. Moreover, as the number of 3D Gaussians used as decoder queries is irrespective of the number of input views, allow an arbitrary number of input images without causing memory explosion. Extensive experiments validate the advantages of our approach, showcasing superior performance over existing methods quantitatively (improving PSNR by 4.2 dB when trained on Objaverse and tested on the GSO benchmark) and qualitatively.</p>

<p>Abstract: Fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) is crucial for diagnosing and monitoring retinal vascular issues but is limited by its invasive nature and restricted accessibility compared to color fundus (CF) imaging. Existing methods that convert CF images to FFA are confined to static image generation, missing the dynamic lesional changes. We introduce Fundus2Video, an autoregressive generative adversarial network (GAN) model that generates dynamic FFA videos from single CF images. Fundus2Video excels in video generation, achieving an FVD of 1497.12 and a PSNR of 11.77. Clinical experts have validated the fidelity of the generated videos. Additionally, the model's generator demonstrates remarkable downstream transferability across ten external public datasets, including blood vessel segmentation, retinal disease diagnosis, systemic disease prediction, and multimodal retrieval, showcasing impressive zero-shot and few-shot capabilities. These findings position Fundus2Video as a powerful, non-invasive alternative to FFA exams and a versatile retinal generative foundation model that captures both static and temporal retinal features, enabling the representation of complex inter-modality relationships.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kexuan Shi, Hai Chen, Leheng Zhang, Shuhang Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs), as a versatile representation paradigm, have achieved success in various computer vision tasks. Due to the spectral bias of the vanilla multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), existing methods focus on designing MLPs with sophisticated architectures or repurposing training techniques for highly accurate INRs. In this paper, we delve into the linear dynamics model of MLPs and theoretically identify the empirical Neural Tangent Kernel (eNTK) matrix as a reliable link between spectral bias and training dynamics. Based on eNTK matrix, we propose a practical inductive gradient adjustment method, which could purposefully improve the spectral bias via inductive generalization of eNTK-based gradient transformation matrix. We evaluate our method on different INRs tasks with various INR architectures and compare to existing training techniques. The superior representation performance clearly validates the advantage of our proposed method. Armed with our gradient adjustment method, better INRs with more enhanced texture details and sharpened edges can be learned from data by tailored improvements on spectral bias.</p>

<p>Abstract: Novel view synthesis has made significant progress in the field of 3D computer vision. However, the rendering of view-consistent novel views from imperfect camera poses remains challenging. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid bundle-adjusting 3D Gaussians model that enables view-consistent rendering with pose optimization.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chuyu Zhang, Peiyan Gu, Xueyang Yu, Xuming He</p>
<p>Abstract: We tackle the generalized category discovery (GCD) problem, which aims to discover novel classes in unlabeled datasets by leveraging the knowledge of known classes. Previous works utilize the known class knowledge through shared representation spaces. Despite their progress, our analysis experiments show that novel classes can achieve impressive clustering results on the feature space of a known class pre-trained model, suggesting that existing methods may not fully utilize known class knowledge. To address it, we introduce a novel concept learning framework for GCD, named ConceptGCD, that categorizes concepts into two types: derivable and underivable from known class concepts, and adopts a stage-wise learning strategy to learn them separately. Specifically, our framework first extracts known class concepts by a known class pre-trained model and then produces derivable concepts from them by a generator layer with a covariance-augmented loss. Subsequently, we expand the generator layer to learn underivable concepts in a balanced manner ensured by a concept score normalization strategy and integrate a contrastive loss to preserve previously learned concepts. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach over the previous state-of-the-art methods. Code will be available soon.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuexun Liu, Xiaoxu Xu, Jinlong Li, Qiudan Zhang, Xu Wang, Nicu Sebe, Lin Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Referring 3D Segmentation is a visual-language task that segments all points of the specified object from a 3D point cloud described by a sentence of query. Previous works perform a two-stage paradigm, first conducting language-agnostic instance segmentation then matching with given text query. However, the semantic concepts from text query and visual cues are separately interacted during the training, and both instance and semantic labels for each object are required, which is time consuming and human-labor intensive. To mitigate these issues, we propose a novel Referring 3D Segmentation pipeline, Label-Efficient and Single-Stage, dubbed LESS, which is only under the supervision of efficient binary mask. Specifically, we design a Point-Word Cross-Modal Alignment module for aligning the fine-grained features of points and textual embedding. Query Mask Predictor module and Query-Sentence Alignment module are introduced for coarse-grained alignment between masks and query. Furthermore, we propose an area regularization loss, which coarsely reduces irrelevant background predictions on a large scale. Besides, a point-to-point contrastive loss is proposed concentrating on distinguishing points with subtly similar features. Through extensive experiments, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on ScanRefer dataset by surpassing the previous methods about 3.7% mIoU using only binary labels.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chuhao Zhou, Chenxi Jiang, Yi Xie, Haozhi Cao, Jianfei Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Dataset Distillation (DD) seeks to create a condensed dataset that, when used to train a model, enables the model to achieve performance similar to that of a model trained on the entire original dataset. It relieves the model training from processing massive data and thus reduces the computation resources, storage, and time costs. This paper illustrates our solution that ranks 1st in the ECCV-2024 Data Distillation Challenge (track 1). Our solution, Modified Difficulty-Aligned Trajectory Matching (M-DATM), introduces two key modifications to the original state-of-the-art method DATM: (1) the soft labels learned by DATM do not achieve one-to-one correspondence with the counterparts generated by the official evaluation script, so we remove the soft labels technique to alleviate such inconsistency; (2) since the removal of soft labels makes it harder for the synthetic dataset to learn late trajectory information, particularly on Tiny ImageNet, we reduce the matching range, allowing the synthetic data to concentrate more on the easier patterns. In the final evaluation, our M-DATM achieved accuracies of 0.4061 and 0.1831 on the CIFAR-100 and Tiny ImageNet datasets, ranking 1st in the Fixed Images Per Class (IPC) Track.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Novel Certad, Cristina Olaverri-Monreal, Friedrich Wiesinger, Tomasz E. Burghardt</p>
<p>Abstract: Road markings were reported as critical road safety features, equally needed for both human drivers and for machine vision technologies utilised by advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and in driving automation. Visibility of road markings is achieved because of their colour contrasting with the roadway surface. During recent testing of an open-source camera-based ADAS under several visibility conditions (day, night, rain, glare), significant failures in trajectory planning were recorded and quantified. Consistently, better ADAS reliability under poor visibility conditions was achieved with Type II road markings (i.e. structured markings, facilitating moisture drainage) as compared to Type I road marking (i.e. flat lines). To further understand these failures, analysis of contrast ratio of road markings, which the tested ADAS was detecting for traffic lane recognition, was performed. The highest contrast ratio (greater than 0.5, calculated per Michelson equation) was measured at night in the absence of confounding factors, with statistically significant difference of 0.1 in favour of Type II road markings over Type I. Under daylight conditions, contrast ratio was reduced, with slightly higher values measured with Type I. The presence of rain or wet roads caused the deterioration of the contrast ratio, with Type II road markings exhibiting significantly higher contrast ratio than Type I, even though the values were low (less than 0.1). These findings matched the output of the ADAS related to traffic lane detection and underlined the importance of road marking visibility. Inadequate lane recognition by ADAS was associated with very low contrast ratio of road markings indeed. Importantly, specific minimum contrast ratio value could not be found, which was due to the complexity of ADAS algorithms...</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuichang Lai, Letian Huang, Jie Guo, Kai Cheng, Bowen Pan, Xiaoxiao Long, Jiangjing Lyu, Chengfei Lv, Yanwen Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Reconstructing objects from posed images is a crucial and complex task in computer graphics and computer vision. While NeRF-based neural reconstruction methods have exhibited impressive reconstruction ability, they tend to be time-comsuming. Recent strategies have adopted 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) for inverse rendering, which have led to quick and effective outcomes. However, these techniques generally have difficulty in producing believable geometries and materials for glossy objects, a challenge that stems from the inherent ambiguities of inverse rendering. To address this, we introduce GlossyGS, an innovative 3D-GS-based inverse rendering framework that aims to precisely reconstruct the geometry and materials of glossy objects by integrating material priors. The key idea is the use of micro-facet geometry segmentation prior, which helps to reduce the intrinsic ambiguities and improve the decomposition of geometries and materials. Additionally, we introduce a normal map prefiltering strategy to more accurately simulate the normal distribution of reflective surfaces. These strategies are integrated into a hybrid geometry and material representation that employs both explicit and implicit methods to depict glossy objects. We demonstrate through quantitative analysis and qualitative visualization that the proposed method is effective to reconstruct high-fidelity geometries and materials of glossy objects, and performs favorably against state-of-the-arts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuezhi Xiang, Xi Wang, Lei Zhang, Denis Ombati, Himaloy Himu, Xiantong Zhen</p>
<p>Abstract: Scene flow estimation aims to generate the 3D motion field of points between two consecutive frames of point clouds, which has wide applications in various fields. Existing point-based methods ignore the irregularity of point clouds and have difficulty capturing long-range dependencies due to the inefficiency of point-level computation. Voxel-based methods suffer from the loss of detail information. In this paper, we propose a point-voxel fusion method, where we utilize a voxel branch based on sparse grid attention and the shifted window strategy to capture long-range dependencies and a point branch to capture fine-grained features to compensate for the information loss in the voxel branch. In addition, since xyz coordinates are difficult to describe the geometric structure of complex 3D objects in the scene, we explicitly encode the local surface information of the point cloud through the umbrella surface feature extraction (USFE) module. We verify the effectiveness of our method by conducting experiments on the Flyingthings3D and KITTI datasets. Our method outperforms all other self-supervised methods and achieves highly competitive results compared to fully supervised methods. We achieve improvements in all metrics, especially EPE, which is reduced by 8.51% and 10.52% on the KITTIo and KITTIs datasets, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoran Hao, Jiaming Han, Changsheng Li, Yu-Feng Li, Xiangyu Yue</p>
<p>Abstract: The development of large language models (LLMs) has significantly enhanced the capabilities of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) as general assistants. However, lack of user-specific knowledge still restricts their application in human's daily life. In this paper, we introduce the Retrieval Augmented Personalization (RAP) framework for MLLMs' personalization. Starting from a general MLLM, we turn it into a personalized assistant in three steps. (a) Remember: We design a key-value database to store user-related information, e.g., user's name, avatar and other attributes. (b) Retrieve: When the user initiates a conversation, RAP will retrieve relevant information from the database using a multimodal retriever. (c) Generate: The input query and retrieved concepts' information are fed into MLLMs to generate personalized, knowledge-augmented responses. Unlike previous methods, RAP allows real-time concept editing via updating the external database. To further improve generation quality and alignment with user-specific information, we design a pipeline for data collection and create a specialized dataset for personalized training of MLLMs. Based on the dataset, we train a series of MLLMs as personalized multimodal assistants. By pretraining on large-scale dataset, RAP-MLLMs can generalize to infinite visual concepts without additional finetuning. Our models demonstrate outstanding flexibility and generation quality across a variety of tasks, such as personalized image captioning, question answering and visual recognition.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Donghao Zhou, Jiancheng Huang, Jinbin Bai, Jiaze Wang, Hao Chen, Guangyong Chen, Xiaowei Hu, Pheng-Ann Heng</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have enabled the creation of high-quality images from text prompts, but they still struggle to generate images with precise control over specific visual concepts. Existing approaches can replicate a given concept by learning from reference images, yet they lack the flexibility for fine-grained customization of the individual component within the concept. In this paper, we introduce component-controllable personalization, a novel task that pushes the boundaries of T2I models by allowing users to reconfigure specific components when personalizing visual concepts. This task is particularly challenging due to two primary obstacles: semantic pollution, where unwanted visual elements corrupt the personalized concept, and semantic imbalance, which causes disproportionate learning of the concept and component. To overcome these challenges, we design MagicTailor, an innovative framework that leverages Dynamic Masked Degradation (DM-Deg) to dynamically perturb undesired visual semantics and Dual-Stream Balancing (DS-Bal) to establish a balanced learning paradigm for desired visual semantics. Extensive comparisons, ablations, and analyses demonstrate that MagicTailor not only excels in this challenging task but also holds significant promise for practical applications, paving the way for more nuanced and creative image generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Florian Wulff, Bernd Schaeufele, Julian Pfeifer, Ilja Radusch</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated vehicles rely on an accurate and robust perception of the environment. Similarly to automated cars, highly automated trains require an environmental perception. Although there is a lot of research based on either camera or LiDAR sensors in the automotive domain, very few contributions for this task exist yet for automated trains. Additionally, no public dataset or described approach for a 3D LiDAR semantic segmentation in the railway environment exists yet. Thus, we propose an approach for a point-wise 3D semantic segmentation based on the 2DPass network architecture using scans and images jointly. In addition, we present a semi-automated intelligent data annotation approach, which we use to efficiently and accurately label the required dataset recorded on a railway track in Germany. To improve performance despite a still small number of labeled scans, we apply an active learning approach to intelligently select scans for the training dataset. Our contributions are threefold: We annotate rail data including camera and LiDAR data from the railway environment, transfer label the raw LiDAR point clouds using an image segmentation network, and train a state-of-the-art 3D LiDAR semantic segmentation network efficiently leveraging active learning. The trained network achieves good segmentation results with a mean IoU of 71.48% of 9 classes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuoran Liu, Danpei Zhao, Bo Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Current methods for disaster scene interpretation in remote sensing images (RSIs) mostly focus on isolated tasks such as segmentation, detection, or visual question-answering (VQA). However, current interpretation methods often fail at tasks that require the combination of multiple perception methods and specialized tools. To fill this gap, this paper introduces Adaptive Disaster Interpretation (ADI), a novel task designed to solve requests by planning and executing multiple sequentially correlative interpretation tasks to provide a comprehensive analysis of disaster scenes. To facilitate research and application in this area, we present a new dataset named RescueADI, which contains high-resolution RSIs with annotations for three connected aspects: planning, perception, and recognition. The dataset includes 4,044 RSIs, 16,949 semantic masks, 14,483 object bounding boxes, and 13,424 interpretation requests across nine challenging request types. Moreover, we propose a new disaster interpretation method employing autonomous agents driven by large language models (LLMs) for task planning and execution, proving its efficacy in handling complex disaster interpretations. The proposed agent-based method solves various complex interpretation requests such as counting, area calculation, and path-finding without human intervention, which traditional single-task approaches cannot handle effectively. Experimental results on RescueADI demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed task and show that our method achieves an accuracy 9% higher than existing VQA methods, highlighting its advantages over conventional disaster interpretation approaches. The dataset will be publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeremy Chopin, Rozenn Dahyot</p>
<p>Abstract: Data embeddings with CLIP and ImageBind provide powerful features for the analysis of multimedia and/or multimodal data. We assess their performance here for classification using a Gaussian Mixture models (GMMs) based layer as an alternative to the standard Softmax layer. GMMs based classifiers have recently been shown to have interesting performances as part of deep learning pipelines trained end-to-end. Our first contribution is to investigate GMM based classification performance taking advantage of the embedded spaces CLIP and ImageBind. Our second contribution is in proposing our own GMM based classifier with a lower parameters count than previously proposed. Our findings are, that in most cases, on these tested embedded spaces, one gaussian component in the GMMs is often enough for capturing each class, and we hypothesize that this may be due to the contrastive loss used for training these embedded spaces that naturally concentrates features together for each class. We also observed that ImageBind often provides better performance than CLIP for classification of image datasets even when these embedded spaces are compressed using PCA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Changcheng Xiao, Qiong Cao, Yujie Zhong, Xiang Zhang, Tao Wang, Canqun Yang, Long Lan</p>
<p>Abstract: Referring multi-object tracking (RMOT) is an emerging cross-modal task that aims to locate an arbitrary number of target objects and maintain their identities referred by a language expression in a video. This intricate task involves the reasoning of linguistic and visual modalities, along with the temporal association of target objects. However, the seminal work employs only loose feature fusion and overlooks the utilization of long-term information on tracked objects. In this study, we introduce a compact Transformer-based method, termed TenRMOT. We conduct feature fusion at both encoding and decoding stages to fully exploit the advantages of Transformer architecture. Specifically, we incrementally perform cross-modal fusion layer-by-layer during the encoding phase. In the decoding phase, we utilize language-guided queries to probe memory features for accurate prediction of the desired objects. Moreover, we introduce a query update module that explicitly leverages temporal prior information of the tracked objects to enhance the consistency of their trajectories. In addition, we introduce a novel task called Referring Multi-Object Tracking and Segmentation (RMOTS) and construct a new dataset named Ref-KITTI Segmentation. Our dataset consists of 18 videos with 818 expressions, and each expression averages 10.7 masks, which poses a greater challenge compared to the typical single mask in most existing referring video segmentation datasets. TenRMOT demonstrates superior performance on both the referring multi-object tracking and the segmentation tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ant Duru, Alptekin Temizel</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated data augmentation methods have significantly improved the performance and generalization capability of deep learning models in image classification. Yet, most state-of-the-art methods are optimized on common benchmark datasets, limiting their applicability to more diverse or domain-specific data, such as medical datasets. In this paper, we propose a strategy that uses large language models to automatically generate efficient augmentation policies, customized to fit the specific characteristics of any dataset and model architecture. The proposed method iteratively interacts with an LLM to obtain and refine the augmentation policies on model performance feedback, creating a dataset-agnostic data augmentation pipeline. The proposed method was evaluated on medical imaging datasets, showing a clear improvement over state-of-the-art methods. The proposed approach offers an adaptive and scalable solution. Although it increases computational cost, it significantly boosts model robustness, automates the process, and minimizes the need for human involvement during model development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Varun Burde, Artem Moroz, Vit Zeman, Pavel Burget</p>
<p>Abstract: Object pose estimation is a prominent task in computer vision. The object pose gives the orientation and translation of the object in real-world space, which allows various applications such as manipulation, augmented reality, etc. Various objects exhibit different properties with light, such as reflections, absorption, etc. This makes it challenging to understand the object's structure in RGB and depth channels. Recent research has been moving toward learning-based methods, which provide a more flexible and generalizable approach to object pose estimation utilizing deep learning. One such approach is the render-and-compare method, which renders the object from multiple views and compares it against the given 2D image, which often requires an object representation in the form of a CAD model. We reason that the synthetic texture of the CAD model may not be ideal for rendering and comparing operations. We showed that if the object is represented as an implicit (neural) representation in the form of Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), it exhibits a more realistic rendering of the actual scene and retains the crucial spatial features, which makes the comparison more versatile. We evaluated our NeRF implementation of the render-and-compare method on transparent datasets and found that it surpassed the current state-of-the-art results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bin Wang, Fei Deng, Shuang Wang, Wen Luo, Zhixuan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Semantic segmentation of remote sensing (RS) images is a challenging task with significant potential across various applications. Deep learning, especially supervised learning with large-scale labeled datasets, has greatly advanced this field. However, acquiring high-quality labeled data is expensive and time-consuming. Moreover, variations in ground sampling distance (GSD), imaging equipment, and geographic diversity contribute to domain shifts between datasets, which pose significant challenges to models trained solely on source domain data, leading to poor cross-domain performance. Domain shift is well-known for undermining a model's generalization ability in the target domain. To address this, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has emerged as a promising solution, enabling models to learn from unlabeled target domain data while training on labeled source domain data. Recent advancements, particularly in self-supervised learning via pseudo-label generation, have shown potential in mitigating domain discrepancies. Strategies combining source and target domain images with their true and pseudo labels for self-supervised training have been effective in addressing domain bias. Despite progress in computer vision, the application of pseudo-labeling methods to RS image segmentation remains underexplored.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyang Chen, Yiwen Ye, Yongsheng Pan, Yong Xia</p>
<p>Abstract: Distribution shifts widely exist in medical images acquired from different medical centers, hindering the deployment of semantic segmentation models trained on data from one center (source domain) to another (target domain). While unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has shown significant promise in mitigating these shifts, it poses privacy risks due to sharing data between centers. To facilitate adaptation while preserving data privacy, source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) and test-time adaptation (TTA) have emerged as effective paradigms, relying solely on target domain data. However, the scenarios currently addressed by SFDA and TTA are limited, making them less suitable for clinical applications. In a more realistic clinical scenario, the pre-trained model is deployed in a medical centre to assist with clinical tasks during the day and rest at night. During the daytime process, TTA can be employed to enhance inference performance. During the nighttime process, after collecting the test data from the day, the model can be fine-tuned utilizing SFDA to further adapt to the target domain. With above insights, we propose a novel adaptation framework called Day-Night Adaptation (DyNA). This framework adapts the model to the target domain through day-night loops without requiring access to source data. Specifically, we implement distinct adaptation strategies for daytime and nighttime to better meet the demands of clinical settings. During the daytime, model parameters are frozen, and a specific low-frequency prompt is trained for each test sample. Additionally, we construct a memory bank for prompt initialization and develop a warm-up mechanism to enhance prompt training. During nighttime, we integrate a global student model into the traditional teacher-student self-training paradigm to fine-tune the model while ensuring training stability...</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiao Xie, Hongyi Wang, Ziwei Niu, Hao Sun, Shuyi Ouyang, Yen-Wei Chen, Lanfen Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) for medical image segmentation is a challenging yet highly practical task, which reduces reliance on large-scale labeled dataset by leveraging unlabeled samples. Among SSL techniques, the weak-to-strong consistency framework, popularized by FixMatch, has emerged as a state-of-the-art method in classification tasks. Notably, such a simple pipeline has also shown competitive performance in medical image segmentation. However, two key limitations still persist, impeding its efficient adaptation: (1) the neglect of contextual dependencies results in inconsistent predictions for similar semantic features, leading to incomplete object segmentation; (2) the lack of exploitation of semantic similarity between labeled and unlabeled data induces considerable class-distribution discrepancy. To address these limitations, we propose a novel semi-supervised framework based on FixMatch, named SemSim, powered by two appealing designs from semantic similarity perspective: (1) rectifying pixel-wise prediction by reasoning about the intra-image pair-wise affinity map, thus integrating contextual dependencies explicitly into the final prediction; (2) bridging labeled and unlabeled data via a feature querying mechanism for compact class representation learning, which fully considers cross-image anatomical similarities. As the reliable semantic similarity extraction depends on robust features, we further introduce an effective spatial-aware fusion module (SFM) to explore distinctive information from multiple scales. Extensive experiments show that SemSim yields consistent improvements over the state-of-the-art methods across three public segmentation benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Stereo estimation has made many advancements in recent years with the introduction of deep-learning. However the traditional supervised approach to deep-learning requires the creation of accurate and plentiful ground-truth data, which is expensive to create and not available in many situations. This is especially true for remote sensing applications, where there is an excess of available data without proper ground truth. To tackle this problem, we propose a self-supervised CNN with self-improving adaptive abilities. In the first iteration, the created disparity map is inaccurate and noisy. Leveraging the left-right consistency check, we get a sparse but more accurate disparity map which is used as an initial pseudo ground-truth. This pseudo ground-truth is then adapted and updated after every epoch in the training step of the network. We use the sum of inconsistent points in order to track the network convergence.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Che Liu, Zhongwei Wan, Haozhe Wang, Yinda Chen, Talha Qaiser, Chen Jin, Fariba Yousefi, Nikolay Burlutskiy, Rossella Arcucci</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical Vision-Language Pre-training (MedVLP) has made significant progress in enabling zero-shot tasks for medical image understanding. However, training MedVLP models typically requires large-scale datasets with paired, high-quality image-text data, which are scarce in the medical domain. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and diffusion models have made it possible to generate large-scale synthetic image-text pairs. This raises the question: *Can MedVLP succeed using purely synthetic data?* To address this, we use off-the-shelf generative models to create synthetic radiology reports and paired Chest X-ray (CXR) images, and propose an automated pipeline to build a diverse, high-quality synthetic dataset, enabling a rigorous study that isolates model and training settings, focusing entirely from the data perspective. Our results show that MedVLP models trained *exclusively on synthetic data* outperform those trained on real data by **3.8%** in averaged AUC on zero-shot classification. Moreover, using a combination of synthetic and real data leads to a further improvement of **9.07%**. Additionally, MedVLP models trained on synthetic or mixed data consistently outperform those trained on real data in zero-shot grounding, as well as in fine-tuned classification and segmentation tasks. Our analysis suggests MedVLP trained on well-designed synthetic data can outperform models trained on real datasets, which may be limited by low-quality samples and long-tailed distributions.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose L3DG, the first approach for generative 3D modeling of 3D Gaussians through a latent 3D Gaussian diffusion formulation. This enables effective generative 3D modeling, scaling to generation of entire room-scale scenes which can be very efficiently rendered. To enable effective synthesis of 3D Gaussians, we propose a latent diffusion formulation, operating in a compressed latent space of 3D Gaussians. This compressed latent space is learned by a vector-quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE), for which we employ a sparse convolutional architecture to efficiently operate on room-scale scenes. This way, the complexity of the costly generation process via diffusion is substantially reduced, allowing higher detail on object-level generation, as well as scalability to large scenes. By leveraging the 3D Gaussian representation, the generated scenes can be rendered from arbitrary viewpoints in real-time. We demonstrate that our approach significantly improves visual quality over prior work on unconditional object-level radiance field synthesis and showcase its applicability to room-scale scene generation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing is widely applied in fields such as emergency response, owing to its advantages of rapid information acquisition and low cost. However, due to the effects of shooting distance and imaging mechanisms, the objects in the images present challenges such as small size, dense distribution, and low inter-class differentiation. To this end, we propose a multimodal remote sensing detection network that employs a quad-directional selective scanning fusion strategy called RemoteDet-Mamba. RemoteDet-Mamba simultaneously facilitates the learning of single-modal local features and the integration of patch-level global features across modalities, enhancing the distinguishability for small objects and utilizing local information to improve discrimination between different classes. Additionally, the use of Mamba's serial processing significantly increases detection speed. Experimental results on the DroneVehicle dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of RemoteDet-Mamba, which achieves superior detection accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining computational efficiency and parameter count.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jooyeol Yun, Davide Abati, Mohamed Omran, Jaegul Choo, Amirhossein Habibian, Auke Wiggers</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative models have become a powerful tool for image editing tasks, including object insertion. However, these methods often lack spatial awareness, generating objects with unrealistic locations and scales, or unintentionally altering the scene background. A key challenge lies in maintaining visual coherence, which requires both a geometrically suitable object location and a high-quality image edit. In this paper, we focus on the former, creating a location model dedicated to identifying realistic object locations. Specifically, we train an autoregressive model that generates bounding box coordinates, conditioned on the background image and the desired object class. This formulation allows to effectively handle sparse placement annotations and to incorporate implausible locations into a preference dataset by performing direct preference optimization. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our generative location model, when paired with an inpainting method, substantially outperforms state-of-the-art instruction-tuned models and location modeling baselines in object insertion tasks, delivering accurate and visually coherent results.</p>

While such methods have been extensively implemented for image level tasks, we found no scalable implementation of Copy-Paste built specifically for video tasks. In this paper, we leverage the recent growth in video fidelity of generative models to explore effective ways of incorporating synthetically generated objects into existing video datasets to artificially expand object instance pools. We first procure synthetic video sequences featuring objects that morph dynamically with time. Our carefully devised pipeline automatically segments then copy-pastes these dynamic instances across the frames of any target background video sequence. We name our video data augmentation pipeline Synthetic Dynamic Instance Copy-Paste, and test it on the complex task of Video Instance Segmentation which combines detection, segmentation and tracking of object instances across a video sequence. Extensive experiments on the popular Youtube-VIS 2021 dataset using two separate popular networks as baselines achieve strong gains of +2.9 AP (6.5%) and +2.1 AP (4.9%).

<p>Abstract: Recent illumination estimation methods have focused on enhancing the resolution and improving the quality and diversity of the generated textures. However, few have explored tailoring the neural network architecture to the Equirectangular Panorama (ERP) format utilised in image-based lighting. Consequently, high dynamic range images (HDRI) results usually exhibit a seam at the side borders and textures or objects that are warped at the poles. To address this shortcoming we propose a novel architecture, 360U-Former, based on a U-Net style Vision-Transformer which leverages the work of PanoSWIN, an adapted shifted window attention tailored to the ERP format. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first purely Vision-Transformer model used in the field of illumination estimation. We train 360U-Former as a GAN to generate HDRI from a limited field of view low dynamic range image (LDRI). We evaluate our method using current illumination estimation evaluation protocols and datasets, demonstrating that our approach outperforms existing and state-of-the-art methods without the artefacts typically associated with the use of the ERP format.</p>

<p>Abstract: Cloth-changing person re-identification (CC-ReID), also known as Long-Term Person Re-Identification (LT-ReID) is a critical and challenging research topic in computer vision that has recently garnered significant attention. However, due to the high cost of constructing CC-ReID data, the existing data-driven models are hard to train efficiently on limited data, causing overfitting issue. To address this challenge, we propose a low-cost and efficient pipeline for generating controllable and high-quality synthetic data simulating the surveillance of real scenarios specific to the CC-ReID task. Particularly, we construct a new self-annotated CC-ReID dataset named Cloth-Changing Unreal Person (CCUP), containing 6,000 IDs, 1,179,976 images, 100 cameras, and 26.5 outfits per individual. Based on this large-scale dataset, we introduce an effective and scalable pretrain-finetune framework for enhancing the generalization capabilities of the traditional CC-ReID models. The extensive experiments demonstrate that two typical models namely TransReID and FIRe^2, when integrated into our framework, outperform other state-of-the-art models after pretraining on CCUP and finetuning on the benchmarks such as PRCC, VC-Clothes and NKUP.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guosheng Zhao, Chaojun Ni, Xiaofeng Wang, Zheng Zhu, Guan Huang, Xinze Chen, Boyuan Wang, Youyi Zhang, Wenjun Mei, Xingang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Closed-loop simulation is essential for advancing end-to-end autonomous driving systems. Contemporary sensor simulation methods, such as NeRF and 3DGS, rely predominantly on conditions closely aligned with training data distributions, which are largely confined to forward-driving scenarios. Consequently, these methods face limitations when rendering complex maneuvers (e.g., lane change, acceleration, deceleration). Recent advancements in autonomous-driving world models have demonstrated the potential to generate diverse driving videos. However, these approaches remain constrained to 2D video generation, inherently lacking the spatiotemporal coherence required to capture intricacies of dynamic driving environments. In this paper, we introduce \textit{DriveDreamer4D}, which enhances 4D driving scene representation leveraging world model priors. Specifically, we utilize the world model as a data machine to synthesize novel trajectory videos based on real-world driving data. Notably, we explicitly leverage structured conditions to control the spatial-temporal consistency of foreground and background elements, thus the generated data adheres closely to traffic constraints. To our knowledge, \textit{DriveDreamer4D} is the first to utilize video generation models for improving 4D reconstruction in driving scenarios. Experimental results reveal that \textit{DriveDreamer4D} significantly enhances generation quality under novel trajectory views, achieving a relative improvement in FID by 24.5\%, 39.0\%, and 10.5\% compared to PVG, $\text{S}^3$Gaussian, and Deformable-GS. Moreover, \textit{DriveDreamer4D} markedly enhances the spatiotemporal coherence of driving agents, which is verified by a comprehensive user study and the relative increases of 20.3\%, 42.0\%, and 13.7\% in the NTA-IoU metric.</p>

Two pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) models are exploited: ImageNet classification-trained ViT, whose features are used to estimate rough object localization through intra-class token relevance, and a self-supervised DINO-ViT for intra-image token relevance. On recent challenging benchmarks, the method achieves state-of-the-art performance among methods trained with the same level of supervision (image labels) while being competitive with methods trained with pixel-level supervision (binary masks). The benefits of the proposed co-segmentation method are further demonstrated in the task of large-scale sketch recognition, that is, the classification of sketches into a wide range of categories. The limited amount of hand-drawn sketch training data is leveraged by exploiting readily available image-level-annotated datasets of natural images containing a large number of classes. To bridge the domain gap, the classifier is trained on a sketch-like proxy domain derived from edges detected on natural images. We show that sketch recognition significantly benefits when the classifier is trained on sketch-like structures extracted from the co-segmented area rather than from the full image.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kuan-Ying Lee, Qian Zhou, Klara Nahrstedt</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-camera systems are indispensable in movies, TV shows, and other media. Selecting the appropriate camera at every timestamp has a decisive impact on production quality and audience preferences. Learning-based view recommendation frameworks can assist professionals in decision-making. However, they often struggle outside of their training domains. The scarcity of labeled multi-camera view recommendation datasets exacerbates the issue. Based on the insight that many videos are edited from the original multi-camera videos, we propose transforming regular videos into pseudo-labeled multi-camera view recommendation datasets. Promisingly, by training the model on pseudo-labeled datasets stemming from videos in the target domain, we achieve a 68% relative improvement in the model's accuracy in the target domain and bridge the accuracy gap between in-domain and never-before-seen domains.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13598">Let Me Finish My Sentence: Video Temporal Grounding with Holistic Text Understanding</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jongbhin Woo, Hyeonggon Ryu, Youngjoon Jang, Jae Won Cho, Joon Son Chung</p>
<p>Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to identify visual frames in a video clip that match text queries. Recent studies in VTG employ cross-attention to correlate visual frames and text queries as individual token sequences. However, these approaches overlook a crucial aspect of the problem: a holistic understanding of the query sentence. A model may capture correlations between individual word tokens and arbitrary visual frames while possibly missing out on the global meaning. To address this, we introduce two primary contributions: (1) a visual frame-level gate mechanism that incorporates holistic textual information, (2) cross-modal alignment loss to learn the fine-grained correlation between query and relevant frames. As a result, we regularize the effect of individual word tokens and suppress irrelevant visual frames. We demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in VTG benchmarks, indicating that holistic text understanding guides the model to focus on the semantically important parts within the video.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahao Lu, Jiacheng Deng, Ruijie Zhu, Yanzhe Liang, Wenfei Yang, Tianzhu Zhang, Xu Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Dynamic scenes rendering is an intriguing yet challenging problem. Although current methods based on NeRF have achieved satisfactory performance, they still can not reach real-time levels. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gar?nered researchers attention due to their outstanding rendering quality and real?time speed. Therefore, a new paradigm has been proposed: defining a canonical 3D gaussians and deforming it to individual frames in deformable fields. How?ever, since the coordinates of canonical 3D gaussians are filled with noise, which can transfer noise into the deformable fields, and there is currently no method that adequately considers the aggregation of 4D information. Therefore, we pro?pose Denoised Deformable Network with Temporal-Spatial Aggregation for Dy?namic Scene Rendering (DN-4DGS). Specifically, a Noise Suppression Strategy is introduced to change the distribution of the coordinates of the canonical 3D gaussians and suppress noise. Additionally, a Decoupled Temporal-Spatial Ag?gregation Module is designed to aggregate information from adjacent points and frames. Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality under a real-time level.</p>

<p>Abstract: Smaller vision-language models (VLMs) are becoming increasingly important for privacy-focused, on-device applications due to their ability to run efficiently on consumer hardware for processing enterprise commercial documents and images. These models require strong language understanding and visual capabilities to enhance human-machine interaction. To address this need, we present H2OVL-Mississippi, a pair of small VLMs trained on 37 million image-text pairs using 240 hours of compute on 8 x H100 GPUs. H2OVL-Mississippi-0.8B is a tiny model with 0.8 billion parameters that specializes in text recognition, achieving state of the art performance on the Text Recognition portion of OCRBench and surpassing much larger models in this area. Additionally, we are releasing H2OVL-Mississippi-2B, a 2 billion parameter model for general use cases, exhibiting highly competitive metrics across various academic benchmarks. Both models build upon our prior work with H2O-Danube language models, extending their capabilities into the visual domain. We release them under the Apache 2.0 license, making VLMs accessible to everyone, democratizing document AI and visual LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinjie Zhang, Zhening Liu, Yifan Zhang, Xingtong Ge, Dailan He, Tongda Xu, Yan Wang, Zehong Lin, Shuicheng Yan, Jun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) has recently emerged as a promising technique for capturing complex dynamic 3D scenes with high fidelity. It utilizes a 4D Gaussian representation and a GPU-friendly rasterizer, enabling rapid rendering speeds. Despite its advantages, 4DGS faces significant challenges, notably the requirement of millions of 4D Gaussians, each with extensive associated attributes, leading to substantial memory and storage cost. This paper introduces a memory-efficient framework for 4DGS. We streamline the color attribute by decomposing it into a per-Gaussian direct color component with only 3 parameters and a shared lightweight alternating current color predictor. This approach eliminates the need for spherical harmonics coefficients, which typically involve up to 144 parameters in classic 4DGS, thereby creating a memory-efficient 4D Gaussian representation. Furthermore, we introduce an entropy-constrained Gaussian deformation technique that uses a deformation field to expand the action range of each Gaussian and integrates an opacity-based entropy loss to limit the number of Gaussians, thus forcing our model to use as few Gaussians as possible to fit a dynamic scene well. With simple half-precision storage and zip compression, our framework achieves a storage reduction by approximately 190$\times$ and 125$\times$ on the Technicolor and Neural 3D Video datasets, respectively, compared to the original 4DGS. Meanwhile, it maintains comparable rendering speeds and scene representation quality, setting a new standard in the field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiri Filip, Filip Dechterenko, Filipp Schmidt, Jiri Lukavsky, Veronika Vilimovska, Jan Kotera, Roland W. Fleming</p>
<p>Abstract: The world is abundant with diverse materials, each possessing unique surface appearances that play a crucial role in our daily perception and understanding of their properties. Despite advancements in technology enabling the capture and realistic reproduction of material appearances for visualization and quality control, the interoperability of material property information across various measurement representations and software platforms remains a complex challenge. A key to overcoming this challenge lies in the automatic identification of materials' perceptual features, enabling intuitive differentiation of properties stored in disparate material data representations. We reasoned that for many practical purposes, a compact representation of the perceptual appearance is more useful than an exhaustive physical description.This paper introduces a novel approach to material identification by encoding perceptual features obtained from dynamic visual stimuli. We conducted a psychophysical experiment to select and validate 16 particularly significant perceptual attributes obtained from videos of 347 materials. We then gathered attribute ratings from over twenty participants for each material, creating a 'material fingerprint' that encodes the unique perceptual properties of each material. Finally, we trained a multi-layer perceptron model to predict the relationship between statistical and deep learning image features and their corresponding perceptual properties. We demonstrate the model's performance in material retrieval and filtering according to individual attributes. This model represents a significant step towards simplifying the sharing and understanding of material properties in diverse digital environments regardless of their digital representation, enhancing both the accuracy and efficiency of material identification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiming Shi, Jiwei Wei, Yujia Wu, Ran Ran, Chengwei Sun, Shiyuan He, Yang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid growth of model scale has necessitated substantial computational resources for fine-tuning. Existing approach such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has sought to address the problem of handling the large updated parameters in full fine-tuning. However, LoRA utilize random initialization and optimization of low-rank matrices to approximate updated weights, which can result in suboptimal convergence and an accuracy gap compared to full fine-tuning. To address these issues, we propose LoLDU, a Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) approach that significantly reduces trainable parameters by 2600 times compared to regular PEFT methods while maintaining comparable performance. LoLDU leverages Lower-Diag-Upper Decomposition (LDU) to initialize low-rank matrices for faster convergence and orthogonality. We focus on optimizing the diagonal matrix for scaling transformations. To the best of our knowledge, LoLDU has the fewest parameters among all PEFT approaches. We conducted extensive experiments across 4 instruction-following datasets, 6 natural language understanding (NLU) datasets, 8 image classification datasets, and image generation datasets with multiple model types (LLaMA2, RoBERTa, ViT, and Stable Diffusion), providing a comprehensive and detailed analysis.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joonhyeon Song, Seohwan Yun, Seongho Yoon, Joohyeok Kim, Sangmin Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: This work proposes a novel approach beyond supervised learning for effective pathological image analysis, addressing the challenge of limited robust labeled data. Pathological diagnosis of diseases like cancer has conventionally relied on the evaluation of morphological features by physicians and pathologists. However, recent advancements in compute-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems are gaining significant attention as diagnostic support tools. Although the advancement of deep learning has improved CAD significantly, segmentation models typically require large pixel-level annotated dataset, and such labeling is expensive. Existing studies not based on supervised approaches still struggle with limited generalization, and no practical approach has emerged yet. To address this issue, we present a weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) model by combining class activation map and Segment Anything Model (SAM)-based pseudo-labeling. For effective pretraining, we adopt the SAM-a foundation model that is pretrained on large datasets and operates in zero-shot configurations using only coarse prompts. The proposed approach transfer enhanced Attention Dropout Layer's knowledge to SAM, thereby generating pseudo-labels. To demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, experimental studies are conducted on histopathological breast cancer datasets. The proposed method outperformed other WSSS methods across three datasets, demonstrating its efficiency by achieving this with only 12GB of GPU memory during training.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Renato Augusto Tavares</p>
<p>Abstract: The growing use of Artificial Intelligence solutions has led to an explosion in image capture and its application in machine learning models. However, the lack of standardization in image quality generates inconsistencies in the results of these models. To mitigate this problem, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is often used as a preprocessing technique, but it still faces challenges in scenarios with inadequate lighting, low resolution, and perspective distortions.
  This work aims to explore and evaluate various preprocessing techniques, such as grayscale conversion, CLAHE in RGB, and Bilateral Filter, applied to vehicle license plate recognition. Each technique is analyzed individually and in combination, using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC curve, AUC, and ANOVA, to identify the most effective method. The study uses a dataset of Brazilian vehicle license plates, widely used in OCR applications. The research provides a detailed analysis of best preprocessing practices, offering insights to optimize OCR performance in real-world scenarios.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13651">Help Me Identify: Is an LLM+VQA System All We Need to Identify Visual Concepts?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shailaja Keyur Sampat, Maitreya Patel, Yezhou Yang, Chitta Baral</p>
<p>Abstract: An ability to learn about new objects from a small amount of visual data and produce convincing linguistic justification about the presence/absence of certain concepts (that collectively compose the object) in novel scenarios is an important characteristic of human cognition. This is possible due to abstraction of attributes/properties that an object is composed of e.g. an object `bird' can be identified by the presence of a beak, feathers, legs, wings, etc. Inspired by this aspect of human reasoning, in this work, we present a zero-shot framework for fine-grained visual concept learning by leveraging large language model and Visual Question Answering (VQA) system. Specifically, we prompt GPT-3 to obtain a rich linguistic description of visual objects in the dataset. We convert the obtained concept descriptions into a set of binary questions. We pose these questions along with the query image to a VQA system and aggregate the answers to determine the presence or absence of an object in the test images. Our experiments demonstrate comparable performance with existing zero-shot visual classification methods and few-shot concept learning approaches, without substantial computational overhead, yet being fully explainable from the reasoning perspective.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shailaja Keyur Sampat, Yezhou Yang, Chitta Baral</p>
<p>Abstract: Humans observe various actions being performed by other humans (physically or in videos/images) and can draw a wide range of inferences about it beyond what they can visually perceive. Such inferences include determining the aspects of the world that make action execution possible (e.g. liquid objects can undergo pouring), predicting how the world will change as a result of the action (e.g. potatoes being golden and crispy after frying), high-level goals associated with the action (e.g. beat the eggs to make an omelet) and reasoning about actions that possibly precede or follow the current action (e.g. crack eggs before whisking or draining pasta after boiling). Similar reasoning ability is highly desirable in autonomous systems that would assist us in performing everyday tasks. To that end, we propose a multi-modal task to learn aforementioned concepts about actions being performed in images. We develop a dataset consisting of 8.5k images and 59.3k inferences about actions grounded in those images, collected from an annotated cooking-video dataset. We propose ActionCOMET, a zero-shot framework to discern knowledge present in language models specific to the provided visual input. We present baseline results of ActionCOMET over the collected dataset and compare them with the performance of the best existing VQA approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: The integration of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with artificial intelligence (AI) models for aerial imagery processing in disaster assessment, necessitates models that demonstrate exceptional accuracy, computational efficiency, and real-time processing capabilities. Traditionally Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), demonstrate efficiency in local feature extraction but are limited by their potential for global context interpretation. On the other hand, Vision Transformers (ViTs) show promise for improved global context interpretation through the use of attention mechanisms, although they still remain underinvestigated in UAV-based disaster response applications. Bridging this research gap, we introduce DiRecNetV2, an improved hybrid model that utilizes convolutional and transformer layers. It merges the inductive biases of CNNs for robust feature extraction with the global context understanding of Transformers, maintaining a low computational load ideal for UAV applications. Additionally, we introduce a new, compact multi-label dataset of disasters, to set an initial benchmark for future research, exploring how models trained on single-label data perform in a multi-label test set. The study assesses lightweight CNNs and ViTs on the AIDERSv2 dataset, based on the frames per second (FPS) for efficiency and the weighted F1 scores for classification performance. DiRecNetV2 not only achieves a weighted F1 score of 0.964 on a single-label test set but also demonstrates adaptability, with a score of 0.614 on a complex multi-label test set, while functioning at 176.13 FPS on the Nvidia Orin Jetson device.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deriving inference from heterogeneous inputs (such as images, text, and audio) is an important skill for humans to perform day-to-day tasks. A similar ability is desirable for the development of advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. While state-of-the-art models are rapidly closing the gap with human-level performance on diverse computer vision and NLP tasks separately, they struggle to solve tasks that require joint reasoning over visual and textual modalities. Inspired by GLUE (Wang et. al., 2018)- a multitask benchmark for natural language understanding, we propose VL-GLUE in this paper. VL-GLUE consists of over 100k samples spanned across seven different tasks, which at their core require visuo-linguistic reasoning. Moreover, our benchmark comprises of diverse image types (from synthetically rendered figures, and day-to-day scenes to charts and complex diagrams) and includes a broad variety of domain-specific text (from cooking, politics, and sports to high-school curricula), demonstrating the need for multi-modal understanding in the real-world. We show that this benchmark is quite challenging for existing large-scale vision-language models and encourage development of systems that possess robust visuo-linguistic reasoning capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yijun Liang, Shweta Bhardwaj, Tianyi Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-quality or scarce data has posed significant challenges for training deep neural networks in practice. While classical data augmentation cannot contribute very different new data, diffusion models opens up a new door to build self-evolving AI by generating high-quality and diverse synthetic data through text-guided prompts. However, text-only guidance cannot control synthetic images' proximity to the original images, resulting in out-of-distribution data detrimental to the model performance. To overcome the limitation, we study image guidance to achieve a spectrum of interpolations between synthetic and real images. With stronger image guidance, the generated images are similar to the training data but hard to learn. While with weaker image guidance, the synthetic images will be easier for model but contribute to a larger distribution gap with the original data. The generated full spectrum of data enables us to build a novel "Diffusion Curriculum (DisCL)". DisCL adjusts the image guidance level of image synthesis for each training stage: It identifies and focuses on hard samples for the model and assesses the most effective guidance level of synthetic images to improve hard data learning. We apply DisCL to two challenging tasks: long-tail (LT) classification and learning from low-quality data. It focuses on lower-guidance images of high-quality to learn prototypical features as a warm-up of learning higher-guidance images that might be weak on diversity or quality. Extensive experiments showcase a gain of 2.7% and 2.1% in OOD and ID macro-accuracy when applying DisCL to iWildCam dataset. On ImageNet-LT, DisCL improves the base model's tail-class accuracy from 4.4% to 23.64% and leads to a 4.02% improvement in all-class accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Assessing the quality of bovine satellite cells (BSCs) is essential for the cultivated meat industry, which aims to address global food sustainability challenges. This study aims to develop a label-free method for predicting fluorescence markers in isolated BSCs using deep learning. We employed a U-Net-based CNN model to predict multiple fluorescence signals from a single bright-field microscopy image of cell culture. Two key biomarkers, DAPI and Pax7, were used to determine the abundance and quality of BSCs. The image pre-processing pipeline included fluorescence denoising to improve prediction performance and consistency. A total of 48 biological replicates were used, with statistical performance metrics such as Pearson correlation coefficient and SSIM employed for model evaluation. The model exhibited better performance with DAPI predictions due to uniform staining. Pax7 predictions were more variable, reflecting biological heterogeneity. Enhanced visualization techniques, including color mapping and image overlay, improved the interpretability of the predictions by providing better contextual and perceptual information. The findings highlight the importance of data pre-processing and demonstrate the potential of deep learning to advance non-invasive, label-free assessment techniques in the cultivated meat industry, paving the way for reliable and actionable AI-driven evaluations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Video Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capability of understanding the video semantics on various downstream tasks. Despite the advancements, there is still a lack of systematic research on visual context representation, which refers to the scheme to select frames from a video and further select the tokens from a frame. In this paper, we explore the design space for visual context representation, and aim to improve the performance of video MLLMs by finding more effective representation schemes. Firstly, we formulate the task of visual context representation as a constrained optimization problem, and model the language modeling loss as a function of the number of frames and the number of embeddings (or tokens) per frame, given the maximum visual context window size. Then, we explore the scaling effects in frame selection and token selection respectively, and fit the corresponding function curve by conducting extensive empirical experiments.

<p>Abstract: We present Movie Gen, a cast of foundation models that generates high-quality, 1080p HD videos with different aspect ratios and synchronized audio. We also show additional capabilities such as precise instruction-based video editing and generation of personalized videos based on a user's image. Our models set a new state-of-the-art on multiple tasks: text-to-video synthesis, video personalization, video editing, video-to-audio generation, and text-to-audio generation. Our largest video generation model is a 30B parameter transformer trained with a maximum context length of 73K video tokens, corresponding to a generated video of 16 seconds at 16 frames-per-second. We show multiple technical innovations and simplifications on the architecture, latent spaces, training objectives and recipes, data curation, evaluation protocols, parallelization techniques, and inference optimizations that allow us to reap the benefits of scaling pre-training data, model size, and training compute for training large scale media generation models. We hope this paper helps the research community to accelerate progress and innovation in media generation models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanbo Cheng, Limin Lin, Chenyu Liu, Pengcheng Xia, Pengfei Hu, Jiefeng Ma, Jun Du, Jia Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: Talking head generation intends to produce vivid and realistic talking head videos from a single portrait and speech audio clip. Although significant progress has been made in diffusion-based talking head generation, almost all methods rely on autoregressive strategies, which suffer from limited context utilization beyond the current generation step, error accumulation, and slower generation speed. To address these challenges, we present DAWN (Dynamic frame Avatar With Non-autoregressive diffusion), a framework that enables all-at-once generation of dynamic-length video sequences. Specifically, it consists of two main components: (1) audio-driven holistic facial dynamics generation in the latent motion space, and (2) audio-driven head pose and blink generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method generates authentic and vivid videos with precise lip motions, and natural pose/blink movements. Additionally, with a high generation speed, DAWN possesses strong extrapolation capabilities, ensuring the stable production of high-quality long videos. These results highlight the considerable promise and potential impact of DAWN in the field of talking head video generation. Furthermore, we hope that DAWN sparks further exploration of non-autoregressive approaches in diffusion models. Our code will be publicly at https://github.com/Hanbo-Cheng/DAWN-pytorch.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanpeng Sun, Huaxin Zhang, Qiang Chen, Xinyu Zhang, Nong Sang, Gang Zhang, Jingdong Wang, Zechao Li</p>
<p>Abstract: We focus on improving the visual understanding capability for boosting the vision-language models. We propose \textbf{Arcana}, a multiModal language model, which introduces two crucial techniques. First, we present Multimodal LoRA (MM-LoRA), a module designed to enhance the decoder. Unlike traditional language-driven decoders, MM-LoRA consists of two parallel LoRAs -- one for vision and one for language -- each with its own parameters. This disentangled parameters design allows for more specialized learning in each modality and better integration of multimodal information. Second, we introduce the Query Ladder adapter (QLadder) to improve the visual encoder. QLadder employs a learnable ``\textit{ladder}'' structure to deeply aggregates the intermediate representations from the frozen pretrained visual encoder (e.g., CLIP image encoder). This enables the model to learn new and informative visual features, as well as remaining the powerful capabilities of the pretrained visual encoder. These techniques collectively enhance Arcana's visual perception power, enabling it to leverage improved visual information for more accurate and contextually relevant outputs across various multimodal scenarios. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization capability of our Arcana. The code and re-annotated data are available at \url{https://arcana-project-page.github.io}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fengqi Liu, Hexiang Wang, Jingyu Gong, Ran Yi, Qianyu Zhou, Xuequan Lu, Jiangbo Lu, Lizhuang Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Speech-driven gesture generation aims at synthesizing a gesture sequence synchronized with the input speech signal. Previous methods leverage neural networks to directly map a compact audio representation to the gesture sequence, ignoring the semantic association of different modalities and failing to deal with salient gestures. In this paper, we propose a novel speech-driven gesture generation method by emphasizing the semantic consistency of salient posture. Specifically, we first learn a joint manifold space for the individual representation of audio and body pose to exploit the inherent semantic association between two modalities, and propose to enforce semantic consistency via a consistency loss. Furthermore, we emphasize the semantic consistency of salient postures by introducing a weakly-supervised detector to identify salient postures, and reweighting the consistency loss to focus more on learning the correspondence between salient postures and the high-level semantics of speech content. In addition, we propose to extract audio features dedicated to facial expression and body gesture separately, and design separate branches for face and body gesture synthesis. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liang Xu, Shaoyang Hua, Zili Lin, Yifan Liu, Feipeng Ma, Yichao Yan, Xin Jin, Xiaokang Yang, Wenjun Zeng</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the problem of how to build and benchmark a large motion model (LMM). The ultimate goal of LMM is to serve as a foundation model for versatile motion-related tasks, e.g., human motion generation, with interpretability and generalizability. Though advanced, recent LMM-related works are still limited by small-scale motion data and costly text descriptions. Besides, previous motion benchmarks primarily focus on pure body movements, neglecting the ubiquitous motions in context, i.e., humans interacting with humans, objects, and scenes. To address these limitations, we consolidate large-scale video action datasets as knowledge banks to build MotionBank, which comprises 13 video action datasets, 1.24M motion sequences, and 132.9M frames of natural and diverse human motions. Different from laboratory-captured motions, in-the-wild human-centric videos contain abundant motions in context. To facilitate better motion text alignment, we also meticulously devise a motion caption generation algorithm to automatically produce rule-based, unbiased, and disentangled text descriptions via the kinematic characteristics for each motion. Extensive experiments show that our MotionBank is beneficial for general motion-related tasks of human motion generation, motion in-context generation, and motion understanding. Video motions together with the rule-based text annotations could serve as an efficient alternative for larger LMMs. Our dataset, codes, and benchmark will be publicly available at https://github.com/liangxuy/MotionBank.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junhao Gu, Peng-Tao Jiang, Hao Zhang, Mi Zhou, Jinwei Chen, Wenming Yang, Bo Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) aims at restoring high-quality (HQ) images from low-quality (LQ) inputs corrupted by unknown and complex degradations. In particular, pretrained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models provide strong generative priors to reconstruct credible and intricate details. However, T2I generation focuses on semantic consistency while Real-ISR emphasizes pixel-level reconstruction, which hinders existing methods from fully exploiting diffusion priors. To address this challenge, we introduce ConsisSR to handle both semantic and pixel-level consistency. Specifically, compared to coarse-grained text prompts, we exploit the more powerful CLIP image embedding and effectively leverage both modalities through our Hybrid Prompt Adapter (HPA) for semantic guidance. Secondly, we introduce Time-aware Latent Augmentation (TALA) to mitigate the inherent gap between T2I generation and Real-ISR consistency requirements. By randomly mixing LQ and HQ latent inputs, our model not only handle timestep-specific diffusion noise but also refine the accumulated latent representations. Last but not least, our GAN-Embedding strategy employs the pretrained Real-ESRGAN model to refine the diffusion start point. This accelerates the inference process to 10 steps while preserving sampling quality, in a training-free manner.Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance among both full-scale and accelerated models. The code will be made publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cl\'ement Playout, Renaud Duval, Marie Carole Boucher, Farida Cheriet</p>
<p>Abstract: The diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy, which relies on fundus images, faces challenges in achieving transparency and interpretability when using a global classification approach. However, segmentation-based databases are significantly more expensive to acquire and combining them is often problematic. This paper introduces a novel method, termed adversarial style conversion, to address the lack of standardization in annotation styles across diverse databases. By training a single architecture on combined databases, the model spontaneously modifies its segmentation style depending on the input, demonstrating the ability to convert among different labeling styles. The proposed methodology adds a linear probe to detect dataset origin based on encoder features and employs adversarial attacks to condition the model's segmentation style. Results indicate significant qualitative and quantitative through dataset combination, offering avenues for improved model generalization, uncertainty estimation and continuous interpolation between annotation styles. Our approach enables training a segmentation model with diverse databases while controlling and leveraging annotation styles for improved retinopathy diagnosis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaodan Xing, Junzhi Ning, Yang Nan, Guang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep generative models have significantly advanced medical imaging analysis by enhancing dataset size and quality. Beyond mere data augmentation, our research in this paper highlights an additional, significant capacity of deep generative models: their ability to reveal and demonstrate patterns in medical images. We employ a generative structure with hybrid conditions, combining clinical data and segmentation masks to guide the image synthesis process. Furthermore, we innovatively transformed the tabular clinical data into textual descriptions. This approach simplifies the handling of missing values and also enables us to leverage large pre-trained vision-language models that investigate the relations between independent clinical entries and comprehend general terms, such as gender and smoking status. Our approach differs from and presents a more challenging task than traditional medical report-guided synthesis due to the less visual correlation of our clinical information with the images. To overcome this, we introduce a text-visual embedding mechanism that strengthens the conditions, ensuring the network effectively utilizes the provided information. Our pipeline is generalizable to both GAN-based and diffusion models. Experiments on chest CT, particularly focusing on the smoking status, demonstrated a consistent intensity shift in the lungs which is in agreement with clinical observations, indicating the effectiveness of our method in capturing and visualizing the impact of specific attributes on medical image patterns. Our methods offer a new avenue for the early detection and precise visualization of complex clinical conditions with deep generative models. All codes are https://github.com/junzhin/DGM-VLC.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junpeng Liu, Tianyue Ou, Yifan Song, Yuxiao Qu, Wai Lam, Chenyan Xiong, Wenhu Chen, Graham Neubig, Xiang Yue</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-rich visual understanding-the ability to process environments where dense textual content is integrated with visuals-is crucial for multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to interact effectively with structured environments. To enhance this capability, we propose synthesizing general multimodal instructions from webpage UIs using text-based large language models (LLMs). Despite lacking direct visual input, text-based LLMs are able to process structured text representations from webpage accessibility trees. These instructions are then paired with UI screenshots to train multimodal models. We introduce MultiUI, a dataset containing 7.3 million samples from 1 million websites, covering diverse multimodal tasks and UI layouts. Models trained on MultiUI not only excel in web UI tasks-achieving up to a 48\% improvement on VisualWebBench and a 19.1\% boost in action accuracy on a web agent dataset Mind2Web-but also generalize surprisingly well to non-web UI tasks and even to non-UI domains, such as document understanding, OCR, and chart interpretation. These results highlight the broad applicability of web UI data for advancing text-rich visual understanding across various scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yujie Wei, Shiwei Zhang, Hangjie Yuan, Xiang Wang, Haonan Qiu, Rui Zhao, Yutong Feng, Feng Liu, Zhizhong Huang, Jiaxin Ye, Yingya Zhang, Hongming Shan</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in customized video generation have enabled users to create videos tailored to both specific subjects and motion trajectories. However, existing methods often require complicated test-time fine-tuning and struggle with balancing subject learning and motion control, limiting their real-world applications. In this paper, we present DreamVideo-2, a zero-shot video customization framework capable of generating videos with a specific subject and motion trajectory, guided by a single image and a bounding box sequence, respectively, and without the need for test-time fine-tuning. Specifically, we introduce reference attention, which leverages the model's inherent capabilities for subject learning, and devise a mask-guided motion module to achieve precise motion control by fully utilizing the robust motion signal of box masks derived from bounding boxes. While these two components achieve their intended functions, we empirically observe that motion control tends to dominate over subject learning. To address this, we propose two key designs: 1) the masked reference attention, which integrates a blended latent mask modeling scheme into reference attention to enhance subject representations at the desired positions, and 2) a reweighted diffusion loss, which differentiates the contributions of regions inside and outside the bounding boxes to ensure a balance between subject and motion control. Extensive experimental results on a newly curated dataset demonstrate that DreamVideo-2 outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both subject customization and motion control. The dataset, code, and models will be made publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingwei Ma, Erika Lu, Roni Paiss, Shiran Zada, Aleksander Holynski, Tali Dekel, Brian Curless, Michael Rubinstein, Forrester Cole</p>
<p>Abstract: Panoramic image stitching provides a unified, wide-angle view of a scene that extends beyond the camera's field of view. Stitching frames of a panning video into a panoramic photograph is a well-understood problem for stationary scenes, but when objects are moving, a still panorama cannot capture the scene. We present a method for synthesizing a panoramic video from a casually-captured panning video, as if the original video were captured with a wide-angle camera. We pose panorama synthesis as a space-time outpainting problem, where we aim to create a full panoramic video of the same length as the input video. Consistent completion of the space-time volume requires a powerful, realistic prior over video content and motion, for which we adapt generative video models. Existing generative models do not, however, immediately extend to panorama completion, as we show. We instead apply video generation as a component of our panorama synthesis system, and demonstrate how to exploit the strengths of the models while minimizing their limitations. Our system can create video panoramas for a range of in-the-wild scenes including people, vehicles, and flowing water, as well as stationary background features.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yansong Peng, Hebei Li, Peixi Wu, Yueyi Zhang, Xiaoyan Sun, Feng Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce D-FINE, a powerful real-time object detector that achieves outstanding localization precision by redefining the bounding box regression task in DETR models. D-FINE comprises two key components: Fine-grained Distribution Refinement (FDR) and Global Optimal Localization Self-Distillation (GO-LSD). FDR transforms the regression process from predicting fixed coordinates to iteratively refining probability distributions, providing a fine-grained intermediate representation that significantly enhances localization accuracy. GO-LSD is a bidirectional optimization strategy that transfers localization knowledge from refined distributions to shallower layers through self-distillation, while also simplifying the residual prediction tasks for deeper layers. Additionally, D-FINE incorporates lightweight optimizations in computationally intensive modules and operations, achieving a better balance between speed and accuracy. Specifically, D-FINE-L / X achieves 54.0% / 55.8% AP on the COCO dataset at 124 / 78 FPS on an NVIDIA T4 GPU. When pretrained on Objects365, D-FINE-L / X attains 57.1% / 59.3% AP, surpassing all existing real-time detectors. Furthermore, our method significantly enhances the performance of a wide range of DETR models by up to 5.3% AP with negligible extra parameters and training costs.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengyue Wu, Xiaokang Chen, Zhiyu Wu, Yiyang Ma, Xingchao Liu, Zizheng Pan, Wen Liu, Zhenda Xie, Xingkai Yu, Chong Ruan, Ping Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Janus, an autoregressive framework that unifies multimodal understanding and generation. Prior research often relies on a single visual encoder for both tasks, such as Chameleon. However, due to the differing levels of information granularity required by multimodal understanding and generation, this approach can lead to suboptimal performance, particularly in multimodal understanding. To address this issue, we decouple visual encoding into separate pathways, while still leveraging a single, unified transformer architecture for processing. The decoupling not only alleviates the conflict between the visual encoder's roles in understanding and generation, but also enhances the framework's flexibility. For instance, both the multimodal understanding and generation components can independently select their most suitable encoding methods. Experiments show that Janus surpasses previous unified model and matches or exceeds the performance of task-specific models. The simplicity, high flexibility, and effectiveness of Janus make it a strong candidate for next-generation unified multimodal models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaxin Luo, Gen Luo, Jiayi Ji, Yiyi Zhou, Xiaoshuai Sun, Zhiqiang Shen, Rongrong Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the significant progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), their high computational cost remains a barrier to real-world deployment. Inspired by the mixture of depths (MoDs) in natural language processing, we aim to address this limitation from the perspective of ``activated tokens''. Our key insight is that if most tokens are redundant for the layer computation, then can be skipped directly via the MoD layer. However, directly converting the dense layers of MLLMs to MoD layers leads to substantial performance degradation. To address this issue, we propose an innovative MoD adaptation strategy for existing MLLMs called $\gamma$-MoD. In $\gamma$-MoD, a novel metric is proposed to guide the deployment of MoDs in the MLLM, namely rank of attention maps (ARank). Through ARank, we can effectively identify which layer is redundant and should be replaced with the MoD layer. Based on ARank, we further propose two novel designs to maximize the computational sparsity of MLLM while maintaining its performance, namely shared vision-language router and masked routing learning. With these designs, more than 90% dense layers of the MLLM can be effectively converted to the MoD ones. To validate our method, we apply it to three popular MLLMs, and conduct extensive experiments on 9 benchmark datasets. Experimental results not only validate the significant efficiency benefit of $\gamma$-MoD to existing MLLMs but also confirm its generalization ability on various MLLMs. For example, with a minor performance drop, i.e., -1.5%, $\gamma$-MoD can reduce the training and inference time of LLaVA-HR by 31.0% and 53.2%, respectively.</p>

<p>Abstract: 3D visual grounding is crucial for robots, requiring integration of natural language and 3D scene understanding. Traditional methods depending on supervised learning with 3D point clouds are limited by scarce datasets. Recently zero-shot methods leveraging LLMs have been proposed to address the data issue. While effective, these methods only use object-centric information, limiting their ability to handle complex queries. In this work, we present VLM-Grounder, a novel framework using vision-language models (VLMs) for zero-shot 3D visual grounding based solely on 2D images. VLM-Grounder dynamically stitches image sequences, employs a grounding and feedback scheme to find the target object, and uses a multi-view ensemble projection to accurately estimate 3D bounding boxes. Experiments on ScanRefer and Nr3D datasets show VLM-Grounder outperforms previous zero-shot methods, achieving 51.6% Acc@0.25 on ScanRefer and 48.0% Acc on Nr3D, without relying on 3D geometry or object priors.

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal foundation models have yielded significant progress in vision-language understanding. Initial attempts have also explored the potential of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for visual content generation. However, existing works have insufficiently addressed the varying granularity demands of different image generation tasks within a unified MLLM paradigm - from the diversity required in text-to-image generation to the precise controllability needed in image manipulation. In this work, we propose PUMA, emPowering Unified MLLM with Multi-grAnular visual generation. PUMA unifies multi-granular visual features as both inputs and outputs of MLLMs, elegantly addressing the different granularity requirements of various image generation tasks within a unified MLLM framework. Following multimodal pretraining and task-specific instruction tuning, PUMA demonstrates proficiency in a wide range of multimodal tasks. This work represents a significant step towards a truly unified MLLM capable of adapting to the granularity demands of various visual tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haofei Xu, Songyou Peng, Fangjinhua Wang, Hermann Blum, Daniel Barath, Andreas Geiger, Marc Pollefeys</p>
<p>Abstract: Gaussian splatting and single/multi-view depth estimation are typically studied in isolation. In this paper, we present DepthSplat to connect Gaussian splatting and depth estimation and study their interactions. More specifically, we first contribute a robust multi-view depth model by leveraging pre-trained monocular depth features, leading to high-quality feed-forward 3D Gaussian splatting reconstructions. We also show that Gaussian splatting can serve as an unsupervised pre-training objective for learning powerful depth models from large-scale unlabelled datasets. We validate the synergy between Gaussian splatting and depth estimation through extensive ablation and cross-task transfer experiments. Our DepthSplat achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet, RealEstate10K and DL3DV datasets in terms of both depth estimation and novel view synthesis, demonstrating the mutual benefits of connecting both tasks. Our code, models, and video results are available at https://haofeixu.github.io/depthsplat/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lijie Fan, Tianhong Li, Siyang Qin, Yuanzhen Li, Chen Sun, Michael Rubinstein, Deqing Sun, Kaiming He, Yonglong Tian</p>
<p>Abstract: Scaling up autoregressive models in vision has not proven as beneficial as in large language models. In this work, we investigate this scaling problem in the context of text-to-image generation, focusing on two critical factors: whether models use discrete or continuous tokens, and whether tokens are generated in a random or fixed raster order using BERT- or GPT-like transformer architectures. Our empirical results show that, while all models scale effectively in terms of validation loss, their evaluation performance -- measured by FID, GenEval score, and visual quality -- follows different trends. Models based on continuous tokens achieve significantly better visual quality than those using discrete tokens. Furthermore, the generation order and attention mechanisms significantly affect the GenEval score: random-order models achieve notably better GenEval scores compared to raster-order models. Inspired by these findings, we train Fluid, a random-order autoregressive model on continuous tokens. Fluid 10.5B model achieves a new state-of-the-art zero-shot FID of 6.16 on MS-COCO 30K, and 0.69 overall score on the GenEval benchmark. We hope our findings and results will encourage future efforts to further bridge the scaling gap between vision and language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ye Li, Wenzhao Zheng, Xiaonan Huang, Kurt Keutzer</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-centric autonomous driving has demonstrated excellent performance with economical sensors. As the fundamental step, 3D perception aims to infer 3D information from 2D images based on 3D-2D projection. This makes driving perception models susceptible to sensor configuration (e.g., camera intrinsics and extrinsics) variations. However, generalizing across camera configurations is important for deploying autonomous driving models on different car models. In this paper, we present UniDrive, a novel framework for vision-centric autonomous driving to achieve universal perception across camera configurations. We deploy a set of unified virtual cameras and propose a ground-aware projection method to effectively transform the original images into these unified virtual views. We further propose a virtual configuration optimization method by minimizing the expected projection error between original cameras and virtual cameras. The proposed virtual camera projection can be applied to existing 3D perception methods as a plug-and-play module to mitigate the challenges posed by camera parameter variability, resulting in more adaptable and reliable driving perception models. To evaluate the effectiveness of our framework, we collect a dataset on Carla by driving the same routes while only modifying the camera configurations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method trained on one specific camera configuration can generalize to varying configurations with minor performance degradation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengxue Qu, Xiaodong Chen, Wu Liu, Alicia Li, Yao Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to ground specific segments within an untrimmed video corresponding to the given natural language query. Existing VTG methods largely depend on supervised learning and extensive annotated data, which is labor-intensive and prone to human biases. To address these challenges, we present ChatVTG, a novel approach that utilizes Video Dialogue Large Language Models (LLMs) for zero-shot video temporal grounding. Our ChatVTG leverages Video Dialogue LLMs to generate multi-granularity segment captions and matches these captions with the given query for coarse temporal grounding, circumventing the need for paired annotation data. Furthermore, to obtain more precise temporal grounding results, we employ moment refinement for fine-grained caption proposals. Extensive experiments on three mainstream VTG datasets, including Charades-STA, ActivityNet-Captions, and TACoS, demonstrate the effectiveness of ChatVTG. Our ChatVTG surpasses the performance of current zero-shot methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yooseung Shin, Kwanseok Oh, Heung-Il Suk</p>
<p>Abstract: Advances in deep learning (DL)-based models for brain image analysis have significantly enhanced the accuracy of Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis, allowing for more timely interventions. Despite these advancements, most current DL models suffer from performance degradation when inferring on unseen domain data owing to the variations in data distributions, a phenomenon known as domain shift. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach called the dynamic frequency mixup scheduler (DyMix) for unsupervised domain adaptation. Contrary to the conventional mixup technique, which involves simple linear interpolations between predefined data points from the frequency space, our proposed DyMix dynamically adjusts the magnitude of the frequency regions being mixed from the source and target domains. Such an adaptive strategy optimizes the model's capacity to deal with domain variability, thereby enhancing its generalizability across the target domain. In addition, we incorporate additional strategies to further enforce the model's robustness against domain shifts, including leveraging amplitude-phase recombination to ensure resilience to intensity variations and applying self-adversarial learning to derive domain-invariant feature representations. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets quantitatively and qualitatively validated the effectiveness of our DyMix in that we demonstrated its outstanding performance in AD diagnosis compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Longchao Da, Rui Wang, Xiaojian Xu, Parminder Bhatia, Taha Kass-Hout, Hua Wei, Cao Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical imaging is crucial for diagnosing a patient's health condition, and accurate segmentation of these images is essential for isolating regions of interest to ensure precise diagnosis and treatment planning. Existing methods primarily rely on bounding boxes or point-based prompts, while few have explored text-related prompts, despite clinicians often describing their observations and instructions in natural language. To address this gap, we first propose a RAG-based free-form text prompt generator, that leverages the domain corpus to generate diverse and realistic descriptions. Then, we introduce FLanS, a novel medical image segmentation model that handles various free-form text prompts, including professional anatomy-informed queries, anatomy-agnostic position-driven queries, and anatomy-agnostic size-driven queries. Additionally, our model also incorporates a symmetry-aware canonicalization module to ensure consistent, accurate segmentations across varying scan orientations and reduce confusion between the anatomical position of an organ and its appearance in the scan. FLanS is trained on a large-scale dataset of over 100k medical images from 7 public datasets. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the model's superior language understanding and segmentation precision, along with a deep comprehension of the relationship between them, outperforming SOTA baselines on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyam Omar Ali, Romain Abraham, Guillaume Desoubeaux, Ahmed Fahal, Clovis Tauber</p>
<p>Abstract: Mycetoma is a chronic and neglected inflammatory disease prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions. It can lead to severe disability and social stigma. The disease is classified into two types based on the causative microorganisms: eumycetoma (fungal) and actinomycetoma (bacterial). Effective treatment strategies depend on accurately identifying the causative agents. Current identification methods include molecular, cytological, and histopathological techniques, as well as grain culturing. Among these, histopathological techniques are considered optimal for use in endemic areas, but they require expert pathologists for accurate identification, which can be challenging in rural areas lacking such expertise. The advent of digital pathology and automated image analysis algorithms offers a potential solution. This report introduces a novel dataset designed for the automated detection and classification of mycetoma using histopathological images. It includes the first database of microscopic images of mycetoma tissue, detailing the entire pipeline from species distribution and patient sampling to acquisition protocols through histological procedures. The dataset consists of images from 142 patients, totalling 864 images, each annotated with binary masks indicating the presence of grains, facilitating both detection and segmentation tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaizhi Zheng, Xiaotong Chen, Xuehai He, Jing Gu, Linjie Li, Zhengyuan Yang, Kevin Lin, Jianfeng Wang, Lijuan Wang, Xin Eric Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Given the steep learning curve of professional 3D software and the time-consuming process of managing large 3D assets, language-guided 3D scene editing has significant potential in fields such as virtual reality, augmented reality, and gaming. However, recent approaches to language-guided 3D scene editing either require manual interventions or focus only on appearance modifications without supporting comprehensive scene layout changes. In response, we propose Edit-Room, a unified framework capable of executing a variety of layout edits through natural language commands, without requiring manual intervention. Specifically, EditRoom leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for command planning and generates target scenes using a diffusion-based method, enabling six types of edits: rotate, translate, scale, replace, add, and remove. To address the lack of data for language-guided 3D scene editing, we have developed an automatic pipeline to augment existing 3D scene synthesis datasets and introduced EditRoom-DB, a large-scale dataset with 83k editing pairs, for training and evaluation. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms other baselines across all metrics, indicating higher accuracy and coherence in language-guided scene layout editing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adam Roegiest, Radha Chitta</p>
<p>Abstract: Finding answers to legal questions about clauses in contracts is an important form of analysis in many legal workflows (e.g., understanding market trends, due diligence, risk mitigation) but more important is being able to do this at scale. Prior work showed that it is possible to use large language models with simple zero-shot prompts to generate structured answers to questions, which can later be incorporated into legal workflows. Such prompts, while effective on simple and straightforward clauses, fail to perform when the clauses are long and contain information not relevant to the question. In this paper, we propose two-stage prompt chaining to produce structured answers to multiple-choice and multiple-select questions and show that they are more effective than simple prompts on more nuanced legal text. We analyze situations where this technique works well and areas where further refinement is needed, especially when the underlying linguistic variations are more than can be captured by simply specifying possible answers. Finally, we discuss future research that seeks to refine this work by improving stage one results by making them more question-specific.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aayush Agrawal, Aniruddh Sikdar, Rajini Makam, Suresh Sundaram, Suresh Kumar Besai, Mahesh Gopi</p>
<p>Abstract: Underwater mine detection with deep learning suffers from limitations due to the scarcity of real-world data.
  This scarcity leads to overfitting, where models perform well on training data but poorly on unseen data. This paper proposes a Syn2Real (Synthetic to Real) domain generalization approach using diffusion models to address this challenge. We demonstrate that synthetic data generated with noise by DDPM and DDIM models, even if not perfectly realistic, can effectively augment real-world samples for training. The residual noise in the final sampled images improves the model's ability to generalize to real-world data with inherent noise and high variation. The baseline Mask-RCNN model when trained on a combination of synthetic and original training datasets, exhibited approximately a 60% increase in Average Precision (AP) compared to being trained solely on the original training data. This significant improvement highlights the potential of Syn2Real domain generalization for underwater mine detection tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lu Pang, Tao Sun, Weimin Lyu, Haibin Ling, Chao Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, backdoor attack has become an increasing security threat to deep neural networks and drawn the attention of researchers. Backdoor attacks exploit vulnerabilities in third-party pretrained models during the training phase, enabling them to behave normally for clean samples and mispredict for samples with specific triggers. Existing backdoor attacks mainly focus on balanced datasets. However, real-world datasets often follow long-tailed distributions. In this paper, for the first time, we explore backdoor attack on such datasets. Specifically, we first analyze the influence of data imbalance on backdoor attack. Based on our analysis, we propose an effective backdoor attack named Dynamic Data Augmentation Operation (D$^2$AO). We design D$^2$AO selectors to select operations depending jointly on the class, sample type (clean vs. backdoored) and sample features. Meanwhile, we develop a trigger generator to generate sample-specific triggers. Through simultaneous optimization of the backdoored model and trigger generator, guided by dynamic data augmentation operation selectors, we achieve significant advancements. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can achieve the state-of-the-art attack performance while preserving the clean accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruiqi Li, Siqi Zheng, Xize Cheng, Ziang Zhang, Shengpeng Ji, Zhou Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating music that aligns with the visual content of a video has been a challenging task, as it requires a deep understanding of visual semantics and involves generating music whose melody, rhythm, and dynamics harmonize with the visual narratives. This paper presents MuVi, a novel framework that effectively addresses these challenges to enhance the cohesion and immersive experience of audio-visual content. MuVi analyzes video content through a specially designed visual adaptor to extract contextually and temporally relevant features. These features are used to generate music that not only matches the video's mood and theme but also its rhythm and pacing. We also introduce a contrastive music-visual pre-training scheme to ensure synchronization, based on the periodicity nature of music phrases. In addition, we demonstrate that our flow-matching-based music generator has in-context learning ability, allowing us to control the style and genre of the generated music. Experimental results show that MuVi demonstrates superior performance in both audio quality and temporal synchronization. The generated music video samples are available at https://muvi-v2m.github.io.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we address the vision-based autonomous landing problem in complex urban environments using deep neural networks for semantic segmentation and risk assessment. We propose employing the SegFormer, a state-of-the-art visual transformer network, for the semantic segmentation of complex, unstructured urban environments. This approach yields valuable information that can be utilized in smart autonomous landing missions, particularly in emergency landing scenarios resulting from system failures or human errors. The assessment is done in real-time flight, when images of an RGB camera at the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) are segmented with the SegFormer into the most common classes found in urban environments. These classes are then mapped into a level of risk, considering in general, potential material damage, damaging the drone itself and endanger people. The proposed strategy is validated through several case studies, demonstrating the huge potential of semantic segmentation-based strategies to determining the safest landing areas for autonomous emergency landing, which we believe will help unleash the full potential of UAVs on civil applications within urban areas.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents a method for generating large-scale datasets to improve class-agnostic video segmentation across robots with different form factors. Specifically, we consider the question of whether video segmentation models trained on generic segmentation data could be more effective for particular robot platforms if robot embodiment is factored into the data generation process. To answer this question, a pipeline is formulated for using 3D reconstructions (e.g. from HM3DSem) to generate segmented videos that are configurable based on a robot's embodiment (e.g. sensor type, sensor placement, and illumination source). A resulting massive RGB-D video panoptic segmentation dataset (MVPd) is introduced for extensive benchmarking with foundation and video segmentation models, as well as to support embodiment-focused research in video segmentation. Our experimental findings demonstrate that using MVPd for finetuning can lead to performance improvements when transferring foundation models to certain robot embodiments, such as specific camera placements. These experiments also show that using 3D modalities (depth images and camera pose) can lead to improvements in video segmentation accuracy and consistency.

<p>Abstract: Machine learning models are known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, but traditional attacks have mostly focused on single-modalities. With the rise of large multi-modal models (LMMs) like CLIP, which combine vision and language capabilities, new vulnerabilities have emerged. However, prior work in multimodal targeted attacks aim to completely change the model's output to what the adversary wants. In many realistic scenarios, an adversary might seek to make only subtle modifications to the output, so that the changes go unnoticed by downstream models or even by humans. We introduce Hiding-in-Plain-Sight (HiPS) attacks, a novel class of adversarial attacks that subtly modifies model predictions by selectively concealing target object(s), as if the target object was absent from the scene. We propose two HiPS attack variants, HiPS-cls and HiPS-cap, and demonstrate their effectiveness in transferring to downstream image captioning models, such as CLIP-Cap, for targeted object removal from image captions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leonardo Pettini, Carsten Bogler, Christian Doeller, John-Dylan Haynes</p>
<p>Abstract: Natural scenes are of key interest for visual perception. Previous work on natural scenes has frequently focused on collections of discrete images with considerable physical differences from stimulus to stimulus. For many purposes it would, however, be desirable to have sets of natural images that vary smoothly along a continuum (for example in order to measure quantitative properties such as thresholds or precisions). This problem has typically been addressed by morphing a source into a target image. However, this approach yields transitions between images that primarily follow their low-level physical features and that can be semantically unclear or ambiguous. Here, in contrast, we used a different approach (Stable Diffusion XL) to synthesise a custom stimulus set of photorealistic images that are characterized by gradual transitions where each image is a clearly interpretable but unique exemplar from the same category. We developed natural scene stimulus sets from six categories with 18 objects each. For each object we generated 10 graded variants that are ordered along a perceptual continuum. We validated the image set psychophysically in a large sample of participants, ensuring that stimuli for each exemplar have varying levels of perceptual confusability. This image set is of interest for studies on visual perception, attention and short- and long-term memory.</p>

<p>Abstract: Osteochondrodysplasia, affecting 2-3% of newborns globally, is a group of bone and cartilage disorders that often result in head malformations, contributing to childhood morbidity and reduced quality of life. Current research on this disease using mouse models faces challenges since it involves accurately segmenting the developing cartilage in 3D micro-CT images of embryonic mice. Tackling this segmentation task with deep learning (DL) methods is laborious due to the big burden of manual image annotation, expensive due to the high acquisition costs of 3D micro-CT images, and difficult due to embryonic cartilage's complex and rapidly changing shapes. While DL approaches have been proposed to automate cartilage segmentation, most such models have limited accuracy and generalizability, especially across data from different embryonic age groups. To address these limitations, we propose novel DL methods that can be adopted by any DL architectures -- including CNNs, Transformers, or hybrid models -- which effectively leverage age and spatial information to enhance model performance. Specifically, we propose two new mechanisms, one conditioned on discrete age categories and the other on continuous image crop locations, to enable an accurate representation of cartilage shape changes across ages and local shape details throughout the cranial region. Extensive experiments on multi-age cartilage segmentation datasets show significant and consistent performance improvements when integrating our conditional modules into popular DL segmentation architectures. On average, we achieve a 1.7% Dice score increase with minimal computational overhead and a 7.5% improvement on unseen data. These results highlight the potential of our approach for developing robust, universal models capable of handling diverse datasets with limited annotated data, a key challenge in DL-based medical image analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziliang Zhang, Zexin Li, Hyoseung Kim, Cong Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The emergence of standalone XR systems has enhanced user mobility, accommodating both subtle, frequent head motions and substantial, less frequent body motions. However, the pervasively used M2D latency metric, which measures the delay between the most recent motion and its corresponding display update, only accounts for head motions. This oversight can leave users prone to motion sickness if significant body motion is involved. Although existing methods optimize M2D latency through asynchronous task scheduling and reprojection methods, they introduce challenges like resource contention between tasks and outdated pose data. These challenges are further complicated by user motion dynamics and scene changes during runtime. To address these issues, we for the first time introduce the C2D latency metric, which captures the delay caused by body motions, and present BOXR, a framework designed to co-optimize both body and head motion delays within an XR system. BOXR enhances the coordination between M2D and C2D latencies by efficiently scheduling tasks to avoid contentions while maintaining an up-to-date pose in the output frame. Moreover, BOXR incorporates a motion-driven visual inertial odometer to adjust to user motion dynamics and employs scene-dependent foveated rendering to manage changes in the scene effectively. Our evaluations show that BOXR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art solutions in 11 EuRoC MAV datasets across 4 XR applications across 3 hardware platforms. In controlled motion and scene settings, BOXR reduces M2D and C2D latencies by up to 63% and 27%, respectively and increases frame rate by up to 43%. In practical deployments, BOXR achieves substantial reductions in real-world scenarios up to 42% in M2D latency and 31% in C2D latency while maintaining remarkably low miss rates of only 1.6% for M2D requirements and 1.0% for C2D requirements.</p>

<p>Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has demonstrated significant potential in healthcare, particularly in disease diagnosis and treatment planning. Recent progress in Medical Large Vision-Language Models (Med-LVLMs) has opened up new possibilities for interactive diagnostic tools. However, these models often suffer from factual hallucination, which can lead to incorrect diagnoses. Fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have emerged as methods to address these issues. However, the amount of high-quality data and distribution shifts between training data and deployment data limit the application of fine-tuning methods. Although RAG is lightweight and effective, existing RAG-based approaches are not sufficiently general to different medical domains and can potentially cause misalignment issues, both between modalities and between the model and the ground truth. In this paper, we propose a versatile multimodal RAG system, MMed-RAG, designed to enhance the factuality of Med-LVLMs. Our approach introduces a domain-aware retrieval mechanism, an adaptive retrieved contexts selection method, and a provable RAG-based preference fine-tuning strategy. These innovations make the RAG process sufficiently general and reliable, significantly improving alignment when introducing retrieved contexts. Experimental results across five medical datasets (involving radiology, ophthalmology, pathology) on medical VQA and report generation demonstrate that MMed-RAG can achieve an average improvement of 43.8% in the factual accuracy of Med-LVLMs. Our data and code are available in https://github.com/richard-peng-xia/MMed-RAG.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Houze Liu, Bo Zhang, Yanlin Xiang, Yuxiang Hu, Aoran Shen, Yang Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have precipitated a paradigm shift in medical imaging, particularly revolutionizing the domain of brain imaging. This paper systematically investigates the integration of deep learning -- a principal branch of AI -- into the semantic segmentation of brain images. Semantic segmentation serves as an indispensable technique for the delineation of discrete anatomical structures and the identification of pathological markers, essential for the diagnosis of complex neurological disorders. Historically, the reliance on manual interpretation by radiologists, while noteworthy for its accuracy, is plagued by inherent subjectivity and inter-observer variability. This limitation becomes more pronounced with the exponential increase in imaging data, which traditional methods struggle to process efficiently and effectively. In response to these challenges, this study introduces the application of adversarial neural networks, a novel AI approach that not only automates but also refines the semantic segmentation process. By leveraging these advanced neural networks, our approach enhances the precision of diagnostic outputs, reducing human error and increasing the throughput of imaging data analysis. The paper provides a detailed discussion on how adversarial neural networks facilitate a more robust, objective, and scalable solution, thereby significantly improving diagnostic accuracies in neurological evaluations. This exploration highlights the transformative impact of AI on medical imaging, setting a new benchmark for future research and clinical practice in neurology.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sikai Yang, Kang Yang, Yuning Chen, Fan Zhao, Wan Du</p>
<p>Abstract: This work presents ARD2, a framework that enables real-time through-wall surveillance using two aerial drones and an augmented reality (AR) device. ARD2 consists of two main steps: target direction estimation and contour reconstruction. In the first stage, ARD2 leverages geometric relationships between the drones, the user, and the target to project the target's direction onto the user's AR display. In the second stage, images from the drones are synthesized to reconstruct the target's contour, allowing the user to visualize the target behind walls. Experimental results demonstrate the system's accuracy in both direction estimation and contour reconstruction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kuleen Sasse, Shan Chen, Jackson Pond, Danielle Bitterman, John Osborne</p>
<p>Abstract: As Vision Language Models (VLMs) gain widespread use, their fairness remains under-explored. In this paper, we analyze demographic biases across five models and six datasets. We find that portrait datasets like UTKFace and CelebA are the best tools for bias detection, finding gaps in performance and fairness between LLaVa and CLIP models. However, scene based datasets like PATA, VLStereoSet fail to be useful benchmarks for bias due to their construction. As for pronoun based datasets like VisoGender, we receive mixed signals as only some subsets of the data are useful in providing insights. To alleviate this problem, we introduce a more difficult version of VisoGender to serve as a more rigorous evaluation. Based on these results, we call for more effective and carefully designed datasets to ensure VLMs are both fair and reliable.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Khiem Le, Nitesh V. Chawla</p>
<p>Abstract: Molecule optimization is a critical task in drug discovery to optimize desired properties of a given molecule through chemical modification. Despite Large Language Models (LLMs) holding the potential to efficiently simulate this task by using natural language to direct the optimization, straightforwardly utilizing shows limited performance. In this work, we facilitate utilizing LLMs in an iterative paradigm by proposing a simple yet highly effective domain feedback provider, namely $\text{Re}^2$DF. In detail, $\text{Re}^2$DF harnesses an external toolkit, RDKit, to handle the molecule hallucination, if the modified molecule is chemically invalid. Otherwise, its desired properties are computed and compared to the original one, establishing reliable domain feedback with correct direction and distance towards the objective, followed by a retrieved example, to explicitly guide the LLM to refine the modified molecule. We conduct experiments across both single- and multi-property objectives with 2 thresholds, where $\text{Re}^2$DF shows significant improvements. Particularly, for 20 single-property objectives, $\text{Re}^2$DF enhances the Hit ratio by 16.95\% and 20.76\% under loose and strict thresholds, respectively. For 32 multi-property objectives, $\text{Re}^2$DF enhances the Hit ratio by 6.04\% and 5.25\%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jameson Merkow, Felix J. Dorfner, Xiyu Yang, Alexander Ersoy, Giridhar Dasegowda, Mannudeep Kalra, Matthew P. Lungren, Christopher P. Bridge, Ivan Tarapov</p>
<p>Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into medical imaging has advanced clinical diagnostics but poses challenges in managing model drift and ensuring long-term reliability. To address these challenges, we develop MMC+, an enhanced framework for scalable drift monitoring, building upon the CheXstray framework that introduced real-time drift detection for medical imaging AI models using multi-modal data concordance. This work extends the original framework's methodologies, providing a more scalable and adaptable solution for real-world healthcare settings and offers a reliable and cost-effective alternative to continuous performance monitoring addressing limitations of both continuous and periodic monitoring methods. MMC+ introduces critical improvements to the original framework, including more robust handling of diverse data streams, improved scalability with the integration of foundation models like MedImageInsight for high-dimensional image embeddings without site-specific training, and the introduction of uncertainty bounds to better capture drift in dynamic clinical environments. Validated with real-world data from Massachusetts General Hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic, MMC+ effectively detects significant data shifts and correlates them with model performance changes. While not directly predicting performance degradation, MMC+ serves as an early warning system, indicating when AI systems may deviate from acceptable performance bounds and enabling timely interventions. By emphasizing the importance of monitoring diverse data streams and evaluating data shifts alongside model performance, this work contributes to the broader adoption and integration of AI solutions in clinical settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> George I. Kamberov</p>
<p>Abstract: Many machine learning (ML) classifiers are claimed to outperform humans, but they still make mistakes that humans do not. The most notorious examples of such mistakes are adversarial visual metamers. This paper aims to define and investigate the phenomenon of adversarial Doppelgangers (AD), which includes adversarial visual metamers, and to compare the performance and robustness of ML classifiers to human performance.
  We find that AD are inputs that are close to each other with respect to a perceptual metric defined in this paper. AD are qualitatively different from the usual adversarial examples. The vast majority of classifiers are vulnerable to AD and robustness-accuracy trade-offs may not improve them. Some classification problems may not admit any AD robust classifiers because the underlying classes are ambiguous. We provide criteria that can be used to determine whether a classification problem is well defined or not; describe the structure and attributes of an AD-robust classifier; introduce and explore the notions of conceptual entropy and regions of conceptual ambiguity for classifiers that are vulnerable to AD attacks, along with methods to bound the AD fooling rate of an attack. We define the notion of classifiers that exhibit hypersensitive behavior, that is, classifiers whose only mistakes are adversarial Doppelgangers. Improving the AD robustness of hyper-sensitive classifiers is equivalent to improving accuracy. We identify conditions guaranteeing that all classifiers with sufficiently high accuracy are hyper-sensitive.
  Our findings are aimed at significant improvements in the reliability and security of machine learning systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingda Lu, Zitian Ao, Chao Wang, Sudhakar Prasad, Raymond H. Chan</p>
<p>Abstract: For the 3D localization problem using point spread function (PSF) engineering, we propose a novel enhancement of our previously introduced localization neural network, LocNet. The improved network is a physics-informed neural network (PINN) that we call PiLocNet. Previous works on the localization problem may be categorized separately into model-based optimization and neural network approaches. Our PiLocNet combines the unique strengths of both approaches by incorporating forward-model-based information into the network via a data-fitting loss term that constrains the neural network to yield results that are physically sensible. We additionally incorporate certain regularization terms from the variational method, which further improves the robustness of the network in the presence of image noise, as we show for the Poisson and Gaussian noise models. This framework accords interpretability to the neural network, and the results we obtain show its superiority. Although the paper focuses on the use of single-lobe rotating PSF to encode the full 3D source location, we expect the method to be widely applicable to other PSFs and imaging problems that are constrained by known forward processes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thao Do</p>
<p>Abstract: Extracting fine-grained OCR text from aged documents in diacritic languages remains challenging due to unexpected artifacts, time-induced degradation, and lack of datasets. While standalone spell correction approaches have been proposed, they show limited performance for historical documents due to numerous possible OCR error combinations and differences between modern and classical corpus distributions. We propose a method utilizing available content-focused ebooks as a reference base to correct imperfect OCR-generated text, supported by large language models. This technique generates high-precision pseudo-page-to-page labels for diacritic languages, where small strokes pose significant challenges in historical conditions. The pipeline eliminates various types of noise from aged documents and addresses issues such as missing characters, words, and disordered sequences. Our post-processing method, which generated a large OCR dataset of classical Vietnamese books, achieved a mean grading score of 8.72 on a 10-point scale. This outperformed the state-of-the-art transformer-based Vietnamese spell correction model, which scored 7.03 when evaluated on a sampled subset of the dataset. We also trained a baseline OCR model to assess and compare it with well-known engines. Experimental results demonstrate the strength of our baseline model compared to widely used open-source solutions. The resulting dataset will be released publicly to support future studies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> ChaoRong Li, XuDong Ling, YiLan Xue, Wenjie Luo, LiHong Zhu, FengQing Qin, Yaodong Zhou, Yuanyuan Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Short-term precipitation forecasting remains challenging due to the difficulty in capturing long-term spatiotemporal dependencies. Current deep learning methods fall short in establishing effective dependencies between conditions and forecast results, while also lacking interpretability. To address this issue, we propose a Precipitation Nowcasting Using Diffusion Transformer with Causal Attention model. Our model leverages Transformer and combines causal attention mechanisms to establish spatiotemporal queries between conditional information (causes) and forecast results (results). This design enables the model to effectively capture long-term dependencies, allowing forecast results to maintain strong causal relationships with input conditions over a wide range of time and space. We explore four variants of spatiotemporal information interactions for DTCA, demonstrating that global spatiotemporal labeling interactions yield the best performance. In addition, we introduce a Channel-To-Batch shift operation to further enhance the model's ability to represent complex rainfall dynamics. We conducted experiments on two datasets. Compared to state-of-the-art U-Net-based methods, our approach improved the CSI (Critical Success Index) for predicting heavy precipitation by approximately 15% and 8% respectively, achieving state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kyungmin Min, Minbeom Kim, Kang-il Lee, Dongryeol Lee, Kyomin Jung</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities in generating detailed and coherent responses from visual inputs. However, they are prone to generate hallucinations due to an over-reliance on language priors. To address this issue, we investigate the language priors in LVLMs and make two key observations: (1) Even when predicting the tokens associated with image-related part-of-speech (POS), models increasingly rely on linguistic priors as the token sequences grow, thereby amplifying hallucinations. (2) Methods that directly calibrate LVLM's output distribution to mitigate language priors can lead to a degradation in text quality or even exacerbate hallucinations. Based on these findings, we propose a novel method, Summary-Guided Decoding (SGD). This method naturally encourages the model to focus more on image information by reducing the text context through summaries, while controlling only the image-related POS tokens to maintain text quality. Through experiments, we demonstrate that SGD achieves state-of-the-art performance on object hallucination benchmarks. Furthermore, in terms of the trade-off between precision and recall, SGD achieves Pareto optimality among the existing methods. Lastly, we observe that although existing methods struggle to balance the reduction of object hallucinations with maintaining text quality, SGD demonstrates robustness in handling this challenge.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kamil Kwarciak, Mateusz Daniol, Daria Hemmerling, Marek Wodzinski</p>
<p>Abstract: The skull segmentation from CT scans can be seen as an already solved problem. However, in MR this task has a significantly greater complexity due to the presence of soft tissues rather than bones. Capturing the bone structures from MR images of the head, where the main visualization objective is the brain, is very demanding. The attempts that make use of skull stripping seem to not be well suited for this task and fail to work in many cases. On the other hand, supervised approaches require costly and time-consuming skull annotations. To overcome the difficulties we propose a fully unsupervised approach, where we do not perform the segmentation directly on MR images, but we rather perform a synthetic CT data generation via MR-to-CT translation and perform the segmentation there. We address many issues associated with unsupervised skull segmentation including the unpaired nature of MR and CT datasets (contrastive learning), low resolution and poor quality (super-resolution), and generalization capabilities. The research has a significant value for downstream tasks requiring skull segmentation from MR volumes such as craniectomy or surgery planning and can be seen as an important step towards the utilization of synthetic data in medical imaging.</p>

<p>Abstract: Supervised contrastive learning has been explored in making use of label information for multi-label classification, but determining positive samples in multi-label scenario remains challenging. Previous studies have examined strategies for identifying positive samples, considering label overlap proportion between anchors and samples. However, they ignore various relations between given anchors and samples, as well as how to dynamically adjust the weights in contrastive loss functions based on different relations, leading to great ambiguity. In this paper, we introduce five distinct relations between multi-label samples and propose a Similarity-Dissimilarity Loss with contrastive learning for multi-label classification. Our loss function re-weights the loss by computing the similarity and dissimilarity between positive samples and a given anchor based on the introduced relations. We mainly conduct experiments for multi-label text classification on MIMIC datasets, then further extend the evaluation on MS-COCO. The Experimental results show that our proposed loss effectively improves the performance on all encoders under supervised contrastive learning paradigm, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aditya Sharma, Aman Dalmia, Mehran Kazemi, Amal Zouaq, Christopher J. Pal</p>
<p>Abstract: Geometry problem-solving demands advanced reasoning abilities to process multimodal inputs and employ mathematical knowledge effectively. Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in various multimodal tasks. Yet, they still struggle with geometry problems and are significantly limited by their inability to perform mathematical operations not seen during pre-training, such as calculating the cosine of an arbitrary angle, and by difficulties in correctly applying relevant geometry formulas. To overcome these challenges, we present GeoCoder, which leverages modular code-finetuning to generate and execute code using a predefined geometry function library. By executing the code, we achieve accurate and deterministic calculations, contrasting the stochastic nature of autoregressive token prediction, while the function library minimizes errors in formula usage. We also propose a multimodal retrieval-augmented variant of GeoCoder, named RAG-GeoCoder, which incorporates a non-parametric memory module for retrieving functions from the geometry library, thereby reducing reliance on parametric memory. Our modular code-finetuning approach enhances the geometric reasoning capabilities of VLMs, yielding an average improvement of over 16% across various question complexities on the GeomVerse dataset compared to other finetuning methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eliahu Horwitz, Bar Cavia, Jonathan Kahana, Yedid Hoshen</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing availability of public models begs the question: can we train neural networks that use other networks as input? This paper learns to represent models within a joint space that embeds both model weights and language. However, machine learning on model weights is challenging as model weights often exhibit significant variation unrelated to the models' semantic properties (nuisance variation). We identify a key property of real-world models: most public models belong to a small set of Model Trees, where all models within a tree are fine-tuned from a common ancestor (e.g., a foundation model). Importantly, we find that within each tree there is less nuisance variation between models. For example, while classifying models according to their training dataset generally requires complex architectures, in our case, even a linear classifier trained on a single layer is often effective. While effective, linear layers are computationally expensive as model weights are very high dimensional. To address this, we introduce Probing Experts (ProbeX), a theoretically motivated, lightweight probing method. Notably, ProbeX is the first probing method designed to learn from the weights of just a single model layer. We also construct and release a dataset that simulates the structure of public model repositories. Our results show that ProbeX can effectively map the weights of large models into a shared weight-language embedding space. Furthermore, we demonstrate the impressive generalization of our method, achieving zero-shot model classification and retrieval.</p>

Qualitative assessments demonstrate the capability to predict spectral profiles critical for informed surgical decision-making during procedures. Challenges associated with capturing both the visible and extended hyperspectral ranges are highlighted using the MAE, emphasizing the complexities involved. The findings open up the new research direction of hyperspectral reconstruction for surgical applications and clinical use cases in real-time surgical environments.</p>

The DL model demonstrates consistency with manual measurements and increased throughput, laying the foundation for statistical studies of nanotube growth. The approach can be adapted for other types of in-situ microscopy studies, emphasizing the importance of automation in high-throughput data acquisition for research on individual nano-objects.</p>

<p>Abstract: With models getting stronger, evaluations have grown more complex, testing multiple skills in one benchmark and even in the same instance at once. However, skill-wise performance is obscured when inspecting aggregate accuracy, under-utilizing the rich signal modern benchmarks contain. We propose an automatic approach to recover the underlying skills relevant for any evaluation instance, by way of inspecting model-generated rationales. After validating the relevance of rationale-parsed skills and inferring skills for $46$k instances over $12$ benchmarks, we observe many skills to be common across benchmarks, resulting in the curation of hundreds of skill-slices (i.e. sets of instances testing a common skill). Inspecting accuracy over these slices yields novel insights on model trade-offs: e.g., compared to GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, on average, Gemini 1.5 Pro is $18\%$ more accurate in "computing molar mass", but $19\%$ less accurate in "applying constitutional law", despite the overall accuracies of the three models differing by a mere $0.4\%$. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical utility of our approach by showing that insights derived from skill slice analysis can generalize to held-out instances: when routing each instance to the model strongest on the relevant skills, we see a $3\%$ accuracy improvement over our $12$ dataset corpus. Our skill-slices and framework open a new avenue in model evaluation, leveraging skill-specific analyses to unlock a more granular and actionable understanding of model capabilities.</p>

We demonstrate its capability and usage in applications including reconstruction of robot poses from images and controlling robots through vision language models. Quantitative and qualitative results show that our differentiable rendering model provides effective gradients for robotic control directly from pixels, setting the foundation for the future applications of vision foundation models in robotics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zizhao Chen, Mustafa Omer Gul, Yiwei Chen, Gloria Geng, Anne Wu, Yoav Artzi</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-turn interactions between large language models (LLMs) and users naturally include implicit feedback signals. If an LLM responds in an unexpected way to an instruction, the user is likely to signal it by rephrasing the request, expressing frustration, or pivoting to an alternative task. Such signals are task-independent and occupy a relatively constrained subspace of language, allowing the LLM to identify them even if it fails on the actual task. This creates an avenue for continually learning from interactions without additional annotations. We introduce ReSpect, a method to learn from such signals in past interactions via retrospection. We deploy ReSpect in a new multimodal interaction scenario, where humans instruct an LLM to solve an abstract reasoning task with a combinatorial solution space. Through thousands of interactions with humans, we show how ReSpect gradually improves task completion rate from 31% to 82%, all without any external annotation.</p>

<p>Abstract: As the capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) continue to improve, the need for higher-order capability evaluation of MLLMs is increasing. However, there is a lack of work evaluating MLLM for higher-order perception and understanding of Chinese visual content. To fill the gap, we introduce the **C**hinese **I**mage **I**mplication understanding **Bench**mark, **CII-Bench**, which aims to assess the higher-order perception and understanding capabilities of MLLMs for Chinese images. CII-Bench stands out in several ways compared to existing benchmarks. Firstly, to ensure the authenticity of the Chinese context, images in CII-Bench are sourced from the Chinese Internet and manually reviewed, with corresponding answers also manually crafted. Additionally, CII-Bench incorporates images that represent Chinese traditional culture, such as famous Chinese traditional paintings, which can deeply reflect the model's understanding of Chinese traditional culture. Through extensive experiments on CII-Bench across multiple MLLMs, we have made significant findings. Initially, a substantial gap is observed between the performance of MLLMs and humans on CII-Bench. The highest accuracy of MLLMs attains 64.4%, where as human accuracy averages 78.2%, peaking at an impressive 81.0%. Subsequently, MLLMs perform worse on Chinese traditional culture images, suggesting limitations in their ability to understand high-level semantics and lack a deep knowledge base of Chinese traditional culture. Finally, it is observed that most models exhibit enhanced accuracy when image emotion hints are incorporated into the prompts. We believe that CII-Bench will enable MLLMs to gain a better understanding of Chinese semantics and Chinese-specific images, advancing the journey towards expert artificial general intelligence (AGI).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yupeng Cheng, Qing Guo, Felix Juefei-Xu, Huazhu Fu, Shang-Wei Lin, Weisi Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss around the world. To help diagnose it, numerous cutting-edge works have built powerful deep neural networks (DNNs) to automatically grade DR via retinal fundus images (RFIs). However, RFIs are commonly affected by camera exposure issues that may lead to incorrect grades. The mis-graded results can potentially pose high risks to an aggravation of the condition. In this paper, we study this problem from the viewpoint of adversarial attacks. We identify and introduce a novel solution to an entirely new task, termed as adversarial exposure attack, which is able to produce natural exposure images and mislead the state-of-the-art DNNs. We validate our proposed method on a real-world public DR dataset with three DNNs, e.g., ResNet50, MobileNet, and EfficientNet, demonstrating that our method achieves high image quality and success rate in transferring the attacks. Our method reveals the potential threats to DNN-based automatic DR grading and would benefit the development of exposure-robust DR grading methods in the future.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kangle Deng, Andrew Liu, Jun-Yan Zhu, Deva Ramanan</p>
<p>Abstract: A commonly observed failure mode of Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) is fitting incorrect geometries when given an insufficient number of input views. One potential reason is that standard volumetric rendering does not enforce the constraint that most of a scene's geometry consist of empty space and opaque surfaces. We formalize the above assumption through DS-NeRF (Depth-supervised Neural Radiance Fields), a loss for learning radiance fields that takes advantage of readily-available depth supervision. We leverage the fact that current NeRF pipelines require images with known camera poses that are typically estimated by running structure-from-motion (SFM). Crucially, SFM also produces sparse 3D points that can be used as "free" depth supervision during training: we add a loss to encourage the distribution of a ray's terminating depth matches a given 3D keypoint, incorporating depth uncertainty. DS-NeRF can render better images given fewer training views while training 2-3x faster. Further, we show that our loss is compatible with other recently proposed NeRF methods, demonstrating that depth is a cheap and easily digestible supervisory signal. And finally, we find that DS-NeRF can support other types of depth supervision such as scanned depth sensors and RGB-D reconstruction outputs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jing Liu, Donglai Wei, Yang Liu, Sipeng Zhang, Tong Yang, Victor C. M. Leung</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-Based Person Search (TBPS) is a crucial task that enables accurate retrieval of target individuals from large-scale galleries with only given textual caption. For cross-modal TBPS tasks, it is critical to obtain well-distributed representation in the common embedding space to reduce the inter-modal gap. Furthermore, learning detailed image-text correspondences is essential to discriminate similar targets and enable fine-grained search. To address these challenges, we present a simple yet effective method named Sew Calibration and Masked Modeling (SCMM) that calibrates cross-modal representations by learning compact and well-aligned embeddings. SCMM is distinguished by two novel losses to provide fine-grained cross-modal representations: 1) a Sew calibration loss that takes the quality of textual captions as guidance and aligns features between image and text modalities, and 2) a Masked Caption Modeling (MCM) loss that leverages a masked caption prediction task to establish detailed and generic relationships between textual and visual parts. The dual-pronged strategy refines feature alignment and enriches cross-modal correspondences, enabling the accurate distinction of similar individuals. Consequently, its streamlined dual-encoder architecture avoids complex branches and interactions and facilitates high-speed inference suitable for real-time requirements. Consequently, high-speed inference is achieved, which is essential for resource-limited applications often demanding real-time processing. Extensive experiments on three popular TBPS benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of SCMM, achieving top results with 73.81%, 74.25%, and 57.35% Rank-1 accuracy on CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReID, respectively. We hope SCMM's scalable and cost-effective design will serve as a strong baseline and facilitate future research in this field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leonard Tang, Dan Ley</p>
<p>Abstract: It is well-known that modern computer vision systems often exhibit behaviors misaligned with those of humans: from adversarial attacks to image corruptions, deep learning vision models suffer in a variety of settings that humans capably handle. In light of these phenomena, here we introduce another, orthogonal perspective studying the human-machine vision gap. We revisit the task of recovering images under degradation, first introduced over 30 years ago in the Recognition-by-Components theory of human vision. Specifically, we study the performance and behavior of neural networks on the seemingly simple task of classifying regular polygons at varying orders of degradation along their perimeters. To this end, we implement the Automated Shape Recoverability Test for rapidly generating large-scale datasets of perimeter-degraded regular polygons, modernizing the historically manual creation of image recoverability experiments. We then investigate the capacity of neural networks to recognize and recover such degraded shapes when initialized with different priors. Ultimately, we find that neural networks' behavior on this simple task conflicts with human behavior, raising a fundamental question of the robustness and learning capabilities of modern computer vision models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nataniel Ruiz, Yuanzhen Li, Varun Jampani, Wei Wei, Tingbo Hou, Yael Pritch, Neal Wadhwa, Michael Rubinstein, Kfir Aberman</p>
<p>Abstract: Personalization has emerged as a prominent aspect within the field of generative AI, enabling the synthesis of individuals in diverse contexts and styles, while retaining high-fidelity to their identities. However, the process of personalization presents inherent challenges in terms of time and memory requirements. Fine-tuning each personalized model needs considerable GPU time investment, and storing a personalized model per subject can be demanding in terms of storage capacity. To overcome these challenges, we propose HyperDreamBooth - a hypernetwork capable of efficiently generating a small set of personalized weights from a single image of a person. By composing these weights into the diffusion model, coupled with fast finetuning, HyperDreamBooth can generate a person's face in various contexts and styles, with high subject details while also preserving the model's crucial knowledge of diverse styles and semantic modifications. Our method achieves personalization on faces in roughly 20 seconds, 25x faster than DreamBooth and 125x faster than Textual Inversion, using as few as one reference image, with the same quality and style diversity as DreamBooth. Also our method yields a model that is 10,000x smaller than a normal DreamBooth model. Project page: https://hyperdreambooth.github.io</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Riccardo Barbano, Alexander Denker, Hyungjin Chung, Tae Hoon Roh, Simon Arridge, Peter Maass, Bangti Jin, Jong Chul Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Denoising diffusion models have emerged as the go-to generative framework for solving inverse problems in imaging. A critical concern regarding these models is their performance on out-of-distribution tasks, which remains an under-explored challenge. Using a diffusion model on an out-of-distribution dataset, realistic reconstructions can be generated, but with hallucinating image features that are uniquely present in the training dataset. To address this discrepancy during train-test time and improve reconstruction accuracy, we introduce a novel sampling framework called Steerable Conditional Diffusion. Specifically, this framework adapts the diffusion model, concurrently with image reconstruction, based solely on the information provided by the available measurement. Utilising our proposed method, we achieve substantial enhancements in out-of-distribution performance across diverse imaging modalities, advancing the robust deployment of denoising diffusion models in real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhongjie Ba, Jieming Zhong, Jiachen Lei, Peng Cheng, Qinglong Wang, Zhan Qin, Zhibo Wang, Kui Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: Advanced text-to-image models such as DALL$\cdot$E 2 and Midjourney possess the capacity to generate highly realistic images, raising significant concerns regarding the potential proliferation of unsafe content. This includes adult, violent, or deceptive imagery of political figures. Despite claims of rigorous safety mechanisms implemented in these models to restrict the generation of not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content, we successfully devise and exhibit the first prompt attacks on Midjourney, resulting in the production of abundant photorealistic NSFW images. We reveal the fundamental principles of such prompt attacks and suggest strategically substituting high-risk sections within a suspect prompt to evade closed-source safety measures. Our novel framework, SurrogatePrompt, systematically generates attack prompts, utilizing large language models, image-to-text, and image-to-image modules to automate attack prompt creation at scale. Evaluation results disclose an 88% success rate in bypassing Midjourney's proprietary safety filter with our attack prompts, leading to the generation of counterfeit images depicting political figures in violent scenarios. Both subjective and objective assessments validate that the images generated from our attack prompts present considerable safety hazards.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Che Liu, Cheng Ouyang, Sibo Cheng, Anand Shah, Wenjia Bai, Rossella Arcucci</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, medical vision-language pre-training (VLP) has reached substantial progress to learn global visual representation from medical images and their paired radiology reports. However, medical imaging tasks in real world usually require finer granularity in visual features. These tasks include visual localization tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation, object detection) and visual grounding task. Yet, current medical VLP methods face challenges in learning these fine-grained features, as they primarily focus on brute-force alignment between image patches and individual text tokens for local visual feature learning, which is suboptimal for downstream dense prediction tasks. In this work, we propose a new VLP framework, named \textbf{G}lobal to \textbf{D}ense level representation learning (G2D) that achieves significantly improved granularity and more accurate grounding for the learned features, compared to existing medical VLP approaches. In particular, G2D learns dense and semantically-grounded image representations via a pseudo segmentation task parallel with the global vision-language alignment. Notably, generating pseudo segmentation targets does not incur extra trainable parameters: they are obtained on the fly during VLP with a parameter-free processor. G2D achieves superior performance across 6 medical imaging tasks and 25 diseases, particularly in semantic segmentation, which necessitates fine-grained, semantically-grounded image features. In this task, G2D surpasses peer models even when fine-tuned with just 1\% of the training data, compared to the 100\% used by these models. The code will be released upon acceptance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kostas Triaridis, Konstantinos Tsigos, Vasileios Mezaris</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent image manipulation localization and detection techniques typically leverage forensic artifacts and traces that are produced by a noise-sensitive filter, such as SRM or Bayar convolution. In this paper, we showcase that different filters commonly used in such approaches excel at unveiling different types of manipulations and provide complementary forensic traces. Thus, we explore ways of combining the outputs of such filters to leverage the complementary nature of the produced artifacts for performing image manipulation localization and detection (IMLD). We assess two distinct combination methods: one that produces independent features from each forensic filter and then fuses them (this is referred to as late fusion) and one that performs early mixing of different modal outputs and produces combined features (this is referred to as early fusion). We use the latter as a feature encoding mechanism, accompanied by a new decoding mechanism that encompasses feature re-weighting, for formulating the proposed MMFusion architecture. We demonstrate that MMFusion achieves competitive performance for both image manipulation localization and detection, outperforming state-of-the-art models across several image and video datasets. We also investigate further the contribution of each forensic filter within MMFusion for addressing different types of manipulations, building on recent AI explainability measures.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the domain of vision-language integration, generating detailed image captions poses a significant challenge due to the lack of curated and rich datasets. This study introduces PixLore, a novel method that leverages Querying Transformers through the fine-tuning of the BLIP-2 model using the LoRa method on a standard commercial GPU. The followed approach, which involves training on a carefully assembled dataset from state-of-the-art Computer Vision models combined and augmented by ChatGPT, addresses the question of whether intricate image understanding can be achieved with an ensemble of smaller-scale models, referred to as Knowledge Stitching. Comparative evaluations against major models such as GPT-4 and Google Bard demonstrate that PixLore-2.7B, despite having considerably fewer parameters, is rated higher than the existing State-of-the-Art models in over half of the assessments. Precisely, PixLore outperform Bard and BLIP-2, which score approximately 35.18% and 27.98% lower than PixLore in the task of image captioning. This research not only presents a groundbreaking approach but also highlights the importance of well-curated datasets in enhancing the performance of smaller models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shufan Li, Harkanwar Singh, Aditya Grover</p>
<p>Abstract: The ability to provide fine-grained control for generating and editing visual imagery has profound implications for computer vision and its applications. Previous works have explored extending controllability in two directions: instruction tuning with text-based prompts and multi-modal conditioning. However, these works make one or more unnatural assumptions on the number and/or type of modality inputs used to express controllability. We propose InstructAny2Pix, a flexible multi-modal instruction-following system that enables users to edit an input image using instructions involving audio, images, and text. InstructAny2Pix consists of three building blocks that facilitate this capability: a multi-modal encoder that encodes different modalities such as images and audio into a unified latent space, a diffusion model that learns to decode representations in this latent space into images, and a multi-modal LLM that can understand instructions involving multiple images and audio pieces and generate a conditional embedding of the desired output, which can be used by the diffusion decoder. Additionally, to facilitate training efficiency and improve generation quality, we include an additional refinement prior module that enhances the visual quality of LLM outputs. These designs are critical to the performance of our system. We demonstrate that our system can perform a series of novel instruction-guided editing tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> A. Emin Orhan, Wentao Wang, Alex N. Wang, Mengye Ren, Brenden M. Lake</p>
<p>Abstract: Children learn powerful internal models of the world around them from a few years of egocentric visual experience. Can such internal models be learned from a child's visual experience with highly generic learning algorithms or do they require strong inductive biases? Recent advances in collecting large-scale, longitudinal, developmentally realistic video datasets and generic self-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms are allowing us to begin to tackle this nature vs. nurture question. However, existing work typically focuses on image-based SSL algorithms and visual capabilities that can be learned from static images (e.g. object recognition), thus ignoring temporal aspects of the world. To close this gap, here we train self-supervised video models on longitudinal, egocentric headcam recordings collected from a child over a two year period in their early development (6-31 months). The resulting models are highly effective at facilitating the learning of action concepts from a small number of labeled examples; they have favorable data size scaling properties; and they display emergent video interpolation capabilities. Video models also learn more accurate and more robust object representations than image-based models trained with the exact same data. These results suggest that important temporal aspects of a child's internal model of the world may be learnable from their visual experience using highly generic learning algorithms and without strong inductive biases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziqiao Shang, Bin Liu, Fengmao Lv, Fei Teng, Tianrui Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Facial action unit (AU) detection has long encountered the challenge of detecting subtle feature differences when AUs activate. Existing methods often rely on encoding pixel-level information of AUs, which not only encodes additional redundant information but also leads to increased model complexity and limited generalizability. Additionally, the accuracy of AU detection is negatively impacted by the class imbalance issue of each AU type, and the presence of noisy and false AU labels. In this paper, we introduce a novel contrastive learning framework aimed for AU detection that incorporates both self-supervised and supervised signals, thereby enhancing the learning of discriminative features for accurate AU detection. To tackle the class imbalance issue, we employ a negative sample re-weighting strategy that adjusts the step size of updating parameters for minority and majority class samples. Moreover, to address the challenges posed by noisy and false AU labels, we employ a sampling technique that encompasses three distinct types of positive sample pairs. This enables us to inject self-supervised signals into the supervised signal, effectively mitigating the adverse effects of noisy labels. Our experimental assessments, conducted on four widely-utilized benchmark datasets (BP4D, DISFA, GFT and Aff-Wild2), underscore the superior performance of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods of AU detection.

<p>Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) paradigm provides a powerful way to decompose dense layers into smaller, modular computations often more amenable to human interpretation, debugging, and editability. However, a major challenge lies in the computational cost of scaling the number of experts high enough to achieve fine-grained specialization. In this paper, we propose the Multilinear Mixture of Experts ($\mu$MoE) layer to address this, focusing on vision models. $\mu$MoE layers enable scalable expert specialization by performing an implicit computation on prohibitively large weight tensors entirely in factorized form. Consequently, $\mu$MoEs (1) avoid the restrictively high inference-time costs of dense MoEs, yet (2) do not inherit the training issues of the popular sparse MoEs' discrete (non-differentiable) expert routing. We present both qualitative and quantitative evidence that scaling $\mu$MoE layers when fine-tuning foundation models for vision tasks leads to more specialized experts at the class-level, further enabling manual bias correction in CelebA attribute classification. Finally, we show qualitative results demonstrating the expert specialism achieved when pre-training large GPT2 and MLP-Mixer models with parameter-matched $\mu$MoE blocks at every layer, maintaining comparable accuracy.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kerui Ren, Lihan Jiang, Tao Lu, Mulin Yu, Linning Xu, Zhangkai Ni, Bo Dai</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent 3D Gaussian splatting (3D-GS) has shown remarkable rendering fidelity and efficiency compared to NeRF-based neural scene representations. While demonstrating the potential for real-time rendering, 3D-GS encounters rendering bottlenecks in large scenes with complex details due to an excessive number of Gaussian primitives located within the viewing frustum. This limitation is particularly noticeable in zoom-out views and can lead to inconsistent rendering speeds in scenes with varying details. Moreover, it often struggles to capture the corresponding level of details at different scales with its heuristic density control operation. Inspired by the Level-of-Detail (LOD) techniques, we introduce Octree-GS, featuring an LOD-structured 3D Gaussian approach supporting level-of-detail decomposition for scene representation that contributes to the final rendering results. Our model dynamically selects the appropriate level from the set of multi-resolution anchor points, ensuring consistent rendering performance with adaptive LOD adjustments while maintaining high-fidelity rendering results.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this work, we present a novel approach for motion customization in video generation, addressing the widespread gap in the exploration of motion representation within video generative models. Recognizing the unique challenges posed by the spatiotemporal nature of video, our method introduces Motion Embeddings, a set of explicit, temporally coherent embeddings derived from a given video. These embeddings are designed to integrate seamlessly with the temporal transformer modules of video diffusion models, modulating self-attention computations across frames without compromising spatial integrity. Our approach provides a compact and efficient solution to motion representation, utilizing two types of embeddings: a Motion Query-Key Embedding to modulate the temporal attention map and a Motion Value Embedding to modulate the attention values. Additionally, we introduce an inference strategy that excludes spatial dimensions from the Motion Query-Key Embedding and applies a differential operation to the Motion Value Embedding, both designed to debias appearance and ensure the embeddings focus solely on motion. Our contributions include the introduction of a tailored motion embedding for customization tasks and a demonstration of the practical advantages and effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinfeng Li, Yuchen Yang, Jiangyi Deng, Chen Yan, Yanjiao Chen, Xiaoyu Ji, Wenyuan Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models, such as Stable Diffusion, have exhibited remarkable performance in generating high-quality images from text descriptions in recent years. However, text-to-image models may be tricked into generating not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content, particularly in sexually explicit scenarios. Existing countermeasures mostly focus on filtering inappropriate inputs and outputs, or suppressing improper text embeddings, which can block sexually explicit content (e.g., naked) but may still be vulnerable to adversarial prompts -- inputs that appear innocent but are ill-intended. In this paper, we present SafeGen, a framework to mitigate sexual content generation by text-to-image models in a text-agnostic manner. The key idea is to eliminate explicit visual representations from the model regardless of the text input. In this way, the text-to-image model is resistant to adversarial prompts since such unsafe visual representations are obstructed from within. Extensive experiments conducted on four datasets and large-scale user studies demonstrate SafeGen's effectiveness in mitigating sexually explicit content generation while preserving the high-fidelity of benign images. SafeGen outperforms eight state-of-the-art baseline methods and achieves 99.4% sexual content removal performance. Furthermore, our constructed benchmark of adversarial prompts provides a basis for future development and evaluation of anti-NSFW-generation methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Zhang, Junhui Hou</p>
<p>Abstract: Contrastive image-to-LiDAR knowledge transfer, commonly used for learning 3D representations with synchronized images and point clouds, often faces a self-conflict dilemma. This issue arises as contrastive losses unintentionally dissociate features of unmatched points and pixels that share semantic labels, compromising the integrity of learned representations. To overcome this, we harness Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), which have revolutionized the acquisition of pixel-level semantics, to enhance 3D representation learning. Specifically, we utilize off-the-shelf VFMs to generate semantic labels for weakly-supervised pixel-to-point contrastive distillation. Additionally, we employ von Mises-Fisher distributions to structure the feature space, ensuring semantic embeddings within the same class remain consistent across varying inputs. Furthermore, we adapt sampling probabilities of points to address imbalances in spatial distribution and category frequency, promoting comprehensive and balanced learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach mitigates the challenges posed by traditional methods and consistently surpasses existing image-to-LiDAR contrastive distillation methods in downstream tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junyi Wu, Haoxuan Wang, Yuzhang Shang, Mubarak Shah, Yan Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent introduction of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) has demonstrated exceptional capabilities in image generation by using a different backbone architecture, departing from traditional U-Nets and embracing the scalable nature of transformers. Despite their advanced capabilities, the wide deployment of DiTs, particularly for real-time applications, is currently hampered by considerable computational demands at the inference stage. Post-training Quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a fast and data-efficient solution that can significantly reduce computation and memory footprint by using low-bit weights and activations. However, its applicability to DiTs has not yet been explored and faces non-trivial difficulties due to the unique design of DiTs. In this paper, we propose PTQ4DiT, a specifically designed PTQ method for DiTs. We discover two primary quantization challenges inherent in DiTs, notably the presence of salient channels with extreme magnitudes and the temporal variability in distributions of salient activation over multiple timesteps. To tackle these challenges, we propose Channel-wise Salience Balancing (CSB) and Spearmen's $\rho$-guided Salience Calibration (SSC). CSB leverages the complementarity property of channel magnitudes to redistribute the extremes, alleviating quantization errors for both activations and weights. SSC extends this approach by dynamically adjusting the balanced salience to capture the temporal variations in activation. Additionally, to eliminate extra computational costs caused by PTQ4DiT during inference, we design an offline re-parameterization strategy for DiTs. Experiments demonstrate that our PTQ4DiT successfully quantizes DiTs to 8-bit precision (W8A8) while preserving comparable generation ability and further enables effective quantization to 4-bit weight precision (W4A8) for the first time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyang Wang, Shoubin Yu, Elias Stengel-Eskin, Jaehong Yoon, Feng Cheng, Gedas Bertasius, Mohit Bansal</p>
<p>Abstract: Long-form video understanding has been a challenging task due to the high redundancy in video data and the abundance of query-irrelevant information. To tackle this challenge, we propose VideoTree, a training-free framework which builds a query-adaptive and hierarchical video representation for LLM reasoning over long-form videos. First, VideoTree extracts query-relevant information from the input video through an iterative process, progressively refining the selection of keyframes based on their relevance to the query. Furthermore, VideoTree leverages the inherent hierarchical structure of long video data, which is often overlooked by existing LLM-based methods. Specifically, we incorporate multigranularity information into a tree-based representation, allowing VideoTree to extract query-relevant details from long videos in a coarse-to-fine manner. This enables the model to effectively handle a wide range of video queries with varying levels of detail. Finally, VideoTree aggregates the hierarchical query-relevant information within the tree structure and feeds it into an LLM reasoning model to answer the query. Our experiments show that our training-free method improves both reasoning accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods. Specifically, VideoTree outperforms the existing training-free approaches on the popular EgoSchema and NExT-QA benchmarks with less inference time, achieving 61.1% and 75.6% accuracy on the test set without additional video-specific training. Moreover, on the long split of Video-MME benchmark (average 44 minutes), the training-free VideoTree framework achieves better performance than the strong proprietary GPT-4V model and other MLLMs that were extensively trained on video data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gonca Yilmaz, Songyou Peng, Marc Pollefeys, Francis Engelmann, Hermann Blum</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have advanced segmentation techniques by shifting from the traditional segmentation of a closed-set of predefined object classes to open-vocabulary segmentation (OVS), allowing users to segment novel classes and concepts unseen during training of the segmentation model. However, this flexibility comes with a trade-off: fully-supervised closed-set methods still outperform OVS methods on base classes, that is on classes on which they have been explicitly trained. This is due to the lack of pixel-aligned training masks for VLMs (which are trained on image-caption pairs), and the absence of domain-specific knowledge, such as autonomous driving. Therefore, we propose the task of open-vocabulary domain adaptation to infuse domain-specific knowledge into VLMs while preserving their open-vocabulary nature. By doing so, we achieve improved performance in base and novel classes. Existing VLM adaptation methods improve performance on base (training) queries, but fail to fully preserve the open-set capabilities of VLMs on novel queries. To address this shortcoming, we combine parameter-efficient prompt tuning with a triplet-loss-based training strategy that uses auxiliary negative queries. Notably, our approach is the only parameter-efficient method that consistently surpasses the original VLM on novel classes. Our adapted VLMs can seamlessly be integrated into existing OVS pipelines, e.g., improving OVSeg by +6.0% mIoU on ADE20K for open-vocabulary 2D segmentation, and OpenMask3D by +4.1% AP on ScanNet++ Offices for open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation without other changes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zane Durante, Robathan Harries, Edward Vendrow, Zelun Luo, Yuta Kyuragi, Kazuki Kozuka, Li Fei-Fei, Ehsan Adeli</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) is a crucial step for different applications including assistive robots, smart homes, and healthcare. However, to date, few benchmarks and methods have focused on complex ADLs, especially those involving multi-person interactions in home environments. In this paper, we propose a new dataset and benchmark, InteractADL, for understanding complex ADLs that involve interaction between humans (and objects). Furthermore, complex ADLs occurring in home environments comprise a challenging long-tailed distribution due to the rarity of multi-person interactions, and pose fine-grained visual recognition tasks due to the presence of semantically and visually similar classes. To address these issues, we propose a novel method for fine-grained few-shot video classification called Name Tuning that enables greater semantic separability by learning optimal class name vectors. We show that Name Tuning can be combined with existing prompt tuning strategies to learn the entire input text (rather than only learning the prompt or class names) and demonstrate improved performance for few-shot classification on InteractADL and 4 other fine-grained visual classification benchmarks. For transparency and reproducibility, we release our code at https://github.com/zanedurante/vlm_benchmark.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianle Zhang, Langtian Ma, Yuchen Yan, Yuchen Zhang, Kai Wang, Yue Yang, Ziyao Guo, Wenqi Shao, Yang You, Yu Qiao, Ping Luo, Kaipeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent text-to-video (T2V) technology advancements, as demonstrated by models such as Gen2, Pika, and Sora, have significantly broadened its applicability and popularity. Despite these strides, evaluating these models poses substantial challenges. Primarily, due to the limitations inherent in automatic metrics, manual evaluation is often considered a superior method for assessing T2V generation. However, existing manual evaluation protocols face reproducibility, reliability, and practicality issues. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the Text-to-Video Human Evaluation (T2VHE) protocol, a comprehensive and standardized protocol for T2V models. The T2VHE protocol includes well-defined metrics, thorough annotator training, and an effective dynamic evaluation module. Experimental results demonstrate that this protocol not only ensures high-quality annotations but can also reduce evaluation costs by nearly 50\%. We will open-source the entire setup of the T2VHE protocol, including the complete protocol workflow, the dynamic evaluation component details, and the annotation interface code. This will help communities establish more sophisticated human assessment protocols.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are becoming increasingly vulnerable to adversarial attacks as various novel attack strategies are being proposed against these models. While existing defenses excel in unimodal contexts, they currently fall short in safeguarding VLMs against adversarial threats. To mitigate this vulnerability, we propose a novel, yet elegantly simple approach for detecting adversarial samples in VLMs. Our method leverages Text-to-Image (T2I) models to generate images based on captions produced by target VLMs. Subsequently, we calculate the similarities of the embeddings of both input and generated images in the feature space to identify adversarial samples. Empirical evaluations conducted on different datasets validate the efficacy of our approach, outperforming baseline methods adapted from image classification domains. Furthermore, we extend our methodology to classification tasks, showcasing its adaptability and model-agnostic nature. Theoretical analyses and empirical findings also show the resilience of our approach against adaptive attacks, positioning it as an excellent defense mechanism for real-world deployment against adversarial threats.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ling Li, Yu Ye, Bingchuan Jiang, Wei Zeng</p>
<p>Abstract: This work tackles the problem of geo-localization with a new paradigm using a large vision-language model (LVLM) augmented with human inference knowledge. A primary challenge here is the scarcity of data for training the LVLM - existing street-view datasets often contain numerous low-quality images lacking visual clues, and lack any reasoning inference. To address the data-quality issue, we devise a CLIP-based network to quantify the degree of street-view images being locatable, leading to the creation of a new dataset comprising highly locatable street views. To enhance reasoning inference, we integrate external knowledge obtained from real geo-localization games, tapping into valuable human inference capabilities. The data are utilized to train GeoReasoner, which undergoes fine-tuning through dedicated reasoning and location-tuning stages. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations illustrate that GeoReasoner outperforms counterpart LVLMs by more than 25% at country-level and 38% at city-level geo-localization tasks, and surpasses StreetCLIP performance while requiring fewer training resources.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benno Krojer, Dheeraj Vattikonda, Luis Lara, Varun Jampani, Eva Portelance, Christopher Pal, Siva Reddy</p>
<p>Abstract: An image editing model should be able to perform diverse edits, ranging from object replacement, changing attributes or style, to performing actions or movement, which require many forms of reasoning. Current general instruction-guided editing models have significant shortcomings with action and reasoning-centric edits. Object, attribute or stylistic changes can be learned from visually static datasets. On the other hand, high-quality data for action and reasoning-centric edits is scarce and has to come from entirely different sources that cover e.g. physical dynamics, temporality and spatial reasoning. To this end, we meticulously curate the AURORA Dataset (Action-Reasoning-Object-Attribute), a collection of high-quality training data, human-annotated and curated from videos and simulation engines. We focus on a key aspect of quality training data: triplets (source image, prompt, target image) contain a single meaningful visual change described by the prompt, i.e., truly minimal changes between source and target images. To demonstrate the value of our dataset, we evaluate an AURORA-finetuned model on a new expert-curated benchmark (AURORA-Bench) covering 8 diverse editing tasks. Our model significantly outperforms previous editing models as judged by human raters. For automatic evaluations, we find important flaws in previous metrics and caution their use for semantically hard editing tasks. Instead, we propose a new automatic metric that focuses on discriminative understanding. We hope that our efforts : (1) curating a quality training dataset and an evaluation benchmark, (2) developing critical evaluations, and (3) releasing a state-of-the-art model, will fuel further progress on general image editing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuang Li, Yibing Wang, Jian Gao, Chulhong Kim, Seongwook Choi, Yu Zhang, Qian Chen, Yao Yao, Changhui Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large-scale photoacoustic (PA) 3D imaging has become increasingly important for both clinical and pre-clinical applications. Limited by resource and application constrains, only sparsely-distributed transducer arrays can be applied, which necessitates advanced image reconstruction algorithms to overcome artifacts caused by using back-projection algorithm. However, high computing memory consumption of traditional iterative algorithms for large-scale 3D cases is practically unacceptable. Here, we propose a point cloud-based iterative algorithm that reduces memory consumption by several orders, wherein a 3D photoacoustic scene is modeled as a series of Gaussian-distributed spherical sources. During the iterative reconstruction process, the properties of each Gaussian source, including peak intensities, standard deviations and means are stored in form of point cloud, then continuously optimized and adaptively undergoing destroying, splitting, and duplication along the gradient direction, thus manifesting the sliding ball adaptive growth effect. This method, named the sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (SlingBAG) algorithm, enables high-quality 3D large-scale PA reconstruction with fast iteration and extremely less memory usage. We validated SlingBAG algorithm in both simulation study and in vivo animal experiments.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study extensively evaluated You Only Look Once (YOLO) object detection algorithms across all configurations (total 22) of YOLOv8, YOLOv9, YOLOv10, and YOLO11 for green fruit detection in commercial orchards. The research also validated in-field fruitlet counting using an iPhone and machine vision sensors across four apple varieties: Scifresh, Scilate, Honeycrisp and Cosmic Crisp. Among the 22 configurations evaluated, YOLO11s and YOLOv9 gelan-base outperformed others with mAP@50 scores of 0.933 and 0.935 respectively. In terms of recall, YOLOv9 gelan-base achieved the highest value among YOLOv9 configurations at 0.899, while YOLO11m led YOLO11 variants with 0.897. YOLO11n emerged as the fastest model, achieving fastest inference speed of only 2.4 ms, significantly outpacing the leading configurations of YOLOv10n, YOLOv9 gelan-s, and YOLOv8n, with speeds of 5.5, 11.5, and 4.1 ms, respectively. This comparative evaluation highlights the strengths of YOLO11, YOLOv9, and YOLOv10, offering researchers essential insights to choose the best-suited model for fruitlet detection and possible automation in commercial orchards.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Praveen Ravirathinam, Ankush Khandelwal, Rahul Ghosh, Vipin Kumar</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, there has been an increased interest in foundation models for geoscience due to the vast amount of Earth observing satellite imagery. Existing remote sensing foundation models make use of the various sources of spectral imagery to create large models pretrained on the task of masked reconstruction. In this paper, we present a foundation model framework, where the pretraining task captures the causal relationship between multiple modalities. Our framework leverages the knowledge guided principles that the spectral imagery captures the impact of the physical drivers on the environmental system, and that the relationship between them is governed by the characteristics of the system. Specifically, our method, called MultiModal Variable Step Forecasting (MM-VSF), uses forecasting of satellite imagery as a pretraining task and is able to capture the causal relationship between spectral imagery and weather. In our evaluation we show that the forecasting of satellite imagery using weather can be used as an effective pretraining task for foundation models. We further show the effectiveness of the embeddings produced by MM-VSF on the downstream tasks of pixel wise crop mapping and missing image prediction of spectral imagery, when compared with embeddings created by models trained in alternative pretraining settings including the traditional single modality input masked reconstruction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunfang Niu, Lingxiang Wu, Dong Yi, Jie Peng, Ning Jiang, Haiying Wu, Jinqiao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Fashion image editing aims to modify a person's appearance based on a given instruction. Existing methods require auxiliary tools like segmenters and keypoint extractors, lacking a flexible and unified framework. Moreover, these methods are limited in the variety of clothing types they can handle, as most datasets focus on people in clean backgrounds and only include generic garments such as tops, pants, and dresses. These limitations restrict their applicability in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we first extend an existing dataset for human generation to include a wider range of apparel and more complex backgrounds. This extended dataset features people wearing diverse items such as tops, pants, dresses, skirts, headwear, scarves, shoes, socks, and bags. Additionally, we propose AnyDesign, a diffusion-based method that enables mask-free editing on versatile areas. Users can simply input a human image along with a corresponding prompt in either text or image format. Our approach incorporates Fashion DiT, equipped with a Fashion-Guidance Attention (FGA) module designed to fuse explicit apparel types and CLIP-encoded apparel features. Both Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method delivers high-quality fashion editing and outperforms contemporary text-guided fashion editing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Songhua Liu, Weihao Yu, Zhenxiong Tan, Xinchao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern diffusion models, particularly those utilizing a Transformer-based UNet for denoising, rely heavily on self-attention operations to manage complex spatial relationships, thus achieving impressive generation performance. However, this existing paradigm faces significant challenges in generating high-resolution visual content due to its quadratic time and memory complexity with respect to the number of spatial tokens. To address this limitation, we aim at a novel linear attention mechanism as an alternative in this paper. Specifically, we begin our exploration from recently introduced models with linear complexity, e.g., Mamba2, RWKV6, Gated Linear Attention, etc, and identify two key features--attention normalization and non-causal inference--that enhance high-resolution visual generation performance. Building on these insights, we introduce a generalized linear attention paradigm, which serves as a low-rank approximation of a wide spectrum of popular linear token mixers. To save the training cost and better leverage pre-trained models, we initialize our models and distill the knowledge from pre-trained StableDiffusion (SD). We find that the distilled model, termed LinFusion, achieves performance on par with or superior to the original SD after only modest training, while significantly reducing time and memory complexity. Extensive experiments on SD-v1.5, SD-v2.1, and SD-XL demonstrate that LinFusion enables satisfactory and efficient zero-shot cross-resolution generation, accommodating ultra-resolution images like 16K on a single GPU. Moreover, it is highly compatible with pre-trained SD components and pipelines, such as ControlNet, IP-Adapter, DemoFusion, DistriFusion, etc, requiring no adaptation efforts.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander Veicht, Paul-Edouard Sarlin, Philipp Lindenberger, Marc Pollefeys</p>
<p>Abstract: From a single image, visual cues can help deduce intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters like the focal length and the gravity direction. This single-image calibration can benefit various downstream applications like image editing and 3D mapping. Current approaches to this problem are based on either classical geometry with lines and vanishing points or on deep neural networks trained end-to-end. The learned approaches are more robust but struggle to generalize to new environments and are less accurate than their classical counterparts. We hypothesize that they lack the constraints that 3D geometry provides. In this work, we introduce GeoCalib, a deep neural network that leverages universal rules of 3D geometry through an optimization process. GeoCalib is trained end-to-end to estimate camera parameters and learns to find useful visual cues from the data. Experiments on various benchmarks show that GeoCalib is more robust and more accurate than existing classical and learned approaches. Its internal optimization estimates uncertainties, which help flag failure cases and benefit downstream applications like visual localization.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhangyue Ling, Pritthijit Nath, C\'esar Quilodr\'an-Casas</p>
<p>Abstract: This study explores the application of diffusion models in the field of typhoons, predicting multiple ERA5 meteorological variables simultaneously from Digital Typhoon satellite images. The focus of this study is taken to be Taiwan, an area very vulnerable to typhoons. By comparing the performance of Conditional Denoising Diffusion Probability Model (CDDPM) with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks (SENet), results suggest that the CDDPM performs best in generating accurate and realistic meteorological data. Specifically, CDDPM achieved a PSNR of 32.807, which is approximately 7.9% higher than CNN and 5.5% higher than SENet. Furthermore, CDDPM recorded an RMSE of 0.032, showing a 11.1% improvement over CNN and 8.6% improvement over SENet. A key application of this research can be for imputation purposes in missing meteorological datasets and generate additional high-quality meteorological data using satellite images. It is hoped that the results of this analysis will enable more robust and detailed forecasting, reducing the impact of severe weather events on vulnerable regions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sikai Yang, Wan Du</p>
<p>Abstract: As human eyes serve as conduits of rich information, unveiling emotions, intentions, and even aspects of an individual's health and overall well-being, gaze tracking also enables various human-computer interaction applications, as well as insights in psychological and medical research. However, existing gaze tracking solutions fall short at handling free user movement, and also require laborious user effort in system calibration. We introduce Tri-Cam, a practical deep learning-based gaze tracking system using three affordable RGB webcams. It features a split network structure for efficient training, as well as designated network designs to handle the separated gaze tracking tasks. Tri-Cam is also equipped with an implicit calibration module, which makes use of mouse click opportunities to reduce calibration overhead on the user's end. We evaluate Tri-Cam against Tobii, the state-of-the-art commercial eye tracker, achieving comparable accuracy, while supporting a wider free movement area. In conclusion, Tri-Cam provides a user-friendly, affordable, and robust gaze tracking solution that could practically enable various applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihao Pan, Weibin Wu, Yuhang Cao, Zibin Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural network based systems deployed in sensitive environments are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Unrestricted adversarial attacks typically manipulate the semantic content of an image (e.g., color or texture) to create adversarial examples that are both effective and photorealistic. Recent works have utilized the diffusion inversion process to map images into a latent space, where high-level semantics are manipulated by introducing perturbations. However, they often results in substantial semantic distortions in the denoised output and suffers from low efficiency. In this study, we propose a novel framework called Semantic-Consistent Unrestricted Adversarial Attacks (SCA), which employs an inversion method to extract edit-friendly noise maps and utilizes Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to provide semantic guidance throughout the process. Under the condition of rich semantic information provided by MLLM, we perform the DDPM denoising process of each step using a series of edit-friendly noise maps, and leverage DPM Solver++ to accelerate this process, enabling efficient sampling with semantic consistency. Compared to existing methods, our framework enables the efficient generation of adversarial examples that exhibit minimal discernible semantic changes. Consequently, we for the first time introduce Semantic-Consistent Adversarial Examples (SCAE). Extensive experiments and visualizations have demonstrated the high efficiency of SCA, particularly in being on average 12 times faster than the state-of-the-art attacks. Our research can further draw attention to the security of multimedia information.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhe Luo, Weina Fu, Shuai Liu, Saeed Anwar, Muhammad Saqib, Sambit Bakshi, Khan Muhammad</p>
<p>Abstract: Action detection and understanding provide the foundation for the generation and interaction of multimedia content. However, existing methods mainly focus on constructing complex relational inference networks, overlooking the judgment of detection effectiveness. Moreover, these methods frequently generate detection results with cognitive abnormalities. To solve the above problems, this study proposes a cognitive effectiveness network based on fuzzy inference (Cefdet), which introduces the concept of "cognition-based detection" to simulate human cognition. First, a fuzzy-driven cognitive effectiveness evaluation module (FCM) is established to introduce fuzzy inference into action detection. FCM is combined with human action features to simulate the cognition-based detection process, which clearly locates the position of frames with cognitive abnormalities. Then, a fuzzy cognitive update strategy (FCS) is proposed based on the FCM, which utilizes fuzzy logic to re-detect the cognition-based detection results and effectively update the results with cognitive abnormalities. Experimental results demonstrate that Cefdet exhibits superior performance against several mainstream algorithms on the public datasets, validating its effectiveness and superiority.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qi Tang, Yao Zhao, Meiqin Liu, Chao Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion-based Video Super-Resolution (VSR) is renowned for generating perceptually realistic videos, yet it grapples with maintaining detail consistency across frames due to stochastic fluctuations. The traditional approach of pixel-level alignment is ineffective for diffusion-processed frames because of iterative disruptions. To overcome this, we introduce SeeClear--a novel VSR framework leveraging conditional video generation, orchestrated by instance-centric and channel-wise semantic controls. This framework integrates a Semantic Distiller and a Pixel Condenser, which synergize to extract and upscale semantic details from low-resolution frames. The Instance-Centric Alignment Module (InCAM) utilizes video-clip-wise tokens to dynamically relate pixels within and across frames, enhancing coherency. Additionally, the Channel-wise Texture Aggregation Memory (CaTeGory) infuses extrinsic knowledge, capitalizing on long-standing semantic textures. Our method also innovates the blurring diffusion process with the ResShift mechanism, finely balancing between sharpness and diffusion effects. Comprehensive experiments confirm our framework's advantage over state-of-the-art diffusion-based VSR techniques. The code is available: https://github.com/Tang1705/SeeClear-NeurIPS24.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weixing Zhang, Zongrui Li, De Ma, Huajin Tang, Xudong Jiang, Qian Zheng, Gang Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting is capable of reconstructing 3D scenes in minutes. Despite recent advances in improving surface reconstruction accuracy, the reconstructed results still exhibit bias and suffer from inefficiency in storage and training. This paper provides a different observation on the cause of the inefficiency and the reconstruction bias, which is attributed to the integration of the low-opacity parts (LOPs) of the generated Gaussians. We show that LOPs consist of Gaussians with overall low-opacity (LOGs) and the low-opacity tails (LOTs) of Gaussians. We propose Spiking GS to reduce such two types of LOPs by integrating spiking neurons into the Gaussian Splatting pipeline. Specifically, we introduce global and local full-precision integrate-and-fire spiking neurons to the opacity and representation function of flattened 3D Gaussians, respectively. Furthermore, we enhance the density control strategy with spiking neurons' thresholds and a new criterion on the scale of Gaussians. Our method can represent more accurate reconstructed surfaces at a lower cost. The supplementary material and code are available at https://github.com/zju-bmi-lab/SpikingGS.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pascal Zwick, Kevin Roesch, Marvin Klemp, Oliver Bringmann</p>
<p>Abstract: Anonymization plays a key role in protecting sensible information of individuals in real world datasets. Self-driving cars for example need high resolution facial features to track people and their viewing direction to predict future behaviour and react accordingly. In order to protect people's privacy whilst keeping important features in the dataset, it is important to replace the full body of a person with a highly detailed anonymized one. In contrast to doing face anonymization, full body replacement decreases the ability of recognizing people by their hairstyle or clothes. In this paper, we propose a workflow for full body person anonymization utilizing Stable Diffusion as a generative backend. Text-to-image diffusion models, like Stable Diffusion, OpenAI's DALL-E or Midjourney, have become very popular in recent time, being able to create photorealistic images from a single text prompt. We show that our method outperforms state-of-the art anonymization pipelines with respect to image quality, resolution, Inception Score (IS) and Frechet Inception Distance (FID). Additionally, our method is invariant with respect to the image generator and thus able to be used with the latest models available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengfei Hu, Yuhang Qian, Tianyue Zheng, Ang Li, Zhe Chen, Yue Gao, Xiuzhen Cheng, Jun Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Given the wide adoption of multimodal sensors (e.g., camera, lidar, radar) by autonomous vehicles (AVs), deep analytics to fuse their outputs for a robust perception become imperative. However, existing fusion methods often make two assumptions rarely holding in practice: i) similar data distributions for all inputs and ii) constant availability for all sensors. Because, for example, lidars have various resolutions and failures of radars may occur, such variability often results in significant performance degradation in fusion. To this end, we present tREADi, an adaptive inference system that accommodates the variability of multimodal sensory data and thus enables robust and efficient perception. t-READi identifies variation-sensitive yet structure-specific model parameters; it then adapts only these parameters while keeping the rest intact. t-READi also leverages a cross-modality contrastive learning method to compensate for the loss from missing modalities. Both functions are implemented to maintain compatibility with existing multimodal deep fusion methods. The extensive experiments evidently demonstrate that compared with the status quo approaches, t-READi not only improves the average inference accuracy by more than 6% but also reduces the inference latency by almost 15x with the cost of only 5% extra memory overhead in the worst case under realistic data and modal variations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kha Nhat Le, Hoang-Tuan Nguyen, Hung Tien Tran, Thanh Duc Ngo</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has become increasingly prevalent in scene text recognition (STR), especially where training and testing data reside in different domains. The efficacy of existing UDA approaches tends to degrade when there is a large gap between the source and target domains. To deal with this problem, gradually shifting or progressively learning to shift from domain to domain is the key issue. In this paper, we introduce the Stratified Domain Adaptation (StrDA) approach, which examines the gradual escalation of the domain gap for the learning process. The objective is to partition the training data into subsets so that the progressively self-trained model can adapt to gradual changes. We stratify the training data by evaluating the proximity of each data sample to both the source and target domains. We propose a novel method for employing domain discriminators to estimate the out-of-distribution and domain discriminative levels of data samples. Extensive experiments on benchmark scene-text datasets show that our approach significantly improves the performance of baseline (source-trained) STR models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Gohar Javed, Chuan Guo, Li Cheng, Xingyu Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating realistic 3D human-human interactions from textual descriptions remains a challenging task. Existing approaches, typically based on diffusion models, often generate unnatural and unrealistic results. In this work, we introduce InterMask, a novel framework for generating human interactions using collaborative masked modeling in discrete space. InterMask first employs a VQ-VAE to transform each motion sequence into a 2D discrete motion token map. Unlike traditional 1D VQ token maps, it better preserves fine-grained spatio-temporal details and promotes spatial awareness within each token. Building on this representation, InterMask utilizes a generative masked modeling framework to collaboratively model the tokens of two interacting individuals. This is achieved by employing a transformer architecture specifically designed to capture complex spatio-temporal interdependencies. During training, it randomly masks the motion tokens of both individuals and learns to predict them. In inference, starting from fully masked sequences, it progressively fills in the tokens for both individuals. With its enhanced motion representation, dedicated architecture, and effective learning strategy, InterMask achieves state-of-the-art results, producing high-fidelity and diverse human interactions. It outperforms previous methods, achieving an FID of $5.154$ (vs $5.535$ for in2IN) on the InterHuman dataset and $0.399$ (vs $5.207$ for InterGen) on the InterX dataset. Additionally, InterMask seamlessly supports reaction generation without the need for model redesign or fine-tuning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Quantitative evaluation of echocardiography is essential for precise assessment of cardiac condition, monitoring disease progression, and guiding treatment decisions. The diverse nature of echo images, including variations in probe types, manufacturers, and pathologies, poses challenges for developing artificial intelligent models that can generalize across different clinical practice. We introduce EchoApex, the first general-purpose vision foundation model echocardiography with applications on a variety of clinical practice. Leveraging self-supervised learning, EchoApex is pretrained on over 20 million echo images from 11 clinical centres. By incorporating task-specific decoders and adapter modules, we demonstrate the effectiveness of EchoApex on 4 different kind of clinical applications with 28 sub-tasks, including view classification, interactive structure segmentation, left ventricle hypertrophy detection and automated ejection fraction estimation from view sequences. Compared to state-of-the-art task-specific models, EchoApex attains improved performance with a unified image encoding architecture, demonstrating the benefits of model pretraining at scale with in-domain data. Furthermore, EchoApex illustrates the potential for developing a general-purpose vision foundation model tailored specifically for echocardiography, capable of addressing a diverse range of clinical applications with high efficiency and efficacy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), equipped with cameras, are employed in numerous applications, including aerial photography, surveillance, and agriculture. In these applications, robust object detection and tracking are essential for the effective deployment of UAVs. However, existing benchmarks for UAV applications are mainly designed for traditional 2D perception tasks, restricting the development of real-world applications that require a 3D understanding of the environment. Furthermore, despite recent advancements in single-UAV perception, limited views of a single UAV platform significantly constrain its perception capabilities over long distances or in occluded areas. To address these challenges, we introduce UAV3D, a benchmark designed to advance research in both 3D and collaborative 3D perception tasks with UAVs. UAV3D comprises 1,000 scenes, each of which has 20 frames with fully annotated 3D bounding boxes on vehicles. We provide the benchmark for four 3D perception tasks: single-UAV 3D object detection, single-UAV object tracking, collaborative-UAV 3D object detection, and collaborative-UAV object tracking.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhimin Chen, Liang Yang, Yingwei Li, Longlong Jing, Bing Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models have significantly enhanced 2D task performance, and recent works like Bridge3D have successfully applied these models to improve 3D scene understanding through knowledge distillation, marking considerable advancements. Nonetheless, challenges such as the misalignment between 2D and 3D representations and the persistent long-tail distribution in 3D datasets still restrict the effectiveness of knowledge distillation from 2D to 3D using foundation models. To tackle these issues, we introduce a novel SAM-guided tokenization method that seamlessly aligns 3D transformer structures with region-level knowledge distillation, replacing the traditional KNN-based tokenization techniques. Additionally, we implement a group-balanced re-weighting strategy to effectively address the long-tail problem in knowledge distillation. Furthermore, inspired by the recent success of masked feature prediction, our framework incorporates a two-stage masked token prediction process in which the student model predicts both the global embeddings and the token-wise local embeddings derived from the teacher models trained in the first stage. Our methodology has been validated across multiple datasets, including SUN RGB-D, ScanNet, and S3DIS, for tasks like 3D object detection and semantic segmentation. The results demonstrate significant improvements over current State-of-the-art self-supervised methods, establishing new benchmarks in this field.</p>

<p>Abstract: Interactive segmentation aims to accurately segment target objects with minimal user interactions. However, current methods often fail to accurately separate target objects from the background, due to a limited understanding of order, the relative depth between objects in a scene. To address this issue, we propose OIS: order-aware interactive segmentation, where we explicitly encode the relative depth between objects into order maps. We introduce a novel order-aware attention, where the order maps seamlessly guide the user interactions (in the form of clicks) to attend to the image features. We further present an object-aware attention module to incorporate a strong object-level understanding to better differentiate objects with similar order. Our approach allows both dense and sparse integration of user clicks, enhancing both accuracy and efficiency as compared to prior works. Experimental results demonstrate that OIS achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving mIoU after one click by 7.61 on the HQSeg44K dataset and 1.32 on the DAVIS dataset as compared to the previous state-of-the-art SegNext, while also doubling inference speed compared to current leading methods.

<p>Abstract: Video-text retrieval has seen significant advancements, yet the ability of models to discern subtle differences in captions still requires verification. In this paper, we introduce a new approach for fine-grained evaluation. Our approach can be applied to existing datasets by automatically generating hard negative test captions with subtle single-word variations across nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and prepositions. We perform comprehensive experiments using four state-of-the-art models across two standard benchmarks (MSR-VTT and VATEX) and two specially curated datasets enriched with detailed descriptions (VLN-UVO and VLN-OOPS), resulting in a number of novel insights: 1) our analyses show that the current evaluation benchmarks fall short in detecting a model's ability to perceive subtle single-word differences, 2) our fine-grained evaluation highlights the difficulty models face in distinguishing such subtle variations. To enhance fine-grained understanding, we propose a new baseline that can be easily combined with current methods. Experiments on our fine-grained evaluations demonstrate that this approach enhances a model's ability to understand fine-grained differences.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arnela Hadzic, Lea Bogensperger, Simon Johannes Joham, Martin Urschler</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning techniques for anatomical landmark localization (ALL) have shown great success, but their reliance on large annotated datasets remains a problem due to the tedious and costly nature of medical data acquisition and annotation. While traditional data augmentation, variational autoencoders (VAEs), and generative adversarial networks (GANs) have already been used to synthetically expand medical datasets, diffusion-based generative models have recently started to gain attention for their ability to generate high-quality synthetic images. In this study, we explore the use of denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) for generating medical images and their corresponding heatmaps of landmarks to enhance the training of a supervised deep learning model for ALL. Our novel approach involves a DDPM with a 2-channel input, incorporating both the original medical image and its heatmap of annotated landmarks. We also propose a novel way to assess the quality of the generated images using a Markov Random Field (MRF) model for landmark matching and a Statistical Shape Model (SSM) to check landmark plausibility, before we evaluate the DDPM-augmented dataset in the context of an ALL task involving hand X-Rays.</p>

<p>Abstract: Anatomical landmarks are vital in medical imaging for navigation and anomaly detection. Modern large language models (LLMs), like Llama-2, offer promise for automating the mapping of these landmarks in free-text radiology reports to corresponding positions in image data. Recent studies propose LLMs may develop coherent representations of generative processes. Motivated by these insights, we investigated whether LLMs accurately represent the spatial positions of anatomical landmarks. Through experiments with Llama-2 models, we found that they can linearly represent anatomical landmarks in space with considerable robustness to different prompts. These results underscore the potential of LLMs to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of medical imaging workflows.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juyoung Yun, Sol Choi, Francois Rameau, Byungkon Kang, Zhoulai Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: With the increasing complexity of machine learning models, managing computational resources like memory and processing power has become a critical concern. Mixed precision techniques, which leverage different numerical precisions during model training and inference to optimize resource usage, have been widely adopted. However, access to hardware that supports lower precision formats (e.g., FP8 or FP4) remains limited, especially for practitioners with hardware constraints. For many with limited resources, the available options are restricted to using 32-bit, 16-bit, or a combination of the two. While it is commonly believed that 16-bit precision can achieve results comparable to full (32-bit) precision, this study is the first to systematically validate this assumption through both rigorous theoretical analysis and extensive empirical evaluation. Our theoretical formalization of floating-point errors and classification tolerance provides new insights into the conditions under which 16-bit precision can approximate 32-bit results. This study fills a critical gap, proving for the first time that standalone 16-bit precision neural networks match 32-bit and mixed-precision in accuracy while boosting computational speed. Given the widespread availability of 16-bit across GPUs, these findings are especially valuable for machine learning practitioners with limited hardware resources to make informed decisions.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper conducts fairness testing of automated pedestrian detection, a crucial but under-explored issue in autonomous driving systems. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art deep learning-based pedestrian detectors across demographic groups on large-scale real-world datasets. To enable thorough fairness testing, we provide extensive annotations for the datasets, resulting in 8,311 images with 16,070 gender labels, 20,115 age labels, and 3,513 skin tone labels. Our findings reveal significant fairness issues, particularly related to age. The proportion of undetected children is 20.14% higher compared to adults. Furthermore, we explore how various driving scenarios affect the fairness of pedestrian detectors. We find that pedestrian detectors demonstrate significant gender biases during night time, potentially exacerbating the prevalent societal issue of female safety concerns during nighttime out. Moreover, we observe that pedestrian detectors can demonstrate both enhanced fairness and superior performance under specific driving conditions, which challenges the fairness-performance trade-off theory widely acknowledged in the fairness literature. We publicly release the code, data, and results to support future research on fairness in autonomous driving.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yixuan Wang, Mingtong Zhang, Zhuoran Li, Tarik Kelestemur, Katherine Driggs-Campbell, Jiajun Wu, Li Fei-Fei, Yunzhu Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Scene representation is a crucial design choice in robotic manipulation systems. An ideal representation is expected to be 3D, dynamic, and semantic to meet the demands of diverse manipulation tasks. However, previous works often lack all three properties simultaneously. In this work, we introduce D$^3$Fields -- dynamic 3D descriptor fields. These fields are implicit 3D representations that take in 3D points and output semantic features and instance masks. They can also capture the dynamics of the underlying 3D environments. Specifically, we project arbitrary 3D points in the workspace onto multi-view 2D visual observations and interpolate features derived from visual foundational models. The resulting fused descriptor fields allow for flexible goal specifications using 2D images with varied contexts, styles, and instances. To evaluate the effectiveness of these descriptor fields, we apply our representation to rearrangement tasks in a zero-shot manner. Through extensive evaluation in real worlds and simulations, we demonstrate that D$^3$Fields are effective for zero-shot generalizable rearrangement tasks. We also compare D$^3$Fields with state-of-the-art implicit 3D representations and show significant improvements in effectiveness and efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Wang, Shangwei Guo, Jialing He, Hangcheng Liu, Tianwei Zhang, Tao Xiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Pre-trained models (PTMs) are widely adopted across various downstream tasks in the machine learning supply chain. Adopting untrustworthy PTMs introduces significant security risks, where adversaries can poison the model supply chain by embedding hidden malicious behaviors (backdoors) into PTMs. However, existing backdoor attacks to PTMs can only achieve partially task-agnostic and the embedded backdoors are easily erased during the fine-tuning process. This makes it challenging for the backdoors to persist and propagate through the supply chain. In this paper, we propose a novel and severer backdoor attack, TransTroj, which enables the backdoors embedded in PTMs to efficiently transfer in the model supply chain. In particular, we first formalize this attack as an indistinguishability problem between poisoned and clean samples in the embedding space. We decompose embedding indistinguishability into pre- and post-indistinguishability, representing the similarity of the poisoned and reference embeddings before and after the attack. Then, we propose a two-stage optimization that separately optimizes triggers and victim PTMs to achieve embedding indistinguishability. We evaluate TransTroj on four PTMs and six downstream tasks. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms SOTA task-agnostic backdoor attacks -- achieving nearly 100\% attack success rate on most downstream tasks -- and demonstrates robustness under various system settings. Our findings underscore the urgent need to secure the model supply chain against such transferable backdoor attacks. The code is available at https://github.com/haowang-cqu/TransTroj .</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kangle Deng, Timothy Omernick, Alexander Weiss, Deva Ramanan, Jun-Yan Zhu, Tinghui Zhou, Maneesh Agrawala</p>
<p>Abstract: Manually creating textures for 3D meshes is time-consuming, even for expert visual content creators. We propose a fast approach for automatically texturing an input 3D mesh based on a user-provided text prompt. Importantly, our approach disentangles lighting from surface material/reflectance in the resulting texture so that the mesh can be properly relit and rendered in any lighting environment. We introduce LightControlNet, a new text-to-image model based on the ControlNet architecture, which allows the specification of the desired lighting as a conditioning image to the model. Our text-to-texture pipeline then constructs the texture in two stages. The first stage produces a sparse set of visually consistent reference views of the mesh using LightControlNet. The second stage applies a texture optimization based on Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) that works with LightControlNet to increase the texture quality while disentangling surface material from lighting. Our algorithm is significantly faster than previous text-to-texture methods, while producing high-quality and relightable textures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shashwat Goel, Ameya Prabhu, Philip Torr, Ponnurangam Kumaraguru, Amartya Sanyal</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine Learning models increasingly face data integrity challenges due to the use of large-scale training datasets drawn from the Internet. We study what model developers can do if they detect that some data was manipulated or incorrect. Such manipulated data can cause adverse effects including vulnerability to backdoored samples, systemic biases, and reduced accuracy on certain input domains. Realistically, all manipulated training samples cannot be identified, and only a small, representative subset of the affected data can be flagged.
  We formalize Corrective Machine Unlearning as the problem of mitigating the impact of data affected by unknown manipulations on a trained model, only having identified a subset of the corrupted data. We demonstrate that the problem of corrective unlearning has significantly different requirements from traditional privacy-oriented unlearning. We find most existing unlearning methods, including retraining-from-scratch without the deletion set, require most of the manipulated data to be identified for effective corrective unlearning. However, one approach, Selective Synaptic Dampening, achieves limited success, unlearning adverse effects with just a small portion of the manipulated samples in our setting, which shows encouraging signs for future progress. We hope our work spurs research towards developing better methods for corrective unlearning and offers practitioners a new strategy to handle data integrity challenges arising from web-scale training.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jin Yang, Peijie Qiu, Yichi Zhang, Daniel S. Marcus, Aristeidis Sotiras</p>
<p>Abstract: Hierarchical transformers have achieved significant success in medical image segmentation due to their large receptive field and capabilities of effectively leveraging global long-range contextual information. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can also deliver a large receptive field by using large kernels, enabling them to achieve competitive performance with fewer model parameters. However, CNNs incorporated with large convolutional kernels remain constrained in adaptively capturing multi-scale features from organs with large variations in shape and size due to the employment of fixed-sized kernels. Additionally, they are unable to utilize global contextual information efficiently. To address these limitations, we propose Dynamic Large Kernel (DLK) and Dynamic Feature Fusion (DFF) modules. The DLK module employs multiple large kernels with varying kernel sizes and dilation rates to capture multi-scale features. Subsequently, a dynamic selection mechanism is utilized to adaptively highlight the most important spatial features based on global information. Additionally, the DFF module is proposed to adaptively fuse multi-scale local feature maps based on their global information. We integrate DLK and DFF in a hierarchical transformer architecture to develop a novel architecture, termed D-Net. D-Net is able to effectively utilize a multi-scale large receptive field and adaptively harness global contextual information. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that D-Net outperforms other state-of-the-art models in the two volumetric segmentation tasks, including abdominal multi-organ segmentation and multi-modality brain tumor segmentation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stefan Gerd Fritsch, Cennet Oguz, Vitor Fortes Rey, Lala Ray, Maximilian Kiefer-Emmanouilidis, Paul Lukowicz</p>
<p>Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a longstanding problem in AI with applications in a broad range of areas, including healthcare, sports and fitness, security, and more. The performance of HAR in real-world settings is strongly dependent on the type and quality of the input signal that can be acquired. Given an unobstructed, high-quality camera view of a scene, computer vision systems, in particular in conjunction with foundation models, can today fairly reliably distinguish complex activities. On the other hand, recognition using modalities such as wearable sensors (which are often more broadly available, e.g., in mobile phones and smartwatches) is a more difficult problem, as the signals often contain less information and labeled training data is more difficult to acquire. To alleviate the need for labeled data, we introduce our comprehensive Fitness Multimodal Activity Dataset (FiMAD) in this work, which can be used with the proposed pre-training method MuJo (Multimodal Joint Feature Space Learning) to enhance HAR performance across various modalities. FiMAD was created using YouTube fitness videos and contains parallel video, language, pose, and simulated IMU sensor data. MuJo utilizes this dataset to learn a joint feature space for these modalities. We show that classifiers pre-trained on FiMAD can increase the performance on real HAR datasets such as MM-Fit, MyoGym, MotionSense, and MHEALTH. For instance, on MM-Fit, we achieve an Macro F1-Score of up to 0.855 when fine-tuning on only 2% of the training data and 0.942 when utilizing the full training set for classification tasks. We have compared our approach to other self-supervised ones and showed that, unlike them, ours can consistently improve on the baseline network performance as well as provide a better data-efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaofeng Zhang, Yihao Quan, Chen Shen, Xiaosong Yuan, Shaotian Yan, Liang Xie, Wenxiao Wang, Chaochen Gu, Hao Tang, Jieping Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) achieve great performance on visual-language reasoning tasks, however, the black-box nature of LVLMs hinders in-depth research on the reasoning mechanism. As all images need to be converted into image tokens to fit the input format of large language models (LLMs) along with natural language prompts, sequential visual representation is essential to the performance of LVLMs, and the information flow analysis approach can be an effective tool for determining interactions between these representations. In this paper, we propose integrating attention analysis with LLaVA-CAM, concretely, attention scores highlight relevant regions during forward propagation, while LLaVA-CAM captures gradient changes through backward propagation, revealing key image features. By exploring the information flow from the perspective of visual representation contribution, we observe that it tends to converge in shallow layers but diversify in deeper layers. To validate our analysis, we conduct comprehensive experiments with truncation strategies across various LVLMs for visual question answering and image captioning tasks, and experimental results not only verify our hypothesis but also reveal a consistent pattern of information flow convergence in the corresponding layers, and the information flow cliff layer will be different due to different contexts.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alex Quach, Makram Chahine, Alexander Amini, Ramin Hasani, Daniela Rus</p>
<p>Abstract: Simulators are powerful tools for autonomous robot learning as they offer scalable data generation, flexible design, and optimization of trajectories. However, transferring behavior learned from simulation data into the real world proves to be difficult, usually mitigated with compute-heavy domain randomization methods or further model fine-tuning. We present a method to improve generalization and robustness to distribution shifts in sim-to-real visual quadrotor navigation tasks. To this end, we first build a simulator by integrating Gaussian Splatting with quadrotor flight dynamics, and then, train robust navigation policies using Liquid neural networks. In this way, we obtain a full-stack imitation learning protocol that combines advances in 3D Gaussian splatting radiance field rendering, crafty programming of expert demonstration training data, and the task understanding capabilities of Liquid networks. Through a series of quantitative flight tests, we demonstrate the robust transfer of navigation skills learned in a single simulation scene directly to the real world. We further show the ability to maintain performance beyond the training environment under drastic distribution and physical environment changes. Our learned Liquid policies, trained on single target manoeuvres curated from a photorealistic simulated indoor flight only, generalize to multi-step hikes onboard a real hardware platform outdoors.</p>

<p>Abstract: Human feedback plays a critical role in learning and refining reward models for text-to-image generation, but the optimal form the feedback should take for learning an accurate reward function has not been conclusively established. This paper investigates the effectiveness of fine-grained feedback which captures nuanced distinctions in image quality and prompt-alignment, compared to traditional coarse-grained feedback (for example, thumbs up/down or ranking between a set of options). While fine-grained feedback holds promise, particularly for systems catering to diverse societal preferences, we show that demonstrating its superiority to coarse-grained feedback is not automatic. Through experiments on real and synthetic preference data, we surface the complexities of building effective models due to the interplay of model choice, feedback type, and the alignment between human judgment and computational interpretation. We identify key challenges in eliciting and utilizing fine-grained feedback, prompting a reassessment of its assumed benefits and practicality. Our findings -- e.g., that fine-grained feedback can lead to worse models for a fixed budget, in some settings; however, in controlled settings with known attributes, fine grained rewards can indeed be more helpful -- call for careful consideration of feedback attributes and potentially beckon novel modeling approaches to appropriately unlock the potential value of fine-grained feedback in-the-wild.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have recently achieved significant progress, demonstrating strong capabilities in open-world visual understanding. However, it is not yet clear how LVLMs address demographic biases in real life, especially the disparities across attributes such as gender, skin tone, age and race. In this paper, We empirically investigate visual fairness in several mainstream LVLMs by auditing their performance disparities across demographic attributes using public fairness benchmark datasets (e.g., FACET, UTKFace). Our fairness evaluation framework employs direct and single-choice question prompt on visual question-answering/classification tasks. Despite advancements in visual understanding, our zero-shot prompting results show that both open-source and closed-source LVLMs continue to exhibit fairness issues across different prompts and demographic groups. Furthermore, we propose a potential multi-modal Chain-of-thought (CoT) based strategy for bias mitigation, applicable to both open-source and closed-source LVLMs. This approach enhances transparency and offers a scalable solution for addressing fairness, providing a solid foundation for future bias reduction efforts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ethan Mendes, Yang Chen, James Hays, Sauvik Das, Wei Xu, Alan Ritter</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are rapidly advancing in their capability to answer information-seeking questions. As these models are widely deployed in consumer applications, they could lead to new privacy risks due to emergent abilities to identify people in photos, geolocate images, etc. As we demonstrate, somewhat surprisingly, current open-source and proprietary VLMs are very capable image geolocators, making widespread geolocation with VLMs an immediate privacy risk, rather than merely a theoretical future concern. As a first step to address this challenge, we develop a new benchmark, GPTGeoChat, to test the ability of VLMs to moderate geolocation dialogues with users. We collect a set of 1,000 image geolocation conversations between in-house annotators and GPT-4v, which are annotated with the granularity of location information revealed at each turn. Using this new dataset, we evaluate the ability of various VLMs to moderate GPT-4v geolocation conversations by determining when too much location information has been revealed. We find that custom fine-tuned models perform on par with prompted API-based models when identifying leaked location information at the country or city level; however, fine-tuning on supervised data appears to be needed to accurately moderate finer granularities, such as the name of a restaurant or building.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peng Xia, Kangyu Zhu, Haoran Li, Hongtu Zhu, Yun Li, Gang Li, Linjun Zhang, Huaxiu Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent emergence of Medical Large Vision Language Models (Med-LVLMs) has enhanced medical diagnosis. However, current Med-LVLMs frequently encounter factual issues, often generating responses that do not align with established medical facts. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which utilizes external knowledge, can improve the factual accuracy of these models but introduces two major challenges. First, limited retrieved contexts might not cover all necessary information, while excessive retrieval can introduce irrelevant and inaccurate references, interfering with the model's generation. Second, in cases where the model originally responds correctly, applying RAG can lead to an over-reliance on retrieved contexts, resulting in incorrect answers. To address these issues, we propose RULE, which consists of two components. First, we introduce a provably effective strategy for controlling factuality risk through the calibrated selection of the number of retrieved contexts. Second, based on samples where over-reliance on retrieved contexts led to errors, we curate a preference dataset to fine-tune the model, balancing its dependence on inherent knowledge and retrieved contexts for generation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RULE on medical VQA and report generation tasks across three datasets, achieving an average improvement of 47.4% in factual accuracy. We publicly release our benchmark and code in https://github.com/richard-peng-xia/RULE.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sikai Yang, Gang Yan, Wan Du</p>
<p>Abstract: Losing track of reading progress during line switching can be frustrating. Eye gaze tracking technology offers a potential solution by highlighting read paragraphs, aiding users in avoiding wrong line switches. However, the gap between gaze tracking accuracy (2-3 cm) and text line spacing (3-5 mm) makes direct application impractical. Existing methods leverage the linear reading pattern but fail during jump reading. This paper presents a reading tracking and highlighting system that supports both linear and jump reading. Based on experimental insights from the gaze nature study of 16 users, two gaze error models are designed to enable both jump reading detection and relocation. The system further leverages the large language model's contextual perception capability in aiding reading tracking. A reading tracking domain-specific line-gaze alignment opportunity is also exploited to enable dynamic and frequent calibration of the gaze results. Controlled experiments demonstrate reliable linear reading tracking, as well as 84% accuracy in tracking jump reading. Furthermore, real field tests with 18 volunteers demonstrated the system's effectiveness in tracking and highlighting read paragraphs, improving reading efficiency, and enhancing user experience.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yidong Zhao, Yi Zhang, Orlando Simonetti, Yuchi Han, Qian Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate biventricular segmentation of cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) cine images is essential for the clinical evaluation of heart function. However, compared to left ventricle (LV), right ventricle (RV) segmentation is still more challenging and less reproducible. Degenerate performance frequently occurs at the RV base, where the in-plane anatomical structures are complex (with atria, valve, and aorta) and vary due to the strong interplanar motion. In this work, we propose to address the currently unsolved issues in CMR segmentation, specifically at the RV base, with two strategies: first, we complemented the public resource by reannotating the RV base in the ACDC dataset, with refined delineation of the right ventricle outflow tract (RVOT), under the guidance of an expert cardiologist. Second, we proposed a novel dual encoder U-Net architecture that leverages temporal incoherence to inform the segmentation when interplanar motions occur. The inter-planar motion is characterized by loss-of-tracking, via Bayesian uncertainty of a motion-tracking model. Our experiments showed that our method significantly improved RV base segmentation taking into account temporal incoherence. Furthermore, we investigated the reproducibility of deep learning-based segmentation and showed that the combination of consistent annotation and loss of tracking could enhance the reproducibility of RV segmentation, potentially facilitating a large number of clinical studies focusing on RV.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhe Wang, Rachid Jennane, Aladine Chetouani, Yung Hsin Chen, Fabian Bauer, Mohamed Jarraya</p>
<p>Abstract: Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a prevalent musculoskeletal disorder, and X-rays are commonly used for its diagnosis due to their cost-effectiveness. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), on the other hand, offers detailed soft tissue visualization and has become a valuable supplementary diagnostic tool for KOA. Unfortunately, the high cost and limited accessibility of MRI hinders its widespread use, leaving many patients with KOA to rely solely on X-ray imaging. In this study, we introduce a novel diffusion-based Xray2MRI model capable of generating pseudo-MRI volumes from a single X-ray image. In addition to using X-rays as conditional input, our model integrates target depth, KOA probability distribution, and image intensity distribution modules to guide the synthesis process, ensuring that the generated corresponding slices accurately correspond to the anatomical structures. Experimental results demonstrate that by integrating information from X-rays with additional input data, our proposed approach is capable of generating pseudo-MRI sequences that approximate real MRI scans. In addition, by increasing the number of inference steps, the model achieves effective interpolation, which further improves the continuity and smoothness of the generated MRI sequences, representing a promising first attempt at cost-effective medical imaging solutions.

<p>Abstract: In the modern world, the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has contributed to improvements in various areas, including automation, computer vision, fraud detection, and more. AI can be leveraged to enhance the efficiency of Autonomous Smart Traffic Management (ASTM) systems and reduce traffic congestion rates. This paper presents an Autonomous Smart Traffic Management (STM) system that uses AI to improve traffic flow rates. The system employs the YOLO V5 Convolutional Neural Network to detect vehicles in traffic management images. Additionally, it predicts the number of vehicles for the next 12 hours using a Recurrent Neural Network with Long Short-Term Memory (RNN-LSTM). The Smart Traffic Management Cycle Length Analysis manages the traffic cycle length based on these vehicle predictions, aided by AI. From the results of the RNN-LSTM model for predicting vehicle numbers over the next 12 hours, we observe that the model predicts traffic with a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 4.521 vehicles and a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 2.232 vehicles. After simulating the STM system in the CARLA simulation environment, we found that the Traffic Management Congestion Flow Rate with ASTM (21 vehicles per minute) is 50\% higher than the rate without STM (around 15 vehicles per minute). Additionally, the Traffic Management Vehicle Pass Delay with STM (5 seconds per vehicle) is 70\% lower than without STM (around 12 seconds per vehicle). These results demonstrate that the STM system using AI can increase traffic flow by 50\% and reduce vehicle pass delays by 70\%.</p>
