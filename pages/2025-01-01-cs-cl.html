<p><b>Authors:</b> Xutao Liao, Shaohui Li, Yuhui Xu, Zhi Li, Yu Liu, You He</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent low-rank training methods, such as GaLore, have significantly reduced the memory required to optimize large language models (LLMs). However, these methods often suffer from time-consuming low-rank projection estimations. In particular, the singular value decomposition (SVD) in GaLore can consume more than 80\% of the total training time. To address this issue, we propose GaLore$+$, which uses cross-head low-rank projection to reduce the substantial time consumption in estimating low-rank projections for multi-head attention. In addition, we employ randomized subspace iteration to achieve fast SVD. To further enhance performance, we propose sparsely coded residuals to reduce the errors caused by low-rank approximation on the first- and second-order moments of the optimizers and weight updates. We evaluate GaLore$+$ on arithmetic reasoning and natural language generation datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that GaLore$+$ delivers superior performance while achieving approximately $4\times$ fine-tuning speed compared to vanilla GaLore.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19906">Evaluate Summarization in Fine-Granularity: Auto Evaluation with LLM</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Dong Yuan, Eti Rastogi, Fen Zhao, Sagar Goyal, Gautam Naik, Sree Prasanna Rajagopal</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to the exponential growth of information and the need for efficient information consumption the task of summarization has gained paramount importance. Evaluating summarization accurately and objectively presents significant challenges, particularly when dealing with long and unstructured texts rich in content. Existing methods, such as ROUGE (Lin, 2004) and embedding similarities, often yield scores that have low correlation with human judgements and are also not intuitively understandable, making it difficult to gauge the true quality of the summaries. LLMs can mimic human in giving subjective reviews but subjective scores are hard to interpret and justify. They can be easily manipulated by altering the models and the tones of the prompts. In this paper, we introduce a novel evaluation methodology and tooling designed to address these challenges, providing a more comprehensive, accurate and interpretable assessment of summarization outputs. Our method (SumAutoEval) proposes and evaluates metrics at varying granularity levels, giving objective scores on 4 key dimensions such as completeness, correctness, Alignment and readability. We empirically demonstrate, that SumAutoEval enhances the understanding of output quality with better human correlation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing by understanding and generating human-like text. However, the increasing demand for more sophisticated LLMs presents significant computational challenges due to their scale and complexity. This paper introduces Hardware Accelerated Decoding (HADES), a novel approach to enhance the performance and energy efficiency of LLMs. We address the design of an LLM accelerator with hardware-level speculative decoding support, a concept not previously explored in existing literature. Our work demonstrates how speculative decoding can significantly improve the efficiency of LLM operations, paving the way for more advanced and practical applications of these models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaqing Yuan, Pradeep K. Murukannaiah, Munindar P. Singh</p>
<p>Abstract: An ethical dilemma describes a choice between two "right" options involving conflicting moral values. We present a comprehensive evaluation of how LLMs navigate ethical dilemmas. Specifically, we investigate LLMs on their (1) sensitivity in comprehending ethical dilemmas, (2) consistency in moral value choice, (3) consideration of consequences, and (4) ability to align their responses to a moral value preference explicitly or implicitly specified in a prompt. Drawing inspiration from a leading ethical framework, we construct a dataset comprising 1,730 ethical dilemmas involving four pairs of conflicting values. We evaluate 20 well-known LLMs from six families. Our experiments reveal that: (1) LLMs exhibit pronounced preferences between major value pairs, and prioritize truth over loyalty, community over individual, and long-term over short-term considerations. (2) The larger LLMs tend to support a deontological perspective, maintaining their choices of actions even when negative consequences are specified. (3) Explicit guidelines are more effective in guiding LLMs' moral choice than in-context examples. Lastly, our experiments highlight the limitation of LLMs in comprehending different formulations of ethical dilemmas.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adamu Gaston Philipo, Doreen Sebastian Sarwatt, Jianguo Ding, Mahmoud Daneshmand, Huansheng Ning</p>
<p>Abstract: Cyberbullying significantly contributes to mental health issues in communities by negatively impacting the psychology of victims. It is a prevalent problem on social media platforms, necessitating effective, real-time detection and monitoring systems to identify harmful messages. However, current cyberbullying detection systems face challenges related to performance, dataset quality, time efficiency, and computational costs. This research aims to conduct a comparative study by adapting and evaluating existing text classification techniques within the cyberbullying detection domain. The study specifically evaluates the effectiveness and performance of these techniques in identifying cyberbullying instances on social media platforms. It focuses on leveraging and assessing large language models, including BERT, RoBERTa, XLNet, DistilBERT, and GPT-2.0, for their suitability in this domain. The results show that BERT strikes a balance between performance, time efficiency, and computational resources: Accuracy of 95%, Precision of 95%, Recall of 95%, F1 Score of 95%, Error Rate of 5%, Inference Time of 0.053 seconds, RAM Usage of 35.28 MB, CPU/GPU Usage of 0.4%, and Energy Consumption of 0.000263 kWh. The findings demonstrate that generative AI models, while powerful, do not consistently outperform fine-tuned models on the tested benchmarks. However, state-of-the-art performance can still be achieved through strategic adaptation and fine-tuning of existing models for specific datasets and tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shrestha Mohanty, Sarah Xuan, Jacob Jobraeel, Anurag Kumar, Deb Roy, Jad Kabbara</p>
<p>Abstract: We focus on enhancing comprehension in small-group recorded conversations, which serve as a medium to bring people together and provide a space for sharing personal stories and experiences on crucial social matters. One way to parse and convey information from these conversations is by sharing highlighted excerpts in subsequent conversations. This can help promote a collective understanding of relevant issues, by highlighting perspectives and experiences to other groups of people who might otherwise be unfamiliar with and thus unable to relate to these experiences. The primary challenge that arises then is that excerpts taken from one conversation and shared in another setting might be missing crucial context or key elements that were previously introduced in the original conversation. This problem is exacerbated when conversations become lengthier and richer in themes and shared experiences. To address this, we explore how Large Language Models (LLMs) can enrich these excerpts by providing socially relevant context. We present approaches for effective contextualization to improve comprehension, readability, and empathy. We show significant improvements in understanding, as assessed through subjective and objective evaluations. While LLMs can offer valuable context, they struggle with capturing key social aspects. We release the Human-annotated Salient Excerpts (HSE) dataset to support future work. Additionally, we show how context-enriched excerpts can provide more focused and comprehensive conversation summaries.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce OneKE, a dockerized schema-guided knowledge extraction system, which can extract knowledge from the Web and raw PDF Books, and support various domains (science, news, etc.). Specifically, we design OneKE with multiple agents and a configure knowledge base. Different agents perform their respective roles, enabling support for various extraction scenarios. The configure knowledge base facilitates schema configuration, error case debugging and correction, further improving the performance. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate OneKE's efficacy, while case studies further elucidate its adaptability to diverse tasks across multiple domains, highlighting its potential for broad applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chencheng Zhu, Kazutaka Shimada, Tomoki Taniguchi, Tomoko Ohkuma</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate the ability to learn in-context, offering a potential solution for scientific information extraction, which often contends with challenges such as insufficient training data and the high cost of annotation processes. Given that the selection of in-context examples can significantly impact performance, it is crucial to design a proper method to sample the efficient ones. In this paper, we propose STAYKATE, a static-dynamic hybrid selection method that combines the principles of representativeness sampling from active learning with the prevalent retrieval-based approach. The results across three domain-specific datasets indicate that STAYKATE outperforms both the traditional supervised methods and existing selection methods. The enhancement in performance is particularly pronounced for entity types that other methods pose challenges.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20057">&quot;My life is miserable, have to sign 500 autographs everyday&quot;: Exposing Humblebragging, the Brags in Disguise</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sharath Naganna, Saprativa Bhattacharjee, Pushpak Bhattacharyya, Biplab Banerjee</p>
<p>Abstract: Humblebragging is a phenomenon where individuals present self-promotional statements under the guise of modesty or complaints. For example, a statement like, "Ugh, I can't believe I got promoted to lead the entire team. So stressful!", subtly highlights an achievement while pretending to be complaining. Detecting humblebragging is important for machines to better understand the nuances of human language, especially in tasks like sentiment analysis and intent recognition. However, this topic has not yet been studied in computational linguistics. For the first time, we introduce the task of automatically detecting humblebragging in text. We formalize the task by proposing a 4-tuple definition of humblebragging and evaluate machine learning, deep learning, and large language models (LLMs) on this task, comparing their performance with humans. We also create and release a dataset called HB24, containing 3,340 humblebrags generated using GPT-4o. Our experiments show that detecting humblebragging is non-trivial, even for humans. Our best model achieves an F1-score of 0.88. This work lays the foundation for further exploration of this nuanced linguistic phenomenon and its integration into broader natural language understanding systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant effectiveness across various NLP tasks, including text ranking. This study assesses the performance of large language models (LLMs) in listwise reranking for limited-resource African languages. We compare proprietary models RankGPT3.5, Rank4o-mini, RankGPTo1-mini and RankClaude-sonnet in cross-lingual contexts. Results indicate that these LLMs significantly outperform traditional baseline methods such as BM25-DT in most evaluation metrics, particularly in nDCG@10 and MRR@100. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs in enhancing reranking tasks for low-resource languages and offer insights into cost-effective solutions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chongjian Yue, Xinrun Xu, Xiaojun Ma, Lun Du, Zhiming Ding, Shi Han, Dongmei Zhang, Qi Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional performance in textual understanding and tabular reasoning tasks. However, their ability to comprehend and analyze hybrid text, containing textual and tabular data, remains unexplored. The hybrid text often appears in the form of hybrid long documents (HLDs), which far exceed the token limit of LLMs. Consequently, we apply an Automated Information Extraction framework (AIE) to enable LLMs to process the HLDs and carry out experiments to analyse four important aspects of information extraction from HLDs. Given the findings: 1) The effective way to select and summarize the useful part of a HLD. 2) An easy table serialization way is enough for LLMs to understand tables. 3) The naive AIE has adaptability in many complex scenarios. 4) The useful prompt engineering to enhance LLMs on HLDs. To address the issue of dataset scarcity in HLDs and support future work, we also propose the Financial Reports Numerical Extraction (FINE) dataset. The dataset and code are publicly available in the attachments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaopeng Feng, Jiayuan Su, Jiamei Zheng, Jiahan Ren, Yan Zhang, Jian Wu, Hongwei Wang, Zuozhu Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have given rise to the LLM-as-a-judge paradigm, showcasing their potential to deliver human-like judgments. However, in the field of machine translation (MT) evaluation, current LLM-as-a-judge methods fall short of learned automatic metrics. In this paper, we propose Multidimensional Multi-Agent Debate (M-MAD), a systematic LLM-based multi-agent framework for advanced LLM-as-a-judge MT evaluation. Our findings demonstrate that M-MAD achieves significant advancements by (1) decoupling heuristic MQM criteria into distinct evaluation dimensions for fine-grained assessments; (2) employing multi-agent debates to harness the collaborative reasoning capabilities of LLMs; (3) synthesizing dimension-specific results into a final evaluation judgment to ensure robust and reliable outcomes. Comprehensive experiments show that M-MAD not only outperforms all existing LLM-as-a-judge methods but also competes with state-of-the-art reference-based automatic metrics, even when powered by a suboptimal model like GPT-4o mini. Detailed ablations and analysis highlight the superiority of our framework design, offering a fresh perspective for LLM-as-a-judge paradigm.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Zhou, Mohsen Mesgar, Annemarie Friedrich, Heike Adel</p>
<p>Abstract: Complex table question answering (TQA) aims to answer questions that require complex reasoning, such as multi-step or multi-category reasoning, over data represented in tabular form. Previous approaches demonstrated notable performance by leveraging either closed-source large language models (LLMs) or fine-tuned open-weight LLMs. However, fine-tuning LLMs requires high-quality training data, which is costly to obtain, and utilizing closed-source LLMs poses accessibility challenges and leads to reproducibility issues. In this paper, we propose Multi-Agent Collaboration with Tool use (MACT), a framework that requires neither closed-source models nor fine-tuning. In MACT, a planning agent and a coding agent that also make use of tools collaborate to answer questions. Our experiments on four TQA benchmarks show that MACT outperforms previous SoTA systems on three out of four benchmarks and that it performs comparably to the larger and more expensive closed-source model GPT-4 on two benchmarks, even when using only open-weight models without any fine-tuning. We conduct extensive analyses to prove the effectiveness of MACT's multi-agent collaboration in TQA.</p>

<p>Abstract: Question answering systems provide short, precise, and specific answers to questions. So far, many robust question answering systems have been developed for English, while some languages with fewer resources, like Persian, have few numbers of standard dataset. In this study, a comprehensive open-domain dataset is presented for Persian. This dataset is called NextQuAD and has 7,515 contexts, including 23,918 questions and answers. Then, a BERT-based question answering model has been applied to this dataset using two pre-trained language models, including ParsBERT and XLM-RoBERTa. The results of these two models have been ensembled using mean logits. Evaluation on the development set shows 0.95 Exact Match (EM) and 0.97 Fl_score. Also, to compare the NextQuAD with other Persian datasets, our trained model on the NextQuAD, is evaluated on two other datasets named PersianQA and ParSQuAD. Comparisons show that the proposed model increased EM by 0.39 and 0.14 respectively in PersianQA and ParSQuAD-manual, while a slight EM decline of 0.007 happened in ParSQuAD-automatic.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guneesh Vats, Priyanka Srivastava, Chiranjeevi Yarra</p>
<p>Abstract: The current study examines the relationship between self-reported depression and the perception of affective speech within the Indian population. PANAS and PHQ-9 were used to assess current mood and depression, respectively. Participants' emotional reactivity was recorded on a valence and arousal scale against the affective speech audio presented in a sequence. No significant differences between the depression and no-depression groups were observed for any of the emotional stimuli, except the audio file depicting neutral emotion. Significantly higher PANAS scores by the depression than the no-depression group indicate the impact of pre-disposed mood on the current mood status. Contrary to previous findings, this study did not observe reduced positive emotional reactivity by the depression group. However, the results demonstrated consistency in emotional reactivity for speech stimuli depicting sadness and anger across all measures of emotion perception.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuguang Chen, Guang Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in various natural language processing tasks but face challenges in mathematical reasoning, where complex problem-solving requires both linguistic understanding and mathematical reasoning skills. Existing approaches to address this challenge often rely on ensemble methods and suffer from the problem of data scarcity in target domains. In this work, we present a novel method to enhance LLMs' capabilities in mathematical reasoning tasks. Motivated by the need to bridge this gap, our approach incorporates a question paraphrase strategy, which aims at diversifying the linguistic forms of mathematical questions to improve generalization. Additionally, specialized training objectives are employed to guide the model's learning process, focusing on enhancing its understanding of mathematical concepts and reasoning processes. We conduct experiments on four datasets using different LLMs, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving LLMs' performance on mathematical reasoning tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qing Zong, Zhaowei Wang, Tianshi Zheng, Xiyu Ren, Yangqiu Song</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid development of LLMs has sparked extensive research into their factual knowledge. Current works claim that LLMs fall short on questions requiring less frequent knowledge. However, their proof is incomplete since they only study the influence of entity frequency, which can not fully represent knowledge frequency. So we introduce ComparisonQA benchmark, containing 283K abstract questions, each instantiated by a pair of high-frequency and low-frequency entities. It ensures a controllable comparison because the difference of knowledge frequency between such a pair is only related to entity frequency. In addition, to avoid possible semantic shortcuts, which is a severe problem of current LLMs study, we design a two-round method for knowledge robustness measurement utilizing both correctness and uncertainty. Experiments reveal that LLMs exhibit particularly low robustness regarding low-frequency knowledge, and GPT-4o is even the worst under this measurement. Besides, we introduce an automatic method to filter out questions with low-quality and shortcuts to form ComparisonQA-Hard. We find that uncertainty effectively identifies such questions while maintaining the data size.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20264">Scoring with Large Language Models: A Study on Measuring Empathy of Responses in Dialogues</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Henry J. Xie, Jinghan Zhang, Xinhao Zhang, Kunpeng Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly more powerful in their ability to complete complex tasks. One such task in which LLMs are often employed is scoring, i.e., assigning a numerical value from a certain scale to a subject. In this paper, we strive to understand how LLMs score, specifically in the context of empathy scoring. We develop a novel and comprehensive framework for investigating how effective LLMs are at measuring and scoring empathy of responses in dialogues, and what methods can be employed to deepen our understanding of LLM scoring. Our strategy is to approximate the performance of state-of-the-art and fine-tuned LLMs with explicit and explainable features. We train classifiers using various features of dialogues including embeddings, the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI) Code, a set of explicit subfactors of empathy as proposed by LLMs, and a combination of the MITI Code and the explicit subfactors. Our results show that when only using embeddings, it is possible to achieve performance close to that of generic LLMs, and when utilizing the MITI Code and explicit subfactors scored by an LLM, the trained classifiers can closely match the performance of fine-tuned LLMs. We employ feature selection methods to derive the most crucial features in the process of empathy scoring. Our work provides a new perspective toward understanding LLM empathy scoring and helps the LLM community explore the potential of LLM scoring in social science studies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Binwei Yao, Zefan Cai, Yun-Shiuan Chuang, Shanglin Yang, Ming Jiang, Diyi Yang, Junjie Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Preferences within a group of people are not uniform but follow a distribution. While existing alignment methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) attempt to steer models to reflect human preferences, they struggle to capture the distributional pluralistic preferences within a group. These methods often skew toward dominant preferences, overlooking the diversity of opinions, especially when conflicting preferences arise. To address this issue, we propose Group Distribution Preference Optimization (GDPO), a novel framework that aligns language models with the distribution of preferences within a group by incorporating the concept of beliefs that shape individual preferences. GDPO calibrates a language model using statistical estimation of the group's belief distribution and aligns the model with belief-conditioned preferences, offering a more inclusive alignment framework than traditional methods. In experiments using both synthetic controllable opinion generation and real-world movie review datasets, we show that DPO fails to align with the targeted belief distributions, while GDPO consistently reduces this alignment gap during training. Moreover, our evaluation metrics demonstrate that GDPO outperforms existing approaches in aligning with group distributional preferences, marking a significant advance in pluralistic alignment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shintaro Ozaki, Yuta Kato, Siyuan Feng, Masayo Tomita, Kazuki Hayashi, Ryoma Obara, Masafumi Oyamada, Katsuhiko Hayashi, Hidetaka Kamigaito, Taro Watanabe</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) complements the knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging external information to enhance response accuracy for queries. This approach is widely applied in several fields by taking its advantage of injecting the most up-to-date information, and researchers are focusing on understanding and improving this aspect to unlock the full potential of RAG in such high-stakes applications. However, despite the potential of RAG to address these needs, the mechanisms behind the confidence levels of its outputs remain underexplored, although the confidence of information is very critical in some domains, such as finance, healthcare, and medicine. Our study focuses the impact of RAG on confidence within the medical domain under various configurations and models. We evaluate confidence by treating the model's predicted probability as its output and calculating Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Adaptive Calibration Error (ACE) scores based on the probabilities and accuracy. In addition, we analyze whether the order of retrieved documents within prompts calibrates the confidence. Our findings reveal large variation in confidence and accuracy depending on the model, settings, and the format of input prompts. These results underscore the necessity of optimizing configurations based on the specific model and conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sanjay Chouhan, Shubha Brata Nath, Aparajita Dutta</p>
<p>Abstract: The advancements in the Large Language Model (LLM) have helped in solving several problems related to language processing. Most of the researches have focused on the English language only, because of its popularity and abundance on the internet. However, a high-performance language model for Hindi and other Indic languages is lacking in the literature. In this work, we have pre-trained two autoregressive LLM models for the Hindi language, namely HindiLLM-Small and HindiLLM-Medium. We use a two-step process comprising unsupervised pre-training and supervised fine-tuning. First, we create a large and high-quality text corpus for unsupervised pre-training. Next, we train a Byte-Pair Encoding, named HindiLLM tokenizer, using the pre-training text data. We then perform training on the unlabeled data, known as the pre-training step, to get the HindiLLM base models. Furthermore, we perform fine-tuning of the HindiLLM base models for different tasks like sentiment analysis, text classification, natural language inference, and multiple choice question-answer on popular labeled datasets to measure the real-world performance. The evaluation shows that the HindiLLM-based fine-tuned models outperform several models in most of the language related tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cheng Yang, Chufan Shi, Siheng Li, Bo Shui, Yujiu Yang, Wai Lam</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities across a myriad of tasks, yet they occasionally yield undesirable outputs. We posit that these limitations are rooted in the foundational autoregressive architecture of LLMs, which inherently lacks mechanisms for differentiating between desirable and undesirable results. Drawing inspiration from the dual-process theory of human cognition, we introduce LLM2, a novel framework that combines an LLM (System 1) with a process-based verifier (System 2). Within LLM2, the LLM is responsible for generating plausible candidates, while the verifier provides timely process-based feedback to distinguish desirable and undesirable outputs. The verifier is trained with a pairwise comparison loss on synthetic process-supervision data generated through our token quality exploration strategy. Empirical results on mathematical reasoning benchmarks substantiate the efficacy of LLM2, exemplified by an accuracy enhancement from 50.3 to 57.8 (+7.5) for Llama3-1B on GSM8K. Furthermore, when combined with self-consistency, LLM2 achieves additional improvements, boosting major@20 accuracy from 56.2 to 70.2 (+14.0).</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20382">Natural Language Fine-Tuning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jia Liu, Yue Wang, Zhiqi Lin, Min Chen, Yixue Hao, Long Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language model fine-tuning techniques typically depend on extensive labeled data, external guidance, and feedback, such as human alignment, scalar rewards, and demonstration. However, in practical application, the scarcity of specific knowledge poses unprecedented challenges to existing fine-tuning techniques. In this paper, focusing on fine-tuning tasks in specific domains with limited data, we introduce Natural Language Fine-Tuning (NLFT), which utilizes natural language for fine-tuning for the first time. By leveraging the strong language comprehension capability of the target LM, NLFT attaches the guidance of natural language to the token-level outputs. Then, saliency tokens are identified with calculated probabilities. Since linguistic information is effectively utilized in NLFT, our proposed method significantly reduces training costs. It markedly enhances training efficiency, comprehensively outperforming reinforcement fine-tuning algorithms in accuracy, time-saving, and resource conservation. Additionally, on the macro level, NLFT can be viewed as a token-level fine-grained optimization of SFT, thereby efficiently replacing the SFT process without the need for warm-up (as opposed to ReFT requiring multiple rounds of warm-up with SFT). Compared to SFT, NLFT does not increase the algorithmic complexity, maintaining O(n). Extensive experiments on the GSM8K dataset demonstrate that NLFT, with only 50 data instances, achieves an accuracy increase that exceeds SFT by 219%. Compared to ReFT, the time complexity and space complexity of NLFT are reduced by 78.27% and 92.24%, respectively. The superior technique of NLFT is paving the way for the deployment of various innovative LLM fine-tuning applications when resources are limited at network edges.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zibin Pan, Shuwen Zhang, Yuesheng Zheng, Chi Li, Yuheng Cheng, Junhua Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine unlearning in the domain of large language models (LLMs) has attracted great attention recently, which aims to effectively eliminate undesirable behaviors from LLMs without full retraining from scratch. In this paper, we explore the Gradient Ascent (GA) approach in LLM unlearning, which is a proactive way to decrease the prediction probability of the model on the target data in order to remove their influence. We analyze two challenges that render the process impractical: gradient explosion and catastrophic forgetting. To address these issues, we propose Multi-Objective Large Language Model Unlearning (MOLLM) algorithm. We first formulate LLM unlearning as a multi-objective optimization problem, in which the cross-entropy loss is modified to the unlearning version to overcome the gradient explosion issue. A common descent update direction is then calculated, which enables the model to forget the target data while preserving the utility of the LLM. Our empirical results verify that MoLLM outperforms the SOTA GA-based LLM unlearning methods in terms of unlearning effect and model utility preservation.</p>

<p>Abstract: The integration of advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) methodologies and Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly enhanced the extraction and analysis of geospatial data from multilingual texts, impacting sectors such as national and international security. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of leading NLP models -- SpaCy, XLM-RoBERTa, mLUKE, GeoLM -- and LLMs, specifically OpenAI's GPT 3.5 and GPT 4, within the context of multilingual geo-entity detection. Utilizing datasets from Telegram channels in English, Russian, and Arabic, we examine the performance of these models through metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores, to assess their effectiveness in accurately identifying geospatial references. The analysis exposes each model's distinct advantages and challenges, underscoring the complexities involved in achieving precise geo-entity identification across varied linguistic landscapes. The conclusions drawn from this experiment aim to direct the enhancement and creation of more advanced and inclusive NLP tools, thus advancing the field of geospatial analysis and its application to global security.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pratik Rakesh Singh, Mohammadi Zaki, Pankaj Wasnik</p>
<p>Abstract: We address the challenging task of neural machine translation (NMT) in the entertainment domain, where the objective is to automatically translate a given dialogue from a source language content to a target language. This task has various applications, particularly in automatic dubbing, subtitling, and other content localization tasks, enabling source content to reach a wider audience. Traditional NMT systems typically translate individual sentences in isolation, without facilitating knowledge transfer of crucial elements such as the context and style from previously encountered sentences. In this work, we emphasize the significance of these fundamental aspects in producing pertinent and captivating translations. We demonstrate their significance through several examples and propose a novel framework for entertainment translation, which, to our knowledge, is the first of its kind. Furthermore, we introduce an algorithm to estimate the context and style of the current session and use these estimations to generate a prompt that guides a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate high-quality translations. Our method is both language and LLM-agnostic, making it a general-purpose tool. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm through various numerical studies and observe significant improvement in the COMET scores over various state-of-the-art LLMs. Moreover, our proposed method consistently outperforms baseline LLMs in terms of win-ratio.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander Blatt, Dietrich Klakow</p>
<p>Abstract: Operational machine-learning based assistant systems must be robust in a wide range of scenarios. This hold especially true for the air-traffic control (ATC) domain. The robustness of an architecture is particularly evident in edge cases, such as high word error rate (WER) transcripts resulting from noisy ATC recordings or partial transcripts due to clipped recordings. To increase the edge-case robustness of call-sign recognition and understanding (CRU), a core tasks in ATC speech processing, we propose the multimodal call-sign-command recovery model (CCR). The CCR architecture leads to an increase in the edge case performance of up to 15%. We demonstrate this on our second proposed architecture, CallSBERT. A CRU model that has less parameters, can be fine-tuned noticeably faster and is more robust during fine-tuning than the state of the art for CRU. Furthermore, we demonstrate that optimizing for edge cases leads to a significantly higher accuracy across a wide operational range.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yao Tong, Weijun Li, Xuanli He, Haolan Zhan, Qiongkai Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: The success of DNNs often depends on training with large-scale datasets, but building such datasets is both expensive and challenging. Consequently, public datasets from open-source platforms like HuggingFace have become popular, posing significant risks of data poisoning attacks. Existing backdoor defenses in NLP primarily focus on identifying and removing poisoned samples; however, purifying a backdoored model with these sample-cleaning approaches typically requires expensive retraining. Therefore, we propose Greedy Module Substitution (GMS), which identifies and substitutes ''deadwood'' modules (i.e., components critical to backdoor pathways) in a backdoored model to purify it. Our method relaxes the common dependency of prior model purification methods on clean datasets or clean auxiliary models. When applied to RoBERTa-large under backdoor attacks, GMS demonstrates strong effectiveness across various settings, particularly against widely recognized challenging attacks like LWS, achieving a post-purification attack success rate (ASR) of 9.7% on SST-2 compared to 58.8% for the best baseline approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Palash Nandi, Shivam Sharma, Tanmoy Chakraborty</p>
<p>Abstract: Memes act as cryptic tools for sharing sensitive ideas, often requiring contextual knowledge to interpret. This makes moderating multimodal memes challenging, as existing works either lack high-quality datasets on nuanced hate categories or rely on low-quality social media visuals. Here, we curate two novel multimodal hate speech datasets, MHS and MHS-Con, that capture fine-grained hateful abstractions in regular and confounding scenarios, respectively. We benchmark these datasets against several competing baselines. Furthermore, we introduce SAFE-MEME (Structured reAsoning FramEwork), a novel multimodal Chain-of-Thought-based framework employing Q&A-style reasoning (SAFE-MEME-QA) and hierarchical categorization (SAFE-MEME-H) to enable robust hate speech detection in memes. SAFE-MEME-QA outperforms existing baselines, achieving an average improvement of approximately 5% and 4% on MHS and MHS-Con, respectively. In comparison, SAFE-MEME-H achieves an average improvement of 6% in MHS while outperforming only multimodal baselines in MHS-Con. We show that fine-tuning a single-layer adapter within SAFE-MEME-H outperforms fully fine-tuned models in regular fine-grained hateful meme detection. However, the fully fine-tuning approach with a Q&A setup is more effective for handling confounding cases. We also systematically examine the error cases, offering valuable insights into the robustness and limitations of the proposed structured reasoning framework for analyzing hateful memes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chong Liu, Zaiwen Feng, Lin Liu, Zhenyun Deng, Jiuyong Li, Ruifang Zhai, Debo Cheng, Li Qin</p>
<p>Abstract: Plausibility Estimation (PE) plays a crucial role for enabling language models to objectively comprehend the real world. While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in PE tasks but sometimes produce trivial commonsense errors due to the complexity of commonsense knowledge. They lack two key traits of an ideal PE model: a) Language-explainable: relying on critical word segments for decisions, and b) Commonsense-sensitive: detecting subtle linguistic variations in commonsense. To address these issues, we propose a novel model-agnostic method, referred to as Commonsense Counterfactual Samples Generating (CCSG). By training PE models with CCSG, we encourage them to focus on critical words, thereby enhancing both their language-explainable and commonsense-sensitive capabilities. Specifically, CCSG generates counterfactual samples by strategically replacing key words and introducing low-level dropout within sentences. These counterfactual samples are then incorporated into a sentence-level contrastive training framework to further enhance the model's learning process. Experimental results across nine diverse datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CCSG in addressing commonsense reasoning challenges, with our CCSG method showing 3.07% improvement against the SOTA methods.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20584">Towards Neural No-Resource Language Translation: A Comparative Evaluation of Approaches</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Madhavendra Thakur</p>
<p>Abstract: No-resource languages - those with minimal or no digital representation - pose unique challenges for machine translation (MT). Unlike low-resource languages, which rely on limited but existent corpora, no-resource languages often have fewer than 100 sentences available for training. This work explores the problem of no-resource translation through three distinct workflows: fine-tuning of translation-specific models, in-context learning with large language models (LLMs) using chain-of-reasoning prompting, and direct prompting without reasoning. Using Owens Valley Paiute as a case study, we demonstrate that no-resource translation demands fundamentally different approaches from low-resource scenarios, as traditional approaches to machine translation, such as those that work for low-resource languages, fail. Empirical results reveal that, although traditional approaches fail, the in-context learning capabilities of general-purpose large language models enable no-resource language translation that outperforms low-resource translation approaches and rivals human translations (BLEU 0.45-0.6); specifically, chain-of-reasoning prompting outperforms other methods for larger corpora, while direct prompting exhibits advantages in smaller datasets. As these approaches are language-agnostic, they have potential to be generalized to translation tasks from a wide variety of no-resource languages without expert input. These findings establish no-resource translation as a distinct paradigm requiring innovative solutions, providing practical and theoretical insights for language preservation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dmitri Roussinov, Serge Sharoff, Nadezhda Puchnina</p>
<p>Abstract: This study demonstrates that the modern generation of Large Language Models (LLMs, such as GPT-4) suffers from the same out-of-domain (OOD) performance gap observed in prior research on pre-trained Language Models (PLMs, such as BERT). We demonstrate this across two non-topical classification tasks: 1) genre classification and 2) generated text detection. Our results show that when demonstration examples for In-Context Learning (ICL) come from one domain (e.g., travel) and the system is tested on another domain (e.g., history), classification performance declines significantly.
  To address this, we introduce a method that controls which predictive indicators are used and which are excluded during classification. For the two tasks studied here, this ensures that topical features are omitted, while the model is guided to focus on stylistic rather than content-based attributes. This approach reduces the OOD gap by up to 20 percentage points in a few-shot setup. Straightforward Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods, used as the baseline, prove insufficient, while our approach consistently enhances domain transfer performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present GliLem -- a novel hybrid lemmatization system for Estonian that enhances the highly accurate rule-based morphological analyzer Vabamorf with an external disambiguation module based on GliNER -- an open vocabulary NER model that is able to match text spans with text labels in natural language. We leverage the flexibility of a pre-trained GliNER model to improve the lemmatization accuracy of Vabamorf by 10\% compared to its original disambiguation module and achieve an improvement over the token classification-based baseline. To measure the impact of improvements in lemmatization accuracy on the information retrieval downstream task, we first created an information retrieval dataset for Estonian by automatically translating the DBpedia-Entity dataset from English. We benchmark several token normalization approaches, including lemmatization, on the created dataset using the BM25 algorithm. We observe a substantial improvement in IR metrics when using lemmatization over simplistic stemming. The benefits of improving lemma disambiguation accuracy manifest in small but consistent improvement in the IR recall measure, especially in the setting of high k.</p>

This has made knowledge editing in large language models increasingly important. However, existing knowledge editing methods face several challenges, including parameter localization coupling, imprecise localization, and a lack of dynamic interaction across layers. In this paper, we propose a novel knowledge editing method called Knowledge Neuronal Ensemble (KNE). A knowledge neuronal ensemble represents a group of neurons encoding specific knowledge, thus mitigating the issue of frequent parameter modification caused by coupling in parameter localization. The KNE method enhances the precision and accuracy of parameter localization by computing gradient attribution scores for each parameter at each layer. During the editing process, only the gradients and losses associated with the knowledge neuronal ensemble are computed, with error backpropagation performed accordingly, ensuring dynamic interaction and collaborative updates among parameters. Experimental results on three widely used knowledge editing datasets show that the KNE method significantly improves the accuracy of knowledge editing and achieves, or even exceeds, the performance of the best baseline methods in portability and locality metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingyun Jin, Xiaohui Song, Feng Zhou, Zengchang Qin</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models have been shown to perform well on a variety of natural language processing problems. However, as the model size and the input sequence's length increase, the rapid increase of KV Cache significantly slows down inference speed. Therefore GQA model, as an alternative to MHA model, has been widely introduced into LLMs. In this work, we propose a low-cost method for pruning MHA models into GQA models with any compression ratio of key-value heads. Our method is based on $\mathit{L_0}$ masks to gradually remove redundant parameters. In addition, we apply orthogonal transformations to attention heads without changing the model to increase similarity between attention heads before pruning training, in order to further improve performance of the model. Our method can be compatible with rotary position embedding (RoPE), which means the model after training can be fully adapted to the mainstream standard GQA framework. Experiments demonstrate that our strategy can compress up to 87.5% of key-value heads of the LLaMA2-7B model without too much performance degradation, just achieved through supervised fine-tuning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tomasz Rutowski, Elizabeth Shriberg, Amir Harati, Yang Lu, Piotr Chlebek, Ricardo Oliveira</p>
<p>Abstract: Digital screening and monitoring applications can aid providers in the management of behavioral health conditions. We explore deep language models for detecting depression, anxiety, and their co-occurrence from conversational speech collected during 16k user interactions with an application. Labels come from PHQ-8 and GAD-7 results also collected by the application. We find that results for binary classification range from 0.86 to 0.79 AUC, depending on condition and co-occurrence. Best performance is achieved when a user has either both or neither condition, and we show that this result is not attributable to data skew. Finally, we find evidence suggesting that underlying word sequence cues may be more salient for depression than for anxiety.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huihan Li, Arnav Goel, Keyu He, Xiang Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: In open-ended generative tasks like narrative writing or dialogue, large language models often exhibit cultural biases, showing limited knowledge and generating templated outputs for less prevalent cultures. Recent works show that these biases may stem from uneven cultural representation in pretraining corpora. This work investigates how pretraining leads to biased culture-conditioned generations by analyzing how models associate entities with cultures based on pretraining data patterns. We propose the MEMOed framework (MEMOrization from pretraining document) to determine whether a generation for a culture arises from memorization. Using MEMOed on culture-conditioned generations about food and clothing for 110 cultures, we find that high-frequency cultures in pretraining data yield more generations with memorized symbols, while some low-frequency cultures produce none. Additionally, the model favors generating entities with extraordinarily high frequency regardless of the conditioned culture, reflecting biases toward frequent pretraining terms irrespective of relevance. We hope that the MEMOed framework and our insights will inspire more works on attributing model performance on pretraining data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianfei Zhang, Jun Bai, Bei Li, Yanmeng Wang, Rumei Li, Chenghua Lin, Wenge Rong</p>
<p>Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with general human preferences has been proved crucial in improving the interaction quality between LLMs and human. However, human values are inherently diverse among different individuals, making it insufficient to align LLMs solely with general preferences. To address this, personalizing LLMs according to individual feedback emerges as a promising solution. Nonetheless, this approach presents challenges in terms of the efficiency of alignment algorithms. In this work, we introduce a flexible paradigm for individual preference alignment. Our method fundamentally improves efficiency by disentangling preference representation from text generation in LLMs. We validate our approach across multiple text generation tasks and demonstrate that it can produce aligned quality as well as or better than PEFT-based methods, while reducing additional training time for each new individual preference by $80\%$ to $90\%$ in comparison with them.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingjian Tao, Yiwei Wang, Yujun Cai, Zhicheng Yang, Jing Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise as potential knowledge bases, yet they often struggle with question-answering tasks and are prone to hallucinations. While previous research attributes these issues to knowledge gaps in the model's parameters, our investigation reveals a different phenomenon: LLMs often retain correct knowledge even when generating incorrect answers. Through analysis of model's internal representations, we find that correct answers frequently appear among high-probability tokens despite not being selected as final outputs. Based on this observation, we introduce Hits@k, a new metric to assess knowledge retention independent of expression accuracy. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that LLMs store significantly more knowledge than their QA performance suggests. Building on these findings, we develop SkipUnsure, a method to improve answer accuracy by leveraging detected but unexpressed knowledge. Experiments on both open-domain and specific-domain datasets show consistent improvements, with accuracy gains of up to 11.8% on DBPedia and 6.3% on IMDB, without requiring model retraining.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sergio Bermejo</p>
<p>Abstract: This work proposes a novel approach to enhancing annotated bibliography generation through Large Language Model (LLM) ensembles. In particular, multiple LLMs in different roles -- controllable text generation, evaluation, and summarization -- are introduced and validated using a systematic methodology to enhance model performance in scholarly tasks. Output diversity among the ensemble that generates text is obtained using different LLM parameters, followed by an LLM acting as a judge to assess relevance, accuracy, and coherence. Responses selected by several combining strategies are then merged and refined through summarization and redundancy removal techniques. The preliminary experimental validation demonstrates that the combined outputs from the LLM ensemble improve coherence and relevance compared to individual responses, leading to a 38% improvement in annotation quality and a 51% reduction in content redundancy, thus highlighting the potential for automating complex scholarly tasks while maintaining high-quality standards.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaolin Hu, Xiang Cheng, Peiyu Liu, Wei Liu, Jian Luan, Bin Wang, Yong Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) reduces the computational and memory demands of fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) by approximating updates with low-rank matrices. However, low-rank approximation in two-dimensional space fails to capture high-dimensional structures within the target matrix. Recently, tensor decomposition methods have been explored for fine-tuning LLMs, leveraging their ability to extract structured information. Yet, these approaches primarily rely on random initialization, and the impact of initialization on tensor adaptation remains underexplored. In this paper, we reveal that random initialization significantly diverges from the validation loss achieved by full fine-tuning. To address this, we propose Weight-Decomposed Tensor Adaptation (DoTA), which leverages the Matrix Product Operator (MPO) decomposition of pre-trained weights for effective initialization in fine-tuning LLMs. Additionally, we introduce QDoTA, a quantized version of DoTA designed for 4-bit quantization. Experiments on commonsense and arithmetic reasoning tasks show that DoTA outperforms random initialization methods with fewer parameters. QDoTA further reduces memory consumption and achieves comparable performance to DoTA on commonsense reasoning tasks. We will release our code to support future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siyuan Fang, Kaijing Ma, Tianyu Zheng, Xinrun Du, Ningxuan Lu, Ge Zhang, Qingkun Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional performance across a variety of tasks, yet they are often affected by hallucinations and the timeliness of knowledge. Leveraging knowledge graphs (KGs) as external knowledge sources has emerged as a viable solution, but existing methods for LLM-based knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) are often limited by step-by-step decision-making on KGs, restricting the global planning and reasoning capabilities of LLMs, or they require fine-tuning or pre-training on specific KGs. To address these challenges, we propose Knowledge graph Assisted Reasoning Path Aggregation (KARPA), a novel framework that harnesses the global planning abilities of LLMs for efficient and accurate KG reasoning. KARPA operates in three steps: pre-planning relation paths using the LLM's global planning capabilities, matching semantically relevant paths via an embedding model, and reasoning over these paths to generate answers. Unlike existing KGQA methods, KARPA avoids stepwise traversal, requires no additional training, and is adaptable to various LLM architectures. Extensive experimental results show that KARPA achieves state-of-the-art performance in KGQA tasks, delivering both high efficiency and accuracy. Our code will be available on Github.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, preference optimization methods such as DPO have significantly enhanced large language models (LLMs) in wide tasks including dialogue and question-answering. However, current methods fail to account for the varying difficulty levels of training samples during preference optimization, leading to mediocre performance in tasks with high accuracy requirements, particularly in mathematical reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose a novel training framework, which employs multiple sampling to analyze output distributions, assign different weights to samples, and incorporate these weights into the preference optimization process. This plug-and-play approach enables LLMs to prioritize challenging examples during training, improving learning efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework integrates seamlessly with various preference optimization methods and achieves consistent improvements in mathematical reasoning tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joonwon Jang, Jaehee Kim, Wonbin Kweon, Hwanjo Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on generating extensive intermediate reasoning units (e.g., tokens, sentences) to enhance final answer quality across a wide range of complex tasks. While generating multiple reasoning paths or iteratively refining rationales proves effective for improving performance, these approaches inevitably result in significantly higher inference costs. In this work, we propose a novel sentence-level rationale reduction training framework that leverages likelihood-based criteria, verbosity, to identify and remove redundant reasoning sentences. Unlike previous approaches that utilize token-level reduction, our sentence-level reduction framework maintains model performance while reducing generation length. This preserves the original reasoning abilities of LLMs and achieves an average 17.15% reduction in generation costs across various models and tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Mapping and navigation services like Google Maps, Apple Maps, Openstreet Maps, are essential for accessing various location-based data, yet they often struggle to handle natural language geospatial queries. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in question answering (QA), but creating reliable geospatial QA datasets from map services remains challenging. We introduce MapQaTor, a web application that streamlines the creation of reproducible, traceable map-based QA datasets. With its plug-and-play architecture, MapQaTor enables seamless integration with any maps API, allowing users to gather and visualize data from diverse sources with minimal setup. By caching API responses, the platform ensures consistent ground truth, enhancing the reliability of the data even as real-world information evolves. MapQaTor centralizes data retrieval, annotation, and visualization within a single platform, offering a unique opportunity to evaluate the current state of LLM-based geospatial reasoning while advancing their capabilities for improved geospatial understanding. Evaluation metrics show that, MapQaTor speeds up the annotation process by at least 30 times compared to manual methods, underscoring its potential for developing geospatial resources, such as complex map reasoning datasets.

We benchmark both open-source and closed-source LLMs and strategies on our task and compare their performance to a handcrafted planner. We find that LLMs and VLMs struggle with the planning problems that Plancraft introduces, and we offer suggestions on how to improve their capabilities.</p>

While existing benchmarks evaluate these models in context-rich, real-life scenarios, they often overlook fundamental perceptual skills essential for environments deviating from everyday realism. In particular, geometric perception, the ability to interpret spatial relationships and abstract visual patterns, remains underexplored. To address this limitation, we introduce GePBench, a novel benchmark designed to assess the geometric perception capabilities of MLLMs. Results from extensive evaluations reveal that current state-of-the-art MLLMs exhibit significant deficiencies in such tasks. Additionally, we demonstrate that models trained with data sourced from GePBench show notable improvements on a wide range of downstream tasks, underscoring the importance of geometric perception as a foundation for advanced multimodal applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> KuanChao Chu, Yi-Pei Chen, Hideki Nakayama</p>
<p>Abstract: Diversity is a critical aspect of multi-agent communication. In this paper, we focus on controlling and exploring diversity in the context of open-domain multi-agent conversations, particularly for world simulation applications. We propose Adaptive Prompt Pruning (APP), a novel method that dynamically adjusts the content of the utterance generation prompt to control diversity using a single parameter, lambda. Through extensive experiments, we show that APP effectively controls the output diversity across models and datasets, with pruning more information leading to more diverse output. We comprehensively analyze the relationship between prompt content and conversational diversity. Our findings reveal that information from all components of the prompt generally constrains the diversity of the output, with the Memory block exerting the most significant influence. APP is compatible with established techniques like temperature sampling and top-p sampling, providing a versatile tool for diversity management. To address the trade-offs of increased diversity, such as inconsistencies with omitted information, we incorporate a post-generation correction step, which effectively balances diversity enhancement with output consistency. Additionally, we examine how prompt structure, including component order and length, impacts diversity. This study addresses key questions surrounding diversity in multi-agent world simulation, offering insights into its control, influencing factors, and associated trade-offs. Our contributions lay the foundation for systematically engineering diversity in LLM-based multi-agent collaborations, advancing their effectiveness in real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mikhail Tikhomirov, Daniil Chernyshev</p>
<p>Abstract: Rapid advancements of large language model (LLM) technologies led to the introduction of powerful open-source instruction-tuned LLMs that have the same text generation quality as the state-of-the-art counterparts such as GPT-4. While the emergence of such models accelerates the adoption of LLM technologies in sensitive-information environments the authors of such models don not disclose the training data necessary for replication of the results thus making the achievements model-exclusive. Since those open-source models are also multilingual this in turn reduces the benefits of training a language specific LLMs as improved inference computation efficiency becomes the only guaranteed advantage of such costly procedure. More cost-efficient options such as vocabulary extension and subsequent continued pre-training are also inhibited by the lack of access to high-quality instruction-tuning data since it is the major factor behind the resulting LLM task-solving capabilities. To address the limitations and cut the costs of the language adaptation pipeline we propose Learned Embedding Propagation (LEP). Unlike existing approaches our method has lower training data size requirements due to minimal impact on existing LLM knowledge which we reinforce using novel ad-hoc embedding propagation procedure that allows to skip the instruction-tuning step and instead implant the new language knowledge directly into any existing instruct-tuned variant. We evaluated four Russian vocabulary adaptations for LLaMa-3-8B and Mistral-7B, showing that LEP is competitive with traditional instruction-tuning methods, achieving performance comparable to OpenChat 3.5 and LLaMa-3-8B-Instruct, with further improvements via self-calibration and continued tuning enhancing task-solving capabilities.</p>

<p>Abstract: The remarkable performance of models like the OpenAI o1 can be attributed to their ability to emulate human-like long-time thinking during inference. These models employ extended chain-of-thought (CoT) processes, exploring multiple strategies to enhance problem-solving capabilities. However, a critical question remains: How to intelligently and efficiently scale computational resources during testing. This paper presents the first comprehensive study on the prevalent issue of overthinking in these models, where excessive computational resources are allocated for simple problems with minimal benefit. We introduce novel efficiency metrics from both outcome and process perspectives to evaluate the rational use of computational resources by o1-like models. Using a self-training paradigm, we propose strategies to mitigate overthinking, streamlining reasoning processes without compromising accuracy. Experimental results show that our approach successfully reduces computational overhead while preserving model performance across a range of testsets with varying difficulty levels, such as GSM8K, MATH500, GPQA, and AIME.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly transformed our daily life and established a new paradigm in natural language processing (NLP). However, the predominant pretraining of LLMs on extensive web-based texts remains insufficient for advanced scientific discovery, particularly in chemistry. The scarcity of specialized chemistry data, coupled with the complexity of multi-modal data such as 2D graph, 3D structure and spectrum, present distinct challenges. Although several studies have reviewed Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) in chemistry, there is a conspicuous absence of a systematic survey specifically focused on chemistry-oriented LLMs. In this paper, we outline methodologies for incorporating domain-specific chemistry knowledge and multi-modal information into LLMs, we also conceptualize chemistry LLMs as agents using chemistry tools and investigate their potential to accelerate scientific research. Additionally, we conclude the existing benchmarks to evaluate chemistry ability of LLMs. Finally, we critically examine the current challenges and identify promising directions for future research. Through this comprehensive survey, we aim to assist researchers in staying at the forefront of developments in chemistry LLMs and to inspire innovative applications in the field.</p>

First, we present RACLETTE, a conversational system that demonstrates superior emotional accuracy compared to state-of-the-art benchmarks in both understanding users' emotional states and generating empathetic responses during conversations, while progressively building an emotional profile of the user through their interactions. Second, we show how the emotional profiles of a user can be used as interpretable markers for mental health assessment. These profiles can be compared with characteristic emotional patterns associated with different mental disorders, providing a novel approach to preliminary screening and support.</p>

Current research suggests that multi-task training outperforms single-task as different tasks can benefit each other, but they often overlook the internal relationships within these tasks, providing limited guidance on selecting datasets to enhance specific tasks. To analyze this phenomenon, we attempted to employ compositional generalization (CG)-the ability of models to understand novel combinations by recombining learned elements-as a guiding framework. Since medical images can be precisely defined by Modality, Anatomical area, and Task, naturally providing an environment for exploring CG. Therefore, we assembled 106 medical datasets to create Med-MAT for comprehensive experiments. The experiments confirmed that MLLMs can use CG to understand unseen medical images and identified CG as one of the main drivers of the generalization observed in multi-task training. Additionally, further studies demonstrated that CG effectively supports datasets with limited data and delivers consistent performance across different backbones, highlighting its versatility and broad applicability.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Velizar Varbanov, Kalin Kopanov, Tatiana Atanasova</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a multidisciplinary approach to analyzing data from Telegram for early warning information regarding cyber threats. With the proliferation of hacktivist groups utilizing Telegram to disseminate information regarding future cyberattacks or to boast about successful ones, the need for effective data analysis methods is paramount. The primary challenge lies in the vast number of channels and the overwhelming volume of data, necessitating advanced techniques for discerning pertinent risks amidst the noise. To address this challenge, we employ a combination of neural network architectures and traditional machine learning algorithms. These methods are utilized to classify and identify potential cyber threats within the Telegram data. Additionally, sentiment analysis and entity recognition techniques are incorporated to provide deeper insights into the nature and context of the communicated information. The study evaluates the effectiveness of each method in detecting and categorizing cyber threats, comparing their performance and identifying areas for improvement. By leveraging these diverse analytical tools, we aim to enhance early warning systems for cyber threats, enabling more proactive responses to potential security breaches. This research contributes to the ongoing efforts to bolster cybersecurity measures in an increasingly interconnected digital landscape.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiao Wang, Qingyi Si, Jianlong Wu, Shiyu Zhu, Li Cao, Liqiang Nie</p>
<p>Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in video understanding. However, existing VideoLLMs often inherit the limitations of their backbone LLMs in handling long sequences, leading to challenges for long video understanding. Common solutions either simply uniformly sample videos' frames or compress visual tokens, which focus primarily on low-level temporal visual redundancy, overlooking high-level knowledge redundancy. This limits the achievable compression rate with minimal loss. To this end. we introduce a training-free method, $\textbf{ReTaKe}$, containing two novel modules DPSelect and PivotKV, to jointly model and reduce both temporal visual redundancy and knowledge redundancy for long video understanding. Specifically, DPSelect identifies keyframes with local maximum peak distance based on their visual features, which are closely aligned with human video perception. PivotKV employs the obtained keyframes as pivots and conducts KV-Cache compression for the non-pivot tokens with low attention scores, which are derived from the learned prior knowledge of LLMs. Experiments on benchmarks VideoMME, MLVU, and LVBench, show that ReTaKe can support 4x longer video sequences with minimal performance loss (<1%) and outperform all similar-size VideoLLMs with 3%-5%, even surpassing or on par with much larger ones.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ranim Khojah, Francisco Gomes de Oliveira Neto, Mazen Mohamad, Philipp Leitner</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used by software engineers for code generation. However, limitations of LLMs such as irrelevant or incorrect code have highlighted the need for prompt programming (or prompt engineering) where engineers apply specific prompt techniques (e.g., chain-of-thought or input-output examples) to improve the generated code. Despite this, the impact of different prompt techniques -- and their combinations -- on code generation remains underexplored. In this study, we introduce CodePromptEval, a dataset of 7072 prompts designed to evaluate five prompt techniques (few-shot, persona, chain-of-thought, function signature, list of packages) and their effect on the correctness, similarity, and quality of complete functions generated by three LLMs (GPT-4o, Llama3, and Mistral). Our findings show that while certain prompt techniques significantly influence the generated code, combining multiple techniques does not necessarily improve the outcome. Additionally, we observed a trade-off between correctness and quality when using prompt techniques. Our dataset and replication package enable future research on improving LLM-generated code and evaluating new prompt techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zijie Chen, Zhanchao Zhou, Yu Lu, Renjun Xu, Lili Pan, Zhenzhong Lan</p>
<p>Abstract: NP-hard problem-solving traditionally relies on heuristics, but manually crafting effective heuristics for complex problems remains challenging. While recent work like FunSearch has demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) can be leveraged for heuristic design in evolutionary algorithm (EA) frameworks, their potential is not fully realized due to its deficiency in exploitation and exploration. We present UBER (Uncertainty-Based Evolution for Refinement), a method that enhances LLM+EA methods for automatic heuristic design by integrating uncertainty on top of the FunSearch framework. UBER introduces two key innovations: an Uncertainty-Inclusive Evolution Process (UIEP) for adaptive exploration-exploitation balance, and a principled Uncertainty-Inclusive Island Reset (UIIS) strategy for maintaining population diversity. Through extensive experiments on challenging NP-complete problems, UBER demonstrates significant improvements over FunSearch. Our work provides a new direction for the synergy of LLMs and EA, advancing the field of automatic heuristic design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peixin Xu, Yujuan Ding, Wenqi Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: Chart summarization, which focuses on extracting key information from charts and interpreting it in natural language, is crucial for generating and delivering insights through effective and accessible data analysis. Traditional methods for chart understanding and summarization often rely on multi-stage pipelines, which may produce suboptimal semantic alignment between visual and textual information. In comparison, recently developed LLM-based methods are more dependent on the capability of foundation images or languages, while ignoring the characteristics of chart data and its relevant challenges. To address these limitations, we propose ChartAdapter, a novel lightweight transformer module designed to bridge the gap between charts and textual summaries. ChartAdapter employs learnable query vectors to extract implicit semantics from chart data and incorporates a cross-modal alignment projector to enhance vision-to-language generative learning. By integrating ChartAdapter with an LLM, we enable end-to-end training and efficient chart summarization. To further enhance the training, we introduce a three-stage hierarchical training procedure and develop a large-scale dataset specifically curated for chart summarization, comprising 190,618 samples. Experimental results on the standard Chart-to-Text testing set demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods, including state-of-the-art models, in generating high-quality chart summaries. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of key components in ChartAdapter. This work highlights the potential of tailored LLM-based approaches to advance chart understanding and sets a strong foundation for future research in this area.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuechen Wang, Shiwan Zhao, Haoqin Sun, Hui Wang, Jiaming Zhou, Yong Qin</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition (MER), leveraging speech and text, has emerged as a pivotal domain within human-computer interaction, demanding sophisticated methods for effective multimodal integration. The challenge of aligning features across these modalities is significant, with most existing approaches adopting a singular alignment strategy. Such a narrow focus not only limits model performance but also fails to address the complexity and ambiguity inherent in emotional expressions. In response, this paper introduces a Multi-Granularity Cross-Modal Alignment (MGCMA) framework, distinguished by its comprehensive approach encompassing distribution-based, instance-based, and token-based alignment modules. This framework enables a multi-level perception of emotional information across modalities. Our experiments on IEMOCAP demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yichao Fu, Junda Chen, Siqi Zhu, Zheyu Fu, Zhongdongming Dai, Aurick Qiao, Hao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) has unlocked their capabilities in advanced reasoning tasks like mathematical problem-solving, code generation, and legal analysis. Central to this progress are inference-time reasoning algorithms, which refine outputs by exploring multiple solution paths, at the cost of increasing compute demands and response latencies. Existing serving systems fail to adapt to the scaling behaviors of these algorithms or the varying difficulty of queries, leading to inefficient resource use and unmet latency targets.
  We present Dynasor, a system that optimizes inference-time compute for LLM reasoning queries. Unlike traditional engines, Dynasor tracks and schedules requests within reasoning queries and uses Certaindex, a proxy that measures statistical reasoning progress based on model certainty, to guide compute allocation dynamically. Dynasor co-adapts scheduling with reasoning progress: it allocates more compute to hard queries, reduces compute for simpler ones, and terminates unpromising queries early, balancing accuracy, latency, and cost. On diverse datasets and algorithms, Dynasor reduces compute by up to 50% in batch processing and sustaining 3.3x higher query rates or 4.7x tighter latency SLOs in online serving.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce TangoFlux, an efficient Text-to-Audio (TTA) generative model with 515M parameters, capable of generating up to 30 seconds of 44.1kHz audio in just 3.7 seconds on a single A40 GPU. A key challenge in aligning TTA models lies in the difficulty of creating preference pairs, as TTA lacks structured mechanisms like verifiable rewards or gold-standard answers available for Large Language Models (LLMs). To address this, we propose CLAP-Ranked Preference Optimization (CRPO), a novel framework that iteratively generates and optimizes preference data to enhance TTA alignment. We demonstrate that the audio preference dataset generated using CRPO outperforms existing alternatives. With this framework, TangoFlux achieves state-of-the-art performance across both objective and subjective benchmarks. We open source all code and models to support further research in TTA generation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Solving complex real-world tasks requires cycles of actions and observations. This is particularly true in science, where tasks require many cycles of analysis, tool use, and experimentation. Language agents are promising for automating intellectual tasks in science because they can interact with tools via natural language or code. Yet their flexibility creates conceptual and practical challenges for software implementations, since agents may comprise non-standard components such as internal reasoning, planning, tool usage, as well as the inherent stochasticity of temperature-sampled language models. Here, we introduce Aviary, an extensible gymnasium for language agents. We formalize agents as policies solving language-grounded partially observable Markov decision processes, which we term language decision processes. We then implement five environments, including three challenging scientific environments: (1) manipulating DNA constructs for molecular cloning, (2) answering research questions by accessing scientific literature, and (3) engineering protein stability. These environments were selected for their focus on multi-step reasoning and their relevance to contemporary biology research. Finally, with online training and scaling inference-time compute, we show that language agents backed by open-source, non-frontier LLMs can match and exceed both frontier LLM agents and human experts on multiple tasks at up to 100x lower inference cost.</p>

<p>Abstract: I compute the average trial-by-trial power of band-limited speech activity across epochs of multi-channel high-density electrocorticography (ECoG) recorded from multiple subjects during a consonant-vowel speaking task. I show that previously seen anti-correlations of average beta frequency activity (12-35 Hz) to high-frequency gamma activity (70-140 Hz) during speech movement are observable between individual ECoG channels in the sensorimotor cortex (SMC). With this I fit a variance-based model using principal component analysis to the band-powers of individual channels of session-averaged ECoG data in the SMC and project SMC channels onto their lower-dimensional principal components.
  Spatiotemporal relationships between speech-related activity and principal components are identified by correlating the principal components of both frequency bands to individual ECoG channels over time using windowed correlation. Correlations of principal component areas to sensorimotor areas reveal a distinct two-component activation-inhibition-like representation for speech that resembles distinct local sensorimotor areas recently shown to have complex interplay in whole-body motor control, inhibition, and posture. Notably the third principal component shows insignificant correlations across all subjects, suggesting two components of ECoG are sufficient to represent SMC activity during speech movement.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce self-invoking code generation, a new task designed to evaluate the progressive reasoning and problem-solving capabilities of LLMs. In this task, models are presented with a base problem and a related, more complex problem. They must solve the base problem and then utilize its solution to address the more complex one. This work features three key contributions. First, we propose a general recipe for generating more challenging versions of existing benchmarks, resulting in three new benchmarks: HumanEval Pro, MBPP Pro, and BigCodeBench-Lite Pro, specifically designed to assess LLMs on self-invoking code generation. Second, from the analysis of experimental results over twenty LLMs on our benchmarks, we have two important observations: (i) Most LLMs excel in traditional code generation benchmarks like HumanEval and MBPP, but their performance declines on self-invoking tasks. For example, o1-mini achieves 96.2% pass@1 on HumanEval but only 76.2% on HumanEval Pro. (ii) On self-invoking code generation task, the instruction-tuned models demonstrate only marginal improvements compared to the base models. Third, we disclose the types of failure modes that exist in our evaluation results. All these results underscore the need for further advancements in self-invoking code generation tasks and provide a new direction for future research on enhancing LLMs' code reasoning capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Purbesh Mitra, Priyanka Kaswan, Sennur Ulukus</p>
<p>Abstract: Mixture-of-Agents (MoA) has recently been proposed as a method to enhance performance of large language models (LLMs), enabling multiple individual LLMs to work together for collaborative inference. This collaborative approach results in improved responses to user prompts compared to relying on a single LLM. In this paper, we consider such an MoA architecture in a distributed setting, where LLMs operate on individual edge devices, each uniquely associated with a user and equipped with its own distributed computing power. These devices exchange information using decentralized gossip algorithms, allowing different device nodes to talk without the supervision of a centralized server. In the considered setup, different users have their own LLM models to address user prompts. Additionally, the devices gossip either their own user-specific prompts or augmented prompts to generate more refined answers to certain queries. User prompts are temporarily stored in the device queues when their corresponding LLMs are busy. Given the memory limitations of edge devices, it is crucial to ensure that the average queue sizes in the system remain bounded. In this paper, we address this by theoretically calculating the queuing stability conditions for the device queues under reasonable assumptions, which we validate experimentally as well. Further, we demonstrate through experiments, leveraging open-source LLMs for the implementation of distributed MoA, that certain MoA configurations produce higher-quality responses compared to others, as evaluated on AlpacaEval 2.0 benchmark.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weiwei Sun, Lingyong Yan, Xinyu Ma, Shuaiqiang Wang, Pengjie Ren, Zhumin Chen, Dawei Yin, Zhaochun Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot generalization across various language-related tasks, including search engines. However, existing work utilizes the generative ability of LLMs for Information Retrieval (IR) rather than direct passage ranking. The discrepancy between the pre-training objectives of LLMs and the ranking objective poses another challenge. In this paper, we first investigate generative LLMs such as ChatGPT and GPT-4 for relevance ranking in IR. Surprisingly, our experiments reveal that properly instructed LLMs can deliver competitive, even superior results to state-of-the-art supervised methods on popular IR benchmarks. Furthermore, to address concerns about data contamination of LLMs, we collect a new test set called NovelEval, based on the latest knowledge and aiming to verify the model's ability to rank unknown knowledge. Finally, to improve efficiency in real-world applications, we delve into the potential for distilling the ranking capabilities of ChatGPT into small specialized models using a permutation distillation scheme. Our evaluation results turn out that a distilled 440M model outperforms a 3B supervised model on the BEIR benchmark. The code to reproduce our results is available at www.github.com/sunnweiwei/RankGPT.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yun Luo, Zhen Yang, Fandong Meng, Yafu Li, Jie Zhou, Yue Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting (CF) is a phenomenon that occurs in machine learning when a model forgets previously learned information while acquiring new knowledge for achieving a satisfactory performance in downstream tasks. As large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance, it is intriguing to investigate whether CF exists during the continual instruction tuning of LLMs. This study empirically evaluates the forgetting phenomenon in LLMs' knowledge during continual instruction tuning from the perspectives of domain knowledge, reasoning, and reading comprehension. The experiments reveal that catastrophic forgetting is generally observed in LLMs ranging from 1b to 7b parameters. Surprisingly, as the model scale increases, the severity of forgetting intensifies in such a model sale range which may result from the much significant initial performance in the larger LLM. Comparing the decoder-only model BLOOMZ with the encoder-decoder model mT0, BLOOMZ exhibits less forgetting and retains more knowledge. Interestingly, we also observe that LLMs can mitigate language biases, such as gender bias, during continual fine-tuning. Furthermore, our findings indicate that general instruction tuning can help alleviate the forgetting phenomenon in LLMs during subsequent fine-tuning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuyu Jiang, Wenyi Tang, Xingshu Chen, Rui Tang, Haizhou Wang, Wenxian Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The proliferation of hate speech (HS) on social media poses a serious threat to societal security. Automatic counter narrative (CN) generation, as an active strategy for HS intervention, has garnered increasing attention in recent years. Existing methods for automatically generating CNs mainly rely on re-training or fine-tuning pre-trained language models (PLMs) on human-curated CN corpora. Unfortunately, the annotation speed of CN corpora cannot keep up with the growth of HS targets, while generating specific and effective CNs for unseen targets remains a significant challenge for the model. To tackle this issue, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Zero-shot Generation (ReZG) to generate CNs with high-specificity for unseen targets. Specifically, we propose a multi-dimensional hierarchical retrieval method that integrates stance, semantics, and fitness, extending the retrieval metric from single dimension to multiple dimensions suitable for the knowledge that refutes HS. Then, we implement an energy-based constrained decoding mechanism that enables PLMs to use differentiable knowledge preservation, countering, and fluency constraint functions instead of in-target CNs as control signals for generation, thereby achieving zero-shot CN generation. With the above techniques, ReZG can integrate external knowledge flexibly and improve the specificity of CNs. Experimental results show that ReZG exhibits stronger generalization capabilities and outperforms strong baselines with significant improvements of 2.0%+ in the relevance and 4.5%+ in the countering success rate metrics.</p>

<p>Abstract: Spurred by advancements in scale, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong few-shot learning ability via in-context learning (ICL). However, the performance of ICL has been shown to be highly sensitive to the selection of few-shot demonstrations. Selecting the most suitable examples as context remains an ongoing challenge and an open problem. Existing literature has highlighted the importance of selecting examples that are diverse or semantically similar to the test sample while ignoring the fact that the optimal selection dimension, i.e., diversity or similarity, is task-specific. Based on how the test sample is answered, we propose Iterative Demonstration Selection (IDS) to leverage the merits of both dimensions. Using zero-shot chain-of-thought reasoning (Zero-shot-CoT), IDS iteratively selects examples that are diverse but still strongly correlated with the test sample as ICL demonstrations. Specifically, IDS applies Zero-shot-CoT to the test sample before demonstration selection. The output reasoning path is then used to choose demonstrations that are prepended to the test sample for inference. The generated answer is followed by its corresponding reasoning path for extracting a new set of demonstrations in the next iteration. After several iterations, IDS adopts majority voting to obtain the final result. Through extensive experiments on tasks including reasoning, question answering, and topic classification, we demonstrate that IDS can consistently outperform existing ICL demonstration selection methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Swapnil Mane, Suman Kundu, Rajesh Sharma</p>
<p>Abstract: The rise of social media platforms has led to an increase in cyber-aggressive behavior, encompassing a broad spectrum of hostile behavior, including cyberbullying, online harassment, and the dissemination of offensive and hate speech. These behaviors have been associated with significant societal consequences, ranging from online anonymity to real-world outcomes such as depression, suicidal tendencies, and, in some instances, offline violence. Recognizing the societal risks associated with unchecked aggressive content, this paper delves into the field of Aggression Content Detection and Behavioral Analysis of Aggressive Users, aiming to bridge the gap between disparate studies. In this paper, we analyzed the diversity of definitions and proposed a unified cyber-aggression definition. We examine the comprehensive process of Aggression Content Detection, spanning from dataset creation, feature selection and extraction, and detection algorithm development. Further, we review studies on Behavioral Analysis of Aggression that explore the influencing factors, consequences, and patterns associated with cyber-aggressive behavior. This systematic literature review is a cross-examination of content detection and behavioral analysis in the realm of cyber-aggression. The integrated investigation reveals the effectiveness of incorporating sociological insights into computational techniques for preventing cyber-aggressive behavior. Finally, the paper concludes by identifying research gaps and encouraging further progress in the unified domain of socio-computational aggressive behavior analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hua Tang, Chong Zhang, Mingyu Jin, Qinkai Yu, Zhenting Wang, Xiaobo Jin, Yongfeng Zhang, Mengnan Du</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been applied in many fields and have developed rapidly in recent years. As a classic machine learning task, time series forecasting has recently been boosted by LLMs. Recent works treat large language models as \emph{zero-shot} time series reasoners without further fine-tuning, which achieves remarkable performance. However, there are some unexplored research problems when applying LLMs for time series forecasting under the zero-shot setting. For instance, the LLMs' preferences for the input time series are less understood. In this paper, by comparing LLMs with traditional time series forecasting models, we observe many interesting properties of LLMs in the context of time series forecasting. First, our study shows that LLMs perform well in predicting time series with clear patterns and trends, but face challenges with datasets lacking periodicity. This observation can be explained by the ability of LLMs to recognize the underlying period within datasets, which is supported by our experiments. In addition, the input strategy is investigated, and it is found that incorporating external knowledge and adopting natural language paraphrases substantially improve the predictive performance of LLMs for time series. Overall, our study contributes insight into LLMs' advantages and limitations in time series forecasting under different conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yue Zhang, Jingxuan Zuo, Liqiang Jing</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal summarization aims to generate a concise summary based on the input text and image. However, the existing methods potentially suffer from unfactual output. To evaluate the factuality of multimodal summarization models, we propose two fine-grained and explainable evaluation frameworks (FALLACIOUS) for different application scenarios, i.e. reference-based factuality evaluation framework and reference-free factuality evaluation framework. Notably, the reference-free factuality evaluation framework doesn't need ground truth and hence it has a wider application scenario. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed frameworks, we compute the correlation between our frameworks and the other metrics. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed method. We will release our code and dataset via github.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce the Yi model family, a series of language and multimodal models that demonstrate strong multi-dimensional capabilities. The Yi model family is based on 6B and 34B pretrained language models, then we extend them to chat models, 200K long context models, depth-upscaled models, and vision-language models. Our base models achieve strong performance on a wide range of benchmarks like MMLU, and our finetuned chat models deliver strong human preference rate on major evaluation platforms like AlpacaEval and Chatbot Arena. Building upon our scalable super-computing infrastructure and the classical transformer architecture, we attribute the performance of Yi models primarily to its data quality resulting from our data-engineering efforts. For pretraining, we construct 3.1 trillion tokens of English and Chinese corpora using a cascaded data deduplication and quality filtering pipeline. For finetuning, we polish a small scale (less than 10K) instruction dataset over multiple iterations such that every single instance has been verified directly by our machine learning engineers. For vision-language, we combine the chat language model with a vision transformer encoder and train the model to align visual representations to the semantic space of the language model. We further extend the context length to 200K through lightweight continual pretraining and demonstrate strong needle-in-a-haystack retrieval performance. We show that extending the depth of the pretrained checkpoint through continual pretraining further improves performance. We believe that given our current results, continuing to scale up model parameters using thoroughly optimized data will lead to even stronger frontier models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Batu Guan, Yao Wan, Zhangqian Bi, Zheng Wang, Hongyu Zhang, Pan Zhou, Lichao Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in code generation. It now becomes crucial to identify whether the code is AI-generated and to determine the specific model used, particularly for purposes such as protecting Intellectual Property (IP) in industry and preventing cheating in programming exercises. To this end, several attempts have been made to insert watermarks into machine-generated code. However, existing approaches are limited to inserting only a single bit of information. In this paper, we introduce CodeIP, a novel multi-bit watermarking technique that inserts additional information to preserve crucial provenance details, such as the vendor ID of an LLM, thereby safeguarding the IPs of LLMs in code generation. Furthermore, to ensure the syntactical correctness of the generated code, we propose constraining the sampling process for predicting the next token by training a type predictor. Experiments conducted on a real-world dataset across five programming languages demonstrate the effectiveness of CodeIP in watermarking LLMs for code generation while maintaining the syntactical correctness of code.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weilong Dong, Xinwei Wu, Renren Jin, Shaoyang Xu, Deyi Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring large language models (LLM) behave consistently with human goals, values, and intentions is crucial for their safety but yet computationally expensive. To reduce the computational cost of alignment training of LLMs, especially for those with a huge number of parameters, and to reutilize learned value alignment, we propose ConTrans, a novel framework that enables weak-to-strong alignment transfer via concept transplantation. From the perspective of representation engineering, ConTrans refines concept vectors in value alignment from a source LLM (usually a weak yet aligned LLM). The refined concept vectors are then reformulated to adapt to the target LLM (usually a strong yet unaligned base LLM) via affine transformation. In the third step, ConTrans transplants the reformulated concept vectors into the residual stream of the target LLM. Experiments demonstrate the successful transplantation of a wide range of aligned concepts from 7B models to 13B and 70B models across multiple LLMs and LLM families. Remarkably, ConTrans even surpasses instruction-tuned models in terms of truthfulness. Experiment results validate the effectiveness of both inter-LLM-family and intra-LLM-family concept transplantation. Our work successfully demonstrates an alternative way to achieve weak-to-strong alignment generalization and control.</p>

<p>Abstract: Traditional feedback learning for hallucination reduction relies on labor-intensive manual labeling or expensive proprietary models. This leaves the community without foundational knowledge about how to build high-quality feedback with open-source MLLMs. In this work, we introduce RLAIF-V, a novel framework that aligns MLLMs in a fully open-source paradigm. RLAIF-V maximally explores open-source MLLMs from two perspectives, including high-quality feedback data generation for preference learning and self-feedback guidance for inference-time scaling. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks in both automatic and human evaluation show that RLAIF-V substantially enhances the trustworthiness of models at both preference learning and inference time. RLAIF-V 7B reduces object hallucination by 80.7\% and overall hallucination by 33.7\%. Remarkably, RLAIF-V 12B further reveals the self-alignment potential of open-source MLLMs, where the model can learn from feedback of itself to achieve super GPT-4V trustworthiness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Yin, Hyunjae Kim, Xiao Xiao, Chih Hsuan Wei, Jaewoo Kang, Zhiyong Lu, Hua Xu, Meng Fang, Qingyu Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Training a neural network-based biomedical named entity recognition (BioNER) model usually requires extensive and costly human annotations. While several studies have employed multi-task learning with multiple BioNER datasets to reduce human effort, this approach does not consistently yield performance improvements and may introduce label ambiguity in different biomedical corpora. We aim to tackle those challenges through transfer learning from easily accessible resources with fewer concept overlaps with biomedical datasets. We proposed GERBERA, a simple-yet-effective method that utilized general-domain NER datasets for training. We performed multi-task learning to train a pre-trained biomedical language model with both the target BioNER dataset and the general-domain dataset. Subsequently, we fine-tuned the models specifically for the BioNER dataset. We systematically evaluated GERBERA on five datasets of eight entity types, collectively consisting of 81,410 instances. Despite using fewer biomedical resources, our models demonstrated superior performance compared to baseline models trained with additional BioNER datasets. Specifically, our models consistently outperformed the baseline models in six out of eight entity types, achieving an average improvement of 0.9% over the best baseline performance across eight entities. Our method was especially effective in amplifying performance on BioNER datasets characterized by limited data, with a 4.7% improvement in F1 scores on the JNLPBA-RNA dataset. This study introduces a new training method that leverages cost-effective general-domain NER datasets to augment BioNER models. This approach significantly improves BioNER model performance, making it a valuable asset for scenarios with scarce or costly biomedical datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinhao Zhang, Jinghan Zhang, Fengran Mo, Yuzhong Chen, Kunpeng Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Feature generation can significantly enhance learning outcomes, particularly for tasks with limited data. An effective way to improve feature generation is by expanding the current feature space using existing features and enriching the informational content. However, generating new, interpretable features in application fields often requires domain-specific knowledge about the existing features. This paper introduces a new method RAFG for generating reasonable and explainable features specific to domain classification tasks. To generate new features with interpretability in domain knowledge, we perform information retrieval on existing features to identify potential feature associations, and utilize these associations to generate meaningful features. Furthermore, we develop a Large Language Model (LLM)-based framework for feature generation with reasoning to verify and filter features during the generation process. Experiments across several datasets in medical, economic, and geographic domains show that our RAFG method produces high-quality, meaningful features and significantly improves classification performance compared with baseline methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zipeng Liu, Likang Wu, Ming He, Zhong Guan, Hongke Zhao, Nan Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: Significant efforts have been dedicated to integrating the powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) with diverse modalities, particularly focusing on the fusion of language, vision and audio data. However, the graph-structured data, which is inherently rich in structural and domain-specific knowledge, has not yet been gracefully adapted to LLMs. Existing methods either describe the graph with raw text, suffering the loss of graph structural information, or feed Graph Neural Network (GNN) embeddings into LLMs at the cost of losing explainable prompt semantics. To bridge this gap, we introduce an end-to-end modality-aligning framework for LLM-graph alignment: Dual-Residual Vector Quantized-Variational AutoEncoder, namely Dr.E. Our approach is purposefully designed to facilitate token-level alignment with LLMs, enabling an effective translation of the intrinsic `language' of graphs into comprehensible natural language. We also manage to enhance LLMs' more robust structural understanding of graphs by incorporating multiple views of the central nodes based on their surrounding nodes at various distances. Our experimental evaluations on standard graph tasks demonstrate competitive performance against other state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches. Additionally, our framework ensures certain visual interpretability, efficiency, and robustness, marking the promising successful endeavor to achieve token-level alignment between LLMs and GNNs.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yeonsu Kwon, Jiho Kim, Gyubok Lee, Seongsu Bae, Daeun Kyung, Wonchul Cha, Tom Pollard, Alistair Johnson, Edward Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are integral for storing comprehensive patient medical records, combining structured data (e.g., medications) with detailed clinical notes (e.g., physician notes). These elements are essential for straightforward data retrieval and provide deep, contextual insights into patient care. However, they often suffer from discrepancies due to unintuitive EHR system designs and human errors, posing serious risks to patient safety. To address this, we developed EHRCon, a new dataset and task specifically designed to ensure data consistency between structured tables and unstructured notes in EHRs. EHRCon was crafted in collaboration with healthcare professionals using the MIMIC-III EHR dataset, and includes manual annotations of 4,101 entities across 105 clinical notes checked against database entries for consistency. EHRCon has two versions, one using the original MIMIC-III schema, and another using the OMOP CDM schema, in order to increase its applicability and generalizability. Furthermore, leveraging the capabilities of large language models, we introduce CheckEHR, a novel framework for verifying the consistency between clinical notes and database tables. CheckEHR utilizes an eight-stage process and shows promising results in both few-shot and zero-shot settings. The code is available at https://github.com/dustn1259/EHRCon.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziqi Zhang, Cunxiang Wang, Xiong Xiao, Yue Zhang, Donglin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Chain of thought (CoT) is a reasoning framework that can enhance the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on complex inference tasks. In particular, among various studies related to CoT, multi-path inference stands out as a simple yet effective improvement. However, there is no optimal setting for the number of inference paths. Therefore, we have to increase the number of inference paths to obtain better results, which in turn increases the inference cost. To address this limitation, we can utilize question-related role templates to guide LLMs into relevant roles, thereby increasing the possibility of correct inferences for each path and further reducing dependence on the number of inference paths while improving reasoning accuracy. However, placing LLMs into specific roles may reduce their reasoning diversity and performance on a few tasks where role dependence is low. To alleviate the excessive immersion of the LLM into a specific role, we propose Nash CoT by constructing a game system on each path that balances the generation from role-specific LLMs' and the general LLMs' generation, thereby ensuring both effective role adoption and diversity in LLM generation further maintaining the performance of multi-path inference while reducing the requirement of the number of inference paths. We evaluate Nash CoT across various inference tasks, including Arabic Reasoning, Commonsense Question Answering, and Symbolic Inference, achieving results that are comparable to or better than those of multi-path CoT with the equal number of inference paths.</p>

<p>Abstract: Literature research, vital for scientific work, faces the challenge of surging information volumes exceeding researchers' processing capabilities. We present an automated review generation method based on large language models (LLMs) to overcome efficiency bottlenecks and reduce cognitive load. Our statistically validated evaluation framework demonstrates that the generated reviews match or exceed manual quality, offering broad applicability across research fields without requiring users' domain knowledge. Applied to propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysts, our method swiftly analyzed 343 articles, averaging seconds per article per LLM account, producing comprehensive reviews spanning 35 topics, with extended analysis of 1041 articles providing insights into catalysts' properties. Through multi-layered quality control, we effectively mitigated LLMs' hallucinations, with expert verification confirming accuracy and citation integrity while demonstrating hallucination risks reduced to below 0.5\% with 95\% confidence. Released Windows application enables one-click review generation, enhancing research productivity and literature recommendation efficiency while setting the stage for broader scientific explorations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinfa Huang, Jinsheng Pan, Zhongwei Wan, Hanjia Lyu, Jiebo Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances show that two-stream approaches have achieved outstanding performance in hateful meme detection. However, hateful memes constantly evolve as new memes emerge by fusing progressive cultural ideas, making existing methods obsolete or ineffective. In this work, we explore the potential of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) for hateful meme detection. To this end, we propose Evolver, which incorporates LMMs via Chain-of-Evolution (CoE) Prompting, by integrating the evolution attribute and in-context information of memes. Specifically, Evolver simulates the evolving and expressing process of memes and reasons through LMMs in a step-by-step manner. First, an evolutionary pair mining module retrieves the top-k most similar memes in the external curated meme set with the input meme. Second, an evolutionary information extractor is designed to summarize the semantic regularities between the paired memes for prompting. Finally, a contextual relevance amplifier enhances the in-context hatefulness information to boost the search for evolutionary processes. Extensive experiments on public FHM, MAMI, and HarM datasets show that CoE prompting can be incorporated into existing LMMs to improve their performance. More encouragingly, it can serve as an interpretive tool to promote the understanding of the evolution of social memes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuwei Zhang, Junming Huang, Sitong Liu, Zexi Chen, Zizheng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper advances a novel architectural schema anchored upon the Transformer paradigm and innovatively amalgamates the K-means categorization algorithm to augment the contextual apprehension capabilities of the schema. The transformer model performs well in machine translation tasks due to its parallel computing power and multi-head attention mechanism. However, it may encounter contextual ambiguity or ignore local features when dealing with highly complex language structures. To circumvent this constraint, this exposition incorporates the K-Means algorithm, which is used to stratify the lexis and idioms of the input textual matter, thereby facilitating superior identification and preservation of the local structure and contextual intelligence of the language. The advantage of this combination is that K-Means can automatically discover the topic or concept regions in the text, which may be directly related to translation quality. Consequently, the schema contrived herein enlists K-Means as a preparatory phase antecedent to the Transformer and recalibrates the multi-head attention weights to assist in the discrimination of lexis and idioms bearing analogous semantics or functionalities. This ensures the schema accords heightened regard to the contextual intelligence embodied by these clusters during the training phase, rather than merely focusing on locational intelligence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zikai Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have generated significant attention since their inception, finding applications across various academic and industrial domains. However, these models often suffer from the "hallucination problem", where outputs, though grammatically and logically coherent, lack factual accuracy or are entirely fabricated. A particularly troubling issue discovered and widely discussed recently is the numerical comparison error where multiple LLMs incorrectly infer that "9.11$>$9.9". We discovered that the order in which LLMs generate answers and reasoning impacts their consistency. Specifically, results vary significantly when an LLM generates an answer first and then provides the reasoning versus generating the reasoning process first and then the conclusion. Inspired by this, we propose a new benchmark method for assessing LLM consistency: comparing responses generated through these two different approaches. This benchmark effectively identifies instances where LLMs fabricate answers and subsequently generate justifications. Furthermore, we introduce a novel and straightforward prompt strategy designed to mitigate this issue. Experimental results demonstrate that this strategy improves performance across various LLMs compared to direct questioning. This work not only sheds light on a critical flaw in LLMs but also offers a practical solution to enhance their reliability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaushal Kumar Maurya, KV Aditya Srivatsa, Ekaterina Kochmar</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have seen widespread adoption due to their remarkable performance across various applications, driving the accelerated development of a large number of diverse LLMs. However, these individual LLMs show limitations in generalization and performance on complex tasks due to inherent training biases, model size constraints, and the quality or diversity of pre-training datasets. A promising direction is to efficiently harness the diverse capabilities of LLMs to overcome these individual limitations. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel LLM selection algorithm called SelectLLM, which efficiently directs input queries to the most suitable subset of LLMs from a large pool, ensuring that the selected models collectively provide accurate responses. SelectLLM employs a multi-label classifier and policy based on the classifier's predictions and confidence scores in selecting an optimal, query-aware, and lightweight subset of LLMs. Our findings indicate that the proposed model outperforms existing ensemble-based baselines and achieves competitive performance with similarly sized top-performing LLMs while maintaining efficiency. Specifically, it achieves a huge reduction in inference latency on two challenging reasoning benchmarks: 13% on GSM8K and 70% on MMLU, compared to the top-performing baselines. Also, we establish a theoretical upper bound by an oracle with LLMs and explore in-depth linguistic analysis to understand the performance gap between Oracle and SelectLLM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiajun Song, Zhuoyan Xu, Yiqiao Zhong</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 sometimes appear to be creative, solving novel tasks often with a few demonstrations in the prompt. These tasks require the models to generalize on distributions different from those from training data -- which is known as out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. Despite the tremendous success of LLMs, how they approach OOD generalization remains an open and underexplored question. We examine OOD generalization in settings where instances are generated according to hidden rules, including in-context learning with symbolic reasoning. Models are required to infer the hidden rules behind input prompts without any fine-tuning.
  We empirically examined the training dynamics of Transformers on a synthetic example and conducted extensive experiments on a variety of pretrained LLMs, focusing on a type of components known as induction heads. We found that OOD generalization and composition are tied together -- models can learn rules by composing two self-attention layers, thereby achieving OOD generalization. Furthermore, a shared latent subspace in the embedding (or feature) space acts as a bridge for composition by aligning early layers and later layers, which we refer to as the common bridge representation hypothesis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andong Chen, Lianzhang Lou, Kehai Chen, Xuefeng Bai, Yang Xiang, Muyun Yang, Tiejun Zhao, Min Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Different from the traditional translation tasks, classical Chinese poetry translation requires both adequacy and fluency in translating culturally and historically significant content and linguistic poetic elegance. Large language models (LLMs) with impressive multilingual capabilities may bring a ray of hope to achieve this extreme translation demand. This paper first introduces a suitable benchmark (PoetMT) where each Chinese poetry has a recognized elegant translation. Meanwhile, we propose a new metric based on GPT-4 to evaluate the extent to which current LLMs can meet these demands. Our empirical evaluation reveals that the existing LLMs fall short in the challenging task. Hence, we propose a Retrieval-Augmented Machine Translation (RAT) method which incorporates knowledge related to classical poetry for advancing the translation of Chinese Poetry in LLMs. Experimental results show that RAT consistently outperforms all comparison methods regarding wildly used BLEU, COMET, BLEURT, our proposed metric, and human evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tejas Deshpande, Nidhi Kowtal, Raviraj Joshi</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces Chain of Translation Prompting (CoTR), a novel strategy designed to enhance the performance of language models in low-resource languages. CoTR restructures prompts to first translate the input context from a low-resource language into a higher-resource language, such as English. The specified task like generation, classification, or any other NLP function is then performed on the translated text, with the option to translate the output back to the original language if needed. All these steps are specified in a single prompt. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method through a case study on the low-resource Indic language Marathi. The CoTR strategy is applied to various tasks, including sentiment analysis, hate speech classification, subject classification and text generation, and its efficacy is showcased by comparing it with regular prompting methods. Our results underscore the potential of translation-based prompting strategies to significantly improve multilingual LLM performance in low-resource languages, offering valuable insights for future research and applications. We specifically see the highest accuracy improvements with the hate speech detection task. The technique also has the potential to enhance the quality of synthetic data generation for underrepresented languages using LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: The development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has seen significant advancements with increasing demands in various fields (e.g., multimodal agents, embodied intelligence). While model-driven approaches attempt to enhance MLLMs capabilities through diverse architectures, the gains have become increasingly marginal. Conversely, data-driven methods, which scale up image-text instruction data, are more effective but face limited data diversity and complexity challenges. The absence of high-quality data constitutes a significant development barrier for MLLMs. To address the data quality bottleneck, we propose MMEvol, a novel multimodal instruction data evolution framework. This framework iteratively improve data quality through a refined combination of fine-grained perception, cognitive reasoning, and interaction evolution, generating a more complex and diverse image-text instruction dataset that empowers MLLMs with enhanced capabilities. Beginning with an initial set of instructions, SEED-163K, we utilize MMEvol to systematically broaden the diversity of instruction types, extend visual reasoning steps to improve cognitive reasoning abilities, and thoroughly explore fine-grained information within images to enhance visual understanding and robustness. To comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive qualitative analysis and quantitative experiments across 13 vision-language tasks. Compared to baseline models trained with the initial seed data, the results demonstrate that our method achieves an average accuracy improvement of 3.1 percentage points. Furthermore, our approach reaches state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in nine tasks using significantly less data compared to state-of-the-art models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoqian Liu, Yangfan Du, Jianjin Wang, Yuan Ge, Chen Xu, Tong Xiao, Guocheng Chen, Jingbo Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Simultaneous Speech Translation (SimulST) involves generating target language text while continuously processing streaming speech input, presenting significant real-time challenges. Multi-task learning is often employed to enhance SimulST performance but introduces optimization conflicts between primary and auxiliary tasks, potentially compromising overall efficiency. The existing model-level conflict resolution methods are not well-suited for this task which exacerbates inefficiencies and leads to high GPU memory consumption. To address these challenges, we propose a Modular Gradient Conflict Mitigation (MGCM) strategy that detects conflicts at a finer-grained modular level and resolves them utilizing gradient projection. Experimental results demonstrate that MGCM significantly improves SimulST performance, particularly under medium and high latency conditions, achieving a 0.68 BLEU score gain in offline tasks. Additionally, MGCM reduces GPU memory consumption by over 95\% compared to other conflict mitigation methods, establishing it as a robust solution for SimulST tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Medication Extraction and Mining play an important role in healthcare NLP research due to its practical applications in hospital settings, such as their mapping into standard clinical knowledge bases (SNOMED-CT, BNF, etc.). In this work, we investigate state-of-the-art LLMs in text mining tasks on medications and their related attributes such as dosage, route, strength, and adverse effects. In addition, we explore different ensemble learning methods (\textsc{Stack-Ensemble} and \textsc{Voting-Ensemble}) to augment the model performances from individual LLMs. Our ensemble learning result demonstrated better performances than individually fine-tuned base models BERT, RoBERTa, RoBERTa-L, BioBERT, BioClinicalBERT, BioMedRoBERTa, ClinicalBERT, and PubMedBERT across general and specific domains. Finally, we build up an entity linking function to map extracted medical terminologies into the SNOMED-CT codes and the British National Formulary (BNF) codes, which are further mapped to the Dictionary of Medicines and Devices (dm+d), and ICD.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guiyang Hou, Wenqi Zhang, Yongliang Shen, Zeqi Tan, Sihao Shen, Weiming Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Social intelligence is built upon three foundational pillars: cognitive intelligence, situational intelligence, and behavioral intelligence. As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into our social lives, understanding, evaluating, and developing their social intelligence are becoming increasingly important. While multiple existing works have investigated the social intelligence of LLMs, (1) most focus on a specific aspect, and the social intelligence of LLMs has yet to be systematically organized and studied; (2) position LLMs as passive observers from a third-person perspective, such as in Theory of Mind (ToM) tests. Compared to the third-person perspective, ego-centric first-person perspective evaluation can align well with actual LLM-based Agent use scenarios. (3) a lack of comprehensive evaluation of behavioral intelligence, with specific emphasis on incorporating critical human-machine interaction scenarios. In light of this, we present EgoSocialArena, a novel framework grounded in the three pillars of social intelligence: cognitive, situational, and behavioral intelligence, aimed to systematically evaluate the social intelligence of LLMs from a first-person perspective. With EgoSocialArena, we have conducted a comprehensive evaluation of eight prominent foundation models, even the most advanced LLMs like o1-preview lag behind human performance by 11.0 points.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Julia R. Fischer, Nilam Ram</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates how the topical flow of dyadic conversations emerges over time and how differences in interlocutors' personality traits contribute to this topical flow. Leveraging text embeddings, we map the trajectories of $N = 1655$ conversations between strangers into a high-dimensional space. Using nonlinear projections and clustering, we then identify when each interlocutor enters and exits various topics. Differences in conversational flow are quantified via $\textit{topic entropy}$, a summary measure of the "spread" of topics covered during a conversation, and $\textit{linguistic alignment}$, a time-varying measure of the cosine similarity between interlocutors' embeddings. Our findings suggest that interlocutors with a larger difference in the personality dimension of openness influence each other to spend more time discussing a wider range of topics and that interlocutors with a larger difference in extraversion experience a larger decrease in linguistic alignment throughout their conversation. We also examine how participants' affect (emotion) changes from before to after a conversation, finding that a larger difference in extraversion predicts a larger difference in affect change and that a greater topic entropy predicts a larger affect increase. This work demonstrates how communication research can be advanced through the use of high-dimensional NLP methods and identifies personality difference as an important driver of social influence.</p>

<p>Abstract: The remarkable understanding and generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have greatly improved translation performance. However, incorrect understanding of the sentence to be translated can degrade translation quality. To address this issue, we proposed a novel Iterative Bilingual Understanding Translation (IBUT) method based on the cross-lingual capabilities of LLMs and the dual characteristics of translation tasks. The cross-lingual capability of LLMs enables the generation of contextual understanding for both the source and target languages separately. Furthermore, the dual characteristics allow IBUT to generate effective cross-lingual feedback, iteratively refining contextual understanding, thereby reducing errors and improving translation performance. Experimental results showed that the proposed IBUT outperforms several strong comparison methods, especially being generalized to multiple domains (e.g., news, commonsense, and cultural translation benchmarks).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengyu Hu, Jieyu Zhang, Zhihan Xiong, Alexander Ratner, Hui Xiong, Ranjay Krishna</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs), evaluating their outputs' quality regarding *preference* remains a critical challenge. Existing works usually leverage a powerful LLM (e.g., GPT4) as the judge for comparing LLMs' output pairwisely, yet such model-based evaluator is vulnerable to *conflicting preference*, i.e., output A is better than B, B than C, but C than A, causing contradictory evaluation results. To improve model-based preference evaluation, we introduce GED (Preference Graph Ensemble and Denoise), a novel approach that leverages multiple model-based evaluators to construct preference graphs, and then ensemble and denoise these graphs for better, non-contradictory evaluation results. In particular, our method consists of two primary stages: aggregating evaluations into a unified graph and applying a denoising process to eliminate cyclic inconsistencies, ensuring a directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure. We provide theoretical guarantees for our framework, demonstrating its efficacy in recovering the ground truth preference structure. Extensive experiments across ten benchmark datasets show that GED outperforms baseline methods in model ranking, response selection, and model alignment tasks. Notably, GED combines weaker evaluators like Llama3-8B, Mistral-7B, and Qwen2-7B to surpass the performance of stronger evaluators like Qwen2-72B, highlighting its ability to enhance evaluation reliability and improve model performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: We show that existing evaluations for fake news detection based on conventional sources, such as claims on fact-checking websites, result in high accuracies over time for LLM-based detectors -- even after their knowledge cutoffs. This suggests that recent popular fake news from such sources can be easily detected due to pre-training and retrieval corpus contamination or increasingly salient shallow patterns. Instead, we argue that a proper fake news detection dataset should test a model's ability to reason factually about the current world by retrieving and reading related evidence. To this end, we develop a novel pipeline that leverages natural language feedback from a RAG-based detector to iteratively modify real-time news into deceptive fake news that challenges LLMs. Our iterative rewrite decreases the binary classification ROC-AUC by an absolute 17.5 percent for a strong RAG-based GPT-4o detector. Our experiments reveal the important role of RAG in both detecting and generating fake news, as retrieval-free LLM detectors are vulnerable to unseen events and adversarial attacks, while feedback from RAG detection helps discover more deceitful patterns in fake news.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyu Zhao, Fangcong Yin, Greg Durrett</p>
<p>Abstract: Long-context LLMs are increasingly in demand for applications such as retrieval-augmented generation. To defray the cost of pretraining LLMs over long contexts, recent work takes an approach of synthetic context extension: fine-tuning LLMs with synthetically generated long-context data in a post-training stage. However, it remains unclear how and why this synthetic context extension imparts abilities for downstream long-context tasks. In this paper, we investigate fine-tuning on synthetic data for three long-context tasks that require retrieval and reasoning. We vary the realism of "needle" concepts to be retrieved and diversity of the surrounding "haystack" context, from using LLMs to construct synthetic documents to using templated relations and creating symbolic datasets. We find that models trained on synthetic data fall short of the real data, but surprisingly, the mismatch can be interpreted and even predicted in terms of a special set of attention heads that are responsible for retrieval over long context, retrieval heads (Wu et al., 2024). The retrieval heads learned on synthetic data have high overlap with retrieval heads learned on real data, and there is a strong correlation between the recall of heads learned and the downstream performance of a model. Furthermore, with attention knockout and activation patching, we mechanistically show that retrieval heads are necessary and explain model performance, although they are not totally sufficient. Our results shed light on how to interpret synthetic data fine-tuning performance and how to approach creating better data for learning real-world capabilities over long contexts.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated emergent abilities in text generation, question answering, and reasoning, facilitating various tasks and domains. Despite their proficiency in various tasks, LLMs like PaLM 540B and Llama-3.1 405B face limitations due to large parameter sizes and computational demands, often requiring cloud API use which raises privacy concerns, limits real-time applications on edge devices, and increases fine-tuning costs. Additionally, LLMs often underperform in specialized domains such as healthcare and law due to insufficient domain-specific knowledge, necessitating specialized models. Therefore, Small Language Models (SLMs) are increasingly favored for their low inference latency, cost-effectiveness, efficient development, and easy customization and adaptability. These models are particularly well-suited for resource-limited environments and domain knowledge acquisition, addressing LLMs' challenges and proving ideal for applications that require localized data handling for privacy, minimal inference latency for efficiency, and domain knowledge acquisition through lightweight fine-tuning. The rising demand for SLMs has spurred extensive research and development. However, a comprehensive survey investigating issues related to the definition, acquisition, application, enhancement, and reliability of SLM remains lacking, prompting us to conduct a detailed survey on these topics. The definition of SLMs varies widely, thus to standardize, we propose defining SLMs by their capability to perform specialized tasks and suitability for resource-constrained settings, setting boundaries based on the minimal size for emergent abilities and the maximum size sustainable under resource constraints. For other aspects, we provide a taxonomy of relevant models/methods and develop general frameworks for each category to enhance and utilize SLMs effectively.</p>

Our approach combines model ensemble strategies with MLP-based and threshold-based methods trained on pretrained language models. Treating individual models as virtual annotators, we simulate the annotation process by designing aggregation measures that incorporate continuous relatedness scores and discrete classification labels to capture both majority and disagreement. Additionally, we employ anisotropy removal techniques to enhance performance. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods, particularly for Subtask 2. Notably, we find that standard deviation on continuous relatedness scores among different model manipulations correlates with human disagreement annotations compared to metrics on aggregated discrete labels.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minh Le, Tien Ngoc Luu, An Nguyen The, Thanh-Thien Le, Trang Nguyen, Tung Thanh Nguyen, Linh Ngo Van, Thien Huu Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: To address catastrophic forgetting in Continual Relation Extraction (CRE), many current approaches rely on memory buffers to rehearse previously learned knowledge while acquiring new tasks. Recently, prompt-based methods have emerged as potent alternatives to rehearsal-based strategies, demonstrating strong empirical performance. However, upon analyzing existing prompt-based approaches for CRE, we identified several critical limitations, such as inaccurate prompt selection, inadequate mechanisms for mitigating forgetting in shared parameters, and suboptimal handling of cross-task and within-task variances. To overcome these challenges, we draw inspiration from the relationship between prefix-tuning and mixture of experts, proposing a novel approach that employs a prompt pool for each task, capturing variations within each task while enhancing cross-task variances. Furthermore, we incorporate a generative model to consolidate prior knowledge within shared parameters, eliminating the need for explicit data storage. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of our approach, demonstrating superior performance over state-of-the-art prompt-based and rehearsal-free methods in continual relation extraction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Patrick Sutanto, Joan Santoso, Esther Irawati Setiawan, Aji Prasetya Wibawa</p>
<p>Abstract: Multiple Choice Question Answering (MCQA) is an important problem with numerous real-world applications, such as medicine, law, and education. The high cost of building MCQA datasets makes few-shot learning pivotal in this domain. While Large Language Models (LLMs) can enable few-shot learning, their direct application in real-world scenarios is often hindered by their high computational cost. To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective approach that uses LLMs for data generation and scoring. Our approach utilizes LLMs to create MCQA data which contains questions and choices, and to assign probability scores to the generated choices. We then use the generated data and LLM-assigned scores to finetune a smaller and more efficient encoder-only model, DeBERTa-v3-base by leveraging distillation loss. Extensive experiments on the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark demonstrate that our method improves accuracy from 28.9% to 39.3%, representing a gain of over 10% compared to a baseline finetuned directly on 5-shot examples. This shows the effectiveness of LLM-driven data generation and knowledge distillation for few-shot MCQA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eunsu Kim, Juyoung Suk, Seungone Kim, Niklas Muennighoff, Dongkwan Kim, Alice Oh</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce LLM-as-an-Interviewer, a novel paradigm for evaluating large language models (LLMs). This approach leverages multi-turn interactions where the LLM interviewer actively provides feedback on responses and poses follow-up questions to the evaluated LLM. At the start of the interview, the LLM interviewer dynamically modifies datasets to generate initial questions, mitigating data contamination. We apply the LLM-as-an-Interviewer framework to evaluate six models on the MATH and DepthQA tasks. Our results show that the framework effectively provides insights into LLM performance, including the quality of initial responses, adaptability to feedback, and ability to address follow-up queries like clarification or additional knowledge requests. The framework also addresses key limitations of conventional methods like LLM-as-a-Judge, including verbosity bias and inconsistency across runs. Finally, we propose the Interview Report, which aggregates insights from the interview process, providing examples and a comprehensive analysis of the LLM's strengths and weaknesses. This report offers a detailed snapshot of the model's real-world applicability. The code for our framework is publicly available at https://github.com/interview-eval/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guoxuan Chen, Han Shi, Jiawei Li, Yihang Gao, Xiaozhe Ren, Yimeng Chen, Xin Jiang, Zhenguo Li, Weiyang Liu, Chao Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited exceptional performance across a spectrum of natural language processing tasks. However, their substantial sizes pose considerable challenges, particularly in computational demands and inference speed, due to their quadratic complexity. In this work, we have identified a key pattern: certain seemingly meaningless special tokens (i.e., separators) contribute disproportionately to attention scores compared to semantically meaningful tokens. This observation suggests that information of the segments between these separator tokens can be effectively condensed into the separator tokens themselves without significant information loss. Guided by this insight, we introduce SepLLM, a plug-and-play framework that accelerates inference by compressing these segments and eliminating redundant tokens. Additionally, we implement efficient kernels for training acceleration. Experimental results across training-free, training-from-scratch, and post-training settings demonstrate SepLLM's effectiveness. Notably, using the Llama-3-8B backbone, SepLLM achieves over 50% reduction in KV cache on the GSM8K-CoT benchmark while maintaining comparable performance. Furthermore, in streaming settings, SepLLM effectively processes sequences of up to 4 million tokens or more while maintaining consistent language modeling capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxuan Jiang, Francis Ferraro</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in character understanding tasks, such as analyzing the roles, personalities, and relationships of fictional characters. However, the extensive pre-training corpora used by LLMs raise concerns that they may rely on memorizing popular fictional works rather than genuinely understanding and reasoning about them. In this work, we argue that 'gist memory'-capturing essential meaning - should be the primary mechanism for character understanding tasks, as opposed to 'verbatim memory' - exact match of a string. We introduce a simple yet effective method to mitigate mechanized memorization in character understanding evaluations while preserving the essential implicit cues needed for comprehension and reasoning. Our approach reduces memorization-driven performance on popular fictional works from 96% accuracy to 72% and results in up to an 18% drop in accuracy across various character understanding tasks. These findings underscore the issue of data contamination in existing benchmarks, which often measure memorization rather than true character understanding.</p>

<p>Abstract: The increasing adoption of AI-generated radiology reports necessitates robust methods for detecting hallucinations--false or unfounded statements that could impact patient care. We present ReXTrust, a novel framework for fine-grained hallucination detection in AI-generated radiology reports. Our approach leverages sequences of hidden states from large vision-language models to produce finding-level hallucination risk scores. We evaluate ReXTrust on a subset of the MIMIC-CXR dataset and demonstrate superior performance compared to existing approaches, achieving an AUROC of 0.8751 across all findings and 0.8963 on clinically significant findings. Our results show that white-box approaches leveraging model hidden states can provide reliable hallucination detection for medical AI systems, potentially improving the safety and reliability of automated radiology reporting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaan Wang, Fandong Meng, Yunlong Liang, Jie Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, O1-like models have emerged as representative examples, illustrating the effectiveness of long chain-of-thought (CoT) in reasoning tasks such as math and coding tasks. In this paper, we introduce DRT-o1, an attempt to bring the success of long CoT to neural machine translation (MT). Specifically, in view of the literature books that might involve similes and metaphors, translating these texts to a target language is very difficult in practice due to cultural differences. In such cases, literal translation often fails to convey the intended meaning effectively. Even for professional human translators, considerable thought must be given to preserving semantics throughout the translation process. To simulate LLMs' long thought ability in MT, we first mine sentences containing similes or metaphors from existing literature books, and then develop a multi-agent framework to translate these sentences via long thought. In the multi-agent framework, a translator is used to iteratively translate the source sentence under the suggestions provided by an advisor. To ensure the effectiveness of the long thoughts, an evaluator is also employed to quantify the translation in each round. In this way, we collect tens of thousands of long-thought MT data, which is used to train our DRT-o1. Using Qwen2.5 and LLama-3.1 as the backbones, DRT-o1 models can learn the thought process during machine translation, and outperform vanilla LLMs as well as existing O1-like LLMs, showing their effectiveness The project is available at https://github.com/krystalan/DRT-o1</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tingxu Han, Chunrong Fang, Shiyu Zhao, Shiqing Ma, Zhenyu Chen, Zhenting Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Reasoning is critical for large language models (LLMs) to excel in a wide range of tasks. While methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning enhance LLM performance by decomposing problems into intermediate steps, they also incur significant overhead in token usage, leading to increased costs. We find that the reasoning process of current LLMs is unnecessarily lengthy and it can be compressed by including a reasonable token budget in the prompt, but the choice of token budget plays a crucial role in the actual compression effectiveness. We then propose a token-budget-aware LLM reasoning framework, which dynamically estimates token budgets for different problems based on reasoning complexity and uses the estimated token budgets to guide the reasoning process. Experiments show that our method effectively reduces token costs in CoT reasoning with only a slight performance reduction, offering a practical solution to balance efficiency and accuracy in LLM reasoning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yice Zhang, Guangyu Xie, Hongling Xu, Kaiheng Hou, Jianzhu Bao, Qianlong Wang, Shiwei Chen, Ruifeng Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-grained sentiment analysis (FSA) aims to extract and summarize user opinions from vast opinionated text. Recent studies demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) possess exceptional sentiment understanding capabilities. However, directly deploying LLMs for FSA applications incurs high inference costs. Therefore, this paper investigates the distillation of fine-grained sentiment understanding from LLMs into small language models (SLMs). We prompt LLMs to examine and interpret the sentiments of given reviews and then utilize the generated content to pretrain SLMs. Additionally, we develop a comprehensive FSA benchmark to evaluate both SLMs and LLMs. Extensive experiments on this benchmark reveal that: (1) distillation significantly enhances the performance of SLMs in FSA tasks, achieving a 6.00\% improvement in $F_1$-score, and the distilled model can outperform Llama-2-7b with only 220M parameters; (2) distillation equips SLMs with excellent zero-shot sentiment classification capabilities, enabling them to match or even exceed their teacher models. These results suggest that distillation from LLMs is a highly promising direction for FSA.

<p>Abstract: Building on the foundations of language modeling in natural language processing, Next Token Prediction (NTP) has evolved into a versatile training objective for machine learning tasks across various modalities, achieving considerable success. As Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced to unify understanding and generation tasks within the textual modality, recent research has shown that tasks from different modalities can also be effectively encapsulated within the NTP framework, transforming the multimodal information into tokens and predict the next one given the context. This survey introduces a comprehensive taxonomy that unifies both understanding and generation within multimodal learning through the lens of NTP. The proposed taxonomy covers five key aspects: Multimodal tokenization, MMNTP model architectures, unified task representation, datasets \& evaluation, and open challenges.

<p>Abstract: Gender-fair language aims at promoting gender equality by using terms and expressions that include all identities and avoid reinforcing gender stereotypes. Implementing gender-fair strategies is particularly challenging in heavily gender-marked languages, such as Italian. To address this, the Gender-Fair Generation challenge intends to help shift toward gender-fair language in written communication. The challenge, designed to assess and monitor the recognition and generation of gender-fair language in both mono- and cross-lingual scenarios, includes three tasks: (1) the detection of gendered expressions in Italian sentences, (2) the reformulation of gendered expressions into gender-fair alternatives, and (3) the generation of gender-fair language in automatic translation from English to Italian. The challenge relies on three different annotated datasets: the GFL-it corpus, which contains Italian texts extracted from administrative documents provided by the University of Brescia; GeNTE, a bilingual test set for gender-neutral rewriting and translation built upon a subset of the Europarl dataset; and Neo-GATE, a bilingual test set designed to assess the use of non-binary neomorphemes in Italian for both fair formulation and translation tasks. Finally, each task is evaluated with specific metrics: average of F1-score obtained by means of BERTScore computed on each entry of the datasets for task 1, an accuracy measured with a gender-neutral classifier, and a coverage-weighted accuracy for tasks 2 and 3.</p>

<p>Abstract: Can artificial intelligence unlock the secrets of the human brain? How do the inner mechanisms of deep learning models relate to our neural circuits? Is it possible to enhance AI by tapping into the power of brain recordings? These captivating questions lie at the heart of an emerging field at the intersection of neuroscience and artificial intelligence. Our survey dives into this exciting domain, focusing on human brain recording studies and cutting-edge cognitive neuroscience datasets that capture brain activity during natural language processing, visual perception, and auditory experiences. We explore two fundamental approaches: encoding models, which attempt to generate brain activity patterns from sensory inputs; and decoding models, which aim to reconstruct our thoughts and perceptions from neural signals. These techniques not only promise breakthroughs in neurological diagnostics and brain-computer interfaces but also offer a window into the very nature of cognition. In this survey, we first discuss popular representations of language, vision, and speech stimuli, and present a summary of neuroscience datasets. We then review how the recent advances in deep learning transformed this field, by investigating the popular deep learning based encoding and decoding architectures, noting their benefits and limitations across different sensory modalities. From text to images, speech to videos, we investigate how these models capture the brain's response to our complex, multimodal world. While our primary focus is on human studies, we also highlight the crucial role of animal models in advancing our understanding of neural mechanisms. Throughout, we mention the ethical implications of these powerful technologies, addressing concerns about privacy and cognitive liberty. We conclude with a summary and discussion of future trends in this rapidly evolving field.</p>

<p>Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) is an approach that has advanced research and applications in computer vision, fueling modern recognition systems and generative models. We believe that the main ingredient to the success of CLIP is its data and not the model architecture or pre-training objective. However, CLIP only provides very limited information about its data and how it has been collected, leading to works that aim to reproduce CLIP's data by filtering with its model parameters. In this work, we intend to reveal CLIP's data curation approach and in our pursuit of making it open to the community introduce Metadata-Curated Language-Image Pre-training (MetaCLIP). MetaCLIP takes a raw data pool and metadata (derived from CLIP's concepts) and yields a balanced subset over the metadata distribution. Our experimental study rigorously isolates the model and training settings, concentrating solely on data. MetaCLIP applied to CommonCrawl with 400M image-text data pairs outperforms CLIP's data on multiple standard benchmarks. In zero-shot ImageNet classification, MetaCLIP achieves 70.8% accuracy, surpassing CLIP's 68.3% on ViT-B models. Scaling to 1B data, while maintaining the same training budget, attains 72.4%. Our observations hold across various model sizes, exemplified by ViT-H achieving 80.5%, without any bells-and-whistles.

<p>Abstract: Generating speech from a face image is crucial for developing virtual humans capable of interacting using their unique voices, without relying on pre-recorded human speech. In this paper, we propose Face-StyleSpeech, a zero-shot Text-To-Speech (TTS) synthesis model that generates natural speech conditioned on a face image rather than reference speech. We hypothesize that learning entire prosodic features from a face image poses a significant challenge. To address this, our TTS model incorporates both face and prosody encoders. The prosody encoder is specifically designed to model speech style characteristics that are not fully captured by the face image, allowing the face encoder to focus on extracting speaker-specific features such as timbre. Experimental results demonstrate that Face-StyleSpeech effectively generates more natural speech from a face image than baselines, even for unseen faces. Samples are available on our demo page.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding long, real-world videos requires modeling of long-range visual dependencies. To this end, we explore video-first architectures, building on the common paradigm of transferring large-scale, image--text models to video via shallow temporal fusion. However, we expose two limitations to the approach: (1) decreased spatial capabilities, likely due to poor video--language alignment in standard video datasets, and (2) higher memory consumption, bottlenecking the number of frames that can be processed. To mitigate the memory bottleneck, we systematically analyze the memory/accuracy trade-off of various efficient methods: factorized attention, parameter-efficient image-to-video adaptation, input masking, and multi-resolution patchification. Surprisingly, simply masking large portions of the video (up to 75%) during contrastive pre-training proves to be one of the most robust ways to scale encoders to videos up to 4.3 minutes at 1 FPS. Our simple approach for training long video-to-text models, which scales to 1B parameters, does not add new architectural complexity and is able to outperform the popular paradigm of using much larger LLMs as an information aggregator over segment-based information on benchmarks with long-range temporal dependencies (YouCook2, EgoSchema).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junjielong Xu, Ying Fu, Shin Hwei Tan, Pinjia He</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved decent results on automated program repair (APR). However, the next token prediction training objective of decoder-only LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) is misaligned with the masked span prediction objective of current infilling-style methods, which impedes LLMs from fully leveraging pre-trained knowledge for program repair. In addition, while some LLMs can locate and repair bugs in certain functions using the related artifacts (e.g., test cases), existing methods still depend on statement-level fault localization methods to provide a list of buggy hunks for repair. This restriction hinders LLMs from exploring potential patches beyond the given locations.
  In this paper, we investigate a new approach to adapt LLMs to program repair. Our core insight is that LLM's APR capability can be greatly improved by simply aligning the output to their training objective and allowing them to refine the whole program without first identifying faulty statements. Based on this insight, we designed D4C, a straightforward prompting framework for APR. D4C can repair 180 bugs correctly in Defects4J, with each patch being sampled only 10 times. This surpasses the SOTA APR methods with perfect fault localization by 10% and reduces the patch sampling number by 90%. Our findings reveal that (1) objective alignment is crucial for fully exploiting LLM's pre-trained capability, and (2) replacing the traditional localize-buggy-hunks-then-repair workflow with direct debugging is more effective for LLM-based APR methods. Thus, we believe this paper introduces a new mindset for harnessing LLMs in APR.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiapu Wang, Kai Sun, Linhao Luo, Wei Wei, Yongli Hu, Alan Wee-Chung Liew, Shirui Pan, Baocai Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning (TKGR) is the process of utilizing temporal information to capture complex relations within a Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) to infer new knowledge. Conventional methods in TKGR typically depend on deep learning algorithms or temporal logical rules. However, deep learning-based TKGRs often lack interpretability, whereas rule-based TKGRs struggle to effectively learn temporal rules that capture temporal patterns. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated extensive knowledge and remarkable proficiency in temporal reasoning. Consequently, the employment of LLMs for Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning (TKGR) has sparked increasing interest among researchers. Nonetheless, LLMs are known to function as black boxes, making it challenging to comprehend their reasoning process. Additionally, due to the resource-intensive nature of fine-tuning, promptly updating LLMs to integrate evolving knowledge within TKGs for reasoning is impractical. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a Large Language Models-guided Dynamic Adaptation (LLM-DA) method for reasoning on TKGs. Specifically, LLM-DA harnesses the capabilities of LLMs to analyze historical data and extract temporal logical rules. These rules unveil temporal patterns and facilitate interpretable reasoning. To account for the evolving nature of TKGs, a dynamic adaptation strategy is proposed to update the LLM-generated rules with the latest events. This ensures that the extracted rules always incorporate the most recent knowledge and better generalize to the predictions on future events. Experimental results show that without the need of fine-tuning, LLM-DA significantly improves the accuracy of reasoning over several common datasets, providing a robust framework for TKGR tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengyu Hu, Linxin Song, Jieyu Zhang, Zheyuan Xiao, Tianfu Wang, Zhengyu Chen, Nicholas Jing Yuan, Jianxun Lian, Kaize Ding, Hui Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: The use of large language models (LLMs) as judges, particularly in preference comparisons, has become widespread, but this reveals a notable bias towards longer responses, undermining the reliability of such evaluations. To better understand such bias, we propose to decompose the preference evaluation metric, specifically the win rate, into two key components: desirability and information mass, where the former is length-independent and related to trustworthiness such as correctness, toxicity, and consistency, and the latter is length-dependent and represents the amount of information in the response. We empirically demonstrated the decomposition through controlled experiments and found that response length impacts evaluations by influencing information mass. To derive a reliable evaluation metric that assesses content quality without being confounded by response length, we propose AdapAlpaca, a simple yet effective adjustment to win rate measurement. Specifically, AdapAlpaca ensures a fair comparison of response quality by aligning the lengths of reference and test model responses under equivalent length intervals.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yulei Qin, Yuncheng Yang, Pengcheng Guo, Gang Li, Hang Shao, Yuchen Shi, Zihan Xu, Yun Gu, Ke Li, Xing Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Instruction tuning plays a critical role in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preference. Despite the vast amount of open instruction datasets, naively training a LLM on all existing instructions may not be optimal and practical. To pinpoint the most beneficial datapoints, data assessment and selection methods have been proposed in the fields of natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning. However, under the context of instruction tuning, there still exists a gap in knowledge on what kind of data evaluation metrics can be employed and how they can be integrated into the selection mechanism. To bridge this gap, we present a comprehensive review on existing literature of data assessment and selection especially for instruction tuning of LLMs. We systematically categorize all applicable methods into quality-based, diversity-based, and importance-based ones where a unified, fine-grained taxonomy is structured. For each category, representative methods are elaborated to describe the landscape of relevant research. In addition, comparison between the latest methods is conducted on their officially reported results to provide in-depth discussions on their limitations. Finally, we summarize the open challenges and propose the promosing avenues for future studies. All related contents are available at https://github.com/yuleiqin/fantastic-data-engineering.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali Lotfi, Ian McQuillan</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents two novel theorems that address two open problems in stochastic Lindenmayer-system (L-system) inference, specifically focusing on the construction of an optimal stochastic L-system capable of generating a given sequence of strings. The first theorem delineates a method for crafting a stochastic L-system that has the maximum probability of a derivation producing a given sequence of words through a single derivation (noting that multiple derivations may generate the same sequence). Furthermore, the second theorem determines the stochastic L-systems with the highest probability of producing a given sequence of words with multiple possible derivations. From these, we introduce an algorithm to infer an optimal stochastic L-system from a given sequence. This algorithm incorporates advanced optimization techniques, such as interior point methods, to ensure the creation of a stochastic L-system that maximizes the probability of generating the given sequence (allowing for multiple derivations). This allows for the use of stochastic L-systems as a model for machine learning using only positive data for training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hiroki Furuta, Kuang-Huei Lee, Shixiang Shane Gu, Yutaka Matsuo, Aleksandra Faust, Heiga Zen, Izzeddin Gur</p>
<p>Abstract: Many algorithms for aligning LLMs with human preferences assume that human preferences are binary and deterministic. However, human preferences can vary across individuals, and therefore should be represented distributionally. In this work, we introduce the distributional soft preference labels and improve Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with a weighted geometric average of the LLM output likelihood in the loss function. This approach adjusts the scale of learning loss based on the soft labels such that the loss would approach zero when the responses are closer to equally preferred. This simple modification can be easily applied to any DPO-based methods and mitigate over-optimization and objective mismatch, which prior works suffer from. Our experiments simulate the soft preference labels with AI feedback from LLMs and demonstrate that geometric averaging consistently improves performance on standard benchmarks for alignment research. In particular, we observe more preferable responses than binary labels and significant improvements where modestly-confident labels are in the majority.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aiwei Liu, Sheng Guan, Yiming Liu, Leyi Pan, Yifei Zhang, Liancheng Fang, Lijie Wen, Philip S. Yu, Xuming Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Text watermarking for Large Language Models (LLMs) has made significant progress in detecting LLM outputs and preventing misuse. Current watermarking techniques offer high detectability, minimal impact on text quality, and robustness to text editing. However, current researches lack investigation into the imperceptibility of watermarking techniques in LLM services. This is crucial as LLM providers may not want to disclose the presence of watermarks in real-world scenarios, as it could reduce user willingness to use the service and make watermarks more vulnerable to attacks. This work is the first to investigate the imperceptibility of watermarked LLMs. We design an identification algorithm called Water-Probe that detects watermarks through well-designed prompts to the LLM. Our key motivation is that current watermarked LLMs expose consistent biases under the same watermark key, resulting in similar differences across prompts under different watermark keys. Experiments show that almost all mainstream watermarking algorithms are easily identified with our well-designed prompts, while Water-Probe demonstrates a minimal false positive rate for non-watermarked LLMs. Finally, we propose that the key to enhancing the imperceptibility of watermarked LLMs is to increase the randomness of watermark key selection. Based on this, we introduce the Water-Bag strategy, which significantly improves watermark imperceptibility by merging multiple watermark keys.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper focuses on creating synthetic data to improve the quality of image captions. Existing works typically have two shortcomings. First, they caption images from scratch, ignoring existing alt-text metadata, and second, lack transparency if the captioners' training data (e.g. GPT) is unknown. In this paper, we study a principled approach Altogether based on the key idea to edit and re-align existing alt-texts associated with the images. To generate training data, we perform human annotation where annotators start with the existing alt-text and re-align it to the image content in multiple rounds, consequently constructing captions with rich visual concepts. This differs from prior work that carries out human annotation as a one-time description task solely based on images and annotator knowledge. We train a captioner on this data that generalizes the process of re-aligning alt-texts at scale. Our results show our Altogether approach leads to richer image captions that also improve text-to-image generation and zero-shot image classification tasks.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06790">Large-scale moral machine experiment on large language models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Shahrul Zaim bin Ahmad, Kazuhiro Takemoto</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their potential integration into autonomous driving systems necessitates understanding their moral decision-making capabilities. While our previous study examined four prominent LLMs using the Moral Machine experimental framework, the dynamic landscape of LLM development demands a more comprehensive analysis. Here, we evaluate moral judgments across 52 different LLMs, including multiple versions of proprietary models (GPT, Claude, Gemini) and open-source alternatives (Llama, Gemma), to assess their alignment with human moral preferences in autonomous driving scenarios. Using a conjoint analysis framework, we evaluated how closely LLM responses aligned with human preferences in ethical dilemmas and examined the effects of model size, updates, and architecture. Results showed that proprietary models and open-source models exceeding 10 billion parameters demonstrated relatively close alignment with human judgments, with a significant negative correlation between model size and distance from human judgments in open-source models. However, model updates did not consistently improve alignment with human preferences, and many LLMs showed excessive emphasis on specific ethical principles. These findings suggest that while increasing model size may naturally lead to more human-like moral judgments, practical implementation in autonomous driving systems requires careful consideration of the trade-off between judgment quality and computational efficiency. Our comprehensive analysis provides crucial insights for the ethical design of autonomous systems and highlights the importance of considering cultural contexts in AI moral decision-making.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Core Francisco Park, Ekdeep Singh Lubana, Itamar Pres, Hidenori Tanaka</p>
<p>Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) has significantly expanded the general-purpose nature of large language models, allowing them to adapt to novel tasks using merely the inputted context. This has motivated a series of papers that analyze tractable synthetic domains and postulate precise mechanisms that may underlie ICL. However, the use of relatively distinct setups that often lack a sequence modeling nature to them makes it unclear how general the reported insights from such studies are. Motivated by this, we propose a synthetic sequence modeling task that involves learning to simulate a finite mixture of Markov chains. As we show, models trained on this task reproduce most well-known results on ICL, hence offering a unified setting for studying the concept. Building on this setup, we demonstrate we can explain a model's behavior by decomposing it into four broad algorithms that combine a fuzzy retrieval vs. inference approach with either unigram or bigram statistics of the context. These algorithms engage in a competition dynamics to dominate model behavior, with the precise experimental conditions dictating which algorithm ends up superseding others: e.g., we find merely varying context size or amount of training yields (at times sharp) transitions between which algorithm dictates the model behavior, revealing a mechanism that explains the transient nature of ICL. In this sense, we argue ICL is best thought of as a mixture of different algorithms, each with its own peculiarities, instead of a monolithic capability. This also implies that making general claims about ICL that hold universally across all settings may be infeasible.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has proven effective in enhancing the instruction-following capabilities of large language models; however, it remains underexplored in the cross-modality domain. As the number of modalities increases, aligning all-modality models with human intentions -- such as instruction following -- becomes a pressing challenge. In this work, we make the first attempt to fine-tune all-modality models (i.e. input and output with any modality, also named any-to-any models) using human preference data across all modalities (including text, image, audio, and video), ensuring its behavior aligns with human intentions. This endeavor presents several challenges. First, there is no large-scale all-modality human preference data in existing open-source resources, as most datasets are limited to specific modalities, predominantly text and image. Secondly, the effectiveness of binary preferences in RLHF for post-training alignment in complex all-modality scenarios remains an unexplored area. Finally, there is a lack of a systematic framework to evaluate the capabilities of all-modality models, particularly regarding modality selection and synergy. To address these challenges, we propose the align-anything framework, which includes meticulously annotated 200k all-modality human preference data. Then, we introduce an alignment method that learns from unified language feedback, effectively capturing complex modality-specific human preferences and enhancing the model's instruction-following capabilities. Furthermore, to assess performance improvements in all-modality models after post-training alignment, we construct a challenging all-modality capability evaluation framework -- eval-anything. All data, models, and code frameworks have been open-sourced for the community. For more details, please refer to https://github.com/PKU-Alignment/align-anything.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taewhan Kim, Soeun Lee, Si-Woo Kim, Dong-Jin Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent lightweight image captioning models using retrieved data mainly focus on text prompts. However, previous works only utilize the retrieved text as text prompts, and the visual information relies only on the CLIP visual embedding. Because of this issue, there is a limitation that the image descriptions inherent in the prompt are not sufficiently reflected in the visual embedding space. To tackle this issue, we propose ViPCap, a novel retrieval text-based visual prompt for lightweight image captioning. ViPCap leverages the retrieved text with image information as visual prompts to enhance the ability of the model to capture relevant visual information. By mapping text prompts into the CLIP space and generating multiple randomized Gaussian distributions, our method leverages sampling to explore randomly augmented distributions and effectively retrieves the semantic features that contain image information. These retrieved features are integrated into the image and designated as the visual prompt, leading to performance improvements on the datasets such as COCO, Flickr30k, and NoCaps. Experimental results demonstrate that ViPCap significantly outperforms prior lightweight captioning models in efficiency and effectiveness, demonstrating the potential for a plug-and-play solution.</p>

<p>Abstract: Language model alignment has become a critical step in training modern generative language models. The goal of alignment is to finetune a reference model such that the win rate of a sample from the aligned model over a sample from the reference model is high, subject to a KL divergence constraint. Today, we are increasingly using inference-time algorithms (e.g., Best-of-N, controlled decoding, tree search) to decode from language models rather than standard sampling. However, the alignment objective does not capture such inference-time decoding procedures. We show that the existing alignment framework is sub-optimal in view of such inference-time methods. We then modify the alignment objective and propose a framework for inference-aware alignment (IAPO). We prove that for any inference-time decoding algorithm, the optimal solution that optimizes the inference-time win rate of the aligned policy against the reference policy is the solution to the typical RLHF problem with a transformation of the reward. This motivates us to provide the KL-regularized calibrate-and-transform RL (CTRL) algorithm to solve this problem, which involves a reward calibration step and a KL-regularized reward maximization step with a transformation of the calibrated reward. We particularize our study to two important inference-time strategies: best-of-N sampling and best-of-N jailbreaking, where N responses are sampled from the model and the one with the highest or lowest reward is selected. We propose specific transformations for these strategies and demonstrate that our framework offers significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods for language model alignment. Empirically, we outperform baselines that are designed without taking inference-time decoding into consideration by 8-12% and 4-9% on inference-time win rates over the Anthropic helpfulness and harmlessness dialog benchmark datasets.</p>
