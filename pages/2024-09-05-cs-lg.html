<p><b>Authors:</b> Yangfan Hu, Qian Zheng, Guoqi Li, Huajin Tang, Gang Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized artificial intelligence (AI), achieving remarkable progress in fields such as computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing. Moreover, the recent success of large language models (LLMs) has fueled a surge in research on large-scale neural networks. However, the escalating demand for computing resources and energy consumption has prompted the search for energy-efficient alternatives. Inspired by the human brain, spiking neural networks (SNNs) promise energy-efficient computation with event-driven spikes. To provide future directions toward building energy-efficient large SNN models, we present a survey of existing methods for developing deep spiking neural networks, with a focus on emerging Spiking Transformers. Our main contributions are as follows: (1) an overview of learning methods for deep spiking neural networks, categorized by ANN-to-SNN conversion and direct training with surrogate gradients; (2) an overview of network architectures for deep spiking neural networks, categorized by deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and Transformer architecture; and (3) a comprehensive comparison of state-of-the-art deep SNNs with a focus on emerging Spiking Transformers. We then further discuss and outline future directions toward large-scale SNNs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michiel Kamphuis</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents Tiny-toxic-detector, a compact transformer-based model designed for toxic content detection. Despite having only 2.1 million parameters, Tiny-toxic-detector achieves competitive performance on benchmark datasets, with 90.97% accuracy on ToxiGen and 86.98% accuracy on the Jigsaw dataset, rivaling models over 50 times its size. This efficiency enables deployment in resource-constrained environments, addressing the need for effective content moderation tools that balance performance with computational efficiency. The model architecture features 4 transformer encoder layers, each with 2 attention heads, an embedding dimension of 64, and a feedforward dimension of 128. Trained on both public and private datasets, Tiny-toxic-detector demonstrates the potential of efficient, task-specific models for addressing online toxicity. The paper covers the model architecture, training process, performance benchmarks, and limitations, underscoring its suitability for applications such as social media monitoring and content moderation. By achieving results comparable to much larger models while significantly reducing computational demands, Tiny-toxic-detector represents progress toward more sustainable and scalable AI-driven content moderation solutions.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02118">TSO: Self-Training with Scaled Preference Optimization</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaihui Chen, Hao Yi, Qingyang Li, Tianyu Qi, Yulan Hu, Fuzheng Zhang, Yong Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Enhancing the conformity of large language models (LLMs) to human preferences remains an ongoing research challenge. Recently, offline approaches such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have gained prominence as attractive options due to offering effective improvement in simple, efficient, and stable without interactions with reward models. However, these offline preference optimization methods highly rely on the quality of pairwise preference samples. Meanwhile, numerous iterative methods require additional training of reward models to select positive and negative samples from the model's own generated responses for preference learning. Furthermore, as LLMs' capabilities advance, it is quite challenging to continuously construct high-quality positive and negative preference instances from the model's outputs due to the lack of diversity. To tackle these challenges, we propose TSO, or Self-Training with Scaled Preference Optimization, a framework for preference optimization that conducts self-training preference learning without training an additional reward model. TSO enhances the diversity of responses by constructing a model matrix and incorporating human preference responses. Furthermore, TSO introduces corrections for model preference errors through human and AI feedback. Finally, TSO adopts iterative and dual clip reward strategies to update the reference model and its responses, adaptively adjusting preference data and balancing the optimization process. Experimental results demonstrate that TSO outperforms existing mainstream methods on various alignment evaluation benchmarks, providing practical insight into preference data construction and model training strategies in the alignment domain.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02119">CoRA: Optimizing Low-Rank Adaptation with Common Subspace of Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaojun Xiao, Sen Shen, Qiming Bao, Hongfei Rong, Kairui Liu, Zhongsheng Wang, Jiamou Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: In fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), conserving computational resources while maintaining effectiveness and improving outcomes within the same computational constraints is crucial. The Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) strategy balances efficiency and performance in fine-tuning large models by reducing the number of trainable parameters and computational costs. However, current advancements in LoRA might be focused on its fine-tuning methodologies, with not as much exploration as might be expected into further compression of LoRA. Since most of LoRA's parameters might still be superfluous, this may lead to unnecessary wastage of computational resources. In this paper, we propose \textbf{CoRA}: leveraging shared knowledge to optimize LoRA training by substituting its matrix $B$ with a common subspace from large models. Our two-fold method includes (1) Freezing the substitute matrix $B$ to halve parameters while training matrix $A$ for specific tasks and (2) Using the substitute matrix $B$ as an enhanced initial state for the original matrix $B$, achieving improved results with the same parameters. Our experiments show that the first approach achieves the same efficacy as the original LoRA fine-tuning while being more efficient than halving parameters. At the same time, the second approach has some improvements compared to LoRA's original fine-tuning performance. They generally attest to the effectiveness of our work.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02122">Deep Knowledge-Infusion For Explainable Depression Detection</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sumit Dalal, Sarika Jain, Mayank Dave</p>
<p>Abstract: Discovering individuals depression on social media has become increasingly important. Researchers employed ML/DL or lexicon-based methods for automated depression detection. Lexicon based methods, explainable and easy to implement, match words from user posts in a depression dictionary without considering contexts. While the DL models can leverage contextual information, their black-box nature limits their adoption in the domain. Though surrogate models like LIME and SHAP can produce explanations for DL models, the explanations are suitable for the developer and of limited use to the end user. We propose a Knolwedge-infused Neural Network (KiNN) incorporating domain-specific knowledge from DepressionFeature ontology (DFO) in a neural network to endow the model with user-level explainability regarding concepts and processes the clinician understands. Further, commonsense knowledge from the Commonsense Transformer (COMET) trained on ATOMIC is also infused to consider the generic emotional aspects of user posts in depression detection. The model is evaluated on three expertly curated datasets related to depression. We observed the model to have a statistically significant (p<0.1) boost in performance over the best domain-specific model, MentalBERT, across CLEF e-Risk (25% MCC increase, 12% F1 increase). A similar trend is observed across the PRIMATE dataset, where the proposed model performed better than MentalBERT (2.5% MCC increase, 19% F1 increase). The observations confirm the generated explanations to be informative for MHPs compared to post hoc model explanations. Results demonstrated that the user-level explainability of KiNN also surpasses the performance of baseline models and can provide explanations where other baselines fall short. Infusing the domain and commonsense knowledge in KiNN enhances the ability of models like GPT-3.5 to generate application-relevant explanations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shengchen Zhu, Yiming Chen, Peiying Yu, Xiang Qu, Yuxiao Zhou, Yiming Ma, Zhizhan Zhao, Yukai Liu, Hao Mi, Bin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate weather forecasting is essential for understanding and mitigating weather-related impacts. In this paper, we present PuYun, an autoregressive cascade model that leverages large kernel attention convolutional networks. The model's design inherently supports extended weather prediction horizons while broadening the effective receptive field. The integration of large kernel attention mechanisms within the convolutional layers enhances the model's capacity to capture fine-grained spatial details, thereby improving its predictive accuracy for meteorological phenomena.
  We introduce PuYun, comprising PuYun-Short for 0-5 day forecasts and PuYun-Medium for 5-10 day predictions. This approach enhances the accuracy of 10-day weather forecasting. Through evaluation, we demonstrate that PuYun-Short alone surpasses the performance of both GraphCast and FuXi-Short in generating accurate 10-day forecasts. Specifically, on the 10th day, PuYun-Short reduces the RMSE for Z500 to 720 $m^2/s^2$, compared to 732 $m^2/s^2$ for GraphCast and 740 $m^2/s^2$ for FuXi-Short. Additionally, the RMSE for T2M is reduced to 2.60 K, compared to 2.63 K for GraphCast and 2.65 K for FuXi-Short. Furthermore, when employing a cascaded approach by integrating PuYun-Short and PuYun-Medium, our method achieves superior results compared to the combined performance of FuXi-Short and FuXi-Medium. On the 10th day, the RMSE for Z500 is further reduced to 638 $m^2/s^2$, compared to 641 $m^2/s^2$ for FuXi. These findings underscore the effectiveness of our model ensemble in advancing medium-range weather prediction. Our training code and model will be open-sourced.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02124">TrajWeaver: Trajectory Recovery with State Propagation Diffusion Model</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinming Wang, Hai Wang, Hongkai Wen, Geyong Min, Man Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: With the proliferation of location-aware devices, large amount of trajectories have been generated when agents such as people, vehicles and goods flow around the urban environment. These raw trajectories, typically collected from various sources such as GPS in cars, personal mobile devices, and public transport, are often sparse and fragmented due to limited sampling rates, infrastructure coverage and data loss. In this context, trajectory recovery aims to reconstruct such sparse raw trajectories into their dense and continuous counterparts, so that fine-grained movement of agents across space and time can be captured faithfully. Existing trajectory recovery approaches typically rely on the prior knowledge of travel mode or motion patterns, and often fail in densely populated urban areas where accurate maps are absent. In this paper, we present a new recovery framework called TrajWeaver based on probabilistic diffusion models, which is able to recover dense and refined trajectories from the sparse raw ones, conditioned on various auxiliary features such as Areas of Interest along the way, user identity and waybill information. The core of TrajWeaver is a novel State Propagation Diffusion Model (SPDM), which introduces a new state propagation mechanism on top of the standard diffusion models, so that knowledge computed in earlier diffusion steps can be reused later, improving the recovery performance while reducing the number of steps needed. Extensive experiments show that the proposed TrajWeaver can recover from raw trajectories of various lengths, sparsity levels and heterogeneous travel modes, and outperform the state-of-the-art baselines significantly in recovery accuracy.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Craig Lawrie, Lorenzo Mansi</p>
<p>Abstract: Motivated by the enumeration of the BPS spectra of certain 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric quantum field theories, obtained from the compactification of 6d superconformal field theories on three-manifolds, we study the homeomorphism problem for a class of graph-manifolds using Graph Neural Network techniques. Utilizing the JSJ decomposition, a unique representation via a plumbing graph is extracted from a graph-manifold. Homeomorphic graph-manifolds are related via a sequence of von Neumann moves on this graph; the algorithmic application of these moves can determine if two graphs correspond to homeomorphic graph-manifolds in super-polynomial time. However, by employing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), the same problem can be addressed, at the cost of accuracy, in polynomial time. We build a dataset composed of pairs of plumbing graphs, together with a hidden label encoding whether the pair is homeomorphic. We train and benchmark a variety of network architectures within a supervised learning setting by testing different combinations of two convolutional layers (GEN, GCN, GAT, NNConv), followed by an aggregation layer and a classification layer. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the different GNNs for this homeomorphism problem.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Senthil Kumar Jagatheesaperumal, Mohamed Rahouti, Ali Alfatemi, Nasir Ghani, Vu Khanh Quy, Abdellah Chehri</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) represents a paradigm shift in machine learning, allowing collaborative model training while keeping data localized. This approach is particularly pertinent in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) context, where data privacy, security, and efficient utilization of distributed resources are paramount. The essence of FL in IIoT lies in its ability to learn from diverse, distributed data sources without requiring central data storage, thus enhancing privacy and reducing communication overheads. However, despite its potential, several challenges impede the widespread adoption of FL in IIoT, notably in ensuring interpretability and robustness. This article focuses on enabling trustworthy FL in IIoT by bridging the gap between interpretability and robustness, which is crucial for enhancing trust, improving decision-making, and ensuring compliance with regulations. Moreover, the design strategies summarized in this article ensure that FL systems in IIoT are transparent and reliable, vital in industrial settings where decisions have significant safety and economic impacts. The case studies in the IIoT environment driven by trustworthy FL models are provided, wherein the practical insights of trustworthy communications between IIoT systems and their end users are highlighted.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02128">The Application of Artificial Neural Network Model to Predicting the Acid Mine Drainage from Long-Term Lab Scale Kinetic Test</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Sonny Abfertiawan, Muchammad Daniyal Kautsar, Faiz Hasan, Yoseph Palinggi, Kris Pranoto</p>
<p>Abstract: Acid mine drainage (AMD) is one of the common environmental problems in the coal mining industry that was formed by the oxidation of sulfide minerals in the overburden or waste rock. The prediction of acid generation through AMD is important to do in overburden management and planning the post-mining land use. One of the methods used to predict AMD is a lab-scale kinetic test to determine the rate of acid formation over time using representative samples in the field. However, this test requires a long-time procedure and large amount of chemical reagents lead to inefficient cost. On the other hand, there is potential for machine learning to learn the pattern behind the lab-scale kinetic test data. This study describes an approach to use artificial neural network (ANN) modeling to predict the result from lab-scale kinetic tests. Various ANN model is used based on 83 weeks experiments of lab-scale kinetic tests with 100\% potential acid-forming rock. The model approaches the monitoring of pH, ORP, conductivity, TDS, sulfate, and heavy metals (Fe and Mn). The overall Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) obtained in this study was 0.99 on training and validation data, indicating a strong correlation and accurate prediction compared to the actual lab-scale kinetic tests data. This show the ANN ability to learn patterns, trends, and seasonality from past data for accurate forecasting, thereby highlighting its significant contribution to solving AMD problems. This research is also expected to establish the foundation for a new approach to predict AMD, with time efficient, accurate, and cost-effectiveness in future applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study analyzes the Ames Housing Dataset using CatBoost and LightGBM models to explore feature importance and causal relationships in housing price prediction. We examine the correlation between SHAP values and EconML predictions, achieving high accuracy in price forecasting. Our analysis reveals a moderate Spearman rank correlation of 0.48 between SHAP-based feature importance and causally significant features, highlighting the complexity of aligning predictive modeling with causal understanding in housing market analysis. Through extensive causal analysis, including heterogeneity exploration and policy tree interpretation, we provide insights into how specific features like porches impact housing prices across various scenarios. This work underscores the need for integrated approaches that combine predictive power with causal insights in real estate valuation, offering valuable guidance for stakeholders in the industry.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samer Francy, Raghubir Singh</p>
<p>Abstract: This work evaluates the compression techniques on ConvNeXt models in image classification tasks using the CIFAR-10 dataset. Structured pruning, unstructured pruning, and dynamic quantization methods are evaluated to reduce model size and computational complexity while maintaining accuracy. The experiments, conducted on cloud-based platforms and edge device, assess the performance of these techniques. Results show significant reductions in model size, with up to 75% reduction achieved using structured pruning techniques. Additionally, dynamic quantization achieves a reduction of up to 95% in the number of parameters. Fine-tuned models exhibit improved compression performance, indicating the benefits of pre-training in conjunction with compression techniques. Unstructured pruning methods reveal trends in accuracy and compression, with limited reductions in computational complexity. The combination of OTOV3 pruning and dynamic quantization further enhances compression performance, resulting 89.7% reduction in size, 95% reduction with number of parameters and MACs, and 3.8% increase with accuracy. The deployment of the final compressed model on edge device demonstrates high accuracy 92.5% and low inference time 20 ms, validating the effectiveness of compression techniques for real-world edge computing applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuma Ichikawa, Yamato Arai</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning-based methods have gained attention as general-purpose solvers because they can automatically learn problem-specific heuristics, reducing the need for manually crafted heuristics. However, these methods often face challenges with scalability. To address these issues, the improved Sampling algorithm for Combinatorial Optimization (iSCO) using discrete Langevin dynamics has been proposed, demonstrating better performance than several learning-based solvers. This study proposes a different approach that integrates gradient-based update through continuous relaxation, combined with Quasi-Quantum Annealing (QQA). QQA smoothly transitions the objective function from a simple convex form, where half-integral solutions dominate, to the original objective function, where the variables are restricted to 0 or 1. Furthermore, we incorporate parallel run communication leveraging GPUs, enhancing exploration capabilities and accelerating convergence. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our approach is a competitive general-purpose solver, achieving comparable performance to iSCO across various benchmark problems. Notably, our method exhibits superior trade-offs between speed and solution quality for large-scale instances compared to iSCO, commercial solvers, and specialized algorithms.</p>

<p>Abstract: Background: This study aimed to evaluate and compare the performance of classical machine learning models (CMLs) and large language models (LLMs) in predicting mortality associated with COVID-19 by utilizing a high-dimensional tabular dataset.
  Materials and Methods: We analyzed data from 9,134 COVID-19 patients collected across four hospitals. Seven CML models, including XGBoost and random forest (RF), were trained and evaluated. The structured data was converted into text for zero-shot classification by eight LLMs, including GPT-4 and Mistral-7b. Additionally, Mistral-7b was fine-tuned using the QLoRA approach to enhance its predictive capabilities.
  Results: Among the CML models, XGBoost and RF achieved the highest accuracy, with F1 scores of 0.87 for internal validation and 0.83 for external validation. In the LLM category, GPT-4 was the top performer with an F1 score of 0.43. Fine-tuning Mistral-7b significantly improved its recall from 1% to 79%, resulting in an F1 score of 0.74, which was stable during external validation.
  Conclusion: While LLMs show moderate performance in zero-shot classification, fine-tuning can significantly enhance their effectiveness, potentially aligning them closer to CML models. However, CMLs still outperform LLMs in high-dimensional tabular data tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuohan Wang, Carmine Ventre</p>
<p>Abstract: Financial time series often exhibit low signal-to-noise ratio, posing significant challenges for accurate data interpretation and prediction and ultimately decision making. Generative models have gained attention as powerful tools for simulating and predicting intricate data patterns, with the diffusion model emerging as a particularly effective method. This paper introduces a novel approach utilizing the diffusion model as a denoiser for financial time series in order to improve data predictability and trading performance. By leveraging the forward and reverse processes of the conditional diffusion model to add and remove noise progressively, we reconstruct original data from noisy inputs. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that diffusion model-based denoised time series significantly enhance the performance on downstream future return classification tasks. Moreover, trading signals derived from the denoised data yield more profitable trades with fewer transactions, thereby minimizing transaction costs and increasing overall trading efficiency. Finally, we show that by using classifiers trained on denoised time series, we can recognize the noising state of the market and obtain excess return.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianxu Liu, Yanbin Wang, Jianguo Sun, Ye Tian, Yanyu Huang, Tao Xue, Peiyue Li, Yiwei Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: As blockchain technology rapidly evolves, the demand for enhanced efficiency, security, and scalability grows.Transformer models, as powerful deep learning architectures,have shown unprecedented potential in addressing various blockchain challenges. However, a systematic review of Transformer applications in blockchain is lacking. This paper aims to fill this research gap by surveying over 200 relevant papers, comprehensively reviewing practical cases and research progress of Transformers in blockchain applications. Our survey covers key areas including anomaly detection, smart contract security analysis, cryptocurrency prediction and trend analysis, and code summary generation. To clearly articulate the advancements of Transformers across various blockchain domains, we adopt a domain-oriented classification system, organizing and introducing representative methods based on major challenges in current blockchain research. For each research domain,we first introduce its background and objectives, then review previous representative methods and analyze their limitations,and finally introduce the advancements brought by Transformer models. Furthermore, we explore the challenges of utilizing Transformer, such as data privacy, model complexity, and real-time processing requirements. Finally, this article proposes future research directions, emphasizing the importance of exploring the Transformer architecture in depth to adapt it to specific blockchain applications, and discusses its potential role in promoting the development of blockchain technology. This review aims to provide new perspectives and a research foundation for the integrated development of blockchain technology and machine learning, supporting further innovation and application expansion of blockchain technology.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Suhong Moon, Siddharth Jha, Lutfi Eren Erdogan, Sehoon Kim, Woosang Lim, Kurt Keutzer, Amir Gholami</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in function calling and tool use have significantly enhanced the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by enabling them to interact with external information sources and execute complex tasks. However, the limited context window of LLMs presents challenges when a large number of tools are available, necessitating efficient methods to manage prompt length and maintain accuracy. Existing approaches, such as fine-tuning LLMs or leveraging their reasoning capabilities, either require frequent retraining or incur significant latency overhead. A more efficient solution involves training smaller models to retrieve the most relevant tools for a given query, although this requires high quality, domain-specific data. To address those challenges, we present a novel framework for generating synthetic data for tool retrieval applications and an efficient data-driven tool retrieval strategy using small encoder models. Empowered by LLMs, we create ToolBank, a new tool retrieval dataset that reflects real human user usages. For tool retrieval methodologies, we propose novel approaches: (1) Tool2Vec: usage-driven tool embedding generation for tool retrieval, (2) ToolRefiner: a staged retrieval method that iteratively improves the quality of retrieved tools, and (3) MLC: framing tool retrieval as a multi-label classification problem. With these new methods, we achieve improvements of up to 27.28 in Recall@K on the ToolBench dataset and 30.5 in Recall@K on ToolBank. Additionally, we present further experimental results to rigorously validate our methods. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/SqueezeAILab/Tool2Vec}</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zekang Yang, Hong Liu, Xiangdong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Computer-aided cancer survival risk prediction plays an important role in the timely treatment of patients. This is a challenging weakly supervised ordinal regression task associated with multiple clinical factors involved such as pathological images, genomic data and etc. In this paper, we propose a new training method, multimodal object-level contrast learning, for cancer survival risk prediction. First, we construct contrast learning pairs based on the survival risk relationship among the samples in the training sample set. Then we introduce the object-level contrast learning method to train the survival risk predictor. We further extend it to the multimodal scenario by applying cross-modal constrast. Considering the heterogeneity of pathological images and genomics data, we construct a multimodal survival risk predictor employing attention-based and self-normalizing based nerural network respectively. Finally, the survival risk predictor trained by our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two public multimodal cancer datasets for survival risk prediction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dexin Duan, Peilin liu, Fei Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: On-device computing, or edge computing, is becoming increasingly important for remote sensing, particularly in applications like deep network-based perception on on-orbit satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). In these scenarios, two brain-like capabilities are crucial for remote sensing models: (1) high energy efficiency, allowing the model to operate on edge devices with limited computing resources, and (2) online adaptation, enabling the model to quickly adapt to environmental variations, weather changes, and sensor drift. This work addresses these needs by proposing an online adaptation framework based on spiking neural networks (SNNs) for remote sensing. Starting with a pretrained SNN model, we design an efficient, unsupervised online adaptation algorithm, which adopts an approximation of the BPTT algorithm and only involves forward-in-time computation that significantly reduces the computational complexity of SNN adaptation learning. Besides, we propose an adaptive activation scaling scheme to boost online SNN adaptation performance, particularly in low time-steps. Furthermore, for the more challenging remote sensing detection task, we propose a confidence-based instance weighting scheme, which substantially improves adaptation performance in the detection task. To our knowledge, this work is the first to address the online adaptation of SNNs. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets across classification, segmentation, and detection tasks demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms existing domain adaptation and domain generalization approaches under varying weather conditions. The proposed method enables energy-efficient and fast online adaptation on edge devices, and has much potential in applications such as remote perception on on-orbit satellites and UAV.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyuan Li, Mathias Funk, Nezihe Merve G\"urel, Aaqib Saeed</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a prominent method for collaboratively training machine learning models using local data from edge devices, all while keeping data decentralized. However, accounting for the quality of data contributed by local clients remains a critical challenge in FL, as local data are often susceptible to corruption by various forms of noise and perturbations, which compromise the aggregation process and lead to a subpar global model. In this work, we focus on addressing the problem of noisy data in the input space, an under-explored area compared to the label noise. We propose a comprehensive assessment of client input in the gradient space, inspired by the distinct disparity observed between the density of gradient norm distributions of models trained on noisy and clean input data. Based on this observation, we introduce a straightforward yet effective approach to identify clients with low-quality data at the initial stage of FL. Furthermore, we propose a noise-aware FL aggregation method, namely Federated Noise-Sifting (FedNS), which can be used as a plug-in approach in conjunction with widely used FL strategies. Our extensive evaluation on diverse benchmark datasets under different federated settings demonstrates the efficacy of FedNS. Our method effortlessly integrates with existing FL strategies, enhancing the global model's performance by up to 13.68% in IID and 15.85% in non-IID settings when learning from noisy decentralized data.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02228">Unforgettable Generalization in Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Eric Zhang, Leshem Chosen, Jacob Andreas</p>
<p>Abstract: When language models (LMs) are trained to forget (or "unlearn'') a skill, how precisely does their behavior change? We study the behavior of transformer LMs in which tasks have been forgotten via fine-tuning on randomized labels. Such LMs learn to generate near-random predictions for individual examples in the "training'' set used for forgetting. Across tasks, however, LMs exhibit extreme variability in whether LM predictions change on examples outside the training set. In some tasks (like entailment classification), forgetting generalizes robustly, and causes models to produce uninformative predictions on new task instances; in other tasks (like physical commonsense reasoning and scientific question answering) forgetting affects only the training examples, and models continue to perform the "forgotten'' task accurately even for examples very similar to those that appeared in the training set. Dataset difficulty is not predictive of whether a behavior can be forgotten; instead, generalization in forgetting is (weakly) predicted by the confidence of LMs' initial task predictions and the variability of LM representations of training data, with low confidence and low variability both associated with greater generalization. Perhaps most surprisingly, random-label forgetting appears to be somewhat insensitive to the contents of the training set: for example, models trained on science questions with random labels continue to answer other science questions accurately, but begin to produce random labels on entailment classification tasks. Finally, we show that even generalizable forgetting is shallow: linear probes trained on LMs' representations can still perform tasks reliably after forgetting. Our results highlight the difficulty and unpredictability of performing targeted skill removal from models via fine-tuning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matthew Repasky, He Wang, Yao Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Police patrol units need to split their time between performing preventive patrol and being dispatched to serve emergency incidents. In the existing literature, patrol and dispatch decisions are often studied separately. We consider joint optimization of these two decisions to improve police operations efficiency and reduce response time to emergency calls. Methodology/results: We propose a novel method for jointly optimizing multi-agent patrol and dispatch to learn policies yielding rapid response times. Our method treats each patroller as an independent Q-learner (agent) with a shared deep Q-network that represents the state-action values. The dispatching decisions are chosen using mixed-integer programming and value function approximation from combinatorial action spaces. We demonstrate that this heterogeneous multi-agent reinforcement learning approach is capable of learning joint policies that outperform those optimized for patrol or dispatch alone. Managerial Implications: Policies jointly optimized for patrol and dispatch can lead to more effective service while targeting demonstrably flexible objectives, such as those encouraging efficiency and equity in response.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali Lotfi, Ian McQuillan</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents two novel theorems that address two open problems in stochastic Lindenmayer-system (L-system) inference, specifically focusing on the construction of an optimal stochastic L-system capable of generating a given sequence of strings. The first theorem delineates a method for crafting a stochastic L-system that maximizes the likelihood of producing a given sequence of words through a singular derivation. Furthermore, the second theorem determines the stochastic L-systems with the highest probability of producing a given sequence of words with multiple possible derivations. From these, we introduce an algorithm to infer an optimal stochastic L-system from a given sequence. This algorithm incorporates sophisticated optimization techniques, such as interior point methods, ensuring production of a stochastically optimal stochastic L-system suitable for generating the given sequence. This allows for the use of using stochastic L-systems as model for machine learning using only positive data for training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hassan El Alami, Danda B. Rawat</p>
<p>Abstract: The development of satellite constellation applications is rapidly advancing due to increasing user demands, reduced operational costs, and technological advancements. However, a significant gap in the existing literature concerns reconfiguration and retasking issues within satellite constellations, which is the primary focus of our research. In this work, we critically assess the impact of satellite failures on constellation performance and the associated task requirements. To facilitate this analysis, we introduce a system modeling approach for GPS satellite constellations, enabling an investigation into performance dynamics and task distribution strategies, particularly in scenarios where satellite failures occur during mission-critical operations. Additionally, we introduce reinforcement learning (RL) techniques, specifically Q-learning, Policy Gradient, Deep Q-Network (DQN), and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), for managing satellite constellations, addressing the challenges posed by reconfiguration and retasking following satellite failures. Our results demonstrate that DQN and PPO achieve effective outcomes in terms of average rewards, task completion rates, and response times.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zijian Chen, Maria Varkanitsa, Prakash Ishwar, Janusz Konrad, Margrit Betke, Swathi Kiran, Archana Venkataraman</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a lesion-aware graph neural network (LEGNet) to predict language ability from resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) connectivity in patients with post-stroke aphasia. Our model integrates three components: an edge-based learning module that encodes functional connectivity between brain regions, a lesion encoding module, and a subgraph learning module that leverages functional similarities for prediction. We use synthetic data derived from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) for hyperparameter tuning and model pretraining. We then evaluate the performance using repeated 10-fold cross-validation on an in-house neuroimaging dataset of post-stroke aphasia. Our results demonstrate that LEGNet outperforms baseline deep learning methods in predicting language ability. LEGNet also exhibits superior generalization ability when tested on a second in-house dataset that was acquired under a slightly different neuroimaging protocol. Taken together, the results of this study highlight the potential of LEGNet in effectively learning the relationships between rs-fMRI connectivity and language ability in a patient cohort with brain lesions for improved post-stroke aphasia evaluation.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02313">On the Benefits of Memory for Modeling Time-Dependent PDEs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ricardo Buitrago Ruiz, Tanya Marwah, Albert Gu, Andrej Risteski</p>
<p>Abstract: Data-driven techniques have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional numerical methods for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). These techniques frequently offer a better trade-off between computational cost and accuracy for many PDE families of interest. For time-dependent PDEs, existing methodologies typically treat PDEs as Markovian systems, i.e., the evolution of the system only depends on the ``current state'', and not the past states. However, distortion of the input signals -- e.g., due to discretization or low-pass filtering -- can render the evolution of the distorted signals non-Markovian. In this work, motivated by the Mori-Zwanzig theory of model reduction, we investigate the impact of architectures with memory for modeling PDEs: that is, when past states are explicitly used to predict the future. We introduce Memory Neural Operator (MemNO), a network based on the recent SSM architectures and Fourier Neural Operator (FNO). We empirically demonstrate on a variety of PDE families of interest that when the input is given on a low-resolution grid, MemNO significantly outperforms the baselines without memory, achieving more than 6 times less error on unseen PDEs. Via a combination of theory and experiments, we show that the effect of memory is particularly significant when the solution of the PDE has high frequency Fourier components (e.g., low-viscosity fluid dynamics), and it also increases robustness to observation noise.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Defu Cao, Wen Ye, Yizhou Zhang, Yan Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: With recent advances in building foundation models for texts and video data, there is a surge of interest in foundation models for time series. A family of models have been developed, utilizing a temporal auto-regressive generative Transformer architecture, whose effectiveness has been proven in Large Language Models. While the empirical results are promising, almost all existing time series foundation models have only been tested on well-curated ``benchmark'' datasets very similar to texts. However, real-world time series exhibit unique challenges, such as variable channel sizes across domains, missing values, and varying signal sampling intervals due to the multi-resolution nature of real-world data. Additionally, the uni-directional nature of temporally auto-regressive decoding limits the incorporation of domain knowledge, such as physical laws expressed as partial differential equations (PDEs). To address these challenges, we introduce the Time Diffusion Transformer (TimeDiT), a general foundation model for time series that employs a denoising diffusion paradigm instead of temporal auto-regressive generation. TimeDiT leverages the Transformer architecture to capture temporal dependencies and employs diffusion processes to generate high-quality candidate samples without imposing stringent assumptions on the target distribution via novel masking schemes and a channel alignment strategy. Furthermore, we propose a finetuning-free model editing strategy that allows the seamless integration of external knowledge during the sampling process without updating any model parameters. Extensive experiments conducted on a varity of tasks such as forecasting, imputation, and anomaly detection, demonstrate the effectiveness of TimeDiT.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sushant More, Priya Kotwal, Sujith Chappidi, Dinesh Mandalapu, Chris Khawand</p>
<p>Abstract: Causal Impact (CI) of customer actions are broadly used across the industry to inform both short- and long-term investment decisions of various types. In this paper, we apply the double machine learning (DML) methodology to estimate the CI values across 100s of customer actions of business interest and 100s of millions of customers. We operationalize DML through a causal ML library based on Spark with a flexible, JSON-driven model configuration approach to estimate CI at scale (i.e., across hundred of actions and millions of customers). We outline the DML methodology and implementation, and associated benefits over the traditional potential outcomes based CI model. We show population-level as well as customer-level CI values along with confidence intervals. The validation metrics show a 2.2% gain over the baseline methods and a 2.5X gain in the computational time. Our contribution is to advance the scalable application of CI, while also providing an interface that allows faster experimentation, cross-platform support, ability to onboard new use cases, and improves accessibility of underlying code for partner teams.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we develop a systematic deep learning approach to solve two-dimensional (2D) stationary quantum droplets (QDs) and investigate their wave propagation in the 2D amended Gross-Pitaevskii equation with Lee-Huang-Yang correction and two kinds of potentials. Firstly, we use the initial-value iterative neural network (IINN) algorithm for 2D stationary quantum droplets of stationary equations. Then the learned stationary QDs are used as the initial value conditions for physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to explore their evolutions in the some space-time region. Especially, we consider two types of potentials, one is the 2D quadruple-well Gaussian potential and the other is the PT-symmetric HO-Gaussian potential, which lead to spontaneous symmetry breaking and the generation of multi-component QDs. The used deep learning method can also be applied to study wave propagations of other nonlinear physical models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sepanta Zeighami, Zac Wellmer, Aditya Parameswaran</p>
<p>Abstract: $k$-Nearest Neighbor search on dense vector embeddings ($k$-NN retrieval) from pre-trained embedding models is the predominant retrieval method for text and images, as well as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines. In practice, application developers often fine-tune the embeddings to improve their accuracy on the dataset and query workload in hand. Existing approaches either fine-tune the pre-trained model itself or, more efficiently, but at the cost of accuracy, train adaptor models to transform the output of the pre-trained model. We present NUDGE, a family of novel non-parametric embedding fine-tuning approaches that are significantly more accurate and efficient than both sets of existing approaches. NUDGE directly modifies the embeddings of data records to maximize the accuracy of $k$-NN retrieval. We present a thorough theoretical and experimental study of NUDGE's non-parametric approach. We show that even though the underlying problem is NP-Hard, constrained variations can be solved efficiently. These constraints additionally ensure that the changes to the embeddings are modest, avoiding large distortions to the semantics learned during pre-training. In experiments across five pre-trained models and nine standard text and image retrieval datasets, NUDGE runs in minutes and often improves NDCG@10 by more than 10% over existing fine-tuning methods. On average, NUDGE provides 3.3x and 4.3x higher increase in accuracy and runs 200x and 3x faster, respectively, over fine-tuning the pre-trained model and training adaptors.</p>

PEFT also helps to decrease data transfer in federated learning settings, where communication depends on the size of updates. In this work, we explore the constraints of previous studies that integrate a well-known PEFT method named LoRA with federated fine-tuning, then introduce RoLoRA, a robust federated fine-tuning framework that utilizes an alternating minimization approach for LoRA, providing greater robustness against decreasing fine-tuning parameters and increasing data heterogeneity. Our results indicate that RoLoRA not only presents the communication benefits but also substantially enhances the robustness and effectiveness in multiple federated fine-tuning scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alex Rojas, David Alvarez-Melis</p>
<p>Abstract: Weight-ensembles are formed when the parameters of multiple neural networks are directly averaged into a single model. They have demonstrated generalization capability in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) which is not completely understood, though they are thought to successfully exploit functional diversity allotted by each distinct model. Given a collection of models, it is also unclear which combination leads to the optimal weight-ensemble; the SOTA is a linear-time ``greedy" method. We introduce two novel weight-ensembling approaches to study the link between performance dynamics and the nature of how each method decides to use apply the functionally diverse components, akin to diversity-encouragement in the prediction-ensemble literature. We develop a visualization tool to explain how each algorithm explores various domains defined via pairwise-distances to further investigate selection and algorithms' convergence. Empirical analyses shed perspectives which reinforce how high-diversity enhances weight-ensembling while qualifying the extent to which diversity alone improves accuracy. We also demonstrate that sampling positionally distinct models can contribute just as meaningfully to improvements in a weight-ensemble.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ayan Maiti, Michelle Michelle, Haizhao Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, the authors of Shen Yang Zhang (JMLR, 2022) developed a neural network with width $36d(2d + 1)$ and depth $11$, which utilizes a special activation function called the elementary universal activation function, to achieve the super approximation property for functions in $C([a,b]^d)$. That is, the constructed network only requires a fixed number of neurons to approximate a $d$-variate continuous function on a $d$-dimensional hypercube with arbitrary accuracy. Their network uses $\mathcal{O}(d^2)$ fixed neurons. One natural question to address is whether we can reduce the number of these neurons in such a network. By leveraging a variant of the Kolmogorov Superposition Theorem, our analysis shows that there is a neural network generated by the elementary universal activation function with only $366d +365$ fixed, intrinsic (non-repeated) neurons that attains this super approximation property. Furthermore, we present a family of continuous functions that requires at least width $d$, and therefore at least $d$ intrinsic neurons, to achieve arbitrary accuracy in its approximation. This shows that the requirement of $\mathcal{O}(d)$ intrinsic neurons is optimal in the sense that it grows linearly with the input dimension $d$, unlike some approximation methods where parameters may grow exponentially with $d$.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent studies have shown that large language models' (LLMs) mathematical problem-solving capabilities can be enhanced by integrating external tools, such as code interpreters, and employing multi-turn Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. While current methods focus on synthetic data generation and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), this paper studies the complementary direct preference learning approach to further improve model performance. However, existing direct preference learning algorithms are originally designed for the single-turn chat task, and do not fully address the complexities of multi-turn reasoning and external tool integration required for tool-integrated mathematical reasoning tasks. To fill in this gap, we introduce a multi-turn direct preference learning framework, tailored for this context, that leverages feedback from code interpreters and optimizes trajectory-level preferences. This framework includes multi-turn DPO and multi-turn KTO as specific implementations. The effectiveness of our framework is validated through training of various language models using an augmented prompt set from the GSM8K and MATH datasets. Our results demonstrate substantial improvements: a supervised fine-tuned Gemma-1.1-it-7B model's performance increased from 77.5% to 83.9% on GSM8K and from 46.1% to 51.2% on MATH. Similarly, a Gemma-2-it-9B model improved from 84.1% to 86.3% on GSM8K and from 51.0% to 54.5% on MATH.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiming Ge, Bochao Liu, Pengju Wang, Yong Li, Dan Zeng</p>
<p>Abstract: While deep models have proved successful in learning rich knowledge from massive well-annotated data, they may pose a privacy leakage risk in practical deployment. It is necessary to find an effective trade-off between high utility and strong privacy. In this work, we propose a discriminative-generative distillation approach to learn privacy-preserving deep models. Our key idea is taking models as bridge to distill knowledge from private data and then transfer it to learn a student network via two streams. First, discriminative stream trains a baseline classifier on private data and an ensemble of teachers on multiple disjoint private subsets, respectively. Then, generative stream takes the classifier as a fixed discriminator and trains a generator in a data-free manner. After that, the generator is used to generate massive synthetic data which are further applied to train a variational autoencoder (VAE). Among these synthetic data, a few of them are fed into the teacher ensemble to query labels via differentially private aggregation, while most of them are embedded to the trained VAE for reconstructing synthetic data. Finally, a semi-supervised student learning is performed to simultaneously handle two tasks: knowledge transfer from the teachers with distillation on few privately labeled synthetic data, and knowledge enhancement with tangent-normal adversarial regularization on many triples of reconstructed synthetic data. In this way, our approach can control query cost over private data and mitigate accuracy degradation in a unified manner, leading to a privacy-preserving student model. Extensive experiments and analysis clearly show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaouad Dabounou</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence, particularly deep neural networks, have pushed the boundaries of what is achievable in complex tasks. Traditional methods for training neural networks in classification problems often rely on static target outputs, such as one-hot encoded vectors, which can lead to unstable optimization and difficulties in handling non-linearities within data. In this paper, we propose a novel training methodology that progressively evolves the target outputs from a null vector to one-hot encoded vectors throughout the training process. This gradual transition allows the network to adapt more smoothly to the increasing complexity of the classification task, maintaining an equilibrium state that reduces the risk of overfitting and enhances generalization. Our approach, inspired by concepts from structural equilibrium in finite element analysis, has been validated through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that our method achieves faster convergence, improved accuracy, and better generalization, especially in scenarios with high data complexity and noise. This progressive training framework offers a robust alternative to classical methods, opening new perspectives for more efficient and stable neural network training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Binshuai Wang, Qiwei Di, Ming Yin, Mengdi Wang, Quanquan Gu, Peng Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a new family of distances, relative-translation invariant Wasserstein distances ($RW_p$), for measuring the similarity of two probability distributions under distribution shift. Generalizing it from the classical optimal transport model, we show that $RW_p$ distances are also real distance metrics defined on the quotient set $\mathcal{P}_p(\mathbb{R}^n)/\sim$ and invariant to distribution translations. When $p=2$, the $RW_2$ distance enjoys more exciting properties, including decomposability of the optimal transport model, translation-invariance of the $RW_2$ distance, and a Pythagorean relationship between $RW_2$ and the classical quadratic Wasserstein distance ($W_2$). Based on these properties, we show that a distribution shift, measured by $W_2$ distance, can be explained in the bias-variance perspective. In addition, we propose a variant of the Sinkhorn algorithm, named $RW_2$ Sinkhorn algorithm, for efficiently calculating $RW_2$ distance, coupling solutions, as well as $W_2$ distance. We also provide the analysis of numerical stability and time complexity for the proposed algorithm. Finally, we validate the $RW_2$ distance metric and the algorithm performance with three experiments. We conduct one numerical validation for the $RW_2$ Sinkhorn algorithm and show two real-world applications demonstrating the effectiveness of using $RW_2$ under distribution shift: digits recognition and similar thunderstorm detection. The experimental results report that our proposed algorithm significantly improves the computational efficiency of Sinkhorn in certain practical applications, and the $RW_2$ distance is robust to distribution translations compared with baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peng Wang, Huijie Zhang, Zekai Zhang, Siyi Chen, Yi Ma, Qing Qu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent empirical studies have demonstrated that diffusion models can effectively learn the image distribution and generate new samples. Remarkably, these models can achieve this even with a small number of training samples despite a large image dimension, circumventing the curse of dimensionality. In this work, we provide theoretical insights into this phenomenon by leveraging key empirical observations: (i) the low intrinsic dimensionality of image data, (ii) a union of manifold structure of image data, and (iii) the low-rank property of the denoising autoencoder in trained diffusion models. These observations motivate us to assume the underlying data distribution of image data as a mixture of low-rank Gaussians and to parameterize the denoising autoencoder as a low-rank model according to the score function of the assumed distribution. With these setups, we rigorously show that optimizing the training loss of diffusion models is equivalent to solving the canonical subspace clustering problem over the training samples. Based on this equivalence, we further show that the minimal number of samples required to learn the underlying distribution scales linearly with the intrinsic dimensions under the above data and model assumptions. This insight sheds light on why diffusion models can break the curse of dimensionality and exhibit the phase transition in learning distributions. Moreover, we empirically establish a correspondence between the subspaces and the semantic representations of image data, facilitating image editing. We validate these results with corroborated experimental results on both simulated distributions and image datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guanwen Xie, Jingzehua Xu, Yiyuan Yang, Shuai Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Leveraging large language models (LLMs) for designing reward functions demonstrates significant potential. However, achieving effective design and improvement of reward functions in reinforcement learning (RL) tasks with complex custom environments and multiple requirements presents considerable challenges. In this paper, we enable LLMs to be effective white-box searchers, highlighting their advanced semantic understanding capabilities. Specifically, we generate reward components for each explicit user requirement and employ the reward critic to identify the correct code form. Then, LLMs assign weights to the reward components to balance their values and iteratively search and optimize these weights based on the context provided by the training log analyzer, while adaptively determining the search step size. We applied the framework to an underwater information collection RL task without direct human feedback or reward examples (zero-shot). The reward critic successfully correct the reward code with only one feedback for each requirement, effectively preventing irreparable errors that can occur when reward function feedback is provided in aggregate. The effective initialization of weights enables the acquisition of different reward functions within the Pareto solution set without weight search. Even in the case where a weight is 100 times off, fewer than four iterations are needed to obtain solutions that meet user requirements. The framework also works well with most prompts utilizing GPT-3.5 Turbo, since it does not require advanced numerical understanding or calculation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunpeng Gong, Yongjie Hou, Zhenzhong Wang, Zexin Lin, Min Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural network solvers for partial differential equations (PDEs) have made significant progress, yet they continue to face challenges related to data scarcity and model robustness. Traditional data augmentation methods, which leverage symmetry or invariance, impose strong assumptions on physical systems that often do not hold in dynamic and complex real-world applications. To address this research gap, this study introduces a universal learning strategy for neural network PDEs, named Systematic Model Augmentation for Robust Training (SMART). By focusing on challenging and improving the model's weaknesses, SMART reduces generalization error during training under data-scarce conditions, leading to significant improvements in prediction accuracy across various PDE scenarios. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through both theoretical analysis and extensive experimentation. The code will be available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dhruv Nigam</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural network(DNN) based classifiers do extremely well in discriminating between observations, resulting in higher ROC AUC and accuracy metrics, but their outputs are often miscalibrated with respect to true event likelihoods. Post-hoc calibration algorithms are often used to calibrate the outputs of these classifiers. Methods like Isotonic regression, Platt scaling, and Temperature scaling have been shown to be effective in some cases but are limited by their parametric assumptions and/or their inability to capture complex non-linear relationships. We propose ForeCal - a novel post-hoc calibration algorithm based on Random forests. ForeCal exploits two unique properties of Random forests: the ability to enforce weak monotonicity and range-preservation. It is more powerful in achieving calibration than current state-of-the-art methods, is non-parametric, and can incorporate exogenous information as features to learn a better calibration function. Through experiments on 43 diverse datasets from the UCI ML repository, we show that ForeCal outperforms existing methods in terms of Expected Calibration Error(ECE) with minimal impact on the discriminative power of the base DNN as measured by AUC.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Wu, Likun Zhang, Shucheng Li, Fengyuan Xu, Sheng Zhong</p>
<p>Abstract: In the federated learning (FL) process, since the data held by each participant is different, it is necessary to figure out which participant has a higher contribution to the model performance. Effective contribution assessment can help motivate data owners to participate in the FL training. Research works in this field can be divided into two directions based on whether a validation dataset is required. Validation-based methods need to use representative validation data to measure the model accuracy, which is difficult to obtain in practical FL scenarios. Existing validation-free methods assess the contribution based on the parameters and gradients of local models and the global model in a single training round, which is easily compromised by the stochasticity of model training. In this work, we propose CoAst, a practical method to assess the FL participants' contribution without access to any validation data. The core idea of CoAst involves two aspects: one is to only count the most important part of model parameters through a weights quantization, and the other is a cross-round valuation based on the similarity between the current local parameters and the global parameter updates in several subsequent communication rounds. Extensive experiments show that CoAst has comparable assessment reliability to existing validation-based methods and outperforms existing validation-free methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jifeng Hu, Li Shen, Sili Huang, Zhejian Yang, Hechang Chen, Lichao Sun, Yi Chang, Dacheng Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial neural networks, especially recent diffusion-based models, have shown remarkable superiority in gaming, control, and QA systems, where the training tasks' datasets are usually static. However, in real-world applications, such as robotic control of reinforcement learning (RL), the tasks are changing, and new tasks arise in a sequential order. This situation poses the new challenge of plasticity-stability trade-off for training an agent who can adapt to task changes and retain acquired knowledge. In view of this, we propose a rehearsal-based continual diffusion model, called Continual Diffuser (CoD), to endow the diffuser with the capabilities of quick adaptation (plasticity) and lasting retention (stability). Specifically, we first construct an offline benchmark that contains 90 tasks from multiple domains. Then, we train the CoD on each task with sequential modeling and conditional generation for making decisions. Next, we preserve a small portion of previous datasets as the rehearsal buffer and replay it to retain the acquired knowledge. Extensive experiments on a series of tasks show CoD can achieve a promising plasticity-stability trade-off and outperform existing diffusion-based methods and other representative baselines on most tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vighnesh Birodkar, Gabriel Barcik, James Lyon, Sergey Ioffe, David Minnen, Joshua V. Dillon</p>
<p>Abstract: For learned image representations, basic autoencoders often produce blurry results. Reconstruction quality can be improved by incorporating additional penalties such as adversarial (GAN) and perceptual losses. Arguably, these approaches lack a principled interpretation. Concurrently, in generative settings diffusion has demonstrated a remarkable ability to create crisp, high quality results and has solid theoretical underpinnings (from variational inference to direct study as the Fisher Divergence). Our work combines autoencoder representation learning with diffusion and is, to our knowledge, the first to demonstrate the efficacy of jointly learning a continuous encoder and decoder under a diffusion-based loss. We demonstrate that this approach yields better reconstruction quality as compared to GAN-based autoencoders while being easier to tune. We also show that the resulting representation is easier to model with a latent diffusion model as compared to the representation obtained from a state-of-the-art GAN-based loss. Since our decoder is stochastic, it can generate details not encoded in the otherwise deterministic latent representation; we therefore name our approach "Sample what you can't compress", or SWYCC for short.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chih-Yuan Li, Jun-Ting Wu, Chan Hsu, Ming-Yen Lin, Yihuang Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: The estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) is an essential indicator of kidney function in clinical practice. Although traditional equations and Machine Learning (ML) models using clinical and laboratory data can estimate eGFR, accurately predicting future eGFR levels remains a significant challenge for nephrologists and ML researchers. Recent advances demonstrate that Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) can serve as robust foundation models for diverse applications. This study investigates the potential of LMMs to predict future eGFR levels with a dataset consisting of laboratory and clinical values from 50 patients. By integrating various prompting techniques and ensembles of LMMs, our findings suggest that these models, when combined with precise prompts and visual representations of eGFR trajectories, offer predictive performance comparable to existing ML models. This research extends the application of foundation models and suggests avenues for future studies to harness these models in addressing complex medical forecasting challenges.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> A. Quadir, M. Sajid, M. Tanveer</p>
<p>Abstract: The identification of DNA-binding proteins (DBPs) is a critical task due to their significant impact on various biological activities. Understanding the mechanisms underlying protein-DNA interactions is essential for elucidating various life activities. In recent years, machine learning-based models have been prominently utilized for DBP prediction. In this paper, to predict DBPs, we propose a novel framework termed a multiview random vector functional link (MvRVFL) network, which fuses neural network architecture with multiview learning. The proposed MvRVFL model combines the benefits of late and early fusion, allowing for distinct regularization parameters across different views while leveraging a closed-form solution to determine unknown parameters efficiently. The primal objective function incorporates a coupling term aimed at minimizing a composite of errors stemming from all views. From each of the three protein views of the DBP datasets, we extract five features. These features are then fused together by incorporating a hidden feature during the model training process. The performance of the proposed MvRVFL model on the DBP dataset surpasses that of baseline models, demonstrating its superior effectiveness. Furthermore, we extend our assessment to the UCI, KEEL, AwA, and Corel5k datasets, to establish the practicality of the proposed models. The consistency error bound, the generalization error bound, and empirical findings, coupled with rigorous statistical analyses, confirm the superior generalization capabilities of the MvRVFL model compared to the baseline models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ryan Whetten, Titouan Parcollet, Adel Moumen, Marco Dinarelli, Yannick Est\`eve</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has proven to be effective in various domains, including speech processing. However, SSL is computationally and memory expensive. This is in part due the quadratic complexity of multi-head self-attention (MHSA). Alternatives for MHSA have been proposed and used in the speech domain, but have yet to be investigated properly in an SSL setting. In this work, we study the effects of replacing MHSA with recent state-of-the-art alternatives that have linear complexity, namely, HyperMixing, Fastformer, SummaryMixing, and Mamba. We evaluate these methods by looking at the speed, the amount of VRAM consumed, and the performance on the SSL MP3S benchmark. Results show that these linear alternatives maintain competitive performance compared to MHSA while, on average, decreasing VRAM consumption by around 20% to 60% and increasing speed from 7% to 65% for input sequences ranging from 20 to 80 seconds.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ivaxi Sheth, Sahar Abdelnabi, Mario Fritz</p>
<p>Abstract: Scientific discovery is a catalyst for human intellectual advances, driven by the cycle of hypothesis generation, experimental design, data evaluation, and iterative assumption refinement. This process, while crucial, is expensive and heavily dependent on the domain knowledge of scientists to generate hypotheses and navigate the scientific cycle. Central to this is causality, the ability to establish the relationship between the cause and the effect. Motivated by the scientific discovery process, in this work, we formulate a novel task where the input is a partial causal graph with missing variables, and the output is a hypothesis about the missing variables to complete the partial graph. We design a benchmark with varying difficulty levels and knowledge assumptions about the causal graph. With the growing interest in using Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist in scientific discovery, we benchmark open-source and closed models on our testbed. We show the strong ability of LLMs to hypothesize the mediation variables between a cause and its effect. In contrast, they underperform in hypothesizing the cause and effect variables themselves. We also observe surprising results where some of the open-source models outperform the closed GPT-4 model.</p>

<p>Abstract: Epistemic uncertainty is crucial for safety-critical applications and out-of-distribution detection tasks. Yet, we uncover a paradoxical phenomenon in deep learning models: an epistemic uncertainty collapse as model complexity increases, challenging the assumption that larger models invariably offer better uncertainty quantification. We propose that this stems from implicit ensembling within large models. To support this hypothesis, we demonstrate epistemic uncertainty collapse empirically across various architectures, from explicit ensembles of ensembles and simple MLPs to state-of-the-art vision models, including ResNets and Vision Transformers -- for the latter, we examine implicit ensemble extraction and decompose larger models into diverse sub-models, recovering epistemic uncertainty. We provide theoretical justification for these phenomena and explore their implications for uncertainty estimation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruoyu Wang, Lina Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: Disentangled Representation Learning aims to improve the explainability of deep learning methods by training a data encoder that identifies semantically meaningful latent variables in the data generation process. Nevertheless, there is no consensus regarding a universally accepted definition for the objective of disentangled representation learning. In particular, there is a considerable amount of discourse regarding whether should the latent variables be mutually independent or not. In this paper, we first investigate these arguments on the interrelationships between latent variables by establishing a conceptual bridge between Epistemology and Disentangled Representation Learning. Then, inspired by these interdisciplinary concepts, we introduce a two-level latent space framework to provide a general solution to the prior arguments on this issue. Finally, we propose a novel method for disentangled representation learning by employing an integration of mutual information constraint and independence constraint within the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method consistently outperforms baseline approaches in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. The method exhibits strong performance across multiple commonly used metrics and demonstrates a great capability in disentangling various semantic factors, leading to an improved quality of controllable generation, which consequently benefits the explainability of the algorithm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ramon Tavares</p>
<p>Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive methodology for modeling and forecasting the historical time series of fire spots detected by the AQUA_M-T satellite in the Amazon, Brazil. The approach utilizes a mixed Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model, combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) architectures to predict monthly accumulations of daily detected fire spots. A summary of the data revealed a consistent seasonality over time, with annual maximum and minimum fire spot values tending to repeat at the same periods each year. The primary objective is to verify whether the forecasts capture this inherent seasonality through rigorous statistical analysis. The methodology involved careful data preparation, model configuration, and training using cross-validation with two seeds, ensuring that the data generalizes well to the test and validation sets, and confirming the convergence of the model parameters. The results indicate that the mixed LSTM and GRU model offers improved accuracy in forecasting 12 months ahead, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing complex temporal patterns and modeling the observed time series. This research significantly contributes to the application of deep learning techniques in environmental monitoring, specifically in fire spot forecasting. In addition to improving forecast accuracy, the proposed approach highlights the potential for adaptation to other time series forecasting challenges, opening new avenues for research and development in machine learning and natural phenomenon prediction.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chaozhi Zhang, Lin Liu, Xiaoqun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Data scarcity poses a serious threat to modern machine learning and artificial intelligence, as their practical success typically relies on the availability of big datasets. One effective strategy to mitigate the issue of insufficient data is to first harness information from other data sources possessing certain similarities in the study design stage, and then employ the multi-task or meta learning framework in the analysis stage. In this paper, we focus on multi-task (or multi-source) linear models whose coefficients across tasks share an invariant low-rank component, a popular structural assumption considered in the recent multi-task or meta learning literature. Under this assumption, we propose a new algorithm, called Meta Subspace Pursuit (abbreviated as Meta-SP), that provably learns this invariant subspace shared by different tasks. Under this stylized setup for multi-task or meta learning, we establish both the algorithmic and statistical guarantees of the proposed method. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted, comparing Meta-SP against several competing methods, including popular, off-the-shelf model-agnostic meta learning algorithms such as ANIL. These experiments demonstrate that Meta-SP achieves superior performance over the competing methods in various aspects.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shujing Li, Yanhu Wang, Shuaishuai Guo, Chenyuan Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph data, essential in fields like knowledge representation and social networks, often involves large networks with many nodes and edges. Transmitting these graphs can be highly inefficient due to their size and redundancy for specific tasks. This paper introduces a method to extract a smaller, task-focused subgraph that maintains key information while reducing communication overhead. Our approach utilizes graph neural networks (GNNs) and the graph information bottleneck (GIB) principle to create a compact, informative, and robust graph representation suitable for transmission. The challenge lies in the irregular structure of graph data, making GIB optimization complex. We address this by deriving a tractable variational upper bound for the objective function. Additionally, we propose the VQ-GIB mechanism, integrating vector quantization (VQ) to convert subgraph representations into a discrete codebook sequence, compatible with existing digital communication systems. Our experiments show that this GIB-based method significantly lowers communication costs while preserving essential task-related information. The approach demonstrates robust performance across various communication channels, suitable for both continuous and discrete systems.</p>

While such models based on low body order features are not complete, we formulate and prove general completeness properties for higher order methods, and show that $6k-5$ of these features are enough for up to $k$ atoms. We also find that the Clebsch--Gordan operations commonly used in these methods can be replaced by matrix multiplications without sacrificing completeness, lowering the scaling from $O(l^6)$ to $O(l^3)$ in the degree of the features. We apply this to quantum chemistry, but the proposed methods are generally applicable for problems involving 3D point configurations.</p>

In RDPs, the unknown dependency of future observations and rewards from the past interactions can be captured by some hidden finite-state automaton. For this reason, many RDP algorithms first reconstruct this unknown dependency using automata learning techniques. In this paper, we show that it is possible to overcome two strong limitations of previous offline RL algorithms for RDPs, notably RegORL. This can be accomplished via the introduction of two original techniques: the development of a new pseudometric based on formal languages, which removes a problematic dependency on $L_\infty^\mathsf{p}$-distinguishability parameters, and the adoption of Count-Min-Sketch (CMS), instead of naive counting. The former reduces the number of samples required in environments that are characterized by a low complexity in language-theoretic terms. The latter alleviates the memory requirements for long planning horizons. We derive the PAC sample complexity bounds associated to each of these techniques, and we validate the approach experimentally.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dingling Yao, Dario Rancati, Riccardo Cadei, Marco Fumero, Francesco Locatello</p>
<p>Abstract: Causal representation learning aims at recovering latent causal variables from high-dimensional observations to solve causal downstream tasks, such as predicting the effect of new interventions or more robust classification. A plethora of methods have been developed, each tackling carefully crafted problem settings that lead to different types of identifiability. The folklore is that these different settings are important, as they are often linked to different rungs of Pearl's causal hierarchy, although not all neatly fit. Our main contribution is to show that many existing causal representation learning approaches methodologically align the representation to known data symmetries. Identification of the variables is guided by equivalence classes across different data pockets that are not necessarily causal. This result suggests important implications, allowing us to unify many existing approaches in a single method that can mix and match different assumptions, including non-causal ones, based on the invariances relevant to our application. It also significantly benefits applicability, which we demonstrate by improving treatment effect estimation on real-world high-dimensional ecological data. Overall, this paper clarifies the role of causality assumptions in the discovery of causal variables and shifts the focus to preserving data symmetries.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeff Mitchell, Jes\'us Mart\'inez del Rinc\'on, Niall McLaughlin</p>
<p>Abstract: While deep neural networks can achieve state-of-the-art performance in many tasks, these models are more fragile than they appear. They are prone to learning spurious correlations in their training data, leading to surprising failure cases. In this paper, we propose a new approach that addresses the issue of spurious correlations: UnLearning from Experience (ULE). Our method is based on using two classification models trained in parallel: student and teacher models. Both models receive the same batches of training data. The student model is trained with no constraints and pursues the spurious correlations in the data. The teacher model is trained to solve the same classification problem while avoiding the mistakes of the student model. As training is done in parallel, the better the student model learns the spurious correlations, the more robust the teacher model becomes. The teacher model uses the gradient of the student's output with respect to its input to unlearn mistakes made by the student. We show that our method is effective on the Waterbirds, CelebA, Spawrious and UrbanCars datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chang Dong, Zhengyang Li, Liangwei Zheng, Weitong Chen, Wei Emma Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, the issue of adversarial robustness in the time series domain has garnered significant attention. However, the available defense mechanisms remain limited, with adversarial training being the predominant approach, though it does not provide theoretical guarantees. Randomized Smoothing has emerged as a standout method due to its ability to certify a provable lower bound on robustness radius under $\ell_p$-ball attacks. Recognizing its success, research in the time series domain has started focusing on these aspects. However, existing research predominantly focuses on time series forecasting, or under the non-$\ell_p$ robustness in statistic feature augmentation for time series classification~(TSC). Our review found that Randomized Smoothing performs modestly in TSC, struggling to provide effective assurances on datasets with poor robustness. Therefore, we propose a self-ensemble method to enhance the lower bound of the probability confidence of predicted labels by reducing the variance of classification margins, thereby certifying a larger radius. This approach also addresses the computational overhead issue of Deep Ensemble~(DE) while remaining competitive and, in some cases, outperforming it in terms of robustness. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results validate the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating superior performance in robustness testing compared to baseline approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Raphael Lafargue, Luke Smith, Franck Vermet, Mathias L\"owe, Ian Reid, Vincent Gripon, Jack Valmadre</p>
<p>Abstract: The predominant method for computing confidence intervals (CI) in few-shot learning (FSL) is based on sampling the tasks with replacement, i.e.\ allowing the same samples to appear in multiple tasks. This makes the CI misleading in that it takes into account the randomness of the sampler but not the data itself. To quantify the extent of this problem, we conduct a comparative analysis between CIs computed with and without replacement. These reveal a notable underestimation by the predominant method. This observation calls for a reevaluation of how we interpret confidence intervals and the resulting conclusions in FSL comparative studies. Our research demonstrates that the use of paired tests can partially address this issue. Additionally, we explore methods to further reduce the (size of the) CI by strategically sampling tasks of a specific size. We also introduce a new optimized benchmark, which can be accessed at https://github.com/RafLaf/FSL-benchmark-again</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali Ismail-Fawaz, Maxime Devanne, Stefano Berretti, Jonathan Weber, Germain Forestier</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning models have been shown to be a powerful solution for Time Series Classification (TSC). State-of-the-art architectures, while producing promising results on the UCR and the UEA archives , present a high number of trainable parameters. This can lead to long training with high CO2 emission, power consumption and possible increase in the number of FLoating-point Operation Per Second (FLOPS). In this paper, we present a new architecture for TSC, the Light Inception with boosTing tEchnique (LITE) with only 2.34% of the number of parameters of the state-of-the-art InceptionTime model, while preserving performance. This architecture, with only 9, 814 trainable parameters due to the usage of DepthWise Separable Convolutions (DWSC), is boosted by three techniques: multiplexing, custom filters, and dilated convolution. The LITE architecture, trained on the UCR, is 2.78 times faster than InceptionTime and consumes 2.79 times less CO2 and power. To evaluate the performance of the proposed architecture on multivariate time series data, we adapt LITE to handle multivariate time series, we call this version LITEMV. To bring theory into application, we also conducted experiments using LITEMV on multivariate time series representing human rehabilitation movements, showing that LITEMV not only is the most efficient model but also the best performing for this application on the Kimore dataset, a skeleton based human rehabilitation exercises dataset. Moreover, to address the interpretability of LITEMV, we present a study using Class Activation Maps to understand the classification decision taken by the model during evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Baris Coskunuzer, C\"uneyt G\"urcan Ak\c{c}ora</p>
<p>Abstract: Topological Machine Learning (TML) is an emerging field that leverages techniques from algebraic topology to analyze complex data structures in ways that traditional machine learning methods may not capture. This tutorial provides a comprehensive introduction to two key TML techniques, persistent homology and the Mapper algorithm, with an emphasis on practical applications. Persistent homology captures multi-scale topological features such as clusters, loops, and voids, while the Mapper algorithm creates an interpretable graph summarizing high-dimensional data. To enhance accessibility, we adopt a data-centric approach, enabling readers to gain hands-on experience applying these techniques to relevant tasks. We provide step-by-step explanations, implementations, hands-on examples, and case studies to demonstrate how these tools can be applied to real-world problems. The goal is to equip researchers and practitioners with the knowledge and resources to incorporate TML into their work, revealing insights often hidden from conventional machine learning methods.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02908">Masked Diffusion Models are Secretly Time-Agnostic Masked Models and Exploit Inaccurate Categorical Sampling</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaiwen Zheng, Yongxin Chen, Hanzi Mao, Ming-Yu Liu, Jun Zhu, Qinsheng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have emerged as a popular research topic for generative modeling of discrete data, thanks to their superior performance over other discrete diffusion models, and are rivaling the auto-regressive models (ARMs) for language modeling tasks. The recent effort in simplifying the masked diffusion framework further leads to alignment with continuous-space diffusion models and more principled training and sampling recipes. In this paper, however, we reveal that both training and sampling of MDMs are theoretically free from the time variable, arguably the key signature of diffusion models, and are instead equivalent to masked models. The connection on the sampling aspect is drawn by our proposed first-hitting sampler (FHS). Specifically, we show that the FHS is theoretically equivalent to MDMs' original generation process while significantly alleviating the time-consuming categorical sampling and achieving a 20$\times$ speedup. In addition, our investigation challenges previous claims that MDMs can surpass ARMs in generative perplexity. We identify, for the first time, an underlying numerical issue, even with the 32-bit floating-point precision, which results in inaccurate categorical sampling. We show that the numerical issue lowers the effective temperature both theoretically and empirically, leading to unfair assessments of MDMs' generation results in the previous literature.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> George P. Harabin, Morad Behandish, Amir Mirzendehdel</p>
<p>Abstract: One of the main concerns in design and process planning for multi-axis additive and subtractive manufacturing is collision avoidance between moving objects (e.g., tool assemblies) and stationary objects (e.g., a part unified with fixtures). The collision measure for various pairs of relative rigid translations and rotations between the two pointsets can be conceptualized by a compactly supported scalar field over the 6D non-Euclidean configuration space. Explicit representation and computation of this field is costly in both time and space. If we fix $O(m)$ sparsely sampled rotations (e.g., tool orientations), computation of the collision measure field as a convolution of indicator functions of the 3D pointsets over a uniform grid (i.e., voxelized geometry) of resolution $O(n^3)$ via fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) scales as in $O(mn^3 \log n)$ in time and $O(mn^3)$ in space. In this paper, we develop an implicit representation of the collision measure field via deep neural networks (DNNs). We show that our approach is able to accurately interpolate the collision measure from a sparse sampling of rotations, and can represent the collision measure field with a small memory footprint. Moreover, we show that this representation can be efficiently updated through fine-tuning to more efficiently train the network on multi-resolution data, as well as accommodate incremental changes to the geometry (such as might occur in iterative processes such as topology optimization of the part subject to CNC tool accessibility constraints).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fatemeh Chajaei, Hossein Bagheri</p>
<p>Abstract: Climate models lack the necessary resolution for urban climate studies, requiring computationally intensive processes to estimate high resolution air temperatures. In contrast, Data-driven approaches offer faster and more accurate air temperature downscaling. This study presents a data-driven framework for downscaling air temperature using publicly available outputs from urban climate models, specifically datasets generated by UrbClim. The proposed framework utilized morphological features extracted from LiDAR data. To extract urban morphological features, first a three-dimensional building model was created using LiDAR data and deep learning models. Then, these features were integrated with meteorological parameters such as wind, humidity, etc., to downscale air temperature using machine learning algorithms. The results demonstrated that the developed framework effectively extracted urban morphological features from LiDAR data. Deep learning algorithms played a crucial role in generating three-dimensional models for extracting the aforementioned features. Also, the evaluation of air temperature downscaling results using various machine learning models indicated that the LightGBM model had the best performance with an RMSE of 0.352{\deg}K and MAE of 0.215{\deg}K. Furthermore, the examination of final air temperature maps derived from downscaling showed that the developed framework successfully estimated air temperatures at higher resolutions, enabling the identification of local air temperature patterns at street level.

<p>Abstract: We applied convolutional neural networks to the classification of cat states and coherent states. Initially, we generated datasets of Schrodinger cat states and coherent states from nonlinear processes and preprocessed these datasets. Subsequently, we constructed both LeNet and ResNet network architectures, adjusting parameters such as convolution kernels and strides to optimal values. We then trained both LeNet and ResNet on the training sets. The loss function values indicated that ResNet performs better in classifying cat states and coherent states. Finally, we evaluated the trained models on the test sets, achieving an accuracy of 97.5% for LeNet and 100% for ResNet. We evaluated cat states and coherent states with different {\alpha}, demonstrating a certain degree of generalization capability. The results show that LeNet may mistakenly recognize coherent states as cat states without coherent features, while ResNet provides a feasible solution to the problem of mistakenly recognizing cat states and coherent states by traditional neural networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrea Borgarelli, Constantin Enea, Rupak Majumdar, Srinidhi Nagendra</p>
<p>Abstract: Bugs in popular distributed protocol implementations have been the source of many downtimes in popular internet services. We describe a randomized testing approach for distributed protocol implementations based on reinforcement learning. Since the natural reward structure is very sparse, the key to successful exploration in reinforcement learning is reward augmentation. We show two different techniques that build on one another. First, we provide a decaying exploration bonus based on the discovery of new states -- the reward decays as the same state is visited multiple times. The exploration bonus captures the intuition from coverage-guided fuzzing of prioritizing new coverage points; in contrast to other schemes, we show that taking the maximum of the bonus and the Q-value leads to more effective exploration. Second, we provide waypoints to the algorithm as a sequence of predicates that capture interesting semantic scenarios. Waypoints exploit designer insight about the protocol and guide the exploration to ``interesting'' parts of the state space. Our reward structure ensures that new episodes can reliably get to deep interesting states even without execution caching. We have implemented our algorithm in Go. Our evaluation on three large benchmarks (RedisRaft, Etcd, and RSL) shows that our algorithm can significantly outperform baseline approaches in terms of coverage and bug finding.</p>

<p>Abstract: Machine learning has shown great potential in the field of cancer multi-omics studies, offering incredible opportunities for advancing precision medicine. However, the challenges associated with dataset curation and task formulation pose significant hurdles, especially for researchers lacking a biomedical background. Here, we introduce the CMOB, the first large-scale cancer multi-omics benchmark integrates the TCGA platform, making data resources accessible and usable for machine learning researchers without significant preparation and expertise.To date, CMOB includes a collection of 20 cancer multi-omics datasets covering 32 cancers, accompanied by a systematic data processing pipeline. CMOB provides well-processed dataset versions to support 20 meaningful tasks in four studies, with a collection of benchmarks. We also integrate CMOB with two complementary resources and various biological tools to explore broader research avenues.All resources are open-accessible with user-friendly and compatible integration scripts that enable non-experts to easily incorporate this complementary information for various tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on selected datasets to offer recommendations on suitable machine learning baselines for specific applications.

Along with climate change and consumer behavioral changes, this leads to changes and variability in generation and load patterns, introducing significant complexity and uncertainty into grid planning and operations. While the industry has already started to exploit AI to overcome computational challenges of established grid simulation tools, we propose the use of AI Foundation Models (FMs) and advances in Graph Neural Networks to efficiently exploit poorly available grid data for different downstream tasks, enhancing grid operations. For capturing the grid's underlying physics, we believe that building a self-supervised model learning the power flow dynamics is a critical first step towards developing an FM for the power grid. We show how this approach may close the gap between the industry needs and current grid analysis capabilities, to bring the industry closer to optimal grid operation and planning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Biopharmaceutical products, particularly monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), have gained prominence in the pharmaceutical market due to their high specificity and efficacy. As these products are projected to constitute a substantial portion of global pharmaceutical sales, the application of machine learning models in mAb development and manufacturing is gaining momentum. This paper addresses the critical need for uncertainty quantification in machine learning predictions, particularly in scenarios with limited training data. Leveraging ensemble learning and Monte Carlo simulations, our proposed method generates additional input samples to enhance the robustness of the model in small training datasets. We evaluate the efficacy of our approach through two case studies: predicting antibody concentrations in advance and real-time monitoring of glucose concentrations during bioreactor runs using Raman spectra data. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in estimating the uncertainty levels associated with process performance predictions and facilitating real-time decision-making in biopharmaceutical manufacturing. This contribution not only introduces a novel approach for uncertainty quantification but also provides insights into overcoming challenges posed by small training datasets in bioprocess development. The evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in addressing key challenges related to uncertainty estimation within upstream cell cultivation, illustrating its potential impact on enhancing process control and product quality in the dynamic field of biopharmaceuticals.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Deaglan J. Bartlett, Marco Chiarenza, Ludvig Doeser, Florent Leclercq</p>
<p>Abstract: $N$-body simulations are computationally expensive, so machine-learning (ML)-based emulation techniques have emerged as a way to increase their speed. Although fast, surrogate models have limited trustworthiness due to potentially substantial emulation errors that current approaches cannot correct for. To alleviate this problem, we introduce COmoving Computer Acceleration (COCA), a hybrid framework interfacing ML with an $N$-body simulator. The correct physical equations of motion are solved in an emulated frame of reference, so that any emulation error is corrected by design. This approach corresponds to solving for the perturbation of particle trajectories around the machine-learnt solution, which is computationally cheaper than obtaining the full solution, yet is guaranteed to converge to the truth as one increases the number of force evaluations. Although applicable to any ML algorithm and $N$-body simulator, this approach is assessed in the particular case of particle-mesh cosmological simulations in a frame of reference predicted by a convolutional neural network, where the time dependence is encoded as an additional input parameter to the network. COCA efficiently reduces emulation errors in particle trajectories, requiring far fewer force evaluations than running the corresponding simulation without ML. We obtain accurate final density and velocity fields for a reduced computational budget. We demonstrate that this method shows robustness when applied to examples outside the range of the training data. When compared to the direct emulation of the Lagrangian displacement field using the same training resources, COCA's ability to correct emulation errors results in more accurate predictions. COCA makes $N$-body simulations cheaper by skipping unnecessary force evaluations, while still solving the correct equations of motion and correcting for emulation errors made by ML.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion-based voice conversion (VC) techniques such as VoiceGrad have attracted interest because of their high VC performance in terms of speech quality and speaker similarity. However, a notable limitation is the slow inference caused by the multi-step reverse diffusion. Therefore, we propose FastVoiceGrad, a novel one-step diffusion-based VC that reduces the number of iterations from dozens to one while inheriting the high VC performance of the multi-step diffusion-based VC. We obtain the model using adversarial conditional diffusion distillation (ACDD), leveraging the ability of generative adversarial networks and diffusion models while reconsidering the initial states in sampling.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdullah Arafat Miah, Kaan Icer, Resit Sendag, Yu Bi</p>
<p>Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat when using third-party data for deep learning development. In these attacks, data can be manipulated to cause a trained model to behave improperly when a specific trigger pattern is applied, providing the adversary with unauthorized advantages. While most existing works focus on designing trigger patterns in both visible and invisible to poison the victim class, they typically result in a single targeted class upon the success of the backdoor attack, meaning that the victim class can only be converted to another class based on the adversary predefined value. In this paper, we address this issue by introducing a novel sample-specific multi-targeted backdoor attack, namely NoiseAttack. Specifically, we adopt White Gaussian Noise (WGN) with various Power Spectral Densities (PSD) as our underlying triggers, coupled with a unique training strategy to execute the backdoor attack. This work is the first of its kind to launch a vision backdoor attack with the intent to generate multiple targeted classes with minimal input configuration. Furthermore, our extensive experimental results demonstrate that NoiseAttack can achieve a high attack success rate against popular network architectures and datasets, as well as bypass state-of-the-art backdoor detection methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saeid Asgari Taghanaki, Aliasgahr Khani, Amir Khasahmadi</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) increasingly struggle to differentiate between top-performing models, underscoring the need for more challenging evaluation frameworks. We introduce MMLU-Pro+, an enhanced benchmark building upon MMLU-Pro to assess shortcut learning and higher-order reasoning in LLMs. By incorporating questions with multiple correct answers across diverse domains, MMLU-Pro+ tests LLMs' ability to engage in complex reasoning and resist simplistic problem-solving strategies. Our results show that MMLU-Pro+ maintains MMLU-Pro's difficulty while providing a more rigorous test of model discrimination, particularly in multi-correct answer scenarios. We introduce novel metrics like shortcut selection ratio and correct pair identification ratio, offering deeper insights into model behavior and anchoring bias. Evaluations of five state-of-the-art LLMs reveal significant performance gaps, highlighting variations in reasoning abilities and bias susceptibility.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arnav Jain, Jasmer Singh Sanjotra, Harshvardhan Choudhary, Krish Agrawal, Rupal Shah, Rohan Jha, M. Sajid, Amir Hussain, M. Tanveer</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose long short term memory speech enhancement network (LSTMSE-Net), an audio-visual speech enhancement (AVSE) method. This innovative method leverages the complementary nature of visual and audio information to boost the quality of speech signals. Visual features are extracted with VisualFeatNet (VFN), and audio features are processed through an encoder and decoder. The system scales and concatenates visual and audio features, then processes them through a separator network for optimized speech enhancement. The architecture highlights advancements in leveraging multi-modal data and interpolation techniques for robust AVSE challenge systems. The performance of LSTMSE-Net surpasses that of the baseline model from the COG-MHEAR AVSE Challenge 2024 by a margin of 0.06 in scale-invariant signal-to-distortion ratio (SISDR), $0.03$ in short-time objective intelligibility (STOI), and $1.32$ in perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lewis Mason, Mark Martinez</p>
<p>Abstract: K-Origins is a neural network layer designed to improve image-based network performances when learning colour, or intensities, is beneficial. Over 250 encoder-decoder convolutional networks are trained and tested on 16-bit synthetic data, demonstrating that K-Origins improves semantic segmentation accuracy in two scenarios: object detection with low signal-to-noise ratios, and segmenting multiple objects that are identical in shape but vary in colour. K-Origins generates output features from the input features, $\textbf{X}$, by the equation $\textbf{Y}_k = \textbf{X}-\textbf{J}\cdot w_k$ for each trainable parameter $w_k$, where $\textbf{J}$ is a matrix of ones. Additionally, networks with varying receptive fields were trained to determine optimal network depths based on the dimensions of target classes, suggesting that receptive field lengths should exceed object sizes. By ensuring a sufficient receptive field length and incorporating K-Origins, we can achieve better semantic network performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zijian Chen, Jueqi Wang, Archana Venkataraman</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose an image-conditioned diffusion model to estimate high angular resolution diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) from a low angular resolution acquisition. Our model, which we call QID$^2$, takes as input a set of low angular resolution DWI data and uses this information to estimate the DWI data associated with a target gradient direction. We leverage a U-Net architecture with cross-attention to preserve the positional information of the reference images, further guiding the target image generation. We train and evaluate QID$^2$ on single-shell DWI samples curated from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset. Specifically, we sub-sample the HCP gradient directions to produce low angular resolution DWI data and train QID$^2$ to reconstruct the missing high angular resolution samples. We compare QID$^2$ with two state-of-the-art GAN models. Our results demonstrate that QID$^2$ not only achieves higher-quality generated images, but it consistently outperforms the GAN models in downstream tensor estimation across multiple metrics. Taken together, this study highlights the potential of diffusion models, and QID$^2$ in particular, for q-space up-sampling, thus offering a promising toolkit for clinical and research applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Austin Talbot, Corey J Keller, David E Carlson, Alex V Kotlar</p>
<p>Abstract: The ability to manipulate complex systems, such as the brain, to modify specific outcomes has far-reaching implications, particularly in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. One approach to designing appropriate manipulations is to target key features of predictive models. While generative latent variable models, such as probabilistic principal component analysis (PPCA), is a powerful tool for identifying targets, they struggle incorporating information relevant to low-variance outcomes into the latent space. When stimulation targets are designed on the latent space in such a scenario, the intervention can be suboptimal with minimal efficacy. To address this problem, we develop a novel objective based on supervised variational autoencoders (SVAEs) that enforces such information is represented in the latent space. The novel objective can be used with linear models, such as PPCA, which we refer to as generative principal component regression (gPCR). We show in simulations that gPCR dramatically improves target selection in manipulation as compared to standard PCR and SVAEs. As part of these simulations, we develop a metric for detecting when relevant information is not properly incorporated into the loadings. We then show in two neural datasets related to stress and social behavior in which gPCR dramatically outperforms PCR in predictive performance and that SVAEs exhibit low incorporation of relevant information into the loadings. Overall, this work suggests that our method significantly improves target selection for manipulation using latent variable models over competitor inference schemes.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02342">Optimal sampling for least-squares approximation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ben Adcock</p>
<p>Abstract: Least-squares approximation is one of the most important methods for recovering an unknown function from data. While in many applications the data is fixed, in many others there is substantial freedom to choose where to sample. In this paper, we review recent progress on optimal sampling for (weighted) least-squares approximation in arbitrary linear spaces. We introduce the Christoffel function as a key quantity in the analysis of (weighted) least-squares approximation from random samples, then show how it can be used to construct sampling strategies that possess near-optimal sample complexity: namely, the number of samples scales log-linearly in $n$, the dimension of the approximation space. We discuss a series of variations, extensions and further topics, and throughout highlight connections to approximation theory, machine learning, information-based complexity and numerical linear algebra. Finally, motivated by various contemporary applications, we consider a generalization of the classical setting where the samples need not be pointwise samples of a scalar-valued function, and the approximation space need not be linear. We show that even in this significantly more general setting suitable generalizations of the Christoffel function still determine the sample complexity. This provides a unified procedure for designing improved sampling strategies for general recovery problems. This article is largely self-contained, and intended to be accessible to nonspecialists.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Farbod Faraji, Maryam Reza</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning (ML) provides a broad spectrum of tools and architectures that enable the transformation of data from simulations and experiments into useful and explainable science, thereby augmenting domain knowledge. Furthermore, ML-enhanced numerical modelling can revamp scientific computing for real-world complex engineering systems, creating unique opportunities to examine the operation of the technologies in detail and automate their optimization and control. In recent years, ML applications have seen significant growth across various scientific domains, particularly in fluid mechanics, where ML has shown great promise in enhancing computational modeling of fluid flows. In contrast, ML applications in numerical plasma physics research remain relatively limited in scope and extent. Despite this, the close relationship between fluid mechanics and plasma physics presents a valuable opportunity to create a roadmap for transferring ML advances in fluid flow modeling to computational plasma physics. This Perspective aims to outline such a roadmap. We begin by discussing some general fundamental aspects of ML, including the various categories of ML algorithms and the different types of problems that can be solved with the help of ML. With regard to each problem type, we then present specific examples from the use of ML in computational fluid dynamics, reviewing several insightful prior efforts. We also review recent ML applications in plasma physics for each problem type. The paper discusses promising future directions and development pathways for ML in plasma modelling within the different application areas. Additionally, we point out prominent challenges that must be addressed to realize ML's full potential in computational plasma physics, including the need for cost-effective high-fidelity simulation tools for extensive data generation.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02374">Exploring Low-Dimensional Subspaces in Diffusion Models for Controllable Image Editing</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Siyi Chen, Huijie Zhang, Minzhe Guo, Yifu Lu, Peng Wang, Qing Qu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of generative models. Despite their success, there is still limited understanding of their semantic spaces. This makes it challenging to achieve precise and disentangled image generation without additional training, especially in an unsupervised way. In this work, we improve the understanding of their semantic spaces from intriguing observations: among a certain range of noise levels, (1) the learned posterior mean predictor (PMP) in the diffusion model is locally linear, and (2) the singular vectors of its Jacobian lie in low-dimensional semantic subspaces. We provide a solid theoretical basis to justify the linearity and low-rankness in the PMP. These insights allow us to propose an unsupervised, single-step, training-free LOw-rank COntrollable image editing (LOCO Edit) method for precise local editing in diffusion models. LOCO Edit identified editing directions with nice properties: homogeneity, transferability, composability, and linearity. These properties of LOCO Edit benefit greatly from the low-dimensional semantic subspace. Our method can further be extended to unsupervised or text-supervised editing in various text-to-image diffusion models (T-LOCO Edit). Finally, extensive empirical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of LOCO Edit. The codes will be released at https://github.com/ChicyChen/LOCO-Edit.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper investigates the best known bounds on the quadratic Gaussian distortion-rate-perception function with limited common randomness for the Kullback-Leibler divergence-based perception measure, as well as their counterparts for the squared Wasserstein-2 distance-based perception measure, recently established by Xie et al. These bounds are shown to be nondegenerate in the sense that they cannot be deduced from each other via a refined version of Talagrand's transportation inequality. On the other hand, an improved lower bound is established when the perception measure is given by the squared Wasserstein-2 distance. In addition, it is revealed by exploiting the connection between rate-distortion-perception coding and entropy-constrained scalar quantization that all the aforementioned bounds are generally not tight in the weak perception constraint regime.</p>

<p>Abstract: Specifically focusing on the landscape of abstractive text summarization, as opposed to extractive techniques, this survey presents a comprehensive overview, delving into state-of-the-art techniques, prevailing challenges, and prospective research directions. We categorize the techniques into traditional sequence-to-sequence models, pre-trained large language models, reinforcement learning, hierarchical methods, and multi-modal summarization. Unlike prior works that did not examine complexities, scalability and comparisons of techniques in detail, this review takes a comprehensive approach encompassing state-of-the-art methods, challenges, solutions, comparisons, limitations and charts out future improvements - providing researchers an extensive overview to advance abstractive summarization research. We provide vital comparison tables across techniques categorized - offering insights into model complexity, scalability and appropriate applications. The paper highlights challenges such as inadequate meaning representation, factual consistency, controllable text summarization, cross-lingual summarization, and evaluation metrics, among others. Solutions leveraging knowledge incorporation and other innovative strategies are proposed to address these challenges. The paper concludes by highlighting emerging research areas like factual inconsistency, domain-specific, cross-lingual, multilingual, and long-document summarization, as well as handling noisy data. Our objective is to provide researchers and practitioners with a structured overview of the domain, enabling them to better understand the current landscape and identify potential areas for further research and improvement.</p>

<p>Abstract: In personalized recommendation systems, accurately capturing users' evolving interests and combining them with contextual information is a critical research area. This paper proposes a novel model called the Deep Adaptive Interest Network (DAIN), which dynamically models users' interests while incorporating context-aware learning mechanisms to achieve precise and adaptive personalized recommendations. DAIN leverages deep learning techniques to build an adaptive interest network structure that can capture users' interest changes in real-time while further optimizing recommendation results by integrating contextual information. Experiments conducted on several public datasets demonstrate that DAIN excels in both recommendation performance and computational efficiency. This research not only provides a new solution for personalized recommendation systems but also offers fresh insights into the application of context-aware learning in recommendation systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kunze Wu, Weiheng Jiang, Dusit Niyato, Yinghuan Li, Chuang Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, the design of wireless receivers using deep neural networks (DNNs), known as deep receivers, has attracted extensive attention for ensuring reliable communication in complex channel environments. To adapt quickly to dynamic channels, online learning has been adopted to update the weights of deep receivers with over-the-air data (e.g., pilots). However, the fragility of neural models and the openness of wireless channels expose these systems to malicious attacks. To this end, understanding these attack methods is essential for robust receiver design.In this paper, we propose a transfer-based adversarial poisoning attack method for online receivers.Without knowledge of the attack target, adversarial perturbations are injected to the pilots, poisoning the online deep receiver and impairing its ability to adapt to dynamic channels and nonlinear effects. In particular, our attack method targets Deep Soft Interference Cancellation (DeepSIC)[1] using online meta-learning.As a classical model-driven deep receiver, DeepSIC incorporates wireless domain knowledge into its architecture. This integration allows it to adapt efficiently to time-varying channels with only a small number of pilots, achieving optimal performance in a multi-input and multi-output (MIMO) scenario.The deep receiver in this scenario has a number of applications in the field of wireless communication, which motivates our study of the attack methods targeting it.Specifically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack in simulations on synthetic linear, synthetic nonlinear, static, and COST 2100 channels. Simulation results indicate that the proposed poisoning attack significantly reduces the performance of online receivers in rapidly changing scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper explores the theoretical foundations of fair regression under the constraint of demographic parity within the unawareness framework, where disparate treatment is prohibited, extending existing results where such treatment is permitted. Specifically, we aim to characterize the optimal fair regression function when minimizing the quadratic loss. Our results reveal that this function is given by the solution to a barycenter problem with optimal transport costs. Additionally, we study the connection between optimal fair cost-sensitive classification, and optimal fair regression. We demonstrate that nestedness of the decision sets of the classifiers is both necessary and sufficient to establish a form of equivalence between classification and regression. Under this nestedness assumption, the optimal classifiers can be derived by applying thresholds to the optimal fair regression function; conversely, the optimal fair regression function is characterized by the family of cost-sensitive classifiers.</p>

<p>Abstract: High-quality real-time view synthesis methods are based on volume rendering, splatting, or surface rendering. While surface-based methods generally are the fastest, they cannot faithfully model fuzzy geometry like hair. In turn, alpha-blending techniques excel at representing fuzzy materials but require an unbounded number of samples per ray (P1). Further overheads are induced by empty space skipping in volume rendering (P2) and sorting input primitives in splatting (P3). These problems are exacerbated on low-performance graphics hardware, e.g. on mobile devices. We present a novel representation for real-time view synthesis where the (P1) number of sampling locations is small and bounded, (P2) sampling locations are efficiently found via rasterization, and (P3) rendering is sorting-free. We achieve this by representing objects as semi-transparent multi-layer meshes, rendered in fixed layer order from outermost to innermost. We model mesh layers as SDF shells with optimal spacing learned during training. After baking, we fit UV textures to the corresponding meshes. We show that our method can represent challenging fuzzy objects while achieving higher frame rates than volume-based and splatting-based methods on low-end and mobile devices.</p>

<p>Abstract: Research in ML4VIS investigates how to use machine learning (ML) techniques to generate visualizations, and the field is rapidly growing with high societal impact. However, as with any computational pipeline that employs ML processes, ML4VIS approaches are susceptible to a range of ML-specific adversarial attacks. These attacks can manipulate visualization generations, causing analysts to be tricked and their judgments to be impaired. Due to a lack of synthesis from both visualization and ML perspectives, this security aspect is largely overlooked by the current ML4VIS literature. To bridge this gap, we investigate the potential vulnerabilities of ML-aided visualizations from adversarial attacks using a holistic lens of both visualization and ML perspectives. We first identify the attack surface (i.e., attack entry points) that is unique in ML-aided visualizations. We then exemplify five different adversarial attacks. These examples highlight the range of possible attacks when considering the attack surface and multiple different adversary capabilities. Our results show that adversaries can induce various attacks, such as creating arbitrary and deceptive visualizations, by systematically identifying input attributes that are influential in ML inferences. Based on our observations of the attack surface characteristics and the attack examples, we underline the importance of comprehensive studies of security issues and defense mechanisms as a call of urgency for the ML4VIS community.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jialong Li, Zhicheng Zhang, Yunwei Chen, Qiqi Lu, Ye Wu, Xiaoming Liu, QianJin Feng, Yanqiu Feng, Xinyuan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) holds significant importance in clinical diagnosis and neuroscience research. However, conventional model-based fitting methods often suffer from sensitivity to noise, leading to decreased accuracy in estimating DTI parameters. While traditional data-driven deep learning methods have shown potential in terms of accuracy and efficiency, their limited generalization to out-of-training-distribution data impedes their broader application due to the diverse scan protocols used across centers, scanners, and studies. This work aims to tackle these challenges and promote the use of DTI by introducing a data-driven optimization-based method termed DoDTI. DoDTI combines the weighted linear least squares fitting algorithm and regularization by denoising technique. The former fits DW images from diverse acquisition settings into diffusion tensor field, while the latter applies a deep learning-based denoiser to regularize the diffusion tensor field instead of the DW images, which is free from the limitation of fixed-channel assignment of the network. The optimization object is solved using the alternating direction method of multipliers and then unrolled to construct a deep neural network, leveraging a data-driven strategy to learn network parameters. Extensive validation experiments are conducted utilizing both internally simulated datasets and externally obtained in-vivo datasets. The results, encompassing both qualitative and quantitative analyses, showcase that the proposed method attains state-of-the-art performance in DTI parameter estimation. Notably, it demonstrates superior generalization, accuracy, and efficiency, rendering it highly reliable for widespread application in the field.</p>

Our training scheme randomly applies linear smoothing filters to input acoustic features, facilitating vocoder generalization across a wide range of smoothings. It significantly mitigates the training-inference mismatch, enhancing the naturalness of synthetic output even when the acoustic model produces overly smoothed features. Notably, our method is applicable to any vocoder without requiring architectural modifications or dependencies on specific acoustic models. The experimental results validate the superiority of our vocoder over conventional methods, achieving 11.99% and 12.05% improvements in mean opinion scores when integrated with Tacotron 2 and FastSpeech 2 TTS acoustic models, respectively.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recognizing objects in low-resolution images is a challenging task due to the lack of informative details. Recent studies have shown that knowledge distillation approaches can effectively transfer knowledge from a high-resolution teacher model to a low-resolution student model by aligning cross-resolution representations. However, these approaches still face limitations in adapting to the situation where the recognized objects exhibit significant representation discrepancies between training and testing images. In this study, we propose a cross-resolution relational contrastive distillation approach to facilitate low-resolution object recognition. Our approach enables the student model to mimic the behavior of a well-trained teacher model which delivers high accuracy in identifying high-resolution objects. To extract sufficient knowledge, the student learning is supervised with contrastive relational distillation loss, which preserves the similarities in various relational structures in contrastive representation space. In this manner, the capability of recovering missing details of familiar low-resolution objects can be effectively enhanced, leading to a better knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on low-resolution object classification and low-resolution face recognition clearly demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fatma Yasmine Loumachi, Mohamed Chahine Ghanem</p>
<p>Abstract: Timeline Analysis (TA) is a key part of Timeline Forensics (TF) in Digital Forensics (DF), focusing primarily on examining and analysing temporal digital artefacts such as timestamps, derived from event logs, file metadata, and other related data to correlate events resulting from cyber incidents and reconstruct their chronological timeline. Traditional tools often struggle to efficiently process the vast volume and variety of data acquired during DF investigations and Incident Response (IR) processes. This paper presents a novel framework, GenDFIR, that combines Rule-Based Artificial Intelligence (R-BAI) algorithms with Large Language Models (LLMs) to advance and automate the TA process. Our approach consists of two main stages (1) We use R-BAI to identify and select anomalous digital artefacts based on predefined rules. (2) The selected artefacts are then converted into embeddings for processing by an LLM with the help of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agent. The LLM consequently leverages its capabilities to perform automated TA on the artefacts and predict potential incident scenarios. To validate our framework, we evaluate GenDFIR performance, efficiency, and reliability using various metrics across synthetic cyber incident simulation scenarios. This paper presents a proof of concept, where the findings demonstrate the significant potential of integrating R-BAI and LLMs for TA. This novel approach highlights the power of Generative AI (GenAI), specifically LLMs, and opens new avenues for advanced threat detection and incident reconstruction, representing a significant step forward in the field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> N. T. Diba, N. Akter, S. A. H. Chowdhury, J. E. Giti</p>
<p>Abstract: A person's Body Mass Index, or BMI, is the most widely used parameter for assessing their health. BMI is a crucial predictor of potential diseases that may arise at higher body fat levels because it is correlated with body fat. Conversely, a community's or an individual's nutritional status can be determined using the BMI. Although deep learning models are used in several studies to estimate BMI from face photos and other data, no previous research established a clear connection between deep learning techniques for handwriting analysis and BMI prediction. This article addresses this research gap with a deep learning approach to estimating BMI from handwritten characters by developing a convolutional neural network (CNN). A dataset containing samples from 48 people in lowercase English scripts is successfully captured for the BMI prediction task. The proposed CNN-based approach reports a commendable accuracy of 99.92%. Performance comparison with other popular CNN architectures reveals that AlexNet and InceptionV3 achieve the second and third-best performance, with the accuracy of 99.69% and 99.53%, respectively.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this work, we propose a fashion item recommendation model that incorporates hyperbolic geometry into user and item representations. Using hyperbolic space, our model aims to capture implicit hierarchies among items based on their visual data and users' purchase history. During training, we apply a multi-task learning framework that considers both hyperbolic and Euclidean distances in the loss function. Our experiments on three data sets show that our model performs better than previous models trained in Euclidean space only, confirming the effectiveness of our model. Our ablation studies show that multi-task learning plays a key role, and removing the Euclidean loss substantially deteriorates the model performance.</p>

We introduce AdvSecureNet, a PyTorch based toolkit for adversarial machine learning that is the first to natively support multi-GPU setups for attacks, defenses, and evaluation. It is the first toolkit that supports both CLI and API interfaces and external YAML configuration files to enhance versatility and reproducibility. The toolkit includes multiple attacks, defenses and evaluation metrics. Rigiorous software engineering practices are followed to ensure high code quality and maintainability.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alberto Portela, Julio R. Banga, Marcos Matabuena</p>
<p>Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is the process of systematically determining and characterizing the degree of confidence in computational model predictions. In the context of systems biology, especially with dynamic models, UQ is crucial because it addresses the challenges posed by nonlinearity and parameter sensitivity, allowing us to properly understand and extrapolate the behavior of complex biological systems. Here, we focus on dynamic models represented by deterministic nonlinear ordinary differential equations. Many current UQ approaches in this field rely on Bayesian statistical methods. While powerful, these methods often require strong prior specifications and make parametric assumptions that may not always hold in biological systems. Additionally, these methods face challenges in domains where sample sizes are limited, and statistical inference becomes constrained, with computational speed being a bottleneck in large models of biological systems. As an alternative, we propose the use of conformal inference methods, introducing two novel algorithms that, in some instances, offer non-asymptotic guarantees, enhancing robustness and scalability across various applications. We demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed algorithms through several scenarios, highlighting their advantages over traditional Bayesian approaches. The proposed methods show promising results for diverse biological data structures and scenarios, offering a general framework to quantify uncertainty for dynamic models of biological systems.The software for the methodology and the reproduction of the results is available at https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.13644870.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cornelius B\"urkle, Fabian Oboril, Kay-Ulrich Scholl</p>
<p>Abstract: The automotive industry is currently expanding digital display options with every new model that comes onto the market. This entails not just an expansion in dimensions, resolution, and customization choices, but also the capability to employ novel display effects like overlays while assembling the content of the display cluster. Unfortunately, this raises the need for appropriate monitoring systems that can detect rendering errors and apply appropriate countermeasures when required. Classical solutions such as Cyclic Redundancy Checks (CRC) will soon be no longer viable as any sort of alpha blending, warping of scaling of content can cause unwanted CRC violations. Therefore, we propose a novel monitoring approach to verify correctness of displayed content using telltales (e.g. warning signs) as example. It uses a learning-based approach to separate "good" telltales, i.e. those that a human driver will understand correctly, and "corrupted" telltales, i.e. those that will not be visible or perceived correctly. As a result, it possesses inherent resilience against individual pixel errors and implicitly supports changing backgrounds, overlay or scaling effects. This is underlined by our experimental study where all "corrupted" test patterns were correctly classified, while no false alarms were triggered.</p>

<p>Abstract: This book introduces the mathematical foundations and techniques that lead to the development and analysis of many of the algorithms that are used in machine learning. It starts with an introductory chapter that describes notation used throughout the book and serve at a reminder of basic concepts in calculus, linear algebra and probability and also introduces some measure theoretic terminology, which can be used as a reading guide for the sections that use these tools. The introductory chapters also provide background material on matrix analysis and optimization. The latter chapter provides theoretical support to many algorithms that are used in the book, including stochastic gradient descent, proximal methods, etc. After discussing basic concepts for statistical prediction, the book includes an introduction to reproducing kernel theory and Hilbert space techniques, which are used in many places, before addressing the description of various algorithms for supervised statistical learning, including linear methods, support vector machines, decision trees, boosting, or neural networks. The subject then switches to generative methods, starting with a chapter that presents sampling methods and an introduction to the theory of Markov chains. The following chapter describe the theory of graphical models, an introduction to variational methods for models with latent variables, and to deep-learning based generative models. The next chapters focus on unsupervised learning methods, for clustering, factor analysis and manifold learning. The final chapter of the book is theory-oriented and discusses concentration inequalities and generalization bounds.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruoyu Wang, Yao Liu, Yuanjiang Cao, Lina Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning algorithms have garnered growing interest in developing versatile Embodied AI systems. However, current research in this domain reveals opportunities for improvement. First, the direct adoption of RNNs and Transformers often overlooks the specific differences between Embodied AI and traditional sequential data modelling, potentially limiting its performance in Embodied AI tasks. Second, the reliance on task-specific configurations, such as pre-trained modules and dataset-specific logic, compromises the generalizability of these methods. We address these constraints by initially exploring the unique differences between Embodied AI tasks and other sequential data tasks through the lens of Causality, presenting a causal framework to elucidate the inadequacies of conventional sequential methods for Embodied AI. By leveraging this causal perspective, we propose Causality-Aware Transformer (CAT) Networks for Navigation, featuring a Causal Understanding Module to enhance the models's Environmental Understanding capability. Meanwhile, our method is devoid of task-specific inductive biases and can be trained in an End-to-End manner, which enhances the method's generalizability across various contexts. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our methodology consistently surpasses benchmark performances across a spectrum of settings, tasks and simulation environments. Extensive ablation studies reveal that the performance gains can be attributed to the Causal Understanding Module, which demonstrates effectiveness and efficiency in both Reinforcement Learning and Supervised Learning settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Timescales of neural activity are diverse across and within brain areas, and experimental observations suggest that neural timescales reflect information in dynamic environments. However, these observations do not specify how neural timescales are shaped, nor whether particular timescales are necessary for neural computations and brain function. Here, we take a complementary perspective and synthesize three directions where computational methods can distill the broad set of empirical observations into quantitative and testable theories: We review (i) how data analysis methods allow us to capture different timescales of neural dynamics across different recording modalities, (ii) how computational models provide a mechanistic explanation for the emergence of diverse timescales, and (iii) how task-optimized models in machine learning uncover the functional relevance of neural timescales. This integrative computational approach, combined with empirical findings, would provide a more holistic understanding of how neural timescales capture the relationship between brain structure, dynamics, and behavior.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruoyu Wang, Xiaoxuan Li, Lina Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable efficiency in tackling various tasks based on human instructions, but recent studies reveal that these models often fail to achieve satisfactory results on questions involving reasoning, such as mathematics or physics questions. This phenomenon is usually attributed to the uncertainty regarding whether these models could genuinely comprehend the knowledge embedded in the text or merely learn to replicate the token distribution without a true understanding of the content. In this paper, we delve into this problem and aim to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. First, we investigate if the model has genuine reasoning capabilities by visualizing the text generation process at the attention and representation level. Then, we formulate the reasoning process of LLMs into a causal framework, which provides a formal explanation of the problems we observe in the visualization. Finally, building upon this causal framework, we propose Deconfounded Causal Adaptation (DCA), a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method to enhance the model's reasoning capabilities by encouraging the model to extract the general problem-solving skills and apply these skills to different questions. Experiments show that our method outperforms the baseline consistently across multiple benchmarks, and with only 1.2M tunable parameters, we achieve better or comparable results to other fine-tuning methods. This demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of our method in improving the overall accuracy and reliability of LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Constantin Waubert de Puiseau, Fabian Wolz, Merlin Montag, Jannik Peters, Hasan Tercan, Tobias Meisen</p>
<p>Abstract: The job shop scheduling problem (JSSP) and its solution algorithms have been of enduring interest in both academia and industry for decades. In recent years, machine learning (ML) is playing an increasingly important role in advancing existing and building new heuristic solutions for the JSSP, aiming to find better solutions in shorter computation times. In this paper we build on top of a state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent, called Neural Local Search (NLS), which can efficiently and effectively control a large local neighborhood search on the JSSP. In particular, we develop a method for training the decision transformer (DT) algorithm on search trajectories taken by a trained NLS agent to further improve upon the learned decision-making sequences. Our experiments show that the DT successfully learns local search strategies that are different and, in many cases, more effective than those of the NLS agent itself. In terms of the tradeoff between solution quality and acceptable computational time needed for the search, the DT is particularly superior in application scenarios where longer computational times are acceptable. In this case, it makes up for the longer inference times required per search step, which are caused by the larger neural network architecture, through better quality decisions per step. Thereby, the DT achieves state-of-the-art results for solving the JSSP with ML-enhanced search.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nidhi Kowtal, Tejas Deshpande, Raviraj Joshi</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine translation in low-resource language pairs faces significant challenges due to the scarcity of parallel corpora and linguistic resources. This study focuses on the case of English-Marathi language pairs, where existing datasets are notably noisy, impeding the performance of machine translation models. To mitigate the impact of data quality issues, we propose a data filtering approach based on cross-lingual sentence representations. Our methodology leverages a multilingual SBERT model to filter out problematic translations in the training data. Specifically, we employ an IndicSBERT similarity model to assess the semantic equivalence between original and translated sentences, allowing us to retain linguistically correct translations while discarding instances with substantial deviations. The results demonstrate a significant improvement in translation quality over the baseline post-filtering with IndicSBERT. This illustrates how cross-lingual sentence representations can reduce errors in machine translation scenarios with limited resources. By integrating multilingual sentence BERT models into the translation pipeline, this research contributes to advancing machine translation techniques in low-resource environments. The proposed method not only addresses the challenges in English-Marathi language pairs but also provides a valuable framework for enhancing translation quality in other low-resource language translation tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiarui Sun, M. Ugur Akcal, Wei Zhang, Girish Chowdhary</p>
<p>Abstract: In visual Reinforcement Learning (RL), learning from pixel-based observations poses significant challenges on sample efficiency, primarily due to the complexity of extracting informative state representations from high-dimensional data. Previous methods such as contrastive-based approaches have made strides in improving sample efficiency but fall short in modeling the nuanced evolution of states. To address this, we introduce MOOSS, a novel framework that leverages a temporal contrastive objective with the help of graph-based spatial-temporal masking to explicitly model state evolution in visual RL. Specifically, we propose a self-supervised dual-component strategy that integrates (1) a graph construction of pixel-based observations for spatial-temporal masking, coupled with (2) a multi-level contrastive learning mechanism that enriches state representations by emphasizing temporal continuity and change of states. MOOSS advances the understanding of state dynamics by disrupting and learning from spatial-temporal correlations, which facilitates policy learning. Our comprehensive evaluation on multiple continuous and discrete control benchmarks shows that MOOSS outperforms previous state-of-the-art visual RL methods in terms of sample efficiency, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.

We propose a novel privacy-enhancing system that generates privacy-enhanced portraits while maintaining high HPE performance. Our key innovations include the reversible recovery of SPI for authorized personnel and the preservation of contextual information. By jointly optimizing a privacy-enhancing module, a privacy recovery module, and a pose estimator, our system ensures robust privacy protection, efficient SPI recovery, and high-performance HPE. Experimental results demonstrate the system's robust performance in privacy enhancement, SPI recovery, and HPE.</p>

<p>Abstract: The emergent dynamics in spacetime diagrams of cellular automata (CAs) is often organised by means of a number of behavioural classes. Whilst classification of elementary CAs is feasible and well-studied, non-elementary CAs are generally too diverse and numerous to exhaustively classify manually. In this chapter we treat the spacetime diagram as a digital image, and implement simple computer vision techniques to perform an automated classification of elementary cellular automata into the five Li-Packard classes. In particular, we present a supervised learning task to a convolutional neural network, in such a way that it may be generalised to non-elementary CAs. If we want to do so, we must divert the algorithm's focus away from the underlying 'microscopic' local updates. We first show that previously developed deep learning approaches have in fact been trained to identify the local update rule, rather than directly focus on the mesoscopic patterns that are associated with the particular behavioural classes. By means of a well-argued neural network design, as well as a number of data augmentation techniques, we then present a convolutional neural network that performs nearly perfectly at identifying the behavioural class, without necessarily first identifying the underlying microscopic dynamics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wang Xinming, Wang Chao, Song Xuan, Kirby Levi, Wu Jianguo</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-output Gaussian process (MGP) has been attracting increasing attention as a transfer learning method to model multiple outputs. Despite its high flexibility and generality, MGP still faces two critical challenges when applied to transfer learning. The first one is negative transfer, which occurs when there exists no shared information among the outputs. The second challenge is the input domain inconsistency, which is commonly studied in transfer learning yet not explored in MGP. In this paper, we propose a regularized MGP modeling framework with domain adaptation to overcome these challenges. More specifically, a sparse covariance matrix of MGP is proposed by using convolution process, where penalization terms are added to adaptively select the most informative outputs for knowledge transfer. To deal with the domain inconsistency, a domain adaptation method is proposed by marginalizing inconsistent features and expanding missing features to align the input domains among different outputs. Statistical properties of the proposed method are provided to guarantee the performance practically and asymptotically. The proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks in comprehensive simulation studies and one real case study of a ceramic manufacturing process. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in dealing with both the negative transfer and the domain inconsistency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Trusted execution environments (TEEs) for machine learning accelerators are indispensable in secure and efficient ML inference. Optimizing workloads through state-space exploration for the accelerator architectures improves performance and energy consumption. However, such explorations are expensive and slow due to the large search space. Current research has to use fast analytical models that forego critical hardware details and cross-layer opportunities unique to the hardware security primitives. While cycle-accurate models can theoretically reach better designs, their high runtime cost restricts them to a smaller state space.
  We present Obsidian, an optimization framework for finding the optimal mapping from ML kernels to a secure ML accelerator. Obsidian addresses the above challenge by exploring the state space using analytical and cycle-accurate models cooperatively. The two main exploration components include: (1) A secure accelerator analytical model, that includes the effect of secure hardware while traversing the large mapping state space and produce the best m model mappings; (2) A compiler profiling step on a cycle-accurate model, that captures runtime bottlenecks to further improve execution runtime, energy and resource utilization and find the optimal model mapping.
  We compare our results to a baseline secure accelerator, comprising of the state-of-the-art security schemes obtained from guardnn [ 33 ] and sesame [11]. The analytical model reduces the inference latency by 20.5% for a cloud and 8.4% for an edge deployment with an energy improvement of 24% and 19% respectively. The cycle-accurate model, further reduces the latency by 9.1% for a cloud and 12.2% for an edge with an energy improvement of 13.8% and 13.1%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jamie Lohoff, Jan Finkbeiner, Emre Neftci</p>
<p>Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) simulators are essential tools to prototype biologically inspired models and neuromorphic hardware architectures and predict their performance. For such a tool, ease of use and flexibility are critical, but so is simulation speed especially given the complexity inherent to simulating SNN. Here, we present SNNAX, a JAX-based framework for simulating and training such models with PyTorch-like intuitiveness and JAX-like execution speed. SNNAX models are easily extended and customized to fit the desired model specifications and target neuromorphic hardware. Additionally, SNNAX offers key features for optimizing the training and deployment of SNNs such as flexible automatic differentiation and just-in-time compilation. We evaluate and compare SNNAX to other commonly used machine learning (ML) frameworks used for programming SNNs. We provide key performance metrics, best practices, documented examples for simulating SNNs in SNNAX, and implement several benchmarks used in the literature.</p>

<p>Abstract: Modern e-commerce platforms offer vast product selections, making it difficult for customers to find items that they like and that are relevant to their current session intent. This is why it is key for e-commerce platforms to have near real-time scalable and adaptable personalized ranking and search systems. While numerous methods exist in the scientific literature for building such systems, many are unsuitable for large-scale industrial use due to complexity and performance limitations. Consequently, industrial ranking systems often resort to computationally efficient yet simplistic retrieval or candidate generation approaches, which overlook near real-time and heterogeneous customer signals, which results in a less personalized and relevant experience. Moreover, related customer experiences are served by completely different systems, which increases complexity, maintenance, and inconsistent experiences.
  In this paper, we present a personalized, adaptable near real-time ranking platform that is reusable across various use cases, such as browsing and search, and that is able to cater to millions of items and customers under heavy load (thousands of requests per second). We employ transformer-based models through different ranking layers which can learn complex behavior patterns directly from customer action sequences while being able to incorporate temporal (e.g. in-session) and contextual information. We validate our system through a series of comprehensive offline and online real-world experiments at a large online e-commerce platform, and we demonstrate its superiority when compared to existing systems, both in terms of customer experience as well as in net revenue. Finally, we share the lessons learned from building a comprehensive, modern ranking platform for use in a large-scale e-commerce environment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cristian Gariboldi, Matteo Corno, Beng Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: With the release of open source datasets such as nuPlan and Argoverse, the research around learning-based planners has spread a lot in the last years. Existing systems have shown excellent capabilities in imitating the human driver behaviour, but they struggle to guarantee safe closed-loop driving. Conversely, optimization-based planners offer greater security in short-term planning scenarios. To confront this challenge, in this paper we propose a novel hybrid motion planner that integrates both learning-based and optimization-based techniques. Initially, a multilayer perceptron (MLP) generates a human-like trajectory, which is then refined by an optimization-based component. This component not only minimizes tracking errors but also computes a trajectory that is both kinematically feasible and collision-free with obstacles and road boundaries. Our model effectively balances safety and human-likeness, mitigating the trade-off inherent in these objectives. We validate our approach through simulation experiments and further demonstrate its efficacy by deploying it in real-world self-driving vehicles.</p>

<p>Abstract: Advancements in LLMs have recently unveiled challenges tied to computational efficiency and continual scalability due to their requirements of huge parameters, making the applications and evolution of these models on devices with limited computation resources and scenarios requiring various abilities increasingly cumbersome. Inspired by modularity within the human brain, there is a growing tendency to decompose LLMs into numerous functional modules, allowing for inference with part of modules and dynamic assembly of modules to tackle complex tasks, such as mixture-of-experts. To highlight the inherent efficiency and composability of the modular approach, we coin the term brick to represent each functional module, designating the modularized structure as configurable foundation models. In this paper, we offer a comprehensive overview and investigation of the construction, utilization, and limitation of configurable foundation models. We first formalize modules into emergent bricks - functional neuron partitions that emerge during the pre-training phase, and customized bricks - bricks constructed via additional post-training to improve the capabilities and knowledge of LLMs. Based on diverse functional bricks, we further present four brick-oriented operations: retrieval and routing, merging, updating, and growing. These operations allow for dynamic configuration of LLMs based on instructions to handle complex tasks. To verify our perspective, we conduct an empirical analysis on widely-used LLMs. We find that the FFN layers follow modular patterns with functional specialization of neurons and functional neuron partitions. Finally, we highlight several open issues and directions for future research. Overall, this paper aims to offer a fresh modular perspective on existing LLM research and inspire the future creation of more efficient and scalable foundational models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guangtao Zheng, Wenqian Ye, Aidong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Few-shot image classifiers are designed to recognize and classify new data with minimal supervision and limited data but often show reliance on spurious correlations between classes and spurious attributes, known as spurious bias. Spurious correlations commonly hold in certain samples and few-shot classifiers can suffer from spurious bias induced from them. There is an absence of an automatic benchmarking system to assess the robustness of few-shot classifiers against spurious bias. In this paper, we propose a systematic and rigorous benchmark framework, termed FewSTAB, to fairly demonstrate and quantify varied degrees of robustness of few-shot classifiers to spurious bias. FewSTAB creates few-shot evaluation tasks with biased attributes so that using them for predictions can demonstrate poor performance. To construct these tasks, we propose attribute-based sample selection strategies based on a pre-trained vision-language model, eliminating the need for manual dataset curation. This allows FewSTAB to automatically benchmark spurious bias using any existing test data. FewSTAB offers evaluation results in a new dimension along with a new design guideline for building robust classifiers. Moreover, it can benchmark spurious bias in varied degrees and enable designs for varied degrees of robustness. Its effectiveness is demonstrated through experiments on ten few-shot learning methods across three datasets. We hope our framework can inspire new designs of robust few-shot classifiers.

<p>Abstract: A data-driven model (DDM) suitable for regional weather forecasting applications is presented. The model extends the Artificial Intelligence Forecasting System by introducing a stretched-grid architecture that dedicates higher resolution over a regional area of interest and maintains a lower resolution elsewhere on the globe. The model is based on graph neural networks, which naturally affords arbitrary multi-resolution grid configurations.
  The model is applied to short-range weather prediction for the Nordics, producing forecasts at 2.5 km spatial and 6 h temporal resolution. The model is pre-trained on 43 years of global ERA5 data at 31 km resolution and is further refined using 3.3 years of 2.5 km resolution operational analyses from the MetCoOp Ensemble Prediction System (MEPS). The performance of the model is evaluated using surface observations from measurement stations across Norway and is compared to short-range weather forecasts from MEPS. The DDM outperforms both the control run and the ensemble mean of MEPS for 2 m temperature. The model also produces competitive precipitation and wind speed forecasts, but is shown to underestimate extreme events.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matin Ansaripour, Shayan Talaei, Giorgi Nadiradze, Dan Alistarh</p>
<p>Abstract: Distributed optimization is the standard way of speeding up machine learning training, and most of the research in the area focuses on distributed first-order, gradient-based methods. Yet, there are settings where some computationally-bounded nodes may not be able to implement first-order, gradient-based optimization, while they could still contribute to joint optimization tasks. In this paper, we initiate the study of hybrid decentralized optimization, studying settings where nodes with zeroth-order and first-order optimization capabilities co-exist in a distributed system, and attempt to jointly solve an optimization task over some data distribution. We essentially show that, under reasonable parameter settings, such a system can not only withstand noisier zeroth-order agents but can even benefit from integrating such agents into the optimization process, rather than ignoring their information. At the core of our approach is a new analysis of distributed optimization with noisy and possibly-biased gradient estimators, which may be of independent interest. Our results hold for both convex and non-convex objectives. Experimental results on standard optimization tasks confirm our analysis, showing that hybrid first-zeroth order optimization can be practical, even when training deep neural networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ting Gao, Rodrigo Kappes Marques, Lei Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Traffic forecasting is an important application of spatiotemporal series prediction. Among different methods, graph neural networks have achieved so far the most promising results, learning relations between graph nodes then becomes a crucial task. However, improvement space is very limited when these relations are learned in a node-to-node manner. The challenge stems from (1) obscure temporal dependencies between different stations, (2) difficulties in defining variables beyond the node level, and (3) no ready-made method to validate the learned relations. To confront these challenges, we define legitimate traffic causal variables to discover the causal relation inside the traffic network, which is carefully checked with statistic tools and case analysis. We then present a novel model named Graph Spatial-Temporal Network Based on Causal Insight (GT-CausIn), where prior learned causal information is integrated with graph diffusion layers and temporal convolutional network (TCN) layers. Experiments are carried out on two real-world traffic datasets: PEMS-BAY and METR-LA, which show that GT-CausIn significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models on mid-term and long-term prediction.</p>

<p>Abstract: Event sequences often emerge in data mining. Modeling these sequences presents two main challenges: methodological and computational. Methodologically, event sequences are non-uniform and sparse, making traditional models unsuitable. Computationally, the vast amount of data and the significant length of each sequence necessitate complex and efficient models. Existing solutions, such as recurrent and transformer neural networks, rely on parametric intensity functions defined at each moment. These functions are either limited in their ability to represent complex event sequences or notably inefficient.
  We propose COTIC, a method based on an efficient convolution neural network designed to handle the non-uniform occurrence of events over time. Our paper introduces a continuous convolution layer, allowing a model to capture complex dependencies, including, e.g., the self-excitement effect, with little computational expense.
  COTIC outperforms existing models in predicting the next event time and type, achieving an average rank of 1.5 compared to 3.714 for the nearest competitor. Furthermore, COTIC`s ability to produce effective embeddings demonstrates its potential for various downstream tasks. Our code is open and available at: https://github.com/VladislavZh/COTIC.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shengbo Wang, Nian Si, Jose Blanchet, Zhengyuan Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Dynamic decision-making under distributional shifts is of fundamental interest in theory and applications of reinforcement learning: The distribution of the environment in which the data is collected can differ from that of the environment in which the model is deployed. This paper presents two novel model-free algorithms, namely the distributionally robust Q-learning and its variance-reduced counterpart, that can effectively learn a robust policy despite distributional shifts. These algorithms are designed to efficiently approximate the $q$-function of an infinite-horizon $\gamma$-discounted robust Markov decision process with Kullback-Leibler ambiguity set to an entry-wise $\epsilon$-degree of precision. Further, the variance-reduced distributionally robust Q-learning combines the synchronous Q-learning with variance-reduction techniques to enhance its performance. Consequently, we establish that it attains a minimax sample complexity upper bound of $\tilde O(|\mathbf{S}||\mathbf{A}|(1-\gamma)^{-4}\epsilon^{-2})$, where $\mathbf{S}$ and $\mathbf{A}$ denote the state and action spaces. This is the first complexity result that is independent of the ambiguity size $\delta$, thereby providing new complexity theoretic insights. Additionally, a series of numerical experiments confirm the theoretical findings and the efficiency of the algorithms in handling distributional shifts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangyu Liu, Kaiqing Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: We study provable multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) in the general framework of partially observable stochastic games (POSGs). To circumvent the known hardness results and the use of computationally intractable oracles, we advocate leveraging the potential \emph{information-sharing} among agents, a common practice in empirical multi-agent RL, and a standard model for multi-agent control systems with communications. We first establish several computational complexity results to justify the necessity of information-sharing, as well as the observability assumption that has enabled quasi-efficient single-agent RL with partial observations, for efficiently solving POSGs. {Inspired by the inefficiency of planning in the ground-truth model,} we then propose to further \emph{approximate} the shared common information to construct an {approximate model} of the POSG, in which planning an approximate \emph{equilibrium} (in terms of solving the original POSG) can be quasi-efficient, i.e., of quasi-polynomial-time, under the aforementioned assumptions. Furthermore, we develop a partially observable multi-agent RL algorithm that is \emph{both} statistically and computationally quasi-efficient. {Finally, beyond equilibrium learning, we extend our algorithmic framework to finding the \emph{team-optimal solution} in cooperative POSGs, i.e., decentralized partially observable Markov decision processes, a much more challenging goal. We establish concrete computational and sample complexities under several common structural assumptions of the model.} We hope our study could open up the possibilities of leveraging and even designing different \emph{information structures}, a well-studied notion in control theory, for developing both sample- and computation-efficient partially observable multi-agent RL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ameya Prabhu, Hasan Abed Al Kader Hammoud, Ser-Nam Lim, Bernard Ghanem, Philip H. S. Torr, Adel Bibi</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) often relies on the availability of extensive annotated datasets, an assumption that is unrealistically time-consuming and costly in practice. We explore a novel paradigm termed name-only continual learning where time and cost constraints prohibit manual annotation. In this scenario, learners adapt to new category shifts using only category names without the luxury of annotated training data. Our proposed solution leverages the expansive and ever-evolving internet to query and download uncurated webly-supervised data for image classification. We investigate the reliability of our web data and find them comparable, and in some cases superior, to manually annotated datasets. Additionally, we show that by harnessing the web, we can create support sets that surpass state-of-the-art name-only classification that create support sets using generative models or image retrieval from LAION-5B, achieving up to 25% boost in accuracy. When applied across varied continual learning contexts, our method consistently exhibits a small performance gap in comparison to models trained on manually annotated datasets. We present EvoTrends, a class-incremental dataset made from the web to capture real-world trends, created in just minutes. Overall, this paper underscores the potential of using uncurated webly-supervised data to mitigate the challenges associated with manual data labeling in continual learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxuan Li, Tianxin Xie, Chenang Liu, Zhangyue Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: The incorporation of advanced sensors and machine learning techniques has enabled modern manufacturing enterprises to perform data-driven classification-based anomaly detection based on the sensor data collected in manufacturing processes. However, one critical challenge is that newly presented defect category may manifest as the manufacturing process continues, resulting in monitoring performance deterioration of previously trained machine learning models. Hence, there is an increasing need for empowering machine learning models to learn continually. Among all continual learning methods, memory-based continual learning has the best performance but faces the constraints of data storage capacity. To address this issue, this paper develops a novel pseudo replay-based continual learning framework by integrating class incremental learning and oversampling-based data generation. Without storing all the data, the developed framework could generate high-quality data representing previous classes to train machine learning model incrementally when new category anomaly occurs. In addition, it could even enhance the monitoring performance since it also effectively improves the data quality. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated in three cases studies, which leverages supervised classification problem for anomaly detection. The experimental results show that the developed method is very promising in detecting novel anomaly while maintaining a good performance on the previous task and brings up more flexibility in model architecture.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kseniya Akhalaya, Franziska Nestler, Daniel Potts</p>
<p>Abstract: Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are an important tool for performing classification on scattered data, where one usually has to deal with many data points in high-dimensional spaces. We propose solving SVMs in primal form using feature maps based on trigonometric functions or wavelets. In small dimensional settings the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and related methods are a powerful tool in order to deal with the considered basis functions. For growing dimensions the classical FFT-based methods become inefficient due to the curse of dimensionality. Therefore, we restrict ourselves to multivariate basis functions, each of which only depends on a small number of dimensions. This is motivated by the well-known sparsity of effects and recent results regarding the reconstruction of functions from scattered data in terms of truncated analysis of variance (ANOVA) decompositions, which makes the resulting model even interpretable in terms of importance of the features as well as their couplings. The usage of small superposition dimensions has the consequence that the computational effort no longer grows exponentially but only polynomially with respect to the dimension. In order to enforce sparsity regarding the basis coefficients, we use the frequently applied $\ell_2$-norm and, in addition, $\ell_1$-norm regularization. The found classifying function, which is the linear combination of basis functions, and its variance can then be analyzed in terms of the classical ANOVA decomposition of functions. Based on numerical examples we show that we are able to recover the signum of a function that perfectly fits our model assumptions. Furthermore, we perform classification on different artificial and real-world data sets. We obtain better results with $\ell_1$-norm regularization, both in terms of accuracy and clarity of interpretability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Penwarden, Houman Owhadi, Robert M. Kirby</p>
<p>Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) as a means of solving partial differential equations (PDE) has garnered much attention in the Computational Science and Engineering (CS&E) world. This topic encompasses a broad array of methods and models aimed at solving a single or a collection of PDE problems, called multitask learning. PIML is characterized by the incorporation of physical laws into the training process of machine learning models in lieu of large data when solving PDE problems. Despite the overall success of this collection of methods, it remains incredibly difficult to analyze, benchmark, and generally compare one approach to another. Using Kolmogorov n-widths as a measure of effectiveness of approximating functions, we judiciously apply this metric in the comparison of various multitask PIML architectures. We compute lower accuracy bounds and analyze the model's learned basis functions on various PDE problems. This is the first objective metric for comparing multitask PIML architectures and helps remove uncertainty in model validation from selective sampling and overfitting. We also identify avenues of improvement for model architectures, such as the choice of activation function, which can drastically affect model generalization to "worst-case" scenarios, which is not observed when reporting task-specific errors. We also incorporate this metric into the optimization process through regularization, which improves the models' generalizability over the multitask PDE problem.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adam Ibrahim, Benjamin Th\'erien, Kshitij Gupta, Mats L. Richter, Quentin Anthony, Timoth\'ee Lesort, Eugene Belilovsky, Irina Rish</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are routinely pre-trained on billions of tokens, only to start the process over again once new data becomes available. A much more efficient solution is to continually pre-train these models, saving significant compute compared to re-training. However, the distribution shift induced by new data typically results in degraded performance on previous data or poor adaptation to the new data. In this work, we show that a simple and scalable combination of learning rate (LR) re-warming, LR re-decaying, and replay of previous data is sufficient to match the performance of fully re-training from scratch on all available data, as measured by the final loss and the average score on several language model (LM) evaluation benchmarks. Specifically, we show this for a weak but realistic distribution shift between two commonly used LLM pre-training datasets (English$\rightarrow$English) and a stronger distribution shift (English$\rightarrow$German) at the $405$M parameter model scale with large dataset sizes (hundreds of billions of tokens). Selecting the weak but realistic shift for larger-scale experiments, we also find that our continual learning strategies match the re-training baseline for a 10B parameter LLM. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can be successfully updated via simple and scalable continual learning strategies, matching the re-training baseline using only a fraction of the compute. Finally, inspired by previous work, we propose alternatives to the cosine learning rate schedule that help circumvent forgetting induced by LR re-warming and that are not bound to a fixed token budget.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francisco Mena, Diego Arenas, Andreas Dengel</p>
<p>Abstract: Studying and analyzing cropland is a difficult task due to its dynamic and heterogeneous growth behavior. Usually, diverse data sources can be collected for its estimation. Although deep learning models have proven to excel in the crop classification task, they face substantial challenges when dealing with multiple inputs, named Multi-View Learning (MVL). The methods used in the MVL scenario can be structured based on the encoder architecture, the fusion strategy, and the optimization technique. The literature has primarily focused on using specific encoder architectures for local regions, lacking a deeper exploration of other components in the MVL methodology. In contrast, we investigate the simultaneous selection of the fusion strategy and encoder architecture, assessing global-scale cropland and crop-type classifications. We use a range of five fusion strategies (Input, Feature, Decision, Ensemble, Hybrid) and five temporal encoders (LSTM, GRU, TempCNN, TAE, L-TAE) as possible configurations in the MVL method. We use the CropHarvest dataset for validation, which provides optical, radar, weather time series, and topographic information as input data. We found that in scenarios with a limited number of labeled samples, a unique configuration is insufficient for all the cases. Instead, a specialized combination should be meticulously sought, including an encoder and fusion strategy. To streamline this search process, we suggest identifying the optimal encoder architecture tailored for a particular fusion strategy, and then determining the most suitable fusion strategy for the classification task. We provide a methodological framework for researchers exploring crop classification through an MVL methodology.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xavier Mart\'inez Lua\~na, Rebeca P. D\'iaz Redondo, Manuel Fern\'andez Veiga</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an interesting strategy that enables the collaborative training of an AI model among different data owners without revealing their private datasets. Even so, FL has some privacy vulnerabilities that have been tried to be overcome by applying some techniques like Differential Privacy (DP), Homomorphic Encryption (HE), or Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC). However, these techniques have some important drawbacks that might narrow their range of application: problems to work with non-linear functions and to operate large matrix multiplications and high communication and computational costs to manage semi-honest nodes. In this context, we propose a solution to guarantee privacy in FL schemes that simultaneously solves the previously mentioned problems. Our proposal is based on the Berrut Approximated Coded Computing, a technique from the Coded Distributed Computing paradigm, adapted to a Secret Sharing configuration, to provide input privacy to FL in a scalable way. It can be applied for computing non-linear functions and treats the special case of distributed matrix multiplication, a key primitive at the core of many automated learning tasks. Because of these characteristics, it could be applied in a wide range of FL scenarios, since it is independent of the machine learning models or aggregation algorithms used in the FL scheme. We provide analysis of the achieved privacy and complexity of our solution and, due to the extensive numerical results performed, a good trade-off between privacy and precision can be observed.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elias Abad Rocamora, Yongtao Wu, Fanghui Liu, Grigorios G. Chrysos, Volkan Cevher</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial attacks in Natural Language Processing apply perturbations in the character or token levels. Token-level attacks, gaining prominence for their use of gradient-based methods, are susceptible to altering sentence semantics, leading to invalid adversarial examples. While character-level attacks easily maintain semantics, they have received less attention as they cannot easily adopt popular gradient-based methods, and are thought to be easy to defend. Challenging these beliefs, we introduce Charmer, an efficient query-based adversarial attack capable of achieving high attack success rate (ASR) while generating highly similar adversarial examples. Our method successfully targets both small (BERT) and large (Llama 2) models. Specifically, on BERT with SST-2, Charmer improves the ASR in 4.84% points and the USE similarity in 8% points with respect to the previous art. Our implementation is available in https://github.com/LIONS-EPFL/Charmer.</p>

<p>Abstract: Sleep is vital for people's physical and mental health, and sound sleep can help them focus on daily activities. Therefore, a sleep study that includes sleep patterns and sleep disorders is crucial to enhancing our knowledge about individuals' health status. This study aims to provide a comprehensive, systematic review of the recent literature to analyze the different approaches and their outcomes in sleep studies, which includes works on "sleep stages classification" and "sleep disorder detection" using AI. In this review, 183 articles were initially selected from different journals, among which 80 records were enlisted for explicit review, ranging from 2016 to 2023. Brain waves were the most commonly employed body parameters for sleep staging and disorder studies (almost 29% of the research used brain activity signals exclusively, and 77% combined with the other signals). The convolutional neural network (CNN), the most widely used of the 34 distinct artificial intelligence models, comprised 27%. The other models included the long short-term memory (LSTM), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and recurrent neural network (RNN), which consisted of 11%, 6%, 6%, and 5% sequentially. For performance metrics, accuracy was widely used for a maximum of 83.75% of the cases, the F1 score of 45%, Kappa of 36.25%, Sensitivity of 31.25%, and Specificity of 30% of cases, along with the other metrics. This article would help physicians and researchers get the gist of AI's contribution to sleep studies and the feasibility of their intended work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tongze Wang, Xiaohui Xie, Wenduo Wang, Chuyi Wang, Youjian Zhao, Yong Cui</p>
<p>Abstract: Network traffic classification is a crucial research area aiming to enhance service quality, streamline network management, and bolster cybersecurity. To address the growing complexity of transmission encryption techniques, various machine learning and deep learning methods have been proposed. However, existing approaches face two main challenges. Firstly, they struggle with model inefficiency due to the quadratic complexity of the widely used Transformer architecture. Secondly, they suffer from inadequate traffic representation because of discarding important byte information while retaining unwanted biases. To address these challenges, we propose NetMamba, an efficient linear-time state space model equipped with a comprehensive traffic representation scheme. We adopt a specially selected and improved unidirectional Mamba architecture for the networking field, instead of the Transformer, to address efficiency issues. In addition, we design a traffic representation scheme to extract valid information from massive traffic data while removing biased information. Evaluation experiments on six public datasets encompassing three main classification tasks showcase NetMamba's superior classification performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines. It achieves an accuracy rate of nearly 99% (some over 99%) in all tasks. Additionally, NetMamba demonstrates excellent efficiency, improving inference speed by up to 60 times while maintaining comparably low memory usage. Furthermore, NetMamba exhibits superior few-shot learning abilities, achieving better classification performance with fewer labeled data. To the best of our knowledge, NetMamba is the first model to tailor the Mamba architecture for networking.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Angelica Chen, Sadhika Malladi, Lily H. Zhang, Xinyi Chen, Qiuyi Zhang, Rajesh Ranganath, Kyunghyun Cho</p>
<p>Abstract: Preference learning algorithms (e.g., RLHF and DPO) are frequently used to steer LLMs to produce generations that are more preferred by humans, but our understanding of their inner workings is still limited. In this work, we study the conventional wisdom that preference learning trains models to assign higher likelihoods to more preferred outputs than less preferred outputs, measured via $\textit{ranking accuracy}$. Surprisingly, we find that most state-of-the-art preference-tuned models achieve a ranking accuracy of less than 60% on common preference datasets. We furthermore derive the $\textit{idealized ranking accuracy}$ that a preference-tuned LLM would achieve if it optimized the DPO or RLHF objective perfectly. We demonstrate that existing models exhibit a significant $\textit{alignment gap}$ -- $\textit{i.e.}$, a gap between the observed and idealized ranking accuracies. We attribute this discrepancy to the DPO objective, which is empirically and theoretically ill-suited to fix even mild ranking errors in the reference model, and derive a simple and efficient formula for quantifying the difficulty of learning a given preference datapoint. Finally, we demonstrate that ranking accuracy strongly correlates with the empirically popular win rate metric when the model is close to the reference model used in the objective, shedding further light on the differences between on-policy (e.g., RLHF) and off-policy (e.g., DPO) preference learning algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicole Hayes, Ekaterina Merkurjev, Guo-Wei Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Data sets with imbalanced class sizes, where one class size is much smaller than that of others, occur exceedingly often in many applications, including those with biological foundations, such as disease diagnosis and drug discovery. Therefore, it is extremely important to be able to identify data elements of classes of various sizes, as a failure to do so can result in heavy costs. Nonetheless, many data classification procedures do not perform well on imbalanced data sets as they often fail to detect elements belonging to underrepresented classes. In this work, we propose the BTDT-MBO algorithm, incorporating Merriman-Bence-Osher (MBO) approaches and a bidirectional transformer, as well as distance correlation and decision threshold adjustments, for data classification tasks on highly imbalanced molecular data sets, where the sizes of the classes vary greatly. The proposed technique not only integrates adjustments in the classification threshold for the MBO algorithm in order to help deal with the class imbalance, but also uses a bidirectional transformer procedure based on an attention mechanism for self-supervised learning. In addition, the model implements distance correlation as a weight function for the similarity graph-based framework on which the adjusted MBO algorithm operates. The proposed method is validated using six molecular data sets and compared to other related techniques. The computational experiments show that the proposed technique is superior to competing approaches even in the case of a high class imbalance ratio.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nirjhar Das, Gaurav Sinha</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the Linear Contextual Bandit problem in the hybrid reward setting. In this setting every arm's reward model contains arm specific parameters in addition to parameters shared across the reward models of all the arms. We can reduce this setting to two closely related settings (a) Shared - no arm specific parameters, and (b) Disjoint - only arm specific parameters, enabling the application of two popular state of the art algorithms - $\texttt{LinUCB}$ and $\texttt{DisLinUCB}$ (Algorithm 1 in (Li et al. 2010)). When the arm features are stochastic and satisfy a popular diversity condition, we provide new regret analyses for both algorithms, significantly improving on the known regret guarantees of these algorithms. Our novel analysis critically exploits the hybrid reward structure and the diversity condition. Moreover, we introduce a new algorithm $\texttt{HyLinUCB}$ that crucially modifies $\texttt{LinUCB}$ (using a new exploration coefficient) to account for sparsity in the hybrid setting. Under the same diversity assumptions, we prove that $\texttt{HyLinUCB}$ also incurs only $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret for $T$ rounds. We perform extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrating strong empirical performance of $\texttt{HyLinUCB}$.For number of arm specific parameters much larger than the number of shared parameters, we observe that $\texttt{DisLinUCB}$ incurs the lowest regret. In this case, regret of $\texttt{HyLinUCB}$ is the second best and extremely competitive to $\texttt{DisLinUCB}$. In all other situations, including our real-world dataset, $\texttt{HyLinUCB}$ has significantly lower regret than $\texttt{LinUCB}$, $\texttt{DisLinUCB}$ and other SOTA baselines we considered. We also empirically observe that the regret of $\texttt{HyLinUCB}$ grows much slower with the number of arms compared to baselines, making it suitable even for very large action spaces.</p>

<p>Abstract: Foundation model development attracts a rapidly expanding body of contributors, scientists, and applications. To help shape responsible development practices, we introduce the Foundation Model Development Cheatsheet: a growing collection of 250+ tools and resources spanning text, vision, and speech modalities. We draw on a large body of prior work to survey resources (e.g. software, documentation, frameworks, guides, and practical tools) that support informed data selection, processing, and understanding, precise and limitation-aware artifact documentation, efficient model training, advance awareness of the environmental impact from training, careful model evaluation of capabilities, risks, and claims, as well as responsible model release, licensing and deployment practices. We hope this curated collection of resources helps guide more responsible development. The process of curating this list, enabled us to review the AI development ecosystem, revealing what tools are critically missing, misused, or over-used in existing practices. We find that (i) tools for data sourcing, model evaluation, and monitoring are critically under-serving ethical and real-world needs, (ii) evaluations for model safety, capabilities, and environmental impact all lack reproducibility and transparency, (iii) text and particularly English-centric analyses continue to dominate over multilingual and multi-modal analyses, and (iv) evaluation of systems, rather than just models, is needed so that capabilities and impact are assessed in context.</p>

<p>Abstract: Clinical trials are pivotal for developing new medical treatments, yet they typically pose some risks such as patient mortality, adverse events, and enrollment failure that waste immense efforts spanning over a decade. Applying artificial intelligence (AI) to forecast or simulate key events in clinical trials holds great potential for providing insights to guide trial designs. However, complex data collection and question definition requiring medical expertise and a deep understanding of trial designs have hindered the involvement of AI thus far. This paper tackles these challenges by presenting a comprehensive suite of meticulously curated AIready datasets covering multi-modal data (e.g., drug molecule, disease code, text, categorical/numerical features) and 8 crucial prediction challenges in clinical trial design, encompassing prediction of trial duration, patient dropout rate, serious adverse event, mortality rate, trial approval outcome, trial failure reason, drug dose finding, design of eligibility criteria. Furthermore, we provide basic validation methods for each task to ensure the datasets' usability and reliability. We anticipate that the availability of such open-access datasets will catalyze the development of advanced AI approaches for clinical trial design, ultimately advancing clinical trial research and accelerating medical solution development.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xu-Hui Liu, Tian-Shuo Liu, Shengyi Jiang, Ruifeng Chen, Zhilong Zhang, Xinwei Chen, Yang Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Combining offline and online reinforcement learning (RL) techniques is indeed crucial for achieving efficient and safe learning where data acquisition is expensive. Existing methods replay offline data directly in the online phase, resulting in a significant challenge of data distribution shift and subsequently causing inefficiency in online fine-tuning. To address this issue, we introduce an innovative approach, \textbf{E}nergy-guided \textbf{DI}ffusion \textbf{S}ampling (EDIS), which utilizes a diffusion model to extract prior knowledge from the offline dataset and employs energy functions to distill this knowledge for enhanced data generation in the online phase. The theoretical analysis demonstrates that EDIS exhibits reduced suboptimality compared to solely utilizing online data or directly reusing offline data. EDIS is a plug-in approach and can be combined with existing methods in offline-to-online RL setting. By implementing EDIS to off-the-shelf methods Cal-QL and IQL, we observe a notable 20% average improvement in empirical performance on MuJoCo, AntMaze, and Adroit environments.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Quan Li, Tianxiang Zhao, Lingwei Chen, Junjie Xu, Suhang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Graphs are pervasive in the real-world, such as social network analysis, bioinformatics, and knowledge graphs. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have great ability in node classification, a fundamental task on graphs. Unfortunately, conventional GNNs still face challenges in scenarios with few labeled nodes, despite the prevalence of few-shot node classification tasks in real-world applications. To address this challenge, various approaches have been proposed, including graph meta-learning, transfer learning, and methods based on Large Language Models (LLMs). However, traditional meta-learning and transfer learning methods often require prior knowledge from base classes or fail to exploit the potential advantages of unlabeled nodes. Meanwhile, LLM-based methods may overlook the zero-shot capabilities of LLMs and rely heavily on the quality of generated contexts. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that integrates LLMs and GNNs, leveraging the zero-shot inference and reasoning capabilities of LLMs and employing a Graph-LLM-based active learning paradigm to enhance GNNs' performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in improving node classification accuracy with considerably limited labeled data, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines by significant margins.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multi-sensor ML models for EO aim to enhance prediction accuracy by integrating data from various sources. However, the presence of missing data poses a significant challenge, particularly in non-persistent sensors that can be affected by external factors. Existing literature has explored strategies like temporal dropout and sensor-invariant models to address the generalization to missing data issues. Inspired by these works, we study two novel methods tailored for multi-sensor scenarios, namely Input Sensor Dropout (ISensD) and Ensemble Sensor Invariant (ESensI). Through experimentation on three multi-sensor temporal EO datasets, we demonstrate that these methods effectively increase the robustness of model predictions to missing sensors. Particularly, we focus on how the predictive performance of models drops when sensors are missing at different levels. We observe that ensemble multi-sensor models are the most robust to the lack of sensors. In addition, the sensor dropout component in ISensD shows promising robustness results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Karel D'Oosterlinck, Winnie Xu, Chris Develder, Thomas Demeester, Amanpreet Singh, Christopher Potts, Douwe Kiela, Shikib Mehri</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are often aligned using contrastive alignment objectives and preference pair datasets. The interaction between model, paired data, and objective makes alignment a complicated procedure, sometimes producing subpar results. We study this and find that (i) preference data gives a better learning signal when the underlying responses are contrastive, and (ii) alignment objectives lead to better performance when they specify more control over the model during training. Based on these insights, we introduce Contrastive Learning from AI Revisions (CLAIR), a data-creation method which leads to more contrastive preference pairs, and Anchored Preference Optimization (APO), a controllable and more stable alignment objective. We align Llama-3-8B-Instruct using various comparable datasets and alignment objectives and measure MixEval-Hard scores, which correlate highly with human judgments. The CLAIR preferences lead to the strongest performance out of all datasets, and APO consistently outperforms less controllable objectives. Our best model, trained on 32K CLAIR preferences with APO, improves Llama-3-8B-Instruct by 7.65%, closing the gap with GPT4-turbo by 45%.

We also introduce a heuristic approach to hyperparameter tuning, significantly reducing computational costs. These findings suggest that while KAN has potential, its use should be guided by data-specific assessments.</p>

The application of neural networks holds the promise of accurately resolving high-dimensional problems with fewer computational demands and limitations compared to standard numerical methods. This versatile framework can be readily adapted for elementary differential equations, and systems of differential equations, even in cases where the solutions may exhibit discontinuities.

Existing Reinforcement Learning work directly addressing lexicographic tasks has been scarce. The few proposed approaches were all noted to be heuristics without theoretical guarantees as the Bellman equation is not applicable to them. Additionally, the practical applicability of these prior approaches also suffers from various issues such as not being able to reach the goal state. While some of these issues have been known before, in this work we investigate further shortcomings, and propose fixes for improving practical performance in many cases. We also present a policy optimization approach using our Lexicographic Projection Optimization (LPO) algorithm that has the potential to address these theoretical and practical concerns. Finally, we demonstrate our proposed algorithms on benchmark problems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent large language model (LLM) defenses have greatly improved models' ability to refuse harmful queries, even when adversarially attacked. However, LLM defenses are primarily evaluated against automated adversarial attacks in a single turn of conversation, an insufficient threat model for real-world malicious use. We demonstrate that multi-turn human jailbreaks uncover significant vulnerabilities, exceeding 70% attack success rate (ASR) on HarmBench against defenses that report single-digit ASRs with automated single-turn attacks. Human jailbreaks also reveal vulnerabilities in machine unlearning defenses, successfully recovering dual-use biosecurity knowledge from unlearned models. We compile these results into Multi-Turn Human Jailbreaks (MHJ), a dataset of 2,912 prompts across 537 multi-turn jailbreaks. We publicly release MHJ alongside a compendium of jailbreak tactics developed across dozens of commercial red teaming engagements, supporting research towards stronger LLM defenses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Felix Pfeiffer, Shahram Eivazi</p>
<p>Abstract: The tuning of hyperparameters in reinforcement learning (RL) is critical, as these parameters significantly impact an agent's performance and learning efficiency. Dynamic adjustment of hyperparameters during the training process can significantly enhance both the performance and stability of learning. Population-based training (PBT) provides a method to achieve this by continuously tuning hyperparameters throughout the training. This ongoing adjustment enables models to adapt to different learning stages, resulting in faster convergence and overall improved performance. In this paper, we propose an enhancement to PBT by simultaneously utilizing both first- and second-order optimizers within a single population. We conducted a series of experiments using the TD3 algorithm across various MuJoCo environments. Our results, for the first time, empirically demonstrate the potential of incorporating second-order optimizers within PBT-based RL. Specifically, the combination of the K-FAC optimizer with Adam led to up to a 10% improvement in overall performance compared to PBT using only Adam. Additionally, in environments where Adam occasionally fails, such as the Swimmer environment, the mixed population with K-FAC exhibited more reliable learning outcomes, offering a significant advantage in training stability without a substantial increase in computational time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hafizh Raihan Kurnia Putra, Novanto Yudistira, Tirana Noor Fatyanosa</p>
<p>Abstract: Time-series forecasting often faces challenges due to data volatility, which can lead to inaccurate predictions. Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) has emerged as a promising technique to mitigate volatility by decomposing data into distinct modes, thereby enhancing forecast accuracy. In this study, we integrate VMD with linear models to develop a robust forecasting framework. Our approach is evaluated on 13 diverse datasets, including ETTm2, WindTurbine, M4, and 10 air quality datasets from various Southeast Asian cities. The effectiveness of the VMD strategy is assessed by comparing Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) values from models utilizing VMD against those without it. Additionally, we benchmark linear-based models against well-known neural network architectures such as LSTM, Bidirectional LSTM, and RNN. The results demonstrate a significant reduction in RMSE across nearly all models following VMD application. Notably, the Linear + VMD model achieved the lowest average RMSE in univariate forecasting at 0.619. In multivariate forecasting, the DLinear + VMD model consistently outperformed others, attaining the lowest RMSE across all datasets with an average of 0.019. These findings underscore the effectiveness of combining VMD with linear models for superior time-series forecasting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Roderick Seow, Yunfan Zhao, Duncan Wood, Milind Tambe, Cleotilde Gonzalez</p>
<p>Abstract: For public health programs with limited resources, the ability to predict how behaviors change over time and in response to interventions is crucial for deciding when and to whom interventions should be allocated. Using data from a real-world maternal health program, we demonstrate how a cognitive model based on Instance-Based Learning (IBL) Theory can augment existing purely computational approaches. Our findings show that, compared to general time-series forecasters (e.g., LSTMs), IBL models, which reflect human decision-making processes, better predict the dynamics of individuals' states. Additionally, IBL provides estimates of the volatility in individuals' states and their sensitivity to interventions, which can improve the efficiency of training of other time series models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cong Zhang, Shuyi Du, Hongqing Song, Yuhe Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Estimating spatially distributed information through the interpolation of scattered observation datasets often overlooks the critical role of domain knowledge in understanding spatial dependencies. Additionally, the features of these data sets are typically limited to the spatial coordinates of the scattered observation locations. In this paper, we propose a hybrid framework that integrates data-driven spatial dependency feature extraction with rule-assisted spatial dependency function mapping to augment domain knowledge. We demonstrate the superior performance of our framework in two comparative application scenarios, highlighting its ability to capture more localized spatial features in the reconstructed distribution fields. Furthermore, we underscore its potential to enhance nonlinear estimation capabilities through the application of transformed fuzzy rules and to quantify the inherent uncertainties associated with the observation data sets. Our framework introduces an innovative approach to spatial information estimation by synergistically combining observational data with rule-assisted domain knowledge.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Natalia Zhang, Xinqi Wang, Qiwen Cui, Runlong Zhou, Sham M. Kakade, Simon S. Du</p>
<p>Abstract: We initiate the study of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (MARLHF), exploring both theoretical foundations and empirical validations. We define the task as identifying Nash equilibrium from a preference-only offline dataset in general-sum games, a problem marked by the challenge of sparse feedback signals. Our theory establishes the upper complexity bounds for Nash Equilibrium in effective MARLHF, demonstrating that single-policy coverage is inadequate and highlighting the importance of unilateral dataset coverage. These theoretical insights are verified through comprehensive experiments. To enhance the practical performance, we further introduce two algorithmic techniques. (1) We propose a Mean Squared Error (MSE) regularization along the time axis to achieve a more uniform reward distribution and improve reward learning outcomes. (2) We utilize imitation learning to approximate the reference policy, ensuring stability and effectiveness in training. Our findings underscore the multifaceted approach required for MARLHF, paving the way for effective preference-based multi-agent systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Priyanka Chudasama, Anil Surisetty, Aakarsh Malhotra, Alok Singh</p>
<p>Abstract: Classification tasks present challenges due to class imbalances and evolving data distributions. Addressing these issues requires a robust method to handle imbalances while effectively detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples not encountered during training. This study introduces a novel OOD detection algorithm designed for tabular datasets, titled Deep Neural Network-based Gaussian Descriptor for Imbalanced Tabular Data (DNN-GDITD). The DNN-GDITD algorithm can be placed on top of any DNN to facilitate better classification of imbalanced data and OOD detection using spherical decision boundaries. Using a combination of Push, Score-based, and focal losses, DNN-GDITD assigns confidence scores to test data points, categorizing them as known classes or as an OOD sample. Extensive experimentation on tabular datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of DNN-GDITD compared to three OOD algorithms. Evaluation encompasses imbalanced and balanced scenarios on diverse tabular datasets, including a synthetic financial dispute dataset and publicly available tabular datasets like Gas Sensor, Drive Diagnosis, and MNIST, showcasing DNN-GDITD's versatility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinglin Liang, Jin Zhong, Hanlin Gu, Zhongqi Lu, Xingxing Tang, Gang Dai, Shuangping Huang, Lixin Fan, Qiang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Class Continual Learning (FCCL) merges the challenges of distributed client learning with the need for seamless adaptation to new classes without forgetting old ones. The key challenge in FCCL is catastrophic forgetting, an issue that has been explored to some extent in Continual Learning (CL). However, due to privacy preservation requirements, some conventional methods, such as experience replay, are not directly applicable to FCCL. Existing FCCL methods mitigate forgetting by generating historical data through federated training of GANs or data-free knowledge distillation. However, these approaches often suffer from unstable training of generators or low-quality generated data, limiting their guidance for the model. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method of data replay based on diffusion models. Instead of training a diffusion model, we employ a pre-trained conditional diffusion model to reverse-engineer each class, searching the corresponding input conditions for each class within the model's input space, significantly reducing computational resources and time consumption while ensuring effective generation. Furthermore, we enhance the classifier's domain generalization ability on generated and real data through contrastive learning, indirectly improving the representational capability of generated data for real data. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines. Code is available at https://github.com/jinglin-liang/DDDR.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tanya Liyaqat, Tanvir Ahmad, Mohammad Kashif, Chandni Saxena</p>
<p>Abstract: Mutagenicity is a concern due to its association with genetic mutations which can result in a variety of negative consequences, including the development of cancer. Earlier identification of mutagenic compounds in the drug development process is therefore crucial for preventing the progression of unsafe candidates and reducing development costs. While computational techniques, especially machine learning models have become increasingly prevalent for this endpoint, they rely on a single modality. In this work, we introduce a novel stacked ensemble based mutagenicity prediction model which incorporate multiple modalities such as simplified molecular input line entry system (SMILES) and molecular graph. These modalities capture diverse information about molecules such as substructural, physicochemical, geometrical and topological. To derive substructural, geometrical and physicochemical information, we use SMILES, while topological information is extracted through a graph attention network (GAT) via molecular graph. Our model uses a stacked ensemble of machine learning classifiers to make predictions using these multiple features. We employ the explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) technique SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) to determine the significance of each classifier and the most relevant features in the prediction. We demonstrate that our method surpasses SOTA methods on two standard datasets across various metrics. Notably, we achieve an area under the curve of 95.21\% on the Hansen benchmark dataset, affirming the efficacy of our method in predicting mutagenicity. We believe that this research will captivate the interest of both clinicians and computational biologists engaged in translational research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wazir Ali, Jay Kumar, Saifullah Tumrani, Redhwan Nour, Adeeb Noor, Zenglin Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Sindhi word segmentation is a challenging task due to space omission and insertion issues. The Sindhi language itself adds to this complexity. It's cursive and consists of characters with inherent joining and non-joining properties, independent of word boundaries. Existing Sindhi word segmentation methods rely on designing and combining hand-crafted features. However, these methods have limitations, such as difficulty handling out-of-vocabulary words, limited robustness for other languages, and inefficiency with large amounts of noisy or raw text. Neural network-based models, in contrast, can automatically capture word boundary information without requiring prior knowledge. In this paper, we propose a Subword-Guided Neural Word Segmenter (SGNWS) that addresses word segmentation as a sequence labeling task. The SGNWS model incorporates subword representation learning through a bidirectional long short-term memory encoder, position-aware self-attention, and a conditional random field. Our empirical results demonstrate that the SGNWS model achieves state-of-the-art performance in Sindhi word segmentation on six datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fernando Casta\~neda, Jason J. Choi, Wonsuhk Jung, Bike Zhang, Claire J. Tomlin, Koushil Sreenath</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning-based control has recently shown great efficacy in performing complex tasks for various applications. However, to deploy it in real systems, it is of vital importance to guarantee the system will stay safe. Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) offer mathematical tools for designing safety-preserving controllers for systems with known dynamics. In this article, we first introduce a model-uncertainty-aware reformulation of CBF-based safety-critical controllers using Gaussian Process (GP) regression to close the gap between an approximate mathematical model and the real system, which results in a second-order cone program (SOCP)-based control design. We then present the pointwise feasibility conditions of the resulting safety controller, highlighting the level of richness that the available system information must meet to ensure safety. We use these conditions to devise an event-triggered online data collection strategy that ensures the recursive feasibility of the learned safety controller. Our method works by constantly reasoning about whether the current information is sufficient to ensure safety or if new measurements under active safe exploration are required to reduce the uncertainty. As a result, our proposed framework can guarantee the forward invariance of the safe set defined by the CBF with high probability, even if it contains a priori unexplored regions. We validate the proposed framework in two numerical simulation experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dimitrios Kollias, Andreas Psaroudakis, Anastasios Arsenos, Paraskevi Theofilou, Chunchang Shao, Guanyu Hu, Ioannis Patras</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents MMA-MRNNet, a novel deep learning architecture for dynamic multi-output Facial Expression Intensity Estimation (FEIE) from video data. Traditional approaches to this task often rely on complex 3-D CNNs, which require extensive pre-training and assume that facial expressions are uniformly distributed across all frames of a video. These methods struggle to handle videos of varying lengths, often resorting to ad-hoc strategies that either discard valuable information or introduce bias. MMA-MRNNet addresses these challenges through a two-stage process. First, the Multiple Models of Affect (MMA) extractor component is a Multi-Task Learning CNN that concurrently estimates valence-arousal, recognizes basic facial expressions, and detects action units in each frame. These representations are then processed by a Masked RNN component, which captures temporal dependencies and dynamically updates weights according to the true length of the input video, ensuring that only the most relevant features are used for the final prediction. The proposed unimodal non-ensemble learning MMA-MRNNet was evaluated on the Hume-Reaction dataset and demonstrated significantly superior performance, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by a wide margin, regardless of whether they were unimodal, multimodal, or ensemble approaches. Finally, we demonstrated the effectiveness of the MMA component of our proposed method across multiple in-the-wild datasets, where it consistently outperformed all state-of-the-art methods across various metrics.</p>

<p>Abstract: Effective protein representation learning is crucial for predicting protein functions. Traditional methods often pretrain protein language models on large, unlabeled amino acid sequences, followed by finetuning on labeled data. While effective, these methods underutilize the potential of protein structures, which are vital for function determination. Common structural representation techniques rely heavily on annotated data, limiting their generalizability. Moreover, structural pretraining methods, similar to natural language pretraining, can distort actual protein structures. In this work, we introduce a novel unsupervised protein structure representation pretraining method, cross-modal contrastive protein learning (CCPL). CCPL leverages a robust protein language model and uses unsupervised contrastive alignment to enhance structure learning, incorporating self-supervised structural constraints to maintain intrinsic structural information. We evaluated our model across various benchmarks, demonstrating the framework's superiority.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Quanjun Lang, Fei Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Regularization plays a pivotal role in ill-posed machine learning and inverse problems. However, the fundamental comparative analysis of various regularization norms remains open. We establish a small noise analysis framework to assess the effects of norms in Tikhonov and RKHS regularizations, in the context of ill-posed linear inverse problems with Gaussian noise. This framework studies the convergence rates of regularized estimators in the small noise limit and reveals the potential instability of the conventional L2-regularizer. We solve such instability by proposing an innovative class of adaptive fractional RKHS regularizers, which covers the L2 Tikhonov and RKHS regularizations by adjusting the fractional smoothness parameter. A surprising insight is that over-smoothing via these fractional RKHSs consistently yields optimal convergence rates, but the optimal hyper-parameter may decay too fast to be selected in practice.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present, QP-SBGD, a novel layer-wise stochastic optimiser tailored towards training neural networks with binary weights, known as binary neural networks (BNNs), on quantum hardware. BNNs reduce the computational requirements and energy consumption of deep learning models with minimal loss in accuracy. However, training them in practice remains to be an open challenge. Most known BNN-optimisers either rely on projected updates or binarise weights post-training. Instead, QP-SBGD approximately maps the gradient onto binary variables, by solving a quadratic constrained binary optimisation. Under practically reasonable assumptions, we show that this update rule converges with a rate of $\mathcal{O}(1 / \sqrt{T})$. Moreover, we show how the $\mathcal{NP}$-hard projection can be effectively executed on an adiabatic quantum annealer, harnessing recent advancements in quantum computation. We also introduce a projected version of this update rule and prove that if a fixed point exists in the binary variable space, the modified updates will converge to it. Last but not least, our algorithm is implemented layer-wise, making it suitable to train larger networks on resource-limited quantum hardware. Through extensive evaluations, we show that QP-SBGD outperforms or is on par with competitive and well-established baselines such as BinaryConnect, signSGD and ProxQuant when optimising the Rosenbrock function, training BNNs as well as binary graph neural networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyu Li, Shichang Zhang, Longwen Tang, Mathieu Bauchy, Yizhou Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Metallic Glasses (MGs) are widely used materials that are stronger than steel while being shapeable as plastic. While understanding the structure-property relationship of MGs remains a challenge in materials science, studying their energy barriers (EBs) as an intermediary step shows promise. In this work, we utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model MGs and study EBs. We contribute a new dataset for EB prediction and a novel Symmetrized GNN (SymGNN) model that is E(3)-invariant in expectation. SymGNN handles invariance by aggregating over orthogonal transformations of the graph structure. When applied to EB prediction, SymGNN are more accurate than molecular dynamics (MD) local-sampling methods and other machine-learning models. Compared to precise MD simulations, SymGNN reduces the inference time on new MGs from roughly 41 days to less than one second. We apply explanation algorithms to reveal the relationship between structures and EBs. The structures that we identify through explanations match the medium-range order (MRO) hypothesis and possess unique topological properties. Our work enables effective prediction and interpretation of MG EBs, bolstering material science research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Konstantin A. Maslov, Claudio Persello, Thomas Schellenberger, Alfred Stein</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate global glacier mapping is critical for understanding climate change impacts. Despite its importance, automated glacier mapping at a global scale remains largely unexplored. Here we address this gap and propose Glacier-VisionTransformer-U-Net (GlaViTU), a convolutional-transformer deep learning model, and five strategies for multitemporal global-scale glacier mapping using open satellite imagery. Assessing the spatial, temporal and cross-sensor generalisation shows that our best strategy achieves intersection over union >0.85 on previously unobserved images in most cases, which drops to >0.75 for debris-rich areas such as High-Mountain Asia and increases to >0.90 for regions dominated by clean ice. A comparative validation against human expert uncertainties in terms of area and distance deviations underscores GlaViTU performance, approaching or matching expert-level delineation. Adding synthetic aperture radar data, namely, backscatter and interferometric coherence, increases the accuracy in all regions where available. The calibrated confidence for glacier extents is reported making the predictions more reliable and interpretable. We also release a benchmark dataset that covers 9% of glaciers worldwide. Our results support efforts towards automated multitemporal and global glacier mapping.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas L\"ohr, Michele Assante, Michael Dodds, Lili Cao, Mikhail Kabeshov, Jon-Paul Janet, Marco Kl\"ahn, Ola Engkvist</p>
<p>Abstract: Many computational chemistry and molecular simulation workflows can be expressed as graphs. This abstraction is useful to modularize and potentially reuse existing components, as well as provide parallelization and ease reproducibility. Existing tools represent the computation as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), thus allowing efficient execution by parallelization of concurrent branches. These systems can, however, generally not express cyclic and conditional workflows. We therefore developed Maize, a workflow manager for cyclic and conditional graphs based on the principles of flow-based programming. By running each node of the graph concurrently in separate processes and allowing communication at any time through dedicated inter-node channels, arbitrary graph structures can be executed. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the tool on a dynamic active learning task in computational drug design, involving the use of a small molecule generative model and an associated scoring system, and on a reactivity prediction pipeline using quantum-chemistry and semiempirical approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Purba Mukherjee, Konstantinos F. Dialektopoulos, Jackson Levi Said, Jurgen Mifsud</p>
<p>Abstract: The strengthening of tensions in the cosmological parameters has led to a reconsideration of fundamental aspects of standard cosmology. The tension in the Hubble constant can also be viewed as a tension between local and early Universe constraints on the absolute magnitude $M_B$ of Type Ia supernova. In this work, we reconsider the possibility of a variation of this parameter in a model-independent way. We employ neural networks to agnostically constrain the value of the absolute magnitude as well as assess the impact and statistical significance of a variation in $M_B$ with redshift from the Pantheon+ compilation, together with a thorough analysis of the neural network architecture. We find an indication for a possible transition redshift at the $z\approx 1$ region.</p>

<p>Abstract: The lack of a suitable tool for the analysis of conversational texts in the Persian language has made various analyses of these texts, including Sentiment Analysis, difficult. In this research, we tried to make the understanding of these texts easier for the machine by providing PSC, Persian Slang Converter, a tool for converting conversational texts into formal ones, and by using the most up-to-date and best deep learning methods along with the PSC, the sentiment learning of short Persian language texts for the machine in a better way. be made More than 10 million unlabeled texts from various social networks and movie subtitles (as Conversational texts) and about 10 million news texts (as formal texts) have been used for training unsupervised models and formal implementation of the tool. 60,000 texts from the comments of Instagram social network users with positive, negative, and neutral labels are considered supervised data for training the emotion classification model of short texts. Using the formal tool, 57% of the words of the corpus of conversation were converted. Finally, by using the formalizer, FastText model, and deep LSTM network, an accuracy of 81.91 was obtained on the test data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongwei Jiang, Jingyu Zhang, Orion Weller, Nathaniel Weir, Benjamin Van Durme, Daniel Khashabi</p>
<p>Abstract: Can LLMs consistently improve their previous outputs for better results? For this to be true, LLMs would need to be better at discriminating among previously-generated alternatives, than generating initial responses. We explore the validity of this hypothesis in practice. We first formulate a unified framework that allows us to compare the generative and discriminative capability of any model on any task. In our resulting experimental analysis of several open-source and industrial LLMs, we observe that models are not reliably better at discriminating among previously-generated alternatives than generating initial responses. This finding challenges the notion that LLMs may be able to enhance their performance only through their own judgment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marcel Hallgarten, Julian Zapata, Martin Stoll, Katrin Renz, Andreas Zell</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-world autonomous driving systems must make safe decisions in the face of rare and diverse traffic scenarios. Current state-of-the-art planners are mostly evaluated on real-world datasets like nuScenes (open-loop) or nuPlan (closed-loop). In particular, nuPlan seems to be an expressive evaluation method since it is based on real-world data and closed-loop, yet it mostly covers basic driving scenarios. This makes it difficult to judge a planner's capabilities to generalize to rarely-seen situations. Therefore, we propose a novel closed-loop benchmark interPlan containing several edge cases and challenging driving scenarios. We assess existing state-of-the-art planners on our benchmark and show that neither rule-based nor learning-based planners can safely navigate the interPlan scenarios. A recently evolving direction is the usage of foundation models like large language models (LLM) to handle generalization. We evaluate an LLM-only planner and introduce a novel hybrid planner that combines an LLM-based behavior planner with a rule-based motion planner that achieves state-of-the-art performance on our benchmark.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammed Latif Siddiq, Simantika Dristi, Joy Saha, Joanna C. S. Santos</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are gaining popularity among software engineers. A crucial aspect of developing effective code generation LLMs is to evaluate these models using a robust benchmark. Evaluation benchmarks with quality issues can provide a false sense of performance. In this work, we conduct the first-of-its-kind study of the quality of prompts within benchmarks used to compare the performance of different code generation models. To conduct this study, we analyzed 3,566 prompts from 9 code generation benchmarks to identify quality issues in them. We also investigated whether fixing the identified quality issues in the benchmarks' prompts affects a model's performance. We also studied memorization issues of the evaluation dataset, which can put into question a benchmark's trustworthiness. We found that code generation evaluation benchmarks mainly focused on Python and coding exercises and had very limited contextual dependencies to challenge the model. These datasets and the developers' prompts suffer from quality issues like spelling and grammatical errors, unclear sentences to express developers' intent, and not using proper documentation style. Fixing all these issues in the benchmarks can lead to a better performance for Python code generation, but not a significant improvement was observed for Java code generation. We also found evidence that GPT-3.5-Turbo and CodeGen-2.5 models may have data contamination issues.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ryan Whetten, Titouan Parcollet, Marco Dinarelli, Yannick Est\`eve</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has proven to be useful in various speech tasks. However, these methods are generally very demanding in terms of data, memory, and computational resources. BERT-based Speech pre-Training with Random-projection Quantizer (BEST-RQ), is an SSL method that has shown great performance on Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) while being simpler than other SSL methods, such as wav2vec 2.0. Despite BEST-RQ's great performance, details are lacking in the original paper, such as the amount of GPU/TPU hours used in pre-training, and there is no official easy-to-use open-source implementation. Furthermore, BEST-RQ has not been evaluated on other downstream tasks aside from ASR and speech translation. In this work, we describe a re-implementation of a Random-projection quantizer and perform a preliminary study with a comparison to wav2vec 2.0 on four downstream tasks. We discuss the details and differences of our implementation. We show that a random projection quantizer can achieve similar downstream performance as wav2vec 2.0 while decreasing training time by over a factor of two.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Davide Piras, Alicja Polanska, Alessio Spurio Mancini, Matthew A. Price, Jason D. McEwen</p>
<p>Abstract: We advocate for a new paradigm of cosmological likelihood-based inference, leveraging recent developments in machine learning and its underlying technology, to accelerate Bayesian inference in high-dimensional settings. Specifically, we combine (i) emulation, where a machine learning model is trained to mimic cosmological observables, e.g. CosmoPower-JAX; (ii) differentiable and probabilistic programming, e.g. JAX and NumPyro, respectively; (iii) scalable Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling techniques that exploit gradients, e.g. Hamiltonian Monte Carlo; and (iv) decoupled and scalable Bayesian model selection techniques that compute the Bayesian evidence purely from posterior samples, e.g. the learned harmonic mean implemented in harmonic. This paradigm allows us to carry out a complete Bayesian analysis, including both parameter estimation and model selection, in a fraction of the time of traditional approaches. First, we demonstrate the application of this paradigm on a simulated cosmic shear analysis for a Stage IV survey in 37- and 39-dimensional parameter spaces, comparing $\Lambda$CDM and a dynamical dark energy model ($w_0w_a$CDM). We recover posterior contours and evidence estimates that are in excellent agreement with those computed by the traditional nested sampling approach while reducing the computational cost from 8 months on 48 CPU cores to 2 days on 12 GPUs. Second, we consider a joint analysis between three simulated next-generation surveys, each performing a 3x2pt analysis, resulting in 157- and 159-dimensional parameter spaces. Standard nested sampling techniques are simply unlikely to be feasible in this high-dimensional setting, requiring a projected 12 years of compute time on 48 CPU cores; on the other hand, the proposed approach only requires 8 days of compute time on 24 GPUs. All packages used in our analyses are publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hwiyoung Lee, Shuo Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning models for continuous outcomes often yield systematically biased predictions, particularly for values that largely deviate from the mean. Specifically, predictions for large-valued outcomes tend to be negatively biased (underestimating actual values), while those for small-valued outcomes are positively biased (overestimating actual values). We refer to this linear central tendency warped bias as the "systematic bias of machine learning regression". In this paper, we first demonstrate that this systematic prediction bias persists across various machine learning regression models, and then delve into its theoretical underpinnings. To address this issue, we propose a general constrained optimization approach designed to correct this bias and develop computationally efficient implementation algorithms. Simulation results indicate that our correction method effectively eliminates the bias from the predicted outcomes. We apply the proposed approach to the prediction of brain age using neuroimaging data. In comparison to competing machine learning regression models, our method effectively addresses the longstanding issue of "systematic bias of machine learning regression" in neuroimaging-based brain age calculation, yielding unbiased predictions of brain age.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thorsten Buss, Frank Gaede, Gregor Kasieczka, Claudius Krause, David Shih</p>
<p>Abstract: In the quest to build generative surrogate models as computationally efficient alternatives to rule-based simulations, the quality of the generated samples remains a crucial frontier. So far, normalizing flows have been among the models with the best fidelity. However, as the latent space in such models is required to have the same dimensionality as the data space, scaling up normalizing flows to high dimensional datasets is not straightforward. The prior L2LFlows approach successfully used a series of separate normalizing flows and sequence of conditioning steps to circumvent this problem. In this work, we extend L2LFlows to simulate showers with a 9-times larger profile in the lateral direction. To achieve this, we introduce convolutional layers and U-Net-type connections, move from masked autoregressive flows to coupling layers, and demonstrate the successful modelling of showers in the ILD Electromagnetic Calorimeter as well as Dataset 3 from the public CaloChallenge dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jason Jones, Wenxin Jiang, Nicholas Synovic, George K. Thiruvathukal, James C. Davis</p>
<p>Abstract: Background: Collaborative Software Package Registries (SPRs) are an integral part of the software supply chain. Much engineering work synthesizes SPR package into applications. Prior research has examined SPRs for traditional software, such as NPM (JavaScript) and PyPI (Python). Pre-Trained Model (PTM) Registries are an emerging class of SPR of increasing importance, because they support the deep learning supply chain.
  Aims: Recent empirical research has examined PTM registries in ways such as vulnerabilities, reuse processes, and evolution. However, no existing research synthesizes them to provide a systematic understanding of the current knowledge. Some of the existing research includes qualitative claims lacking quantitative analysis. Our research fills these gaps by providing a knowledge synthesis and quantitative analyses.
  Methods: We first conduct a systematic literature review (SLR). We then observe that some of the claims are qualitative. We identify quantifiable metrics associated with those claims, and measure in order to substantiate these claims.
  Results: From our SLR, we identify 12 claims about PTM reuse on the HuggingFace platform, 4 of which lack quantitative validation. We successfully test 3 of these claims through a quantitative analysis, and directly compare one with traditional software. Our findings corroborate qualitative claims with quantitative measurements. Our findings are: (1) PTMs have a much higher turnover rate than traditional software, indicating a dynamic and rapidly evolving reuse environment within the PTM ecosystem; and (2) There is a strong correlation between documentation quality and PTM popularity.
  Conclusions: We confirm qualitative research claims with concrete metrics, supporting prior qualitative and case study research. Our measures show further dynamics of PTM reuse, inspiring research infrastructure and new measures.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large policies pretrained on a combination of Internet-scale vision-language data and diverse robot demonstrations have the potential to change how we teach robots new skills: rather than training new behaviors from scratch, we can fine-tune such vision-language-action (VLA) models to obtain robust, generalizable policies for visuomotor control. Yet, widespread adoption of VLAs for robotics has been challenging as 1) existing VLAs are largely closed and inaccessible to the public, and 2) prior work fails to explore methods for efficiently fine-tuning VLAs for new tasks, a key component for adoption. Addressing these challenges, we introduce OpenVLA, a 7B-parameter open-source VLA trained on a diverse collection of 970k real-world robot demonstrations. OpenVLA builds on a Llama 2 language model combined with a visual encoder that fuses pretrained features from DINOv2 and SigLIP. As a product of the added data diversity and new model components, OpenVLA demonstrates strong results for generalist manipulation, outperforming closed models such as RT-2-X (55B) by 16.5% in absolute task success rate across 29 tasks and multiple robot embodiments, with 7x fewer parameters. We further show that we can effectively fine-tune OpenVLA for new settings, with especially strong generalization results in multi-task environments involving multiple objects and strong language grounding abilities, and outperform expressive from-scratch imitation learning methods such as Diffusion Policy by 20.4%. We also explore compute efficiency; as a separate contribution, we show that OpenVLA can be fine-tuned on consumer GPUs via modern low-rank adaptation methods and served efficiently via quantization without a hit to downstream success rate. Finally, we release model checkpoints, fine-tuning notebooks, and our PyTorch codebase with built-in support for training VLAs at scale on Open X-Embodiment datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongjie Yu, Hang Xu, Yizhou Chen, Yi Ren, Jia Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: Bimanual manipulation tasks typically involve multiple stages which require efficient interactions between two arms, posing step-wise and stage-wise challenges for imitation learning systems. Specifically, failure and delay of one step will broadcast through time, hinder success and efficiency of each sub-stage task, and thereby overall task performance. Although recent works have made strides in addressing certain challenges, few approaches explicitly consider the multi-stage nature of bimanual tasks while simultaneously emphasizing the importance of inference speed. In this paper, we introduce a novel keypose-conditioned consistency policy tailored for bimanual manipulation. It is a hierarchical imitation learning framework that consists of a high-level keypose predictor and a low-level trajectory generator. The predicted keyposes provide guidance for trajectory generation and also mark the completion of one sub-stage task. The trajectory generator is designed as a consistency model trained from scratch without distillation, which generates action sequences conditioning on current observations and predicted keyposes with fast inference speed. Simulated and real-world experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach surpasses baseline methods in terms of success rate and operational efficiency.

<p>Abstract: Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN) is a theoretical framework designed to address challenges in AI development, particularly focusing on data fragmentation and siloing issues. It facilitates effective AI training within sovereign data networks by overcoming barriers to accessing diverse data sources, leveraging: 1) personal data stores to ensure data sovereignty, where data remains securely within Participants' control; 2) a scalable federated learning protocol implemented on a public blockchain for decentralized AI training, where only model parameter updates are shared, keeping data within the personal data stores; and 3) a scalable, trustless cryptographic rewards mechanism on a public blockchain to incentivize participation and ensure fair reward distribution through a decentralized auditing protocol. This approach guarantees that no entity can prevent or control access to training data or influence financial benefits, as coordination and reward distribution are managed on the public blockchain with an immutable record. The framework supports effective AI training by allowing Participants to maintain control over their data, benefit financially, and contribute to a decentralized, scalable ecosystem that leverages collective AI to develop beneficial algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linping Qu, Yuyi Mao, Shenghui Song, Chi-Ying Tsui</p>
<p>Abstract: One of the most critical challenges for deploying distributed learning solutions, such as federated learning (FL), in wireless networks is the limited battery capacity of mobile clients. While it is a common belief that the major energy consumption of mobile clients comes from the uplink data transmission, this paper presents a novel finding, namely channel decoding also contributes significantly to the overall energy consumption of mobile clients in FL. Motivated by this new observation, we propose an energy-efficient adaptive channel decoding scheme that leverages the intrinsic robustness of FL to model errors. In particular, the robustness is exploited to reduce the energy consumption of channel decoders at mobile clients by adaptively adjusting the number of decoding iterations. We theoretically prove that wireless FL with communication errors can converge at the same rate as the case with error-free communication provided the bit error rate (BER) is properly constrained. An adaptive channel decoding scheme is then proposed to improve the energy efficiency of wireless FL systems. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method maintains the same learning accuracy while reducing the channel decoding energy consumption by ~20% when compared to an existing approach.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a new method for preventing unsafe or otherwise low quality large language model (LLM) outputs, by leveraging the stochasticity of LLMs. We propose a system whereby LLM checkers vote on the acceptability of a generated output, regenerating it if a threshold of disapproval is reached, until sufficient checkers approve. We further propose estimators for cost and failure rate, and based on those estimators and experimental data tailored to the application, we propose an algorithm that achieves a desired failure rate at the least possible cost. We demonstrate that, under these models, failure rate decreases exponentially as a function of cost when voter count and threshold are chosen according to the algorithm, and that the models reasonably estimate the actual performance of such a system in action, even with limited data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joe B Hakim, Jeffery L Painter, Darmendra Ramcharran, Vijay Kara, Greg Powell, Paulina Sobczak, Chiho Sato, Andrew Bate, Andrew Beam</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are useful tools with the capacity for performing specific types of knowledge work at an effective scale. However, LLM deployments in high-risk and safety-critical domains pose unique challenges, notably the issue of ``hallucination,'' where LLMs can generate fabricated information. This is particularly concerning in settings such as drug safety, where inaccuracies could lead to patient harm. To mitigate these risks, we have developed and demonstrated a proof of concept suite of guardrails specifically designed to mitigate certain types of hallucinations and errors for drug safety, and potentially applicable to other medical safety-critical contexts. These guardrails include mechanisms to detect anomalous documents to prevent the ingestion of inappropriate data, identify incorrect drug names or adverse event terms, and convey uncertainty in generated content. We integrated these guardrails with an LLM fine-tuned for a text-to-text task, which involves converting both structured and unstructured data within adverse event reports into natural language. This method was applied to translate individual case safety reports, demonstrating effective application in a pharmacovigilance processing task. Our guardrail framework offers a set of tools with broad applicability across various domains, ensuring LLMs can be safely used in high-risk situations by eliminating the occurrence of key errors, including the generation of incorrect pharmacovigilance-related terms, thus adhering to stringent regulatory and quality standards in medical safety-critical environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicholas Konz, Maciej A. Mazurowski</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, there has been interest in how geometric properties such as intrinsic dimension (ID) of a neural network's hidden representations change through its layers, and how such properties are predictive of important model behavior such as generalization ability. However, evidence has begun to emerge that such behavior can change significantly depending on the domain of the network's training data, such as natural versus medical images. Here, we further this inquiry by exploring how the ID of a network's learned representations changes through its layers, in essence, characterizing how the network successively refines the information content of input data to be used for predictions. Analyzing eleven natural and medical image datasets across six network architectures, we find that how ID changes through the network differs noticeably between natural and medical image models. Specifically, medical image models peak in representation ID earlier in the network, implying a difference in the image features and their abstractness that are typically used for downstream tasks in these domains. Additionally, we discover a strong correlation of this peak representation ID with the ID of the data in its input space, implying that the intrinsic information content of a model's learned representations is guided by that of the data it was trained on. Overall, our findings emphasize notable discrepancies in network behavior between natural and non-natural imaging domains regarding hidden representation information content, and provide further insights into how a network's learned features are shaped by its training data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have significantly improved prediction accuracy in various applications. However, ensuring the calibration of probabilistic predictions remains a significant challenge. Despite efforts to enhance model calibration, the rigorous statistical evaluation of model calibration remains less explored. In this work, we develop confidence intervals the $\ell_2$ Expected Calibration Error (ECE). We consider top-1-to-$k$ calibration, which includes both the popular notion of confidence calibration as well as full calibration. For a debiased estimator of the ECE, we show asymptotic normality, but with different convergence rates and asymptotic variances for calibrated and miscalibrated models. We develop methods to construct asymptotically valid confidence intervals for the ECE, accounting for this behavior as well as non-negativity. Our theoretical findings are supported through extensive experiments, showing that our methods produce valid confidence intervals with shorter lengths compared to those obtained by resampling-based methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sachin Shukla, Omid Mirzaei</p>
<p>Abstract: In the pursuit of an effective spam detection system, the focus has often been on identifying known spam patterns either through rule-based detection systems or machine learning (ML) solutions that rely on keywords. However, both systems are susceptible to evasion techniques and zero-day attacks that can be achieved at low cost. Therefore, an email that bypassed the defense system once can do it again in the following days, even though rules are updated or the ML models are retrained. The recurrence of failures to detect emails that exhibit layout similarities to previously undetected spam is concerning for customers and can erode their trust in a company. Our observations show that threat actors reuse email kits extensively and can bypass detection with little effort, for example, by making changes to the content of emails. In this work, we propose an email visual similarity detection approach, named Pisco, to improve the detection capabilities of an email threat defense system. We apply our proof of concept to some real-world samples received from different sources. Our results show that email kits are being reused extensively and visually similar emails are sent to our customers at various time intervals. Therefore, this method could be very helpful in situations where detection engines that rely on textual features and keywords are bypassed, an occurrence our observations show happens frequently.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmad Mohammad Saber, Alaa Selim, Mohamed M. Hammad, Amr Youssef, Deepa Kundur, Ehab El-Saadany</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid integration of electronically interfaced renewable energy resources and loads into smart grids, there is increasing interest in power quality disturbances (PQD) classification to enhance the security and efficiency of these grids. This paper introduces a new approach to PQD classification based on the Vision Transformer (ViT) model. When a PQD occurs, the proposed approach first converts the power quality signal into an image and then utilizes a pre-trained ViT to accurately determine the class of the PQD. Unlike most previous works, which were limited to a few disturbance classes or small datasets, the proposed method is trained and tested on a large dataset with 17 disturbance classes. Our experimental results show that the proposed ViT-based approach achieves PQD classification precision and recall of 98.28% and 97.98%, respectively, outperforming recently proposed techniques applied to the same dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Nadeem, Shahab Saquib Sohail, Erik Cambria, Bj\"orn W. Schuller, Amir Hussain</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundational Large Language Models (LLMs) have changed the way we perceive technology. They have been shown to excel in tasks ranging from poem writing and coding to essay generation and puzzle solving. With the incorporation of image generation capability, they have become more comprehensive and versatile AI tools. At the same time, researchers are striving to identify the limitations of these tools to improve them further. Currently identified flaws include hallucination, biases, and bypassing restricted commands to generate harmful content. In the present work, we have identified a fundamental limitation related to the image generation ability of LLMs, and termed it The NO Syndrome. This negation blindness refers to LLMs inability to correctly comprehend NO related natural language prompts to generate the desired images. Interestingly, all tested LLMs including GPT-4, Gemini, and Copilot were found to be suffering from this syndrome. To demonstrate the generalization of this limitation, we carried out simulation experiments and conducted entropy-based and benchmark statistical analysis tests on various LLMs in multiple languages, including English, Hindi, and French. We conclude that the NO syndrome is a significant flaw in current LLMs that needs to be addressed. A related finding of this study showed a consistent discrepancy between image and textual responses as a result of this NO syndrome. We posit that the introduction of a negation context-aware reinforcement learning based feedback loop between the LLMs textual response and generated image could help ensure the generated text is based on both the LLMs correct contextual understanding of the negation query and the generated visual output.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ben Dai</p>
<p>Abstract: Empirical risk minimization (ERM) with a computationally feasible surrogate loss is a widely accepted approach for classification. Notably, the convexity and calibration (CC) properties of a loss function ensure consistency of ERM in maximizing accuracy, thereby offering a wide range of options for surrogate losses. In this article, we propose a novel ensemble method, namely EnsLoss, which extends the ensemble learning concept to combine loss functions within the ERM framework. A key feature of our method is the consideration on preserving the "legitimacy" of the combined losses, i.e., ensuring the CC properties. Specifically, we first transform the CC conditions of losses into loss-derivatives, thereby bypassing the need for explicit loss functions and directly generating calibrated loss-derivatives. Therefore, inspired by Dropout, EnsLoss enables loss ensembles through one training process with doubly stochastic gradient descent (i.e., random batch samples and random calibrated loss-derivatives). We theoretically establish the statistical consistency of our approach and provide insights into its benefits. The numerical effectiveness of EnsLoss compared to fixed loss methods is demonstrated through experiments on a broad range of 14 OpenML tabular datasets and 46 image datasets with various deep learning architectures.

<p><b>Authors:</b> M. Badouch, M. Boutaounte</p>
<p>Abstract: In e-commerce, web mining for page recommendations is widely used but often fails to meet user needs. To address this, we propose a novel solution combining semantic web mining with BP neural networks. We process user search logs to extract five key features: content priority, time spent, user feedback, recommendation semantics, and input deviation. These features are then fed into a BP neural network to classify and prioritize web pages. The prioritized pages are recommended to users. Using book sales pages for testing, our results demonstrate that this solution can quickly and accurately identify the pages users need. Our approach ensures that recommendations are more relevant and tailored to individual preferences, enhancing the online shopping experience. By leveraging advanced semantic analysis and neural network techniques, we bridge the gap between user expectations and actual recommendations. This innovative method not only improves accuracy but also speeds up the recommendation process, making it a valuable tool for e-commerce platforms aiming to boost user satisfaction and engagement. Additionally, our system ability to handle large datasets and provide real-time recommendations makes it a scalable and efficient solution for modern e-commerce challenges.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01227">Prompt Compression with Context-Aware Sentence Encoding for Fast and Improved LLM Inference</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Barys Liskavets, Maxim Ushakov, Shuvendu Roy, Mark Klibanov, Ali Etemad, Shane Luke</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have triggered a new stream of research focusing on compressing the context length to reduce the computational cost while ensuring the retention of helpful information for LLMs to answer the given question. Token-based removal methods are one of the most prominent approaches in this direction, but risk losing the semantics of the context caused by intermediate token removal, especially under high compression ratios, while also facing challenges in computational efficiency. In this work, we propose context-aware prompt compression (CPC), a sentence-level prompt compression technique where its key innovation is a novel context-aware sentence encoder that provides a relevance score for each sentence for a given question. To train this encoder, we generate a new dataset consisting of questions, positives, and negative pairs where positives are sentences relevant to the question, while negatives are irrelevant context sentences. We train the encoder in a contrastive setup to learn context-aware sentence representations. Our method considerably outperforms prior works on prompt compression on benchmark datasets and is up to 10.93x faster at inference compared to the best token-level compression method. We also find better improvement for shorter length constraints in most benchmarks, showing the effectiveness of our proposed solution in the compression of relevant information in a shorter context. Finally, we release the code and the dataset for quick reproducibility and further development: https://github.com/Workday/cpc.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01433">Domain Decomposition-based coupling of Operator Inference reduced order models via the Schwarz alternating method</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ian Moore, Christopher Wentland, Anthony Gruber, Irina Tezaur</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents and evaluates an approach for coupling together subdomain-local reduced order models (ROMs) constructed via non-intrusive operator inference (OpInf) with each other and with subdomain-local full order models (FOMs), following a domain decomposition of the spatial geometry on which a given partial differential equation (PDE) is posed. Joining subdomain-local models is accomplished using the overlapping Schwarz alternating method, a minimally-intrusive multiscale coupling technique that works by transforming a monolithic problem into a sequence of subdomain-local problems, which communicate through transmission boundary conditions imposed on the subdomain interfaces. After formulating the overlapping Schwarz alternating method for OpInf ROMs, termed OpInf-Schwarz, we evaluate the method's accuracy and efficiency on several test cases involving the heat equation in two spatial dimensions. We demonstrate that the method is capable of coupling together arbitrary combinations of OpInf ROMs and FOMs, and that speed-ups over a monolithic FOM are possible when performing OpInf ROM coupling.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01821">When Does Visual Prompting Outperform Linear Probing for Vision-Language Models? A Likelihood Perspective</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hsi-Ai Tsao, Lei Hsiung, Pin-Yu Chen, Tsung-Yi Ho</p>
<p>Abstract: Adapting pre-trained models to new tasks can exhibit varying effectiveness across datasets. Visual prompting, a state-of-the-art parameter-efficient transfer learning method, can significantly improve the performance of out-of-distribution tasks. On the other hand, linear probing, a standard transfer learning method, can sometimes become the best approach. We propose a log-likelihood ratio (LLR) approach to analyze the comparative benefits of visual prompting and linear probing. By employing the LLR score alongside resource-efficient visual prompts approximations, our cost-effective measure attains up to a 100-fold reduction in run time compared to full training, while achieving prediction accuracies up to 91%.
